First, I‚Äôve decided to move these to Mirror! Using the platform for the [1559 NFT project](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/rsUhYxXARr7j2iDjqJeelY7nc6CN_Y-MilVDP1S5voA) was a really positive experience, and I‚Äôve been looking for an excuse to use it again, so here we are. I‚Äôll keep maintaining a list of updates on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/acd/) so they re easy to find in one place.\n\nSecond, given our current focus on The Merge, this post isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúupdate‚Äù but a deep dive into the roadmap evolution which led to the current architecture choice. In a few weeks, expect a similar post going over the details of how the Ethereum network will operate post-merge.\n\n## Merge Pre-History üìú\n\nThe Merge will swap out Ethereum‚Äôs current proof of work consensus algorithm for the proof of stake mechanism running on the beacon chain. This design is the result of several iterations on the ‚ÄúEthereum 2.0‚Äù roadmap. Let's recap how things changed over the past few years.\n\n### Phases 0Ô∏è‚É£, 1Ô∏è‚É£, 2Ô∏è‚É£\n\nFor several years, proof of stake and sharding R&D were both pretty independent from each other. During a 2018 research workshop in Taipei, a decision was made to unify both research initiatives into a single, three phrased, \"Ethereum 2.0\" roadmap. The workshop and general philosophy at the time is well summarized by Ben Edginton [here](https://media.consensys.net/state-of-ethereum-protocol-1-d3211dd0f6). It was during this event that Hsiao-Wei Wang presented this now famous diagram of what \"Ethereum 2.0\" would look like:\n\n![Source: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G5UZdEL71XAkU5B2v-TC3lmGaRIu2P6QSeF8m3wg6MU/edit#slide=id.g3c326bb661_0_298](https://i.imgur.com/jZLRk9v.png?&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nThis diagram pictures what each phase of the then new roadmap would deliver:\n\n* Phase 0 would bring the beacon chain;\n* In Phase 1, data shards would be added;\n* In Phase 2, virtual machines would be added to each shard to enable computation in the system.\n\nThe number of shards was initially set to 100, then raised to 1024, and most recently lowered back to 64.\n\n### Early Merge üåÖ\n\nAs work on the beacon chain started in 2018, it became clear that this three-phased Ethereum 2.0 roadmap would take several years to fully deliver. This, along with the growing pains from the rapid adoption of Ethereum, led to a revival of research initiatives on the proof of work chain. The umbrella term \"Ethereum 1.x\" was coined for these initiatives at Devcon IV, in 2018. The biggest one of these was research into Stateless Ethereum, a paradigm that would remove untouched state from the network in order to bound its growth rate.\n\nThe increased focus on making the PoW chain long-term sustainable paired with the realization that the beacon chain would be ready much earlier than other components of the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap led to an [‚ÄúEarly Merge‚Äù proposa](https://ethresear.ch/t/alternative-proposal-for-early-eth1-eth2-merge/6666/2)l. This proposal would have the existing EVM chain launch as \"Shard 0\" of the Ethereum 2.0 system. Not only would this expedite the move to proof of stake, but it would also make for a much smoother transition for applications, as the move to proof of stake could happen without any migration on their end.\n\nShortly after this proposal, Danny Ryan explored how we could accomplish all this by leveraging the existing Eth1 clients in his  [Eth1+Eth2 client relationship](https://ethresear.ch/t/eth1-eth2-client-relationship/7248) post. This would massively reduce the development work to deliver a post-merge system and leverage clients which had been battle tested for years on mainnet. Following this path would also give researchers more time to figure out the open questions around Phases 1 & 2, explored [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-short-history-and-a-way-forward-for-phase-2/6982), as well as Stateless Ethereum, which is also still an active area of research.\n\n### Rollup Centric Roadmap üéØ\n\nFast forward to late 2020: Phase 0 is now 99% done with the beacon chain launching soon. While the work on Phase 1 is progressing nicely, Phase 2, which would enable computation on the shards introduced in Phase 1, still has many unsolved questions:\n\n* How to transition smoothly from the current EVM chain to the sharded VMs?\n* What alternative VMs can actually be deployed, performance-wise?\n* How would we ensure that various VMs are indeed safe?\n* How would state and balances be reconcilled across all the VMs?\n* ‚Ä¶ and more\n\nAt the same time, progress on rollups (i.e. Layer 2 scaling) is rapidly happening. Several teams announce testnets, with promising early results.\n\nAround this time, Vitalik wrote a long [Ethereum Magicians post](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) arguing that we should focus our short and medium term scaling efforts around rollups. Not only would they be on mainnet before Phase 2 would be done, but they would also be the largest beneficiaries of Phase 1. Rollups generate a lot of data, and shards can offer cheaper storage for it than the EVM chain. From the post itself:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrC1GJi.png)\n\nThis approach would have several impacts on the Phase 0-2 roadmap. Specifically:\n\n* Phase 0 (the beacon chain) which was now running on testnets ahead of mainnet launch, could become Ethereum‚Äôs consensus engine as soon as the PoW chain was ready, rather than after Phase 2;\n* Phase 1 (data sharding), still several years away, went from being a critical blocker to scaling to an incremental improvement which would reduce the cost of already developed scaling solutions (e.g. rollups);\n* Phase 2 (sharded execution), the more complex feature with the most open research questions, could be pushed out several years or cancelled entirely without any impact on the scaling roadmap.\n\nThe research community quickly rallied around this proposal and within a month had produced an ethresear.ch post detailing the current plan for The Merge!\n\n## Current & Future Roadmap üó∫\n\n### Executable Beacon Chain ‚õì\n\nThe current architecture for the merge was first detailed in the [\"Executable Beacon Chain\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/executable-beacon-chain/8271) post by Mikhail Kalinin in November 2020. In short, it combined the following insights from the various iterations to the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap:\n\n* The beacon chain is live, and can now be used as a consensus engine;\n* Rollups are the best short term solution for scaling computation;\n* The current Eth1 clients form the best basis for the execution layer post-merge;\n* The move to proof of stake can be done with minimal impact on the currently running applications.\n\nThe one big change Mikhail proposed was that instead of having the current EVM chain be \"Shard 0,\" it could be coupled to the beacon chain directly.\n\nThis is a simple but important insight: Eth1 execution clients are already built in a way where the consensus algorithm can be swapped. Mainnet uses proof of work, but testnets and private Ethereum networks use various proof of authority consensus algorithms (clique, IBFT, etc.).\n\nIn his post, Mikhail proposed to have proof of stake \"simply\" be a new consensus algorithm that clients use. In other words, to merge the current proof of work chain with the beacon chain. The following diagram by Trent Van Epps illustrates the transition:\n\n![Source: https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1415741658067517441/photo/1 ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64858811-65f3-4483-9d6e-f008a51851a2.png?height=1218&width=2152&&&size=medium)\n\nThis approach would minimize the work that client teams on the PoW chain need to do, while still delivering all the benefits of the Early Merge and Rollup Centric Roadmap \\[1\\].\n\n### Rayonism ‚òÄÔ∏è\n\nTo validate that the Executable Beacon Chain architecture was viable, clients prototyped it over the course of a month-long hackathon named [Rayonism](https://rayonism.io/).\n\nWithin a few weeks, all combinations of Eth1/Eth2 clients were turned into hybrid, post-merge, clients running transactions in the EVM and coming to consensus via the beacon chain.\n\nAt a high level, the current Eth2 nodes were repurposed as the consensus layer of the network, and the current Eth1 nodes as its execution layer. The consensus layer's functionality was expanded to send the latest chain head information to, and request blocks from, the execution layer. The execution layer was still in charge of processing  blocks, gossiping transactions, storing and managing the  state and handling JSON RPC requests.\n\nThis experiment validated that the Executable Beacon Chain architecture was sound and could be use as the basis for the transition to proof of stake, now dubbed The Merge.\n\n### PoW -> PoS transition ‚õè\n\nOne thing that was not tested as part of Rayonism was the transition from a live PoW network to one running under PoS. After a few iterations, a specification for this is now roughly finalized.\n\nTo transition from proof of work to proof of stake, a `TERMINAL TOTAL DIFFICULTY` will be set in clients \\[2\\]. Once a block is seen exceeding that difficulty on the proof of work chain, clients will enter a transition mode where they begin listening to the proof of stake layer for consensus. As soon as the consensus layer has finalized a block whose difficulty exceeds the `TERMINAL TOTAL DIFFICULTY`, the execution layer will stop listening for and gossiping PoW blocks entirely. And then, voil√†, The Merge is done üéâ!\n\nFor applications, this won't cause any disruption to contracts or users. A few opcodes will be updated and that's about it. For beacon chain node operators, the merge will require choosing an execution engine . Similarly, if you are running a node on the proof of work network, the merge will require choosing a consensus client. You can expect multiple devnets, tutorials and calls to discuss this as the work on the merge progresses!\n\n## Next Steps üõ†\n\nWhile the general approach for The Merge is now set, there is still a long list of things that client teams need to do over the next few months. The bulk of the TODOs are tracked [here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md), and notable ones include finalizing post-merge sync protocols, setting up integration tests for the entire process, launching devnets & running them under adverse conditions, and planning for a variety of contingencies during the transition.\n\nIf you'd like to dig into the actual specs, [EIP-3675](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675) details the changes that will be required for the execution-layer clients, and the [merge folder](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/specs/merge) in the consensus specs details the changes to the consensus layer.\n\nOnce things are a bit more settled, expect another post going into the details of how Ethereum clients will work post-Merge. Thanks for reading, and see you next time üëãüèª!\n\n\n---\n\nThanks to Danny Ryan, Trent Van Epps and Mikhail Kalinin for feedback on drafts fo this post.\n\n\n---\n\n\\[1\\] One notable change is that \"Stateless Ethereum\" is no longer a prerequisite for the move to proof of stake.\n\n\\[2\\] Relying on the total difficulty rather than the block or slot number allows for better management of re-orgs during the transition phase.

For me at least, I tend to be attracted to the strangeness in certain projects.\n\nSo, maybe what I‚Äôm about to tell you will resonate in some way, even though it‚Äôs sort of weird.\n\nAnyway, let me start with my last therapy session.\n\nI usually do my therapy through a video call, mainly because I‚Äôm too lazy to drive down to my therapist‚Äôs office, but also because I don‚Äôt like driving that much, and also a few years ago, I made the decision to not own a car. I mean, my family has a car, but my wife and kids are usually using it, and I‚Äôm usually on foot most of the time.\n\nSo, I was on the video call with my therapist, and I was giving him an update on my conversion disorder (sometimes called functional neurological disorder).  This is part of the VERY strange stuff I mentioned, and I don‚Äôt have time to go into it all in this post, but for context, just know that conversion disorder is real (or so they tell me), and it‚Äôs a psychosomatic thing that makes me twitch and stutter sometimes, and I also learned that it may have been what the girls in the Salem Witch Trials had when they were freaking everyone out with their hysterics, which for some reason I thought was cool.\n\nWhat makes me twitch and stutter is still sort of a mystery.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still in therapy every week! But in general, the idea is that it‚Äôs a psychological conflict that presents itself in a physiological way, ie. the stuttering and twitching stuff that I do.\n\nSo what is the psychological conflict you may be wondering?\n\nMe too!\n\nWouldn‚Äôt that be nice if I figured it all out and didn‚Äôt twitch and stutter anymore?  I was actually worried for a bit that I had early signs of ALS, which is my literal worst fear. Sometimes I stutter when I try to order in the Chik-Fil A drive through, and now I have my wife do that bit.  I get really bad around birthdays and holidays, and if it gets really really bad, I can go catatonic.\n\nIf you have any psychoanalytical theories, shoot them my way, but in general, I have a strong thesis going, and this gets back to why in the world I would be posting all of this on Mirror.\n\n## Who am I?\n\nNo, this isn‚Äôt the part where I go into my career highlights,  At the deepest level, I think at least part of my psychological conflict comes from this essential existential question.\n\nOf course, on the outside, I have it made. Great wife and family, nice neighborhood, kids are awesome, etc, etc.  \n\nInternally though, the question deepens when I think about my vocation. Vocation, to me, is a word that simply describes how I spend my days in exchange for value of some sort.\n\nThe kicker is that I‚Äôve always avoided wanting to define my vocation, because in a way I would be defining myself, and that scares me perhaps.(See? The therapy is helping.)\n\nIn the past year, I‚Äôve had many people ask me what it is I ‚Äúdo‚Äù.  What is my job? How do I make money?  How do I spend my days?  \n\nAt one point my wife even asked me that.\n\nThe answer is, I do all sorts of things, but that usually leads to a longer conversation...  So, I usually just say I‚Äôm a consultant, and do my best to duck out of the conversation.\n\nBut back to the reason for this essay, and specifically for putting this essay on Mirror, which I had to campaign hard to get access to!\n\n## A Vocational Multiverse\n\nI cringe at using the word ‚Äúmultiverse‚Äù here, but oh well.  You tell me if there is a better term for it.\n\nI plan on using Mirror to launch various research/art projects, while also using this as my space for personal explorations.\n\nThe projects that I'm considering probably couldn‚Äôt be more different from each other in theme, and who knows what will be in my personal explorations.  So, at it‚Äôs core, maybe this is all a deeply personal experiment in me trying to exercise the psychological conflict that is triggering my conversion disorder by leaning into the disparate, and possibly dissociative nature of my interests.\n\nWe shall see.\n\nIn regards to Mirror, I don't have any meaningful Web 3 analysis that isn't already being explored by someone else on Mirror that is smarter than me.  However, I‚Äôm intrigued by the intimate nature that this type of platform can create with a potential audience, and the way that Web 3 allows creators and their audience to be aligned with each other.\n\nSo, I‚Äôm planning on using Mirror to hopefully ‚Äú*listen*‚Äù to whoever might be reading this.  I‚Äôm under no illusions that these posts will go viral, or that any meaningful number of people will find their way here.  So, it‚Äôs not really about the wisdom of a crowd.\n\nIn a way, it‚Äôs about fate, providence, or whatever you may want to define it as.  The universe?\n\nMore to come...\n\nThanks for reading!", "timestamp": 1628714077, "digest": "KTHdhuZp1yliAoOwXF4o7CBu_yxzpNB1ZBvJ-axcMsI", "contributor": "0x793a9b7BAB3b0cD3c6758114046a1c5DD51422cf"}

This organization never stops; it runs 24 hours a day across the globe, building applications, protocols, and data pipelines on top of a distributed blockchain network to move tokens and crypto through a network representing an ecosystem of ideas, desires, and innovation.\n\nI‚Äôve never met these coworkers in real life, nor do I know their names. All I know about them is their avatar, past votes and proposals, and their immutable transaction history on the blockchain. Some of their iconic representations of self cost more in ETH than the down payment to my home. And yet I trust them to contribute to our mission, respect their knowledge, and learn from their perspectives.\n\n**How did we get here, and where are we going?**\n\n## The Traditional Organization\n\nFor the past seven years of my career I‚Äôve been writing algorithms and data feeds to automate, coordinate, and eliminate human decisions within Fortune 500 companies. My data science *niche* is operations research and workflow; I see the organization an information network - tasks, timestamps, and decisions being consumed, processed, and sent along into a system of feedback and throughput.\n\nUltimately I view Operations as an entropy reduction function within the company - by reducing variety of mundane situations a person has to respond to I can increase the throughput of high value creative thought in an organization. However, incentives, org structures, and technology often make this idealist mindset a difficult reality to achieve. For example:\n\n*   Optimizing for the individual, or team not always best for the department\n*   Matrix management requires energy into communication, navigation, and defining ownership of one‚Äôs work\n*   Transaction data is often aggregated rather than tied to an individual\n\nAs the pace of markets increase, communication feedback loops form with new tools to connect us, and we work in distributed geographies, it is time to define new systems of work and coordination. For this task I tap the world of cybernetics.\n\n## The Cybernetic Organization\n\nIn the 1940‚Äôs English psychiatrist W. Ross Ashby began writing about adaptation, self-organization, variety, and control of systems for amplifying intelligence and intuition of the human mind. He brought together the fields of information theory, communications, game theory, and control systems into a formal structure for mapping operations of mind and machine in his book [An Introduction to Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Introduction_to_Cybernetics)1.\n\nThe developments of adjacent technologies and forces of society have brought us to a dawn of using these frameworks to create governance and incentive systems in DAOs. In doing so, we must leave behind the centralized command and control systems in favor of self-organized economic organisms. **Here I lay out the main cybernetic principles to guide creation of a successful decentralized autonomous organization.**\n\n### Mechanism\n\nTo move from the handshakes, verbal agreements, and tacit understandings in the traditional organization to the cybernetic view, you must have a computational mindset and recognize your DAO as a system that:\n\n*   Accepts inputs (proposals) from an environment\n*   Responds to those inputs (votes)\n*   Updates its state (completion of work)\n\nThis process is recorded through a series of smart contracts and blocks on the blockchain. Your DAO is a dynamical information system, not unlike a biological organism observing its environment, deciding next best action, and then interacting with its environment as a complex process of adaptation and evolution. **Think deeply about how to assign discrete, measureable structure to the intuition, values, and outcomes we use to navigate organizations today.**\n\n[@rafathebuilder](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder) had an interesting tweet about this concept:\n\n> Designing incentive structures in digital native organizations feels like building braitenberg vehicles [pic.twitter.com/gvt4IOOViH](https://t.co/gvt4IOOViH)\n>\n> ‚Äî rafa0 (@rafathebuilder) [August 15, 2021](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1426888751293378561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nHow do you measure love, fun, excitement, fear, and cohesion when your language is data and information?\n\n### Variety\n\nNow that you‚Äôve done the work to map the values and range of outcomes from the decisions made by your DAO, consider this: how do you summarize the state of your DAO given the distribution over the range of values? If fear is high and cohesion is low, how do you characterize the state of your community? How about if love is high, along with cohesion, excitement, and fun?\n\nWhat range of possible outcomes do you want possible for your DAO? **Define specifically how you will measure the various states to describe your DAO‚Äôs operations.**\n\n### Regulation and Control\n\nThe most important shift in mindset is that unlike traditional organizations optimizing for an objective like profit, engagement, clicks, these outcomes become emergent properties of the DAO‚Äôs governance, culture, and collective dynamics. With the structure you‚Äôve defined for states and outcomes of DAO operations, now decisions about **DAO governance** can be explored.\n\nFor example, if both excitement and fear are running high, perhaps a governance rule to implement is to slow the pace of proposals until frenetic engagement decreases. Conversely, if love, fun, and cohesion are high, perhaps reduce the friction of passing proposals so that the team benefits from this euphoric state. Then use these controls to correlate with the outcomes you seek to optimize for.\n\n**In a decentralized organization, the way to ensure resilience is to build control systems that incentive the behaviors you want and regulate those you don‚Äôt.**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy having mechanisms for shared incentives, distributed decision making, and autonomous regulation of outcomes, the DAO becomes a **cybernetic organization** exhibiting self-organization, emergence, and resilience over time.\n\nDawn is early for the decentralized organization: control systems are not yet well defined, DAO metadata is difficult to capture and correlate to governance, and many governance systems have yet to be explored. However, the thread of adjacent possibilites has woven an ecosystem of technology, interest, and energy in rethinking how we engage and define the next chapter of economic organizations.\n\nEngage in this conversation and go deeper on this Twitter thread\n\n> With DAOs, the principles of self-organization, creativity, and complexity in natural and biological systems can be used to dramatically change how we work.\n>\n> Here I lay out the main cybernetic principles to guide creation of a successful DAO.<https://t.co/dBoMjIFN7P>\n>\n> ‚Äî christian | lemp.eth (@c_lemp) [August 17, 2021](https://twitter.com/c_lemp/status/1427615544581115904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n### Footnotes\n\n\\[1] Many other researchers contributed to the development of intelligent control systems: [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener), [Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Bertalanffy), and [Jon von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann), to name a few.\n", "timestamp": 1629516467, "digest": "Mf_nwOELmJChWi6oH4g-VV6QmivgiEOQGRCjWpB2MCE", "contributor": "0x97b9958faceC9ACB7ADb2Bb72a70172CB5a0Ea7C"}

Despite the lack of death, softer politics, paltry cash rewards, and fewer despots to overthrow, he continued. It was an old habit, one deeper than the tattoos on his skin.\nThe largest difference now, however, was the absence of his son and former partner: Atlas. In the real world, his son had been his regular companion on the missions. Even when the Captain made Atlas stay put for particularly dangerous ones, he would miss his son's presence‚Äîand not from any mawkishness. At twelve years old, the boy already had an eye for casting diversions, giving the Captain the space to move in rapidly and use his unfeeling hands.\nIn most of their adventures, they‚Äôd become separated and make their way home alone. It was an unspoken rule that whoever arrived first would turn on a light in every window, making sure the other had a beacon in the night. On this evening in the simulation, the Captain was walking briskly back at the verge of sunset, and he found himself wishing against all odds that there would be a glow in the front window.¬†\nThe Captain slowly entered the dark house and ambled straight to the kitchen. He poured a generous glass of whiskey, wiped away a couple aberrant drops on the counter, and sunk into his recliner. His eyes focused and unfocused upon the opposite wall, and a moment passed before he saw it.¬†\nHis paintings were missing.¬†\nThe wall was barren, and the gaze of the dying sun filled it with an empty, orange sea. He continued to stare. Already, he struggled to recall the face that he had once so assiduously captured, caressing the canvas with his paint brush. His eyes wrinkled and his chest began to expand, but he held himself still. The thief could still be inside. His training returned like an inching shadow.¬†\nHe arose and traipsed down the hallway to his room. Every step felt like a year. The evening glow was now receding, and in its wake it seemed as if the walls and floors had grown ancient, far older than he was. The paint was chipping, and the wooden planks beneath him were warping and rotting. When he glanced out the hallway window, the pine tree that stood beside the house looked sickly, the bark peeling away and its needles a spiritless gray. He closed his eyes and imagined a distant future, the hallway now fully derelict and layered in dust, the tree bereft of needles, its branches sticking out like the rigid arms of a corpse. Yet when he saw himself in the hallway, his feet making a deep impression in the dust, he looked the exact same: an old, sun-burnt man with a scraggly beard.\nFinding his room clear, he opened the closet and began feeling around the shelf above his head. Upon grasping a small tin box‚Äîits cold metal a welcome shock‚Äîhe sat down and began to cry. He still had something that tied him to his son. Something he could hold through the coming years of simulation, or more frighteningly, centuries.¬†\nFor the next several nights and mornings, the Captain was perched in his attic. His home lay atop a small hill, giving him a vantage point to watch the rows of houses below. Just before daybreak on the seventh day, he spotted his culprit. A figure pressed up against the back window of a house, pausing, before darting to the next. The Captain stood, but before he could make a move, the skulking silhouette disappeared behind another house. For a brief moment, under the dim moonlight of the simulation, he saw a small, boyish frame. The Captain saw his son.\n\n**Several, Long Decades Ago: The Captain‚Äôs Upload**\n\nThe scientist walking alongside the Captain was dressed in a freshly starched lab coat that seemed too slim to accommodate any serious movement. *Probably a program director, years from any serious research*, the Captain thought. They turned left into a long hallway towards a growing chorus of voices and a set of blue swinging doors. They were close.\n‚ÄúDo a lot of folks get cold feet?‚Äù the Captain asked.¬†\n‚ÄúSo many,‚Äù the scientist said, grinning. ‚ÄúWe had to start strapping them into the pods so they wouldn‚Äôt leave.‚Äù¬†\nThe Captain laughed and decided to go along with the gallows humor. ‚ÄúMight as well knock them unconscious once they step inside.‚Äù He felt a tug on his arm and saw Atlas with an annoyed frown on his face. The weight of the journey had laid heavily on the boy, and the Captain regretted speaking so carelessly. Saying goodbye to friends and familiar sights was not a foreign feeling; they had always been a nomadic pair. However, the prospect of Upload was more serious, and had pervaded nearly every conversation in the weeks leading up to the trip. Atlas, normally a bright, active boy, had begun to sulk and developed a habit of staring wistfully into the distance. The Captain knew his son didn‚Äôt care about a simulated vastness‚Äîthe real world still had a lot to offer.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm just joking,‚Äù the Captain quickly said to Atlas. The boy pursed his lips and looked as if he was going to respond, but they reached the doors and entered into a room the size of a small gymnasium. Several lines of pods stood row by row, and a small crowd of people were milling about.¬†\nLooking at his son, the Captain made the rare decision to only speak earnestly for the rest of the day. He knew Atlas was letting himself be roped into the simulation because the Captain had pulled with every last pound of his paternal authority. He had told Atlas that the upside of infinity was too great‚Äîand the downside of missing it too terrible‚Äîto be delayed. Atlas had been quick to remark that this was rubbish coming from a man who risked his life for printed paper.\nThe Captain believed there was truth to what he told Atlas, but he was withholding the genuine reason for their hurry. The boy‚Äôs frustration was as palpable to the Captain as the hard lump he could feel lurking under the skin of his neck. Fortunately, while it had grown over the weeks, it was still hidden under his beard. The Captain didn‚Äôt want Atlas to panic; more importantly, he didn‚Äôt want him to know that their coupled Upload was largely selfish. While the Captain could have uploaded first, time in the simulation passed at a much faster rate than reality. He could not bear the thought of living in the simulation for possibly decades before seeing Atlas again.¬†\nThere was also guilt from knowing that Atlas would not merely be losing time in the real world. In order for uploaded minds to function normally, simulated bodies had to remain at their biological age‚Äîa significant consequence of embodied cognition. Atlas would be stuck at twelve for eternity. While children were not barred from Upload, it was generally regarded that waiting until adulthood was the better choice. Adults would have ostensibly matured and developed a theory of living that would better suit the abundance of time given to them. The Captain felt awful for infringing on Atlas‚Äôs autonomy, but knew there was no way he could upload without him.¬†\n‚ÄúYou two are pods seven and eight. Get strapped in now and I‚Äôll be back,‚Äù the scientist gestured before walking away.\nAs they reached their pods, the final good-byes were breaking out around the father and son. Crying, assurances, and judging from the low tone of some, confessions; all spilled out as if the group stood beside coffins. The Captain noticed some individuals walking to the exit and realized they had come to see others off. He couldn‚Äôt imagine what it would feel like to see someone upload and not do it yourself, knowing that the other had just gained eternity while the sand in your own hourglass continued to fall. A different type of grief.¬†\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre doing this,‚Äù Atlas said quietly.\n‚ÄúAtlas, I need you to listen,‚Äù the Captain said, turning to face his son. Without thinking, his hand lifted to stroke Atlas‚Äôs chin. ‚ÄúThis is the best thing for us. We‚Äôre going to spend hundreds of years together. We‚Äôre going to explore the world.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI know, I know,‚Äù Atlas said, relenting. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ scared. I wish this wasn‚Äôt happening so fast.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI wish it didn‚Äôt have to either,‚Äù the Captain said. At that moment, he noticed the scientist hastily running by and shoving past the entrance, leaving behind an air of concern. The crowd around him began murmuring, and from his tested instincts the Captain knew something was wrong. Atlas stared at the swinging doors the scientist left behind.¬†\n‚ÄúLook,‚Äù the Captain said, taking hold of Atlas‚Äôs shoulder. He pulled from his pocket a small obsidian arrowhead, its glassy surface a deep, mesmerizing black. Atlas‚Äôs eyes widened and he looked at the Captain, who felt a surge of warmth. The Captain took Atlas‚Äôs hand and pressed the arrowhead gently into his palm, avoiding any pressure around the point.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve kept this,‚Äù the Captain started to say. He cleared his throat, which had suddenly become constricted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve kept this since our first mission together. We‚Äôll upload now, and... ‚Äú at this he stopped again, hot tears filling up in his eyes and the words inside him threatening to break the dam. Atlas‚Äôs face began to contort and the Captain knew he had to hold himself together. He took a deep breath. His son needed him.¬†\n‚ÄúHold onto this,‚Äù the Captain spoke with fresh resolve. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be going on a new adventure soon. The first of many for us.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt go on any more trips alone?‚Äù Atlas said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go together to the Congo?‚Äù\nThe Captain chuckled and several tears broke through the barrier, trailing down his face. He had recently regaled Atlas with stories about his deployment there. He had omitted the frenzied raids into insurgent camps, but described with a dreamy enchantment the elephants he had watched bathe, the flaring nostrils of angry gorillas, and the slow stalk of the cheetah.\n‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù the Captain said. He noticed more rapid movement to the entrance and shouting in the distance. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you anywhere in the simulation. Anything you want, we‚Äôll find.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWill my mom be there?‚Äù Atlas asked.¬†\nThe Captain looked at Atlas. The entrance door slammed open and both of them turned to see the scientist running through with a loudspeaker in hand, visibly concerned.\n‚ÄúEveryone into the pods immediately!‚Äù he announced through the speaker after catching a quick breath. ‚ÄúStrap in and shut the pod door. It‚Äôll automatically start. Don‚Äôt wait for me!‚Äù He raced back out, and as the door swung behind him, the *pop* of gunfire echoed into the room. People immediately began running to their pods. As the covers were hastily closing around the pair, the Captain gripped Atlas and ushered him into his pod. The gunshots had thrown the Captain‚Äôs mind into high gear, and he quickly pieced things together.\nOnce the Upload began and it became clear it worked, governments and religions tried to block the passage alike; the authorities having lost their labor, and the churches their eschatology. In a stunning divorce, a wave of academic and research institutions renounced their ties to the state. Upload was facilitated at discrete sites, and the ensuing pilgrimages made in stealth. However, the ordained from both the holy and unholy cathedral sought to shut the sites down. All potential Uploaders knew that only one of those sides was lenient.¬†\nThe Captain tried fumbling with Atlas‚Äôs harness, but Atlas quickly grabbed the buckles and began adjusting them himself. Just as he was able to click himself in, the lights in the room flickered and dimmed. Amid the clamor, the Captain watched a man in a white robe emerge from the dark entrance hallway. The man wore a full, golden mask that had intricate flowers carved throughout its surface, reminding the Captain of the fissures of a volcano. The man‚Äôs eyes were hidden in the shadows. The remaining pods began to slam shut around the father and son with the same violence as the recent gunfire. No one could wait any longer.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you there,‚Äù the Captain said before throwing himself into the pod next to Atlas. He had heard how certain sects were attempting to break the encryption on the simulation, likely to develop worlds of endless worship‚Äîa veritable heaven. He had no intention of spending the rest of eternity on his knees. The masked man began walking towards him and this resolve became the sole purpose of the Captain‚Äôs remaining minutes.\nIn the Congo, the Captain had once been hunted by an insurgent sniper. Bullets had pierced through the vegetation around him, each one following a loud *crack*. Unable to discern the location of his hunter, he had dropped prostrate and begun furiously clawing at the forest floor, pressing his face deep into the soil and fallen leaves in a desperate attempt to flee. He had now the same realization that nobody would be saving him, that no amount of guile or courage would get him out. He smelled the jungle.¬†\n‚ÄúGo NOW!‚Äù the Captain shouted at Atlas, putting on his own harness. He heard Atlas cry out and turned to see the boy‚Äôs arm stretching for the pod door, unable to reach it. The Captain tried to pull his harness off to help and realized the harnesses were locked in place. He remembered his earlier conversation with the scientist. Gripping the nylon, he pulled apart with such intensity his callouses tore away, but the harness remained fastened. The Captain heard a terrible sawing noise coming from Atlas‚Äôs pod and realized that Atlas was trying to cut his harness with the arrowhead. There was no way to do that without gripping the arrowhead‚Äôs sharp edges. The Captain howled at the thought and his body twisted against its confinement.\nThe masked man stepped upon them, so close that the Captain could now see the dilated pupils of his eyes. He reached out with a gloved hand to the Captain‚Äôs pod cover. The Captain turned to see Atlas make one last lunge, the arrowhead falling to the floor and his fingers barely wrapping around the cover‚Äôs inner handle. That was enough for the Captain. He gripped his own cover and pulled it close. It locked in place instantly and the glass panel swiftly froze over as the temperature dropped to a cryogenic range. With his last moments, the Captain strained to look outside of the panel, but could not see past the intricate crystals that now covered the glass‚Äîinfinite patterns that seemed to him a barren tundra. \n* * *\nThe Captain awoke. It felt as if he had overslept for a vast length of time; unlike him. He was still in the pod. The cover extended outward without him moving, and he covered his eyes against a light shining into his face. An unfamiliar voice was saying something but he ignored it. Realizing there was no longer a harness holding him, he gingerly grabbed hold of the pod‚Äôs side to pull himself out. The pod alongside his was empty. *Where‚Äôs Atlas? Did he make it?*\nThroughout the next few days, others tried to console him. They told him that the precise time of upload could vary, and it was possible Atlas had already arrived and wandered into the world. The Captain knew they hadn‚Äôt seen the final moments of himself and his son, so their conjecture was close to useless. Even then, what little hope he had shrunk once he learned from an uploaded researcher that even if Atlas had made it through, there would still be a wide river to cross.¬†\nThe researcher explained that simulated minds were created by scanning the body and brain, replicating them through code. Given the influx of experiences and sensory data across years in the simulation, much more than the century of lifespan that human brains could barely accommodate, memories decayed at a faster rate. Pre-upload memories were more robust than simulated ones, having roots in neurons and synapses, but nothing was fully shielded. Memory had always been fallible and unreliable, but in the simulation, it was especially fleeting. Something to do immediately, the researcher recommended, was to capture your memories of loved ones, lest they be forgotten. You might not recognize them when you meet.¬†\nBoth inspired and worried, the Captain began painting. Although he had never painted before, he found it was a common hobby for many other simulated minds given its recollective value. By watching those around him he quickly learned what materials to procure and how to employ simple techniques. With a brush in hand, he would muster his focus to remember how Atlas‚Äôs face looked when he was happy, trying to capture every line and curve on the canvas. It was a stressful endeavor. If he lost focus, the face in his mind‚Äôs eye threatened to break into the last look of terror he had glimpsed before the upload.¬†\nEven as the Captain walked this mental tightrope, he knew from seeing other paintings that hung from walls‚Äîand those stuffed into trash bins‚Äîthat he was one of the lucky ones. Many others could not fully visualize what they sought to see again, often from letting too much time pass in the simulation. Their paintings were apparitions; each one a blend of features that resembled a lost spirit calling out from another universe.¬†\nAs he continued painting, the Captain thought about how to use other tools for his memory. Thinking about a practice he had once seen on a mission, he cut some wood from a maple tree and began carving. Although he hadn‚Äôt set out to carve anything particular, as he continued to whittle it down, he saw the shape of an arrowhead emerge. However, upon finishing, he could not bear having it in his sight. Unlike his paintings, the wooden arrowhead represented something he did not want to remember. He placed it into a small tin box and packed it away on a shelf. For several years the Captain traveled across the simulated lands in search of his son, but found no trace. Gradually, the wooden arrowhead slipped from his mind, and all knew was that inside this tin box was something he could never forget. \n\n**Simulation**\n\nThe Captain watched patiently for another week before the thief returned to his neighborhood. This time, he was ready. He had placed several small speakers in a pattern around nearby houses, creating an invisible path to a corner where he‚Äôd lie in wait. This tactic was inspired by Atlas himself, one that the Captain had planned with him so often that it was muscle memory. Once triggered, the speakers would play pre-recorded sounds at timed intervals, giving the perception of coordinated activity. During an infiltration, they could deceive a guard into thinking there was movement in a certain direction; in a pursuit, the target would run from the speakers, believing the sounds were those of pursuers, and fall predictably into a trap. If the thief was Atlas there was a chance that he‚Äôd catch on, but the Captain knew that the strategy was difficult for anyone to discern in the heat of the chase.¬†\nFrom his attic, the Captain watched the thief stealthily creep in range. He initiated the first speaker.\n‚ÄúHey, stay where you are!‚Äù he heard the voice call out from the speaker. The thief sprinted in the opposite direction, and with a grin the Captain made his way downstairs and to his hiding spot. He wistfully recalled that when he and Atlas deployed the strategy, they‚Äôd tell each other to meet at the ‚Äúfinish line.‚Äù Various recorded sounds of himself running, coughing, and jumping on metal boards emanated throughout the neighborhood. The Captain positioned himself behind a hidden corner. He began to gleefully imagine how irritated Atlas would be if he was caught with one of his own signature tricks. Light footsteps came closer and the Captain crouched in preparation.¬†\nA figure emerged, and the Captain swiftly tackled him to the ground, twisting in midair to let his own body bear the brunt of the impact. Instinctively, he pinned one of the arms to the ground, and was about to pin the other when he saw the thief‚Äôs face.¬†\nIt wasn‚Äôt Atlas.¬†\nThe thief, a boy of about the same age but with dark, olive skin and fierce green eyes, was beginning to shake himself from the daze of the takedown.¬†\n‚ÄúGet off of me,‚Äù the thief moaned. The Captain felt disappointment rise from within his lungs and into his head, and felt himself begin to crush the much smaller wrist in his hand.\n‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù the thief suddenly exclaimed upon feeling the vise-like grip. The sound of fear had crept into his voice.¬†\nThe Captain leaned close and did not release his hold. ‚ÄúWhere are my paintings?‚Äù the Captain said in a low tone.\nThe boy squinted at him, then glanced at something to the side. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll tell you.‚Äù¬†\nThe Captain stiffened and followed the glance, having not expected an accomplice. There was no one there. The boy‚Äôs free arm swung from the other side, clocking a piercing blow beneath his eye. The Captain instinctively grabbed at his eye, and a fistful of dirt flew into the other and up his nose. He stumbled back, coughing. A foot caught him in the stomach, knocking the air out of his body, and through his tears the Captain saw the boy spin around and take off. The Captain held still for several moments to recover. He caught his breath and charged it into a bloodlust.\nAccelerating after him, the Captain found the boy was already half a block away. They hurdled over fences and dashed through backyards until the boy slipped into Line City. The neighborhood lay on the outer edge of a unique metropolis, one that contained the only bridge from the simulation back to the real world. Despite the chaos of the early Upload era, simulated minds and humans had eventually agreed on‚Äîand determined the means of‚Äîa form of return. This was formalized into a pact that gave those in the simulation the right to return to Earth with a new, nano-sized body; these ‚Äúanchored‚Äù minds were also given a city to spend the scarcity of time they had recovered.¬†\nLine City contained the only way back. It was full of various hawkers and performers, all of them serving a clientele that looked to squeeze the last drops of juice from the fruit of eternity. As the Captain rushed past exotic food carts and street artists setting up their wares, he could see the fabled line for the city‚Äôs central gates in the distance; those who had found a reason to go back to reality.¬†\nAt this sight he felt his legs become weary, and he was glad to see the boy slow down to jog up the grand staircase of a large restaurant. A diner walked out and kept the door open for the boy, unaware of the scoundrel he had just invited in. Only moments behind, the Captain spent the last of his energy to burst up the stairs and into the restaurant, almost tearing open the door with his speed. He collided with a well-dressed couple, apologized, and spun around to see he had the attention of an entire ballroom of gastronomic guests. The boy was slipping into the kitchen on the other side of the room.¬†\n‚ÄúStop!‚Äù the Captain cried. He needled his way through linen-covered tables and carts full of steaming goods. As he entered the kitchen, he immediately jumped back, as the boy had waited there to upturn a large cauldron of curry, evidently the restaurant‚Äôs specialty. The whiff of braised beef and potatoes called out to the Captain‚Äôs stomach. The boy ran down a spiral staircase to the side and the Captain followed, spending more time in the air than the actual steps. In the near darkness at the bottom, the boy hesitated, and in that moment the Captain pounced on him like a starving tiger. This time he allowed the entirety of his weight to drive into the youth and against the floor, their skin scraping against the gritty ridges of the brick surface. The boy was weeping now and clearly done, but the Captain watched his hands move towards the boy‚Äôs neck.¬†\n‚ÄúSTOP!‚Äù a woman‚Äôs deep voice commanded, and her echo came back to reinforce this from every direction. Its totality made the Captain‚Äôs body pause from carrying out its subliminal orders, enough time for the Captain to regain control and stare, devastated, at the boy beneath him. He got up and immediately staggered back, for at his side was a large, burly woman. She had been at least sixty when she uploaded. A long, aquiline nose protruded from her face and seemed ready to peck at him. Her face was surprisingly masculine, with a fierce square chin that would put most bodybuilders to shame. In stark contrast to this were her golden hoop earrings and braided ponytails full of blonde hair. She put two fingers into her mouth and whistled.\nA swarm of small footsteps pattered about, surrounding him. Daring to turn around, he was shocked to find himself surrounded by a ring of children dressed in tatters. He had avoided children ever since he had uploaded, and it was now as if all of them had gathered to corner him in this restaurant‚Äôs basement. As his eyes adjusted, he realized the room was huge and cavernous, with wide brick arches watching over barrels of wine and shelves of kitchen goods.\n‚ÄúYou disgust me!‚Äù the burly woman spat out.¬†\n‚ÄúLook,‚Äù the Captain said, reclaiming his breath and raising his hands. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I just want my paintings back.‚Äù¬†\n‚ÄúHa!‚Äù she shrilled. ‚ÄúYou think you are the only one? The only father pining after pictures of their forgotten children, while their offspring are left to wander the simulation alone?‚Äù Her arms spread out to the children around them. ‚ÄúI am Sashenka, the matriarch of the detached. When the simulation robs children of their parents, I provide the well for their thirst.‚Äù¬†\nThe Captain looked around him again.¬†\n‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúWhere are the parents?‚Äù\nSashenka rolled her eyes, clearly annoyed at the question. ‚ÄúThe parents left them. Every family uploads together, but most of them break. They break when the father decides they must spend the next century partying and that the son must find someone else to play games with. They break when the mother is tired of holding hands to walk across the street and decides the daughter must stay at home.‚Äù\nThe Captain lowered his hands and narrowed his gaze.¬†\n‚ÄúThe parents just abandon the kids? Surely not every situation is like that?‚Äù he said. Sashenka drew in closer, and he could now see a wart on her chin and a missing front tooth. Her eyes lit up.\n‚ÄúBut they are,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe first decade here is the same for everybody. Maybe the next twenty too. But at some point you decide that eternity cannot be burdened with child-rearing, and cast yourself off from your ancestral duty.‚Äù\nThe Captain found himself shaking his head. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you admit there are other reasons?‚Äù he asked.\n‚ÄúAnd what good reason could a parent have for abandoning their child?‚Äù the matriarch returned.¬†\n‚ÄúThere are several, but perhaps all unforgivable,‚Äù the Captain blankly stated.¬†\n‚ÄúYes, you reprobate,‚Äù she declared. ‚ÄúAnd yours?‚Äù¬†\nThe Captain was suddenly tired of talking. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the wrong person,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI made a mistake, but it was a long time ago. The simulation and my life here have nothing to do with it. Now, hand over my paintings.‚Äù He thought about the combined strength of the children around him and noticed Sashenka was staring at him oddly.\n‚ÄúWhen was the last time you saw your child?‚Äù she asked.¬†\n‚ÄúMy son‚Ä¶ and not. Anytime. Here,‚Äù the Captain said, gritting his teeth and judging the lunging distance between himself and Sashenka. However, at this Sashenka began laughing, a terrible, insolent music, and she looked at the Captain again with eyes full of dancing flames.\n‚ÄúOf course. You‚Äôre Atlas‚Äôs father,‚Äù she said.¬†\nIt was as if the simulation had suddenly paused for the Captain. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he said, his voice trembling.¬†\n‚ÄúWe found him several years ago pickpocketing the city‚Äôs line,‚Äù Sashenka said. ‚ÄúHe spent time with us.‚Äù¬†\n‚ÄúHe made it? You‚Ä¶ you know where he is?‚Äù the Captain said.¬†\nSashenka grinned. ‚ÄúNot now, and even if I knew, that wouldn‚Äôt be for me to tell you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre as guilty as the rest of them. A child who‚Äôs abandoned gets to decide if they‚Äôre reunited. If the parent has earned it. After all, why reconcile only to be deserted again later?‚Äù She motioned with her arms toward the children. ‚ÄúMany of us here are wanted, but not needed.‚Äù\nThe Captain decided all of this was too convenient to be true. Had he written Atlas‚Äôs name on the back of the paintings? His head pounded. Something inside him had blistered at the accusations of forsaking his son. It was all wrong. He had thought Atlas was in position to upload. The masked man had been so close. It had been a matter of life and death; not some selfish, whimsical decision about his responsibilities in eternity.¬†¬†\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a liar,‚Äù he said angrily, but he began weeping, and the tears could not be stopped. ‚ÄúAnd I didn‚Äôt abandon my son.‚Äù¬†\nWith that the Captain began walking to the staircase. The ring of children broke to let him through, and he ascended back up into the sounds of bubbling pots and whirling whisks. \n* * *\nThe Captain returned home in a daze, his head continuing to pound. He tried pouring himself a whiskey, but could not keep his hand still enough to fill the glass. Resigning himself to failure, he left the bottle on its side. The rest of the life-giving nectar gurgled away to form a small lake on his countertop.¬†\nHe laid on his bed without changing clothes. Sashenka‚Äôs words played over and over. *You‚Äôre as guilty as the rest of them*. He yearned painfully for his paintings, anything to bring Atlas back. A dim light began to shine in the attic of his mind, and he staggered into his closet. He reached up and took the tin box with the carefulness of a priest holding an ancient, holy book. His thumb slid under the metal cover and gently released it from its duty. As he saw beneath the cover he became overwhelmed, falling back against the closet wall and sliding to the floor. His memory had failed him. Instead of the wooden arrowhead, there was a small, black card. He recognized the seal of his upload certificate, which had been assigned when he entered the simulation. The Captain knew the corresponding seal could only be produced by an individual‚Äôs genuine, simulated touch. Below it were the words:\n*Line City Storage*\nIt was a key.\n* * *\nThe building was nestled deep in Line City, sitting next to the line‚Äôs final stretch to the gates. From a distance, the storage facility seemed to shift and distort in the waves of simulated heat; up close, the Captain realized it was actually built from hundreds of cubes that were constantly being rearranged. Large vehicles moved to and from the building‚Äôs loading docks, revealing the cubes as miniature shipping containers. Many uploaded minds had embraced a nomadic lifestyle, likely keeping the entirety of their belongings in these cubes.\nThere was no entrance to the building, only a series of kiosks distributed in front of the cubes that made up its sides. Observing others entering the cubes, the Captain walked up to a kiosk and inserted his card. The cube in front of him slid backwards smoothly and lowered beneath the ground, revealing an endless corridor of containers behind it. Minutes later, another cube took its place. Facing the cube, the Captain watched its wall retract into its side to reveal another wall with a metal door. He opened the door and waited for the lights to flicker on before stepping inside.¬†¬†\nThere was nothing else in the room but several items splayed onto a large table. On the left side, he saw a few wooden, carved items: a dog figurine, a boomerang, a medallion with an engraved face, and his replica arrowhead. At the sight of the arrowhead he felt a wave of relief‚Äîso it was real. He picked up the medallion next to it and ran his thumb over the etches. Like a spark of electricity, something ran up from the indentations and into his fingertips. These were all memories recreated from adventures with Atlas‚Äîbefore the upload. On the other side of the table the objects were not carved, but actual items, and these seemed foreign to him. A pair of dice, a broken handheld mirror, and gold coins that were inscribed with a strange language. As his eyes traveled from one trinket to the next, something stirred in the depths of his submerged memory, spiraling upwards from within, and it entered into the rooms of his mind and filled them with a horrible comprehension.¬†\nAt some point, Atlas had been with him in the simulation. The Captain had let himself forget. \n* * *\nThe Captain found Sashenka telling the children a story when he returned. Her juvenile gang was seated in front of her. He looked at the children as they turned around. Their faces lacked the creases and wrinkles of his own battle-worn visage, but he could see now that etched upon them was the same search for answers.\n‚ÄúYou were right,‚Äù he said before Sashenka could break into another tirade. ‚ÄúHe was here. We traveled together, accomplished things.‚Äù His voice had faded into a whisper. He gently squeezed the wooden arrowhead in his pocket and it felt warm between his fingers.\n‚ÄúCan I help?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúYou and the children here. Your burden.‚Äù\nA mirthless smile broke out on Sashenka‚Äôs face. She began to circle around him, a threatening shape in the hazy light of the basement.¬†\n‚ÄúHelp?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLike the other parents that have come before you? All of them, looking for redemption.‚Äù As quickly as she had started pacing, Sashenka stopped and stood still. ‚ÄúNone of them has ever recovered what they lost. An eternity of begging may be all that you deserve once you find him.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to search for Atlas. I know that won‚Äôt change anything,‚Äù the Captain said, looking at the group. ‚ÄúHe needs to find me himself.‚Äù At this there was an eruption of angry muttering.\n‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt need to do anything for you, you deadbeat!‚Äù a familiar voice cried out to an echo of agreement. Searching through the faces, the Captain recognized the glaring countenance of the boy he had tackled. The Captain could sense how deep the roots of their grudges had grown, the links wrapped around fragments of memories and intertwined with one another, reinforcing the group against anyone that pulled against them. The cold hand of doubt suddenly gripped him. There was nothing he could do. The children would forever languish in this dark basement, where their grievances could be preserved alongside the barrels of wine.¬†\nSashenka held up a hand to quiet the crowd, peering at him curiously.¬†\nThe Captain spoke quickly so the silence could not strangle him. ‚ÄúMy son‚Äôs no longer with me because of the future I chose. If I pursue him, it‚Äôs just doing the very thing that tore us apart. I‚Äôm done venturing from home. I have one last mission before I join the line and leave the simulation.‚Äù He gathered himself, taking in a deep breath. ‚ÄúTo help others make that jump before me.‚Äù\nSashenka shook her head, but the Captain caught her glance briefly at her younger companions. ‚ÄúThis is ridiculous,‚Äù she said.¬†\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to start a place of rest near the gateway. A new home.‚Äù The Captain gestured at the children. ‚ÄúI can give them somewhere nice to stay, where the world won‚Äôt forget about them. They deserve more than this.‚Äù He paused to let this register. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be surrounded by those preparing to move on. They may learn to forgive again. And if they decide to leave the simulation, I‚Äôll be there to help them.‚Äù¬†\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how much they carry,‚Äù Sashenka said, beginning to tremble. ‚ÄúHow they‚Äôve been wronged. I‚Äôve found children that have spent more years weeping than they were alive.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôll never grow here,‚Äù the Captain said softly.\n‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt do it,‚Äù Sashenka said, adamant. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing out there for us.‚Äù\nAn idea fluttered through the Captain‚Äôs mind, and he caught and held onto it gingerly, even as he wanted to let it go. He slowly approached Sashenka. Reaching out, he took her wrinkled hand and raised it upwards. Removing the wooden arrowhead from his pocket, he placed it on her palm.¬†\n‚ÄúThis represents one of my greatest joys with my son, as well as my greatest failure,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSince you took my paintings, this is all I have left of him. If I succeed and Atlas finds me, I won‚Äôt need this anymore.‚Äù\nHe closed her fingers lightly above the arrowhead.\n‚ÄúSomething to remember me by.‚Äù\n* * *\nThe hotel had cost most of the Captain‚Äôs savings from completed contracts, but he had never felt more prosperous. He had even procured searchlights for the rooftop. These would turn on every night, making the building a beacon in the darkness, marking it as a home for others to return to before their final journey. They were a tremendous effort to set up, but luckily he had the help of a few small, nimble hands.\nThe Captain now stood in front of the hotel as he usually did in the afternoons, gazing at the line to the real world that waited less than ten meters away. He wondered if, one day, he would see Atlas‚Äôs face among the crowd. He became aware of giggling behind him, sweeping away thoughts of his lost son. Sashenka stood grinning near the entrance, and one of the orphans‚Äîa young girl in a blue dress‚Äîwas running toward him.¬†\n‚ÄúCap!‚Äù the girl said. ‚ÄúCappy!‚Äù¬†\nHis face lighting up, the Captain knelt to give her a hug.¬†\n***\nThank you for reading!\n\nBid on the cover image by Simon Wairiuko. 100% of proceeds go to him: https://makersplace.com/wairds/memories-of-atlas-1-of-1-76678\n\nThe story's digital memorabilia NFT will be available soon!\n\nYou can also listen to this story as a podcast or YouTube, (narrated by Alexa Elmy & Sal Rendino), or read it as an ebook.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fededaffina) or subscribe to [Discovering the Future](https://federico1.substack.com/) to join me on my journey getting deep into the weeds of all things crypto.*\n\n## 1.¬† Introduction\n\nOne of the first blockchain trends to gain momentum was the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Vitalik Buterin first[ wrote about them](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/) in 2014, before Ethereum‚Äôs launch in 2015. After a quiet five years since [the DAO hack](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao), DAOs are back in the spotlight, partly thanks to the development of blockchain infrastructure and the growth of DeFi and NFTs.\n\nToday, according to analytics tool [Deep DAO](https://deepdao.io/#/deepdao/dashboard), there are over 100 DAOs with a total of ‚àº715k members managing ‚àº$9B in assets, and growing rapidly. Spinning up new DAOs is becoming increasingly easy, especially after the emergence of tools such as [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/), which ‚Äî when combined ‚Äî allow anyone in the world to create a community with shared ownership of capital (e.g. a treasury) that collectively and trustlessly decides on where to allocate it.\n\nHowever, there are still many challenges facing DAOs that must be solved to form resilient communities. As DAOs get larger and more decentralized over time, it becomes much harder to organize teamwork effectively, track accountability, measure contributions, and maintain the same dedication and drive from participants.\n\nAfter outlining the current DAO tooling landscape, I will analyze some of the most important issues with DAO management and share my thoughts on the future. I‚Äôll also explain why the most effective tooling will be built to enhance community interactions, coordination, and connections ‚Äî thus prioritizing social cohesion.\n\n## 2. DAO Tooling Landscape\n\nTraditional organizations use bank accounts to manage funds and numerous enterprise software solutions to coordinate effectively (e.g. Slack, Zoom, Google Docs, Asana, DocuSign). Similarly, various tools have emerged to tackle different aspects of DAO management and ensure well-functioning communities.\n\nThe following are some DAO tools I‚Äôve come across through my personal experience and research:\n\n### 2.1.

In order to gain traction and resilience, DAOs will need better tools to support their tightly-knit communities.\n\n### 3.1.¬† The DAO Dilemma\n\nDAOs can sometimes be hard to coordinate, and these coordination costs have been a growing pain. As more experimentation has happened, a large trade-off has emerged: DAOs live on a spectrum between organization and decentralization.\n\n![The DAO Dilemma](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/717d407d-2cf9-4090-9b54-b764c0378a69.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nThe DAO Dilemma is the reason why most projects start out with centralized governance ‚Äî there are many decisions to be made at the start. Then, once a solid community is formed and some sort of DAO-market fit is found, some projects opt to decentralize over time. This is called ‚Äú[progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/)‚Äù.\n\nAlthough most DAOs have tried to improve this trade-off by creating smaller working groups or [core units](https://twitter.com/makergrowth/status/1408098195071279104?lang=en) to split tasks more clearly and efficiently, a lot of the activity and conversations between members still happen on web2 tools such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Discord](https://discord.com/), [Discourse](https://discourse.org/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en). Being a member of a couple of DAOs myself, I‚Äôve found it very time consuming to navigate these platforms and understand where I can provide the most value.\n\nWhile [stewards](https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-the-community-stewards-program/) can help by pointing participants in the right direction, there is still a need for better social and organizational tooling to improve community interactions, information flow and social cohesion. For example, [pods](https://showcase.ethglobal.co/marketmake/orca-protocol) ‚Äî ‚Äúorganizations that consist of a fixed number of member tokens each representing a single vote‚Äù, according to Orca Protocol ‚Äî¬† would be a great starting point to further improve project governance and community management.\n\n### 3.2.¬† Governance and Accountability\n\nWhen examining governance in politics, and in corporations more generally, three things are clear:\n\n1. When there are too many people in command, there will rarely be consensus.\n2. Certain decisions require specialization, as not all members are best suited to make them.\n3. Average users of a product/service don‚Äôt want to manage what they‚Äôre using; they just want it to work correctly.\n\n[Delegation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation) has emerged as a tool to pass on responsibility to more qualified and active members within these organizations. This system helps counter voter fatigue and improve decision-making quality and execution.\n\nBut with this comes accountability. Delegators want to make sure that their delegates align with their beliefs and that their actions reflect this. Tracking and managing ‚Äú[protocol politicians](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-life-of-a-protocol-politician)‚Äù is extremely important for the resilience of a project and its community (many existing political systems were built on these principals, such as [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy) in the US or the UK).\n\nOther tools have been created to incentivize smaller token holders to vote, such as the [one released by Andre Cronje](https://thedefiant.io/andre-cronje-curve-bribe-tool/) (founder of Yearn Finance), which allows DeFi protocols to offer token rewards to veCRV holders in exchange for their votes, effectively bribing them to achieve a greater allocation of CRV rewards and higher yields for their users. These new forms of ‚Äúvote buying‚Äù could be used by dangerous attackers ‚Äî a complex issue to solve with current token governance systems.\n\nCommunities need better tools to assess the accountability of individual participants who hold positions of power within them, put proper checks and balances in place, and [move beyond coin voting governance](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html).\n\n### 3.3.¬† Measuring Contributions\n\nDAOs have two main sources of capital they can use to achieve their goals: internal and external.\n\nInternal capital is mostly financial and resides in a DAO‚Äôs treasury. This is possibly the most important component for a DAO to grow, since internal capital is used to encourage participation and to improve the core product or service.\n\nExternal capital is made up of the humans that reside [at the edges](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/). While rewards are a great tool to incentivize the contributors who provide the most value, proper mechanisms to do this haven‚Äôt been entirely figured out yet (the most common approach I‚Äôve seen so far is to enter the work you‚Äôve done into a spreadsheet so that it can be tracked and assessed). [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/kudos), [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) and [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/cred) are working on interesting ideas to capture and quantify contributions.\n\nTo enable meaningful work and retain top talent in the long-term, it will be critical for DAOs to have more user-friendly tools that distribute ownership to smaller working groups with specialized objectives and use KPIs to evaluate their progress.\n\n### 3.4.¬† Legal\n\nLike the wider crypto industry, regulatory clarity for DAOs and implementing effective forms of taxation will be a fulcrum for community adoption and participation. Core contributors and engineers worry about the legal risks when it comes to working for a DAO because there is high uncertainty on possible repercussions. While some progress has been made in legal efforts like the [Wyoming DAO law](https://www.wyoleg.gov/2021/Introduced/SF0038.pdf), which legally recognizes DAOs as LLCs (the first state to do so in the US), there is still a lot of work to do.\n\nSome ideas have been proposed for [DAOs to work together on the technical layer](https://medium.com/primedao/exploring-dao2dao-collaboration-mechanisms-c37218a17a21). Since most DAOs are trying to figure out the same issues, legal or not, there are numerous opportunities to collaborate on the social layer and reach conclusions that will be mutually beneficial. We have started to see this in DeFi with projects such as the [DeFi Education Fund](https://defrapidgrants.org/), which is on a ‚Äúmission to educate policymakers about the benefits of decentralized finance and to achieve regulatory clarity for the DeFi ecosystem.‚Äù\n\n### 3.5.¬† Implementation\n\nDAOs still have many problems to solve from an operational and managerial perspective, which will require a lot of innovation in DAO tooling. Focusing on building out the means that will help DAOs achieve their goals is the priority.\n\nVarious tools are being built to ensure effective governance and voting, which has facilitated a lot of good ideas and proposals by the community. But there‚Äôs a lack of people actually implementing them. It can take weeks, if not months, depending on the proposal. Implementation tooling must be emphasized to facilitate the continual evolution and improvement of DAOs.\n\n# 4.¬† The Future of DAO Tooling\n\nToday, DAOs face many managerial, organizational and legal challenges. Although many tools are being built out, spanning from analytics to voting platforms to multi-signature accounts, there are still plenty of areas of opportunity.\n\n### 4.1.¬† Automation\n\n[Compound‚Äôs Autonomous Proposals](https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-autonomous-proposals-354e7a2ad6b7), which allow members to delegate votes to ideas instead of just people, give us a glimpse into the future. Establishing processes to carry out outcomes without having to rely on humans to carry out the will of the community (moving towards automation) will make DAOs extremely powerful. This is particularly important for [protocol DAOs](https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/the-dao-ecosystem-organizations-for-the-internet-age) to scale, as they could [reduce the need for governance](https://www.fehrsam.xyz/blog/governance-minimization) and achieve greater network effects through automation.\n\n### 4.2.¬† Composability\n\nIt is particularly hard to anticipate how DAOs will evolve and which use cases will be sought after by participants. Therefore, using a combination of developer platforms and composable tools ‚Äî such as bridging your Gnosis Safe multi-signature account to the Snapshot voting platform ‚Äî will allow DAOs to develop their own specialized tools to achieve their goals and solve for design-project fit. This is particularly important to keep experimenting with different organizational structures and practices tailored to fulfil the diverse purposes DAOs are built for.\n\n### 4.3.¬† Incentives\n\nEmphasis must be placed on economic rewards allocation and distribution tools to improve stakeholder participation and community building. Incentivizing [intrinsically motivated](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/how-to-grow-decentralized-communities-1bf1044924f8) participants who will provide long-term value from the start, such as builders and active community members, rather than speculators, is foundational for success. Other than [skin-in-the-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase)) mechanisms such as token vesting, limited transferability and early contributor rewards, there must be more experimentation with different tools to onboard smaller token holders and encourage them to contribute significantly, even though they may not have large economic stakes in a project to begin with. Perhaps this could be done by creating tools that allow participants to exercise power and governance through [reputation](https://medium.com/daostack/reputation-vs-tokens-6d7642c7a538) rather than token ownership.\n\n### 4.4.¬† Community\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the most successful projects have a core team that focuses on building out their community around their core mission and actively participates with members, motivating them by making them feel part of something real. Tools that facilitate coordination and social interactions on a more human level will enable stronger relationships to be formed amongst participants, improving the quality of the community. This is extremely important as a community‚Äôs success is defined by the bonds between its members and the strength of their mutual beliefs.\n\n## 5.¬† Final Thoughts\n\nCurrent DAO tools have played an incredible role in fueling the explosive growth of DAOs and their communities by reducing many technical and operational frictions. It will be interesting to witness how these tools will evolve to overcome current and future challenges, especially those related to social cohesion.\n\nIn the end, it is a DAO‚Äôs community that drives its success. What matters most is that the community keeps caring about their shared mission. The best DAO tools will be those built to optimize for a well-functioning community and ensure the community is happy and aligned long-term.\n\nGiven that the DAO revolution has just started, and the speed of innovation in the space shows no signs of slowing down, I‚Äôm confident that exciting, new tools will be built to help shape and support these communities, redefining the way we collaborate online. Perhaps, as virtual reality develops further, it will emerge as one of the most important tools for DAOs to improve interactions, coordination, and connections amongst community members.\n\n\n***\n\n*List of resources I used in researching this piece:*\n\n* [Adam Levi | Reputation vs Tokens](https://medium.com/daostack/reputation-vs-tokens-6d7642c7a538)\n* [Andre Cronje | Decentralized payroll management for DAOs](https://medium.com/iearn/decentralized-payroll-management-for-daos-b2252160c543)\n* [Andy Bromberg | Token Project & Token Sale Advice, Community, Adaptability, Bet On People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggM4_0uCQjM)\n* [Bankless | Virtual DAO Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xQLiVbz3EM&t=3973s)\n* [BlockScience | Exploring DAO2DAO Collaboration Mechanisms](https://medium.com/primedao/exploring-dao2dao-collaboration-mechanisms-c37218a17a21)\n* [Calvin Liu | Compound Autonomous Proposals](https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-autonomous-proposals-354e7a2ad6b7)\n* [Chase Chapman | On The Other Side | 09.

He jumped into the crypto bandwagon this year and became the Content & Community Lead at [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/). He‚Äôs become one of the voices that influence me most in the space, especially when it comes to making Web3 more inclusive and accessible to all.*\n\n**Note:** This interview was recorded on August 12th, 2021.\n\n![Dahlia (from the collection Lady Dolls) is an NFT owned by Jackson](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cbb44b66-85bb-4532-b329-761a8e492c59.png?height=716&width=717)\n\n**Hi Jackson! I‚Äôm so happy to have you as a guest. I first heard about you when you wrote [a wonderful article](https://dame.mirror.xyz/6U_sDNM7unirxk30glrMJlAmcICpZb7clxRey67YRb4) about how you fell in love with crypto in March 2021. Since then, a lot of great things have happened for you and we'll get back to that later in the interview. But before that, can you tell me about your background before you decided to enter the crypto ecosystem?**\n\nBefore I got into crypto, I worked as a marketer for SaaS companies. The thing is, I never truly believed in their mission or felt a deep connection to their products on a personal level. Back in March, I left a job at a traditional tech company because I realized that it was not a good fit for me anymore. Around the same time, I had been sort of playing around with crypto in my free time. I've always been very passionate about technology and using it in ways that will benefit my life and that of the people around me. But I didn't ever feel like the traditional tech industry was doing that to the world. I even thought it was harming people more than it was helping them.\n\nSo I started to think that this crypto thing and what they called ‚ÄúWeb3‚Äù was maybe a chance to start fresh and try to build a better model for the future. Then I sent [a tweet](https://twitter.com/jacksondame/status/1386714083970494467) saying out that I was [looking for a job in this space](https://dame.mirror.xyz/DkDTYmIPGfxCJN1kpwN7ueple7thjTDGLcJY_l-8l8g). Within hours, I got lots of people sharing it and referring me to people working in the industry. And within a week, I ended up getting dozens of interviews without even submitting a resume or an application anywhere. This resulted in me having three or four job offers and then [accepting that of Rainbow](https://dame.mirror.xyz/DkDTYmIPGfxCJN1kpwN7ueple7thjTDGLcJY_l-8l8g).\n\n**Congrats, again! What‚Äôs even more impressive is that you did A LOT of things since March. Besides having the job at Rainbow, you won the $WRITE race and launched your publication on Mirror, you experimented with creating NFT projects and social tokens, you joined some DAOs... What a ride! (laughs) But before getting involved in crypto, you probably had some preconceived ideas about the industry. Some of them may have turned out to be true, others probably turned out to be wrong. How has your perception evolved over time?**\n\nThat's a really great question! In a very short span of time, I sort of made a dramatic shift in how I perceived and related to crypto. Before this year, I've been following the ecosystem from the sidelines. I didn‚Äôt get involved in crypto earlier mainly because the public perception of it was controversial. I felt this space was very dominated by tech bros and Bitcoin maximalists. They are not really the kinds of people that I can relate to. I perceived crypto as being a space for them, then not a space for me. I was also biased by the headlines and the occasional ‚Äúdrama‚Äù that would occur on Twitter. Back then, I also thought about crypto as being a big homogenous thing.\n\nI don't know what shifted in me exactly. But over the last 12 months, I started opening myself up to the possibility that there was maybe something else going on here. Then I read and watch videos on both crypto and blockchain. Once I started to understand how that technology works, I realized that it was both radical and for everyone ‚Äî not only tech bros. I was also very surprised to learn that crypto was actually very heterogeneous. There were many types of blockchains, many different projects, and so many things going on under the surface ‚Äî far away from the headlines. I also noticed that the people building these things were more diverse than expected. Besides, it was very global and not US-centric only. Then I started realizing, wow, maybe this space is a place for me, a place I could call home.\n\n**That‚Äôs fantastic! I had a specific question regarding your mission at Rainbow. There is this famous quote by Chris Dixon, [‚Äúthe next big thing will start out looking like a toy‚Äù](https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy). And I have this feeling that on Rainbow, crypto *feels* like a game. Sure, it definitely helps when it comes to making it more accessible and inclusive. But let‚Äôs not forget that it‚Äôs a game that involves money, risk and potential losses. Companies like Robinhood may have democratized financial investments and stock trading, they also received a lot of criticism for encouraging ‚Äî and making money on ‚Äî risky behaviours. So where do you plan to place the cursor in terms of narrative on the subject of the risks associated with crypto?**\n\nI love that question. It's something I care about because I share a lot of the criticism and concerns that people have over Robinhood. I think that the experience of investing and interacting with crypto should be a fun experience, not something difficult and burdensome. It was the same approach for Robinhood, except that it fell into the pitfall of getting a lot of its users in trouble. Some people borrow money on margins for options trading and end up spending amounts they can‚Äôt afford to lose. And of course, Robinhood made that part very easy, while in the past there were lots of barriers for people not being able to do that ‚Äî and for good reasons.\n\nAt Rainbow, we are aware that crypto has a very large knowledge gap that prevents new people from getting into the ecosystem. We want to make things fun and easy by using gamification, but most importantly education. We‚Äôve started to create [accessible and non-technical resources](https://rainbow.me/learn) that people can understand and relate to, with everything they need to make wise financial decisions on their own.\n\nThe other big difference is about transparency. Rainbow is a non-custodial wallet, which essentially means that our users are 100% in control of the money and assets stored in their wallets. Those are protected by cryptographic keys generated on a user's device. Even our team can‚Äôt access anyone‚Äôs Rainbow wallet. So unlike Robinhood, we will never use people's money on their behalf since we made it impossible by design.\n\n**Putting the emphasis on transparency seems essential to create trust between newcomers and crypto overall. But there is another pillar of the crypto education that I consider often overlooked. It‚Äôs about the mental load associated with navigating in the Web3 ecosystem, especially for newcomers. Every day, you hear about new drops of NFT or social tokens, new DAOs to join, new versions of protocols‚Ä¶ There is a lot of information to process and a lot of FOMO to handle. I guess you can also feel pretty quickly ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù to crypto. How do you personally deal with all this?**\n\nFirst, FOMO is usually a bad signal to rely on when making a decision. It‚Äôs also extremely powerful. It sort of blinds you and makes your rational mindset vulnerable. It fueled some decisions in my past and I had been overwhelmed before because of it.\n\nI‚Äôve developed this sort of mental model that says, ‚Äúokay Jackson, if you're feeling this, then you probably shouldn't move forward with this decision‚Äù. I've actually chosen not to get involved with many popular NFT projects simply because I had this feeling of FOMO. Overcoming it played a big role in my mindset in this space and it‚Äôs helped me navigate it pretty well so far.\n\nSecond, what you said is true: new projects are dropping every day. But it‚Äôs very comforting to me because it signals that there are endless opportunities. I've actually learned to become content with missing out, since I know that there's always going to be another great project dropping soon. This feeling of overabundance actually makes it easier for me to say no to things.\n\n**It's also a sign that it's never too late to get started. What bothers me about FOMO is that it's not only toxic for yourself, but also for others. There's this dominant narrative in crypto that pushes you to always be \"early\" when you join a project or when you buy an NFT. And to me, that has the effect of dissuading a lot of people from investing or being interested at all** ‚Äî **which of course only increases the inequality between insiders and outsiders.**\n\nI agree with you. It‚Äôs a question I‚Äôve been asking myself for years before getting into crypto: ‚ÄúIs it too late?‚Äù It‚Äôs also the first thing my friends and family ask me when considering to start investing or getting involved. I can now confidently say that we're still extremely early in crypto and that there‚Äôs an abundance of opportunities.\n\n**Your very recent entry is a perfect illustration. You have also become one of the most influential voices calling for more diversity in the ecosystem. As a non-binary person who lives in South Carolina, you're the opposite of the profiles found not only in crypto, but in tech overall. What's your favorite argument for convincing underrepresented people to get started?**\n\nIt's a really important conversation to have. This space may be less conventional than traditional tech, it still does lack a lot of diversity. And yet, I‚Äôm convinced that underrepresented people like me have an edge in crypto. Web3 requires a large mindset shift in comparison to the traditional web. And I believe that because we have fresh eyes, we're well-positioned to help shape this new ecosystem in ways that are going to better impact the whole society.\n\nFor a long time, technology has been marginalizing people like me because we weren‚Äôt part of the establishment building it. So it's critical that we don't let Web3 be shaped in the image of those who were already there to build Web2. And the only way to avoid that is to make sure that more underrepresented people like me can get involved and claim space here for ourselves. Web3 is going to have much greater outcomes for everyone if a wider and diverse group of people will have a say in how it looks.\n\n**Beyond underrepresented people, I think that your analogy is especially true for artists ‚Äî the majority of whom got screwed with Web2. But there is a lot of hope for them at the intersection of the passion economy and NFT, with seemingly endless opportunities to showcase and distribute their works. We had [a great talk about this with Patrick Rivera](https://pwa.mirror.xyz/BoEyMiW_B2DoUZlFNKdfXRn59goHfrsPwvdM8KiLhb4). He told me that the possible business models for the future could look like 1% of the people funding the 99% others. This is directly tied to the concept of [whales](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/whale) that is prevalent in free-to-play video games and keeps gaining ground in the crypto and NFT ecosystem. But I often wonder whether this is truly a really desirable model for the future. On the one hand, that's still a lot of power and impact concentrated in the hands of a few people. And on the other hand, I can‚Äôt help but have this image of whales in video games in which I imagine isolated out of touch people. So I get the point of such business models, but I also have mixed feelings on the subject. What does this perspective inspire you?**\n\nYou made a lot of great points about the dynamics that are going on. Though crypto offers the opportunity of a fresh start, the slate hasn‚Äôt been wiped totally clean. We are building on top of what was set before us by institutions, investors, and people with lots of money. But I'm hopeful about the fact that there are a lot of great things that are built by more diverse groups of people. After having people from Harvard create successful Web2 companies, we're starting to see underdogs building popular crypto projects and emerging artists selling NFTs for millions.\n\nAnd in turn, we see the whales of venture capital and other institutions suddenly taking notice. It's almost like these promising things are suddenly coming out of corners of the universe that they never expected. But while lots of money from venture capital has been flowing into crypto and Web3 projects, they are going to gain more influence and power over them ‚Äî which concerns me.\n\nMy biggest hope is that crypto has enabled lots of new diverse funding models. Plenty of projects have never received any VC money at all because they were able to bootstrap the funding completely from the community of people that support them. And the same is true for artists. One of the first big crowdfunding projects that took off on Mirror was [$NOVEL by the writer Emily Segal](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg). She ended up raising 25 ETH from people who were very captivated by the idea of funding a novel on the blockchain. I am aware that this is a roundabout way of answering your question (laughs). But I am convinced that more diversity in the funding models will lead to more diversity in the projects launched.\n\n**Yeah, that sounds like a great point. Since we're almost at the end of the interview, I'd like to go back to your own background. In the beginning, crypto was just an interest for you. Today, you're a Rainbow employee, a creator, but also an activist calling for more diversity and accessibility in the ecosystem. And it's all happened so fast in such a short time... So I was wondering: what are your long-term goals?**\n\nHonestly, my initial goal was to explore and take advantage of the financial opportunities that are emerging with crypto. I grew up in a modest environment where my family didn't have a lot of money. A lot of the people that I have met in this space come from very well-off backgrounds. Then crypto is kind of just a continuation for them having money. But for me, it's all very new. When I first got into crypto, I was a little bit timid about it. I tend to be very conservative with my money. Taking risks on crypto was out of my comfort zone. But I felt it was an opportunity to overcome certain economic barriers that I faced in the past. And I‚Äôm now more confident about both my current situation and my future.\n\nMy next step is to assist as many people as possible at navigating crypto so that they can have more economic freedom and power ‚Äî especially those who have historically been marginalized by the traditional capitalist society. I also want to put a significant part of the money I‚Äôve made back into the ecosystem. I love to fund the creators I meet on Twitter without any gatekeeper saying otherwise. It allows people who didn't use to have a lot of power to suddenly be able to create a better future for themselves and feel part of a vibrant ecosystem. That's also why I want more underrepresented people like me and more diverse groups of people to come into crypto. It's a huge opportunity for us to sort of reclaim a lot of the space that we've been pushed out of for so long.\n\n**Wow! I truly hope that this narrative will gain ground in the coming years. For now, it‚Äôs a wonderful conclusion to this interview.

If you had a month to work on it surrounded by beautiful nature, creative collaborators, and blazing fast wifi, what could you accomplish?\n\nThe [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) residency is designed to help people answer these questions. **The next cohort will run from August 23rd - September 19th and applications are open now!** \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/047089c0-327c-4a9e-8c83-0945f258c03b.jpeg?height=2000&width=4000)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cf0f590d-65b0-49ba-952d-29ffc773ec10.png?height=878&width=2308)\n\n\n## Submitting a Proposal\n\n**We are accepting proposals from July 27th (now!) until August 2nd (at 11:59 pm PT).**\n\nSubmitting a proposal couldn‚Äôt be easier:\n\n1. Write and share a thread on Twitter explaining who you are and what you'd do with a month at the cabins\n2. Tag [@creatorcabins](https://twitter.com/creatorcabins) #Cohort2 in the first tweet\n3. Confirm that you are: vaccinated against COVID-19, able to attend for the entire duration of the cohort, and able to focus full-time on the residency program\n\nWe‚Äôll gather these threads and coordinate a vote among our members to determine the four creators to be selected for the cohort. Voting will open for $CABIN holders from August 3rd - August 6th, at which time the four proposals with the most votes will be selected to participate in the cohort. \n\n\n## What to Include in Your Proposal\n\nUse this as an opportunity to be creative. It would be good to introduce yourself to the community and share some of your past work. We would also love to see some rough, initial thoughts on how you would like to spend the time in Texas. You don‚Äôt need to provide a fully fleshed-out plan. Just the kernel of a promising idea that‚Äôs been bouncing around your head.\n\nA good proposal will include:\n\n* An introduction to who you are and what you do\n* Some past work samples\n* An idea for how you‚Äôd like to spend your time while at the cabins\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ZFleischmann/status/1405588160365596680\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mnirPRJCTS/status/1405620335253278720\n\n\n\n\n## The Cohort\n\nIf your proposal is accepted, you‚Äôll receive a free 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) in the Hill Country of Texas outside Austin (valued at $2,800). You will have your own private bedroom, bathroom, and workspace in the [Residency Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/cabins), with access to a communal workspace, living room, dining room, and kitchen. The cabins also have a fire pit, floating pool, and 28 acres to roam around on.\n\nA Camp Counselor will be there to coordinate the logistics of your stay, including getting to the cabins from the airport, group outings, and grocery runs.\n\n**Most importantly, you‚Äôll have one month of uninterrupted time to bring a project into the world.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/422c55ba-cf7e-4f48-a33f-f20f3aa011e5.jpg?height=2400&width=3600)\n\n## FAQs\n\n### What is Creator Cabins?\n\n[Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) is an online and IRL community committed to helping independent online creators. We operate a residency program run by a [DAO (decentralized autonomous organization)](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw).\n\nThe DAO brought together people from across the internet to fund [12 month-long residencies for creators](https://creators.mirror.xyz/20Eyc57rknNJYL9vJa11zvupU_MXP7NZJUADTzTlCjQ). We have an active [token-gated discord community](https://discord.gg/N6hVmFygjR) and bring people together IRL at the Creator Cabins location in the Texas Hill Country outside of Austin, TX:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710) \n\n\n\n### What are the requirements to apply?\n\nWe ask that all residents be:\n\n1. Vaccinated against COVID-19\n2. Able to attend for the entire duration of the cohort\n3. Able to focus full-time on the residency program\n\nBeyond that, the program is open to anyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term ‚Äúcreator‚Äù: digital artists, musicians, writers, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders, and more. \n\nIf you‚Äôre building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\n\n\n### What skills are we looking for?\n\nCreativity, collaboration, dedication, and diversity. We love the idea of bringing people from wildly different backgrounds together and seeing what happens. What will the conversation be like around the firepit? How will people end up collaborating and supporting each other?\n\n\n### How do I know I should apply?\n\nThe little voice inside of you telling you your idea is great and you can do it. Believe that voice. Channel it into a Twitter thread for a chance to spend a month working on that project you‚Äôve been itching to build.\n\n\n### What‚Äôs included?\n\nThe residency program includes the following:\n* A free, 1-month stay at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) (valued at $2,800) with your own private bedroom, bathroom, and workspace\n* A 0.25 ETH stipend for food and other essentials\n* Access to a Camp Counselor to coordinate logistics of your trip\n* One month of uninterrupted time to create with a community of collaborators to support you\n* Your own $CABIN tokens and membership in the CabinDAO community\n\n\n### Can I work on other work (e.g. remote work) while I‚Äôm there?\n\nThe goal of this residency program is to unlock the time and space to work on projects you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be able to focus on. We want to support people who will be spending most of their time focused on these projects. While we understand that people may have other commitments, if you aren‚Äôt able to dedicate a month to independent creative work, this program is probably not the right fit. We trust the members of this community to use their best judgment based on the goal of this program.\n\n\n### When will I know if I was selected?\n\nVoting will close on August 6th, at which point we will reach out on Twitter and/or via email to make sure you meet the requirements and can accept the residency.\n\n\n### Is this just for US citizens?\n\nNo, this is open to anyone who can travel to the US and will be vaccinated at the start of the program.\n\n\n### Do I have to submit on Twitter?\n\nWe would prefer applications to be submitted through Twitter so that the broader community can provide feedback. If you don't have Twitter or are not able to submit your proposal there, [you may send the DAO your proposal via this form](https://forms.gle/d53Uba5kvjtcUWGn8).", "timestamp": 1627919214, "digest": "sO5Z4YfAY3zRNsGdKUINrcRYbzLIcKFOjlN0gC2ZsFU", "contributor": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549"}

V3 offers powerful tools for creators that act as the foundational layer for building tokenized communities. This is a significant milestone for us to showcase the evolution of Coinvise and how it enables creators to achieve economic freedom.\n\n## About the Event\n\nV3 introduces a new paradigm for creators to not only launch a token, but also to build & operate meaningful communities. In the keynote, we'll go over some of the features & guides on how to use Coinvise. We'll also talk about how we aim to shape community building in future & making creation a multiplayer game. All existing creators on Coinvise will have access to the event.\n\n## **About Coinvise**\n\nAt Coinvise, we genuinely believe in creators having ownership over the means of production & distribution of their work & how they can build mission-driven communities. It's the most trusted and easy-to-use platform for creators to launch a social token and build a tokenized community.

And if that‚Äôs the case, then I‚Äôm sure your newsfeed over the last week has been consumed by [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/)‚Äì[Dom Hofmann‚Äôs](https://twitter.com/dhof?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) latest attempt to [‚Äúpromote the creation of blockchain-based art and communities to surround them.‚Äù](https://www.platformer.news/p/loot-is-a-viral-social-network-that)\n\nThe first iteration of Loot, Loot (for Adventurers), featured 8,000 NFT Loot bags that each contained a list of eight different adventure items as text. Yep, you heard that right. It‚Äôs just a black background with eight lines of white text.\n\n![The first Loot (for Adventurers) bag ever displayed](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/78d57ba2-0596-4ae4-b8af-52cf46c6e60b.png?height=708&width=1448)\n\nSo, what‚Äôs all the hype? How did this spontaneous NFT project manage to attract $46 million in sales and a total market cap of >$180 million in just five days?\n\nWell, to be honest, it‚Äôs too early to tell. While some people believe that Loot is the latest sign of an unsustainable NFT bubble, others view it as a stepping stone to achieving an open-source fantasy Metaverse (shameless plug for last week‚Äôs newsletter on the Metaverse [here](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/qNLHPqZSMS2udrhExR9O3raTch39KNfSw1FPPlCd8pE)).\n\nRegardless of where you stand on Loot, the frenzy surrounding the project‚Äôs August 28th drop has been overwhelming‚Äìto say the least. To clear up some confusion, we‚Äôve provided a Pathfinder-curated list of must-read content on the project.\n\n1. [This](https://metaversal.banklesshq.com/p/loot-explained-) Bankless beginner‚Äôs guide does a great job of explaining the basics of Loot as well as some initial theories concerning why the project went viral so fast. While you‚Äôre on the Bankless bandwagon, you should also check out [David Hoffman‚Äôs proposition about the Metaverse](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-metaverse-emerges) and the role that Loot could potentially play within it.\n2. In [this](https://twitter.com/tandavas/status/1432802983528448000) Twitter thread, Thanakron Tandavas visually explains why he thinks Loot represents a bottom-up rather than top-down approach to NFTs‚Äìa paradigm shift in the space.\n3. Lastly, [here](https://collisions.substack.com/p/gimme-the-loot), gaming company founder Kyle Russell gives his take on the more controversial side of Loot (i.e. how many people actually get to participate if the current floor price for¬† Loot (for Adventurers) is [7 ETH](https://opensea.io/collection/lootproject?collectionSlug=lootproject&search%5BsortAscending%5D=true&search%5BsortBy%5D=PRICE&search%5Btoggles%5D%5B0%5D=BUY_NOW)). He also gets into why he thinks the project is so interesting‚Äìthink a successor to Marvel‚Äôs cinematic universe being able to take shape in a Lootverse.\n\nAs Loot founder Dom Hofmann said, ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, these are just items on a list,‚Äù \\[...\\] It‚Äôs just what people do with it and how they ascribe value to it.‚Äù To be determined‚Ä¶\n\nTweet us [@pathfinders_gg](https://twitter.com/pathfinders_gg) if you come across any interesting articles related to Loot that you think would be helpful for others, or that you‚Äôd just like to share!\n\n*This introduction to Loot was written by [@anay_sim](https://twitter.com/anay_sim).*\n\n### Pathfinder update: Welcoming Artisans to the team, new bounty ideas\n\nThe Pathfinder squad is growing, and we couldn‚Äôt be more excited to introduce Artisans to the team this week. Artisans are designing and creating the NFTs behind each RabbitHole Quest, and perhaps... a super-secret, never before seen, exclusive upcoming RabbitHole project!? In a digitally native world, Artisans are crucial to building culture. They will be joining the Pioneers on the weekly Wandering Wednesday calls and are sure to be an integral part in the formation of RabbitHole‚Äôs DAO.\n\nAlong with new friends, we‚Äôre also brainstorming new bounty ideas driven by Pathfinders themselves, rather than just the core RabbitHole team. In the past week, there have been many bounty ideas tossed around and strategy conversations that have taken place. We can‚Äôt wait to unveil these bounties and new guides to you soon.\n\n### New Pathfinder guides\n\nWe have just one guide to share with you this week, but it‚Äôs not one you‚Äôll want to miss:\n\n* [How to Provide Active Liquidity on Visor](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/sEfAaGnwfzr_rvTbk9-nSbTkJ4wg3Qwu6nMyp-XfXYY), researched and written by [@NotZachDavidson](https://twitter.com/NotZachDavidson).\n\nRemember that almost every guide is a future quest or task on RabbitHole so keep your eyes peeled for more coming soon!\n\n*Pathfinder Update and compilation of this week‚Äôs Pathfinder Guides written by [@JonahBaer](https://twitter.com/JonahBaer).*\n\n### Rabbit of the week\n\nThis bunny just got it‚Äôs aGold airdrop\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7897d861-e01d-4562-86f0-64169904c6ee.jpeg?height=533&width=800)\n\n", "timestamp": 1631210547, "digest": "61mpC8avnWGmepJ0Ps1lN-Zzr9dyf_5R30j2JNiVEAU", "contributor": "0x0ba85c9e1863E5efB8395a55cd042d61DECD6e89"}

{"id": "6ELyYfLJ6fsvdgoGiubZwUGWMHMeoTaMWVpOFDn4l1U", "title": "Web3: in a nutshell ", "body": "**I wanted to write a quick post delving into Web3 after receiving several questions about it. Without any long narratives, I‚Äôll give it a go with as simple of an explanation as I can.**\n\nTo understand Web3, let‚Äôs go through the features of Web1 and Web2.\n\n**Web1: Read-Only**\n\nThe internet has officially existed since the ‚Äò80s. Content creators have had a place on the internet, but the majority of users using the internet in the ‚Äò90s were consumers on static web pages and seldom produced content. Perhaps a consequence of shifting from print media to the internet, those who dominated content creation were professional writers, reporters, and journalists. The content model here was few-many and people came onto the internet to consume or read-only.\n\nWe saw less censorship here (though still dominant) compared to print. Due to this, people started questioning the credibility of the quickly growing database of information. There were loose social networks on Web1 and only a few ‚Äúinternet companies‚Äù controlled content on the internet. Web1-esque websites still exist today, but it isn‚Äôt very typical. [Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.org/) is an example you are likely familiar with.\n\n**Web2:¬† Read-Write**\n\nCue Web2 or the web as we know it *today*. It took over in the early 2000s.\n\nWeb2, coined by[ Tim O‚ÄôReilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_O%27Reilly), was prompted by upgrades to servers, developer skills, and faster internet speeds - leading way to interactive web applications. Some attribute its start to the aftereffects of the dot-com boom.\n\nThough plenty of companies dominate Web2, there are a few giants that we are all familiar with. At its core, Web2 made space for everyone to become a content creator and consumer simultaneously - though not everyone actually makes money off of what they create. Users produce media on social networks, i.e. [Facebook](http://facebook.com), who then is able to sell personal data to generate impressive amounts of revenue. This is fully allowable because centralized companies have ownership over user data and all user-generated content. Censorship is a bit more lifted in Web2, but is largely platform-dependent. Although users are both suppliers and consumers on this web, they are at the mercy of where they are creating and consuming, handing over rights to any sense of ownership.\n\n[https://twitter.com/eshita/status/1410719809398972416?s=20](https://twitter.com/eshita/status/1410719809398972416?s=20)\n\nPlatforms are siloed in Web2, with the user needing to create an identity across each one to interact as platforms do not ‚Äútalk‚Äù to each other. In addition, capital is accumulated at the top. Privacy is a huge concern as intermediaries are responsible for protecting ours.\n\n**Web3: Read-Write-Own**\n\nOwnership is one of the biggest features of Web3 - participants have full ownership over their content, data, and assets.\n\nThe bitcoin network was[ introduced in 2009](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f), which offered up ethos that Web3 pioneers. Important to note that the internet has not reached what we consider to be Web3, but there are products and services being built that are considered to be ‚ÄúWeb3‚Äù. This simply means that they adhere to the following principles to varying degrees: *open, decentralized, censorship-resistant, immutable, trustless,* and *permissionless*.\n\nWe are slowly seeing Web2 platforms think about what it means to start building products and services that fit within Web3, such as [Twitter‚Äôs Bluesky Project](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3816729) which set out to make a decentralized standard for social media. As with the shift from Web1 to Web2, the shift from Web2 to Web3 is largely due to infrastructure advancement, but there will be a mindset shift for builders and developers as governance will be much more user-centered. With the removal of a middleman and data living on immutable infrastructure, there is no control over data thus no censorship and less risk of data loss.\n\nInteroperability is a major theme for blockchains as it will be for platforms built on Web3. Almost like how the metaverse is described, different platforms can be pieced together to make one fluid space where one‚Äôs identity can remain the same, i.e. not needing to make an account across different platforms.\n\nMany claim that onboarding to Web3 is as simple as setting up your crypto wallet (i.e. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)). Having a wallet connects one to decentralized apps in order to interact and conduct transactions.\n\nExamples of what Web3 tools are might help shape thinking. Here is an excellent mapping of Web3 protocols and their Web2 equivalents:\n\n[https://twitter.com/masonnystrom/status/1359139788553654272?s=20¬†](https://twitter.com/masonnystrom/status/1359139788553654272?s=20)\n\nTake for example[ Medium](https://medium.com/), a centralized tool for writers to publish and earn some income with no say in its governance. In comparison,[ Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) allows for writers to gain full ownership of their work, have a say in its governance (considered co-owners), and earn directly from their audience. This is precisely the theme we will continue to observe as we all start shifting to Web3. As with Web1, Web2 will always exist in parts of the internet, but won‚Äôt dominate spaces where we spend most of our time online in the future.\n\nHope this provided some clarification - as always, DMs are open!\n\n*Thanks to my wonderful friends [Jad Esber](https://twitter.com/Jad_AE), [Vajresh Balaji](https://twitter.com/bvajresh), and [Chris Gonsalves](https://twitter.com/CryptoGamr) for their thoughts on this!*", "timestamp": 1631222327, "digest": "H5bNIXATsWUv_QbbEz6lckYcgAa2rhXEPDRkecOlCOI", "contributor": "0x29Bc18979B5aF84B820bDDfAc207b224c7a959DE"}
{"id": "9YdyxfZtHdr0eLt4pybFjjdGANlmaTc0nHeRHnH_zCA", "title": "Skeleton Drops", "body": "It began with a tweet.\n\n[https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1431316631934967815?s=10](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1431316631934967815?s=10)\n\nDom Hofmann, the previous founder of Vine, released a set of 8,000 loot bags as NFTs that were free for anyone to mint. The NFTs were just 8 lines of text in the top left of a black box.\n\nWhat followed was one of the most insane weeks on the web in recent memory. In seven days @lootproject went from a wonky fascination to something that generated more than a hundred million dollars in trade activity and spawned an entire category of derivative projects. I did not buy Loot, but multiple friends did and liquidated their holdings towards the end of the week for six figures. The fomo is real.\n\nTo those outside the world of Web 3 and NFTs, it's easy to see how this could like another ridiculous side show‚Äîpart scam, part authentic mania. But there's something compelling here, something that's always been core to the internet that is getting reapplied in a different form.\n\nSo what happened the week before Labor Day? These were some of my favorite responses to Loot:\n\n[https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432725683940184064](https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432725683940184064)\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072)\n\n[https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1434340060581621763](https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1434340060581621763)\n\n[https://twitter.com/drewcoffman/status/1432867675651260418](https://twitter.com/drewcoffman/status/1432867675651260418)\n\nDylan Field, the co-founder of Figma, said it well:\n\n[https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1432768626055008257](https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1432768626055008257)\n\nWhen attempting to explain what Loot is to people, I've found myself referring to this project as a Skeleton Drop. Dom zeroed in on the bones of the idea, then invited the entire internet to come flesh out the rest. He did so without taking a cut of the transactions or trying to control too much of what happened after the drop. Once it was out, he was just another person riffing on the idea, not its official leader.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432738541566521345](https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432738541566521345)\n\nThe result was a bonanza of creativity I haven't seen in some time. Hundreds of people worked on projects that built on top of Loot from abstract art, to realms, to stat sheets.\n\n# The First Fork\n\nCompare the Loot drop to another project in the space that I (briefly) worked on last week. Instead of fantasy, the target was a Dope Wars version of Loot.\n\n[https://twitter.com/DennisonBertram/status/1432773242163445763](https://twitter.com/DennisonBertram/status/1432773242163445763)\n\nThe Discord went live shortly after that tweet and over the course of a few hours the project unfolded. The original Loot smart contract was forked, a google doc was created, and people proceeded to let loose, renaming all the items of Loot in Dope Wars style. My primary contributions involved adding Atlanta and changing \"of\" to \"from\", right before the project went live.\n\nThere was also a discussion about the DAO that got heated. I wanted the project to follow the example of Loot, with much more focus on its skeleton vs introducing a structure where the founder and an official DAO for the project would be taking funds immediately.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4dd00c0b-79e2-4183-a8d7-efa732cf9e7a.png?height=1068&width=1268)\n\nI ultimately lost this debate. The founder of the Discord added a 5% rake to each transaction on OpenSea that fed into a DAO he created.\n\nThis is no shade to the Dope Wars Loot founder (he started the project and was clear about owning it). It's also not unwavering praise to Dom. It's unclear what the viability of either approach is as it's so early. The Dope Wars Loot DAO now has \\~$400,000 in their treasury but [an NFT floor price that is slumping](https://opensea.io/activity/dope-v4). The Loot project now has a huge group of people building in every direction but a lot of uncertainty about how to find coherence when Dom just sent another 1.3 million items to mainnet and the discord erupted.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f822f3c2-bbb5-48a4-8eed-7f0ffcebb65a.png?height=1370&width=990)\n\n# The Art and Challenge of a Skeleton Drop\n\nYou can make the claim that Ethereum, Bitcoin, and even the initial World Wide Web protocol are all a kind of skeleton drop. The creators of each dropped the most essential part of their idea then stepped back as official owners as they trusted the world to build itself.\n\nWhat's novel about Loot is the speed of commercialization. Imagine getting an invite to a brand new outdoor festival (like Burning Man) and on day one, it's amazing. Everyone is there because they love the work of the organizer. On day two, it's even more fun‚Äîpeople realize there are many more ways to build and collaborate than they thought as they start making guilds and art for everyone in the community. But on day four, things start to get weird. A friend in a separate camp just sold his, previously free, camp spot for a Maserati. From there things go bananas, a new group of people spend an outrageous amount to enter the festival and the price of each camp spot become the fixation.\n\nThe dynamics have a way of cannibalizing incentives.\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1435642352715145224?s=21](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1435642352715145224?s=21)\n\nLoot took hold of the internet last week because it raises so many fun and brutal questions about what is being built for the new web and why.\n\nCan you make an amazing game by starting with the loot then working backwards? Is it [possible to build a new category of IP from the bottom up](https://collisions.substack.com/p/gimme-the-loot?r=6y7j&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=twitter)?\n\nOr is Loot the worst parts of game culture combined with the worst parts of crypto culture? Has the ETH gotten to people's heads? If we create [\"a world of more exclusive groups based on even more exclusive assets\"](https://twitter.com/parisrouz/status/1432389714468802566) what are we really doing here?\n\nThese questions are targeted towards a role playing game project that's 9 days old but they can just as easily apply to many projects in Web 3.\n\nWhat's amazing is we're already starting to see projects launch that address some of the flaws in the Loot launch. Projects like \"Heroes\" from Mirror which assure an NFT drop is for verified profiles and can't be immediately taken over by bots.\n\n[https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1433603537758351379](https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1433603537758351379)\n\nThe beauty of Loot is that if it falls apart, after flying past a trade volume of a quarter billion dollars in USD, it will provide invaluable lessons on how to structure projects in the future.\n\nIf Loot and More Loot evolve, if they find a way to incentivize a broader community to make a great game (or games), then this will also provide invaluable lessons on how to steward projects in the future.\n\nDom is [burning the keys](https://loot-talk.com/t/lip-0-burn-the-keys-to-the-loot-contract/1218). The quest is on for the people who just spent tens of thousands on an SVG text file.\n\n*And PS.

These were some of my favorite responses to Loot:\n\n[https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432725683940184064](https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432725683940184064)\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072)\n\n[https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1434340060581621763](https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1434340060581621763)\n\n[https://twitter.com/drewcoffman/status/1432867675651260418](https://twitter.com/drewcoffman/status/1432867675651260418)\n\nDylan Field, the co-founder of Figma, said it well:\n\n[https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1432768626055008257](https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1432768626055008257)\n\nWhen attempting to explain what Loot is to people, I've found myself referring to this project as a Skeleton Drop. Dom zeroed in on the bones of the idea, then invited the entire internet to come flesh out the rest. He did so without taking a cut of the transactions or trying to control too much of what happened after the drop. Once it was out, he was just another person riffing on the idea, not its official leader.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432738541566521345](https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432738541566521345)\n\nThe result was a bonanza of creativity I haven't seen in some time. Hundreds of people worked on projects that built on top of Loot from abstract art, to realms, to stat sheets.\n\n# The First Fork\n\nCompare the Loot drop to another project in the space that I (briefly) worked on last week. Instead of fantasy, the target was a Dope Wars version of Loot.\n\n[https://twitter.com/DennisonBertram/status/1432773242163445763](https://twitter.com/DennisonBertram/status/1432773242163445763)\n\nThe Discord went live shortly after that tweet and over the course of a few hours the project unfolded. The original Loot smart contract was forked, a google doc was created, and people proceeded to let loose, renaming all the items of Loot in Dope Wars style. My primary contributions involved adding Atlanta and changing \"of\" to \"from\", right before the project went live.\n\nThere was also a discussion about the DAO that got heated. I wanted the project to follow the example of Loot, with much more focus on its skeleton vs introducing a structure where the founder and an official DAO for the project would be taking funds immediately.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4dd00c0b-79e2-4183-a8d7-efa732cf9e7a.png?height=1068&width=1268)\n\nI ultimately lost this debate. The founder of the Discord added a 5% rake to each transaction on OpenSea that fed into a DAO he created.\n\nThis is no shade to the Dope Wars Loot founder (he started the project and was clear about owning it). It's also not unwavering praise to Dom. It's unclear what the viability of either approach is as it's so early. The Dope Wars Loot DAO now has \\~$400,000 in their treasury but [an NFT floor price that is slumping](https://opensea.io/activity/dope-v4).

{"id": "9xB1wT5Qxl4Zdj-_Ca_okPTlW9mN3wcEpEROUj_RQxU", "title": "Web3: in a nutshell ", "body": "**I wanted to write a quick post delving into Web3 after receiving several questions about it. Without any long narratives, I‚Äôll give it a go with as simple of an explanation as I can.**\n\nTo understand Web3, let‚Äôs go through the features of Web1 and Web2.\n\n**Web1: Read-Only**\n\nThe internet has officially existed since the ‚Äò80s. Content creators have had a place on the internet, but the majority of users using the internet in the ‚Äò90s were consumers on static web pages and seldom produced content. Perhaps a consequence of shifting from print media to the internet, those who dominated content creation were professional writers, reporters, and journalists.

Without any long narratives, I‚Äôll give it a go with as simple of an explanation as I can.**\n\nTo understand Web3, let‚Äôs go through the features of Web1 and Web2.\n\n**Web1: Read-Only**\n\nThe internet has officially existed since the ‚Äò80s. Content creators have had a place on the internet, but the majority of users using the internet in the ‚Äò90s were consumers on static web pages and seldom produced content. Perhaps a consequence of shifting from print media to the internet, those who dominated content creation were professional writers, reporters, and journalists.

The NFTs were just 8 lines of text in the top left of a black box.\n\nWhat followed was one of the most insane weeks on the web in recent memory. In seven days @lootproject went from a wonky fascination to something that generated more than a hundred million dollars in trade activity and spawned an entire category of derivative projects.

The fomo is real.\n\nTo those outside the world of Web 3 and NFTs, it's easy to see how this could like another ridiculous side show‚Äîpart scam, part authentic mania. But there's something compelling here, something that's always been core to the internet that is getting reapplied in a different form.\n\nSo what happened the week before Labor Day? These were some of my favorite responses to Loot:\n\n[https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432725683940184064](https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432725683940184064)\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072)\n\n[https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1434340060581621763](https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1434340060581621763)\n\n[https://twitter.com/drewcoffman/status/1432867675651260418](https://twitter.com/drewcoffman/status/1432867675651260418)\n\nDylan Field, the co-founder of Figma, said it well:\n\n[https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1432768626055008257](https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1432768626055008257)\n\nWhen attempting to explain what Loot is to people, I've found myself referring to this project as a Skeleton Drop. Dom zeroed in on the bones of the idea, then invited the entire internet to come flesh out the rest. He did so without taking a cut of the transactions or trying to control too much of what happened after the drop. Once it was out, he was just another person riffing on the idea, not its official leader.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432738541566521345](https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432738541566521345)\n\nThe result was a bonanza of creativity I haven't seen in some time. Hundreds of people worked on projects that built on top of Loot from abstract art, to realms, to stat sheets.\n\n# The First Fork\n\nCompare the Loot drop to another project in the space that I (briefly) worked on last week. Instead of fantasy, the target was a Dope Wars version of Loot.\n\n[https://twitter.com/DennisonBertram/status/1432773242163445763](https://twitter.com/DennisonBertram/status/1432773242163445763)\n\nThe Discord went live shortly after that tweet and over the course of a few hours the project unfolded. The original Loot smart contract was forked, a google doc was created, and people proceeded to let loose, renaming all the items of Loot in Dope Wars style. My primary contributions involved adding Atlanta and changing \"of\" to \"from\", right before the project went live.\n\nThere was also a discussion about the DAO that got heated. I wanted the project to follow the example of Loot, with much more focus on its skeleton vs introducing a structure where the founder and an official DAO for the project would be taking funds immediately.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4dd00c0b-79e2-4183-a8d7-efa732cf9e7a.png?height=1068&width=1268)\n\nI ultimately lost this debate. The founder of the Discord added a 5% rake to each transaction on OpenSea that fed into a DAO he created.\n\nThis is no shade to the Dope Wars Loot founder (he started the project and was clear about owning it). It's also not unwavering praise to Dom. It's unclear what the viability of either approach is as it's so early. The Dope Wars Loot DAO now has \\~$400,000 in their treasury but [an NFT floor price that is slumping](https://opensea.io/activity/dope-v4). The Loot project now has a huge group of people building in every direction but a lot of uncertainty about how to find coherence when Dom just sent another 1.3 million items to mainnet and the discord erupted.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f822f3c2-bbb5-48a4-8eed-7f0ffcebb65a.png?height=1370&width=990)\n\n# The Art and Challenge of a Skeleton Drop\n\nYou can make the claim that Ethereum, Bitcoin, and even the initial World Wide Web protocol are all a kind of skeleton drop. The creators of each dropped the most essential part of their idea then stepped back as official owners as they trusted the world to build itself.\n\nWhat's novel about Loot is the speed of commercialization. Imagine getting an invite to a brand new outdoor festival (like Burning Man) and on day one, it's amazing. Everyone is there because they love the work of the organizer. On day two, it's even more fun‚Äîpeople realize there are many more ways to build and collaborate than they thought as they start making guilds and art for everyone in the community. But on day four, things start to get weird. A friend in a separate camp just sold his, previously free, camp spot for a Maserati. From there things go bananas, a new group of people spend an outrageous amount to enter the festival and the price of each camp spot become the fixation.\n\nThe dynamics have a way of cannibalizing incentives.\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1435642352715145224?s=21](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1435642352715145224?s=21)\n\nLoot took hold of the internet last week because it raises so many fun and brutal questions about what is being built for the new web and why.\n\nCan you make an amazing game by starting with the loot then working backwards? Is it [possible to build a new category of IP from the bottom up](https://collisions.substack.com/p/gimme-the-loot?r=6y7j&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=twitter)?\n\nOr is Loot the worst parts of game culture combined with the worst parts of crypto culture? Has the ETH gotten to people's heads? If we create [\"a world of more exclusive groups based on even more exclusive assets\"](https://twitter.com/parisrouz/status/1432389714468802566) what are we really doing here?\n\nThese questions are targeted towards a role playing game project that's 9 days old but they can just as easily apply to many projects in Web 3.\n\nWhat's amazing is we're already starting to see projects launch that address some of the flaws in the Loot launch. Projects like \"Heroes\" from Mirror which assure an NFT drop is for verified profiles and can't be immediately taken over by bots.\n\n[https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1433603537758351379](https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1433603537758351379)\n\nThe beauty of Loot is that if it falls apart, after flying past a trade volume of a quarter billion dollars in USD, it will provide invaluable lessons on how to structure projects in the future.\n\nIf Loot and More Loot evolve, if they find a way to incentivize a broader community to make a great game (or games), then this will also provide invaluable lessons on how to steward projects in the future.\n\nDom is [burning the keys](https://loot-talk.com/t/lip-0-burn-the-keys-to-the-loot-contract/1218). For the people sitting on a collection of SVG text files they could currently trade to buy a house, the quest is on.\n\n*And PS.

The Loot project now has a huge group of people building in every direction but a lot of uncertainty about how to find coherence when Dom just sent another 1.3 million items to mainnet and the discord erupted.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f822f3c2-bbb5-48a4-8eed-7f0ffcebb65a.png?height=1370&width=990)\n\n# The Art and Challenge of a Skeleton Drop\n\nYou can make the claim that Ethereum, Bitcoin, and even the initial World Wide Web protocol are all a kind of skeleton drop. The creators of each dropped the most essential part of their idea then stepped back as official owners as they trusted the world to build itself.\n\nWhat's novel about Loot is the speed of commercialization. Imagine getting an invite to a brand new outdoor festival (like Burning Man) and on day one, it's amazing. Everyone is there because they love the work of the organizer. On day two, it's even more fun‚Äîpeople realize there are many more ways to build and collaborate than they thought as they start making guilds and art for everyone in the community. But on day four, things start to get weird. A friend in a separate camp just sold his, previously free, camp spot for a Maserati. From there things go bananas, a new group of people spend an outrageous amount to enter the festival and the price of each camp spot become the fixation.\n\nThe dynamics have a way of cannibalizing incentives.\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1435642352715145224?s=21](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1435642352715145224?s=21)\n\nLoot took hold of the internet last week because it raises so many fun and brutal questions about what is being built for the new web and why.\n\nCan you make an amazing game by starting with the loot then working backwards? Is it [possible to build a new category of IP from the bottom up](https://collisions.substack.com/p/gimme-the-loot?r=6y7j&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=twitter)?\n\nOr is Loot the worst parts of game culture combined with the worst parts of crypto culture? Has the ETH gotten to people's heads? If we create [\"a world of more exclusive groups based on even more exclusive assets\"](https://twitter.com/parisrouz/status/1432389714468802566) what are we really doing here?\n\nThese questions are targeted towards a role playing game project that's 9 days old but they can just as easily apply to many projects in Web 3.\n\nWhat's amazing is we're already starting to see projects launch that address some of the flaws in the Loot launch. Projects like \"Heroes\" from Mirror which assure an NFT drop is for verified profiles and can't be immediately taken over by bots.\n\n[https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1433603537758351379](https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1433603537758351379)\n\nThe beauty of Loot is that if it falls apart, after flying past a trade volume of a quarter billion dollars in USD, it will provide invaluable lessons on how to structure projects in the future.\n\nIf Loot and More Loot evolve, if they find a way to incentivize a broader community to make a great game (or games), then this will also provide invaluable lessons on how to steward projects in the future.\n\nDom is [burning the keys](https://loot-talk.com/t/lip-0-burn-the-keys-to-the-loot-contract/1218). For the people sitting on a collection of SVG text files they could currently trade to buy a house, the quest is on.\n\n*And PS.

Content creators have had a place on the internet, but the majority of users using the internet in the ‚Äò90s were consumers on static web pages and seldom produced content. Perhaps a consequence of shifting from print media to the internet, those who dominated content creation were professional writers, reporters, and journalists.

Some attribute its start to the aftereffects of the dot-com boom.\n\nThough plenty of companies dominate Web2, there are a few giants that we are all familiar with. At its core, Web2 made space for everyone to become a content creator and consumer simultaneously - though not everyone actually makes money off of what they create. Users produce media on social networks, i.e. [Facebook](http://facebook.com), who then is able to sell personal data to generate impressive amounts of revenue. This is fully allowable because centralized companies have ownership over user data and all user-generated content. Censorship is a bit more lifted in Web2, but is largely platform-dependent. Although users are both suppliers and consumers on this web, they are at the mercy of where they are creating and consuming, handing over rights to any sense of ownership.\n\n[https://twitter.com/eshita/status/1410719809398972416?s=20](https://twitter.com/eshita/status/1410719809398972416?s=20)\n\nPlatforms are siloed in Web2, with the user needing to create an identity across each one to interact as platforms do not ‚Äútalk‚Äù to each other. In addition, capital is accumulated at the top. Privacy is a huge concern as intermediaries are responsible for protecting ours.\n\n**Web3: Read-Write-Own**\n\nOwnership is one of the biggest features of Web3 - participants have full ownership over their content, data, and assets.\n\nThe bitcoin network was[ introduced in 2009](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f), which offered up ethos that Web3 pioneers. Important to note that the internet has not reached what we consider to be Web3, but there are products and services being built that are considered to be ‚ÄúWeb3‚Äù. This simply means that they adhere to the following principles to varying degrees: *open, decentralized, censorship-resistant, immutable, trustless,* and *permissionless*.\n\nWe are slowly seeing Web2 platforms think about what it means to start building products and services that fit within Web3, such as [Twitter‚Äôs Bluesky Project](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3816729) which set out to make a decentralized standard for social media. As with the shift from Web1 to Web2, the shift from Web2 to Web3 is largely due to infrastructure advancement, but there will be a mindset shift for builders and developers as governance will be much more user-centered. With the removal of a middleman and data living on immutable infrastructure, there is no control over data thus no censorship and less risk of data loss.\n\nInteroperability is a major theme for blockchains as it will be for platforms built on Web3.

{"id": "sEVFmcXRYvaTxB2DXAwnML3a3NijyYHfsRDougxWJnY", "title": "Full-Time DAOs", "body": "The world is changing.\n\nWe can work on what we love, and get paid in the process.\n\nToday - *I‚Äôm going full-time DAOs*.\n\n**I stand up internet communities and create tokens that represent ownership in them.**\n\nThis post will dive into the ethos of working for a DAO, and the key learnings that come from life as a crypto native.\n\nHere‚Äôs how I work for DAOs, and how you can too.\n\n## All DAOs Lead to Coopahtroopa\n\nDAOs have been a topic of conversation since my earliest days in Ethereum. I wasn‚Äôt around for [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)), so my DAO journey started in 2018 by contributing to grant-giving organizations like MetaCartel and Moloch.\n\nI worked my way in [by writing](https://molochdao.medium.com/moloch-2019-year-in-review-eb6f53dc035). I earned one share by spreading the group‚Äôs mission, giving me just enough governance weight to get into the club.\n\nThis social capital allowed me to contribute to [many communities](https://medium.com/poap/poaps-next-chapter-6be604961261), mainly on growth and external communication.\n\nI got involved [in governance](https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-governance-forum-7b7c9d0300ac), drafting on-chain proposals and creating forums for community discussions. This led to the creation of [Fire Eyes DAO](https://www.fireeyes.xyz/) - a collective to launch tokens and participate in governance.\n\nWhen I [joined Audius](https://medium.com/audius/why-im-joining-audius-72f45aff78b8), I learned what building a core team looked like. The leadership team showed me that building a DAO is much more than just building hype - there need to be systems and processes in place to motivate and align contributors over a multi-year year time horizon.\n\nThese days, I‚Äôm a core contributor to many leading [social clubs](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/gWY6Kfebs9wHdfoZZswfiLTBVzfKiyFaIwNf2q8JpgI).\n\n**I launch tokens, participate in governance, organize community and act as a voice for the next generation to do the same.**\n\nHere‚Äôs a drastically oversimplified version of my DAO timeline.\n\n![Design by Carlos Gomes.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/008de41f-f897-4016-9020-b1fb5d1319de.png?height=3252&width=5120)\n\n*Note: My level of involvement in each of these DAOs varies. There are other DAOs which I am technically a part of, but have left off this list due to a lack of personal contributions.*\n\n## Working for Ownership\n\nBeing full-time DAOs means I‚Äôm kissing traditional compensation structures goodbye. No salary, no healthcare benefits, no 401k - just ownership. Or, more specifically, tokens.\n\nSilicon Valley has known about the ownership secret for a long time: to get the best talent in the world to work for your startup, you need to offer equity. DAOs are the newest evolution of this [Ownership Economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/).\n\nI will not be receiving any payment in fiat. Only on-chain assets. This may include ETH and USDC, but it will generally be represented in governance tokens.\n\n**My goal is to eliminate USD-denominated contracts to entirely token-based compensation.**\n\nMy challenge is finding productive ways to put those tokens to work so that I can sustain myself without having to liquidate tokens.\n\nSo far, I have not figured this out.

{"id": "nf2SfOAdSwDjFsB9e0lL33mFwlP5MOzbYz9or6zd_jk", "title": "Full-Time DAOs", "body": "The world is changing.\n\nWe can work on what we love, and get paid in the process.\n\nToday - *I‚Äôm going full-time DAOs*.\n\n**I stand up internet communities and create tokens that represent ownership in them.**\n\nThis post will dive into the ethos of working for a DAO, and the key learnings that come from life as a crypto native.\n\nHere‚Äôs how I work for DAOs, and how you can too.\n\n## All DAOs Lead to Coopahtroopa\n\nDAOs have been a topic of conversation since my earliest days in Ethereum. I wasn‚Äôt around for [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)), so my DAO journey started in 2018 by contributing to grant-giving organizations like MetaCartel and Moloch.\n\nI worked my way in [by writing](https://molochdao.medium.com/moloch-2019-year-in-review-eb6f53dc035). I earned one share by spreading the group‚Äôs mission, giving me just enough governance weight to get into the club.\n\nThis social capital allowed me to contribute to [many communities](https://medium.com/poap/poaps-next-chapter-6be604961261), mainly on growth and external communication.\n\nI got involved [in governance](https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-governance-forum-7b7c9d0300ac), drafting on-chain proposals and creating forums for community discussions. This led to the creation of [Fire Eyes DAO](https://www.fireeyes.xyz/) - a collective to launch tokens and participate in governance.\n\nWhen I [joined Audius](https://medium.com/audius/why-im-joining-audius-72f45aff78b8), I learned what building a core team looked like. The leadership team showed me that building a DAO is much more than just building hype - there need to be systems and processes in place to motivate and align contributors over a multi-year time horizon.\n\nThese days, I‚Äôm a core contributor to many leading [social clubs](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/gWY6Kfebs9wHdfoZZswfiLTBVzfKiyFaIwNf2q8JpgI).\n\n**I launch tokens, participate in governance, organize community and act as a voice for the next generation to do the same.**\n\nHere‚Äôs a drastically oversimplified version of my DAO timeline.\n\n![Design by Carlos Gomes.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/008de41f-f897-4016-9020-b1fb5d1319de.png?height=3252&width=5120)\n\n*Note: My level of involvement in each of these DAOs varies. There are other DAOs which I am a part of and a huge supporter, but have left off this list due to a lack of personal contributions.*\n\n## Working for Ownership\n\nBeing full-time DAOs means I‚Äôm kissing traditional compensation structures goodbye. No salary, no healthcare benefits, no 401k - just ownership. Or, more specifically, tokens.\n\nSilicon Valley has known about the ownership secret for a long time: to get the best talent in the world to work for your startup, you need to offer equity. DAOs are the newest evolution of this [Ownership Economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/).\n\nI will not be receiving any payment in fiat. Only on-chain assets. This may include ETH and USDC, but it will generally be represented in governance tokens.\n\n**My goal is to eliminate USD-denominated contracts to entirely token-based compensation.**\n\nMy challenge is finding productive ways to put those tokens to work so that I can sustain myself without having to liquidate tokens.\n\nSo far, I have not figured this out. Getting paid in tokens is one thing, finding ways to make them productive and sustainable is another.\n\nMy intuition is something along the lines of liquidity provision, but I‚Äôm still thinking through this process each and every day. If you have ideas, please DM me.\n\n## DAOs as a Skill\n\nSo what do I actually do?\n\nI‚Äôve been fortunate to be a part of major launches like [$RARE](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao/x-superrare-736ab1d090a4) and $GTC through üî•_üî•, and have been front and center for more experimental launches like $FWB and $FF.\n\nHere‚Äôs a look at what that looks like.\n\n**Org Structure**\n\nOrganize and coordinate core contributors using tools like Gnosis Safe, Snapshot, Discord, Coinvise, Mirror, Parcel, Coordinape and SourceCred.\n\nHelp establish working group norms and create touchpoints for eager individuals to get involved.\n\n**Token Distribution**\n\nDesign and iterate on token models and initial distribution mechanics.\n\nLess focus on the long-term token design, more on initial issuance to kickstart the flywheel.\n\nBring tokens to life.\n\n**Curation**\n\nWhat is your position in the [DAO landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw)?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6755275f-532e-40ad-a943-9ebea396ac34.jpg?height=2880&width=5120)\n\nWhy should someone contribute to your DAO over the other 100+ that exist?\n\nWork closely with teams to build out core narratives and identify unique selling points.\n\n**Governance**\n\nHelp communities draft and pass proposals - typically using this template:\n\n* *Summary*\n* *Abstract*\n* *Motivation*\n* *Specification*\n* *Benefits*\n* *Drawbacks*\n* *Vote*\n\nSynthesize community decisions into clear and concise votes.\n\n**Treasury Diversification**\n\nAct as a [value router](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1390357136815779845) to connect core contributors to capital partners after sufficient decentralization and community ownership has been achieved.\n\nParticipate as a liquidity provider and act as a touchpoint for larger funds.\n\n## Positive Sum Games\n\nDAOs are collaborative by nature.\n\nMy goal is to take learnings from one community to another and help reduce, reuse and recycle time and energy.\n\nThe more templates we can create around DAO structures, the faster we will move as a whole.

The NFTs were just 8 lines of text in the top left of a black box.\n\nWhat followed was one of the most insane weeks on the web in recent memory. In seven days @lootproject went from a wonky fascination to something that generated more than a hundred million dollars in trade activity and spawned an entire category of derivative projects. I did not buy Loot, but multiple friends did and liquidated their holdings towards the end of the week for six figures. The fomo is real.\n\nTo those outside the world of Web 3 and NFTs, it's easy to see how this could like another ridiculous side show‚Äîpart scam, part authentic mania. But there's something compelling here, something that's always been core to the internet that is getting reapplied in a different form.\n\nSo what happened the week before Labor Day? These were some of my favorite responses to Loot:\n\n[https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432725683940184064](https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432725683940184064)\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072)\n\n[https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1434340060581621763](https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1434340060581621763)\n\n[https://twitter.com/drewcoffman/status/1432867675651260418](https://twitter.com/drewcoffman/status/1432867675651260418)\n\nDylan Field, the co-founder of Figma, said it well:\n\n[https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1432768626055008257](https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1432768626055008257)\n\nWhen attempting to explain what Loot is to people, I've found myself referring to this project as a Skeleton Drop. Dom zeroed in on the bones of the idea, then invited the entire internet to come flesh out the rest. He did so without taking a cut of the transactions or trying to control too much of what happened after the drop. Once it was out, he was just another person riffing on the idea, not its official leader.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432738541566521345](https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432738541566521345)\n\nThe result was a bonanza of creativity I haven't seen in some time. Hundreds of people worked on projects that built on top of Loot from abstract art, to realms, to stat sheets.\n\n# The First Fork\n\nCompare the Loot drop to another project in the space that I (briefly) worked on last week. Instead of fantasy, the target was a Dope Wars version of Loot.\n\n[https://twitter.com/DennisonBertram/status/1432773242163445763](https://twitter.com/DennisonBertram/status/1432773242163445763)\n\nThe Discord went live shortly after that tweet and over the course of a few hours the project unfolded. The original Loot smart contract was forked, a google doc was created, and people proceeded to let loose, renaming all the items of Loot in Dope Wars style. My primary contributions involved adding Atlanta and changing \"of\" to \"from\", right before the project went live.\n\nThere was also a discussion about the DAO that got heated. I wanted the project to follow the example of Loot, with much more focus on its skeleton vs introducing a structure where the founder and an official DAO for the project would be taking funds immediately.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4dd00c0b-79e2-4183-a8d7-efa732cf9e7a.png?height=1068&width=1268)\n\nI ultimately lost this debate. The founder of the Discord added a 5% rake to each transaction on OpenSea that fed into a DAO he created.\n\nThis is no shade to the Dope Wars Loot founder (he started the project and was clear about owning it). It's also not unwavering praise to Dom. It's unclear what the viability of either approach is as it's so early. The Dope Wars Loot DAO now has \\~$400,000 in their treasury but [an NFT floor price that is slumping](https://opensea.io/activity/dope-v4). The Loot project now has a huge group of people building in every direction but a lot of uncertainty about how to find coherence when Dom just sent another 1.3 million items to mainnet and the discord erupted.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f822f3c2-bbb5-48a4-8eed-7f0ffcebb65a.png?height=1370&width=990)\n\n# The Art and Challenge of a Skeleton Drop\n\nYou can make the claim that Ethereum, Bitcoin, and even the initial World Wide Web protocol are all a kind of skeleton drop. The creators of each dropped the most essential part of their idea then stepped back as official owners as they trusted the world to build itself.\n\nWhat's novel about Loot is the speed of commercialization. Imagine getting an invite to a brand new outdoor festival (like Burning Man) and on day one, it's amazing. Everyone is there because they love the work of the organizer. On day two, it's even more fun‚Äîpeople realize there are many more ways to build and collaborate than they thought as they start making guilds and art for everyone in the community. But on day four, things start to get weird. A friend in a separate camp just sold his, previously free, camp spot for a Maserati. From there things go bananas, a new group of people spend an outrageous amount to enter the festival and the price of each camp spot become the fixation.\n\nThe dynamics have a way of cannibalizing incentives.\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1435642352715145224?s=21](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1435642352715145224?s=21)\n\nLoot took hold of the internet last week because it raises so many fun and brutal questions about what is being built for the new web and why.\n\nCan you make an amazing game by starting with the loot then working backwards? Is it [possible to build a new category of IP from the bottom up](https://collisions.substack.com/p/gimme-the-loot?r=6y7j&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=twitter)?\n\nOr is Loot the worst parts of game culture combined with the worst parts of crypto culture? Has the ETH gotten to people's heads? If we create [\"a world of more exclusive groups based on even more exclusive assets\"](https://twitter.com/parisrouz/status/1432389714468802566) what are we really doing here?\n\nThese questions are targeted towards a role playing game project that's 9 days old but they can just as easily apply to many projects in Web 3.\n\nWhat's amazing is we're already starting to see projects launch that address some of the flaws in the Loot launch. Projects like \"Heroes\" from Mirror which assure an NFT drop is for verified profiles and can't be immediately taken over by bots.\n\n[https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1433603537758351379](https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1433603537758351379)\n\nThe beauty of Loot is that if it falls apart, after flying past a trade volume of a quarter billion dollars in USD, it will provide invaluable lessons on how to structure projects in the future.\n\nIf Loot and More Loot evolve, if they find a way to incentivize a broader community to make a great game (or games), then this will also provide invaluable lessons on how to steward projects in the future.\n\nDom is [burning the keys](https://loot-talk.com/t/lip-0-burn-the-keys-to-the-loot-contract/1218). For the people sitting on a collection of SVG text files currently valued at $20,000 too much more, the quest is on.\n\n*And PS.

These were some of my favorite responses to Loot:\n\n[https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432725683940184064](https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432725683940184064)\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072)\n\n[https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1434340060581621763](https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1434340060581621763)\n\n[https://twitter.com/drewcoffman/status/1432867675651260418](https://twitter.com/drewcoffman/status/1432867675651260418)\n\nDylan Field, the co-founder of Figma, said it well:\n\n[https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1432768626055008257](https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1432768626055008257)\n\nWhen attempting to explain what Loot is to people, I've found myself referring to this project as a Skeleton Drop. Dom zeroed in on the bones of the idea, then invited the entire internet to come flesh out the rest. He did so without taking a cut of the transactions or trying to control too much of what happened after the drop. Once it was out, he was just another person riffing on the idea, not its official leader.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432738541566521345](https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432738541566521345)\n\nThe result was a bonanza of creativity I haven't seen in some time. Hundreds of people worked on projects that built on top of Loot from abstract art, to realms, to stat sheets.\n\n# The First Fork\n\nCompare the Loot drop to another project in the space that I (briefly) worked on last week. Instead of fantasy, the target was a Dope Wars version of Loot.\n\n[https://twitter.com/DennisonBertram/status/1432773242163445763](https://twitter.com/DennisonBertram/status/1432773242163445763)\n\nThe Discord went live shortly after that tweet and over the course of a few hours the project unfolded. The original Loot smart contract was forked, a google doc was created, and people proceeded to let loose, renaming all the items of Loot in Dope Wars style. My primary contributions involved adding Atlanta and changing \"of\" to \"from\", right before the project went live.\n\nThere was also a discussion about the DAO that got heated. I wanted the project to follow the example of Loot, with much more focus on its skeleton vs introducing a structure where the founder and an official DAO for the project would be taking funds immediately.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4dd00c0b-79e2-4183-a8d7-efa732cf9e7a.png?height=1068&width=1268)\n\nI ultimately lost this debate. The founder of the Discord added a 5% rake to each transaction on OpenSea that fed into a DAO he created.\n\nThis is no shade to the Dope Wars Loot founder (he started the project and was clear about owning it). It's also not unwavering praise to Dom. It's unclear what the viability of either approach is as it's so early. The Dope Wars Loot DAO now has \\~$400,000 in their treasury but [an NFT floor price that is slumping](https://opensea.io/activity/dope-v4). The Loot project now has a huge group of people building in every direction but a lot of uncertainty about how to find coherence when Dom just sent another 1.3 million items to mainnet and the discord erupted.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f822f3c2-bbb5-48a4-8eed-7f0ffcebb65a.png?height=1370&width=990)\n\n# The Art and Challenge of a Skeleton Drop\n\nYou can make the claim that Ethereum, Bitcoin, and even the initial World Wide Web protocol are all a kind of skeleton drop. The creators of each dropped the most essential part of their idea then stepped back as official owners as they trusted the world to build itself.\n\nWhat's novel about Loot is the speed of commercialization. Imagine getting an invite to a brand new outdoor festival (like Burning Man) and on day one, it's amazing. Everyone is there because they love the work of the organizer. On day two, it's even more fun‚Äîpeople realize there are many more ways to build and collaborate than they thought as they start making guilds and art for everyone in the community. But on day four, things start to get weird. A friend in a separate camp just sold his, previously free, camp spot for a Maserati. From there things go bananas, a new group of people spend an outrageous amount to enter the festival and the price of each camp spot become the fixation.\n\nThe dynamics have a way of cannibalizing incentives.\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1435642352715145224?s=21](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1435642352715145224?s=21)\n\nLoot took hold of the internet last week because it raises so many fun and brutal questions about what is being built for the new web and why.\n\nCan you make an amazing game by starting with the loot then working backwards? Is it [possible to build a new category of IP from the bottom up](https://collisions.substack.com/p/gimme-the-loot?r=6y7j&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=twitter)?\n\nOr is Loot the worst parts of game culture combined with the worst parts of crypto culture? Has the ETH gotten to people's heads? If we create [\"a world of more exclusive groups based on even more exclusive assets\"](https://twitter.com/parisrouz/status/1432389714468802566) what are we really doing here?\n\nThese questions are targeted towards a role playing game project that's 9 days old but they can just as easily apply to many projects in Web 3.\n\nWhat's amazing is we're already starting to see projects launch that address some of the flaws in the Loot launch. Projects like \"Heroes\" from Mirror which assure an NFT drop is for verified profiles and can't be immediately taken over by bots.\n\n[https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1433603537758351379](https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1433603537758351379)\n\nThe beauty of Loot is that if it falls apart, after flying past a trade volume of a quarter billion dollars in USD, it will provide invaluable lessons on how to structure projects in the future.\n\nIf Loot and More Loot evolve, if they find a way to incentivize a broader community to make a great game (or games), then this will also provide invaluable lessons on how to steward projects in the future.\n\nDom is [burning the keys](https://loot-talk.com/t/lip-0-burn-the-keys-to-the-loot-contract/1218). For the people sitting on a collection of SVG text files currently valued at $20,000 too much more, the quest is on.\n\n*And PS.

But there's something compelling here, something that's always been core to the internet that is getting reapplied in a different form.\n\nSo what happened the week before Labor Day? These were some of my favorite responses to Loot:\n\n[https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432725683940184064](https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432725683940184064)\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072)\n\n[https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1434340060581621763](https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1434340060581621763)\n\n[https://twitter.com/drewcoffman/status/1432867675651260418](https://twitter.com/drewcoffman/status/1432867675651260418)\n\nDylan Field, the co-founder of Figma, said it well:\n\n[https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1432768626055008257](https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1432768626055008257)\n\nWhen attempting to explain what Loot is to people, I've found myself referring to this project as a Skeleton Drop. Dom zeroed in on the bones of the idea, then invited the entire internet to come flesh out the rest. He did so without taking a cut of the transactions or trying to control too much of what happened after the drop. Once it was out, he was just another person riffing on the idea, not its official leader.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432738541566521345](https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1432738541566521345)\n\nThe result was a bonanza of creativity I haven't seen in some time. Hundreds of people worked on projects that built on top of Loot from abstract art, to realms, to stat sheets.\n\n# The First Fork\n\nCompare the Loot drop to another project in the space that I (briefly) worked on last week. Instead of fantasy, the target was a Dope Wars version of Loot.\n\n[https://twitter.com/DennisonBertram/status/1432773242163445763](https://twitter.com/DennisonBertram/status/1432773242163445763)\n\nThe Discord went live shortly after that tweet and over the course of a few hours the project unfolded. The original Loot smart contract was forked, a google doc was created, and people proceeded to let loose, renaming all the items of Loot in Dope Wars style. My primary contributions involved adding Atlanta and changing \"of\" to \"from\", right before the project went live.\n\nThere was also a discussion about the DAO that got heated. I wanted the project to follow the example of Loot, with much more focus on its skeleton vs introducing a structure where the founder and an official DAO for the project would be taking funds immediately.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4dd00c0b-79e2-4183-a8d7-efa732cf9e7a.png?height=1068&width=1268)\n\nI ultimately lost this debate. The founder of the Discord added a 5% rake to each transaction on OpenSea that fed into a DAO he created.\n\nThis is no shade to the Dope Wars Loot founder (he started the project and was clear about owning it). It's also not unwavering praise to Dom. It's unclear what the viability of either approach is as it's so early. The Dope Wars Loot DAO now has \\~$400,000 in their treasury but [an NFT floor price that is slumping](https://opensea.io/activity/dope-v4). The Loot project now has a huge group of people building in every direction but a lot of uncertainty about how to find coherence when Dom just sent another 1.3 million items to mainnet and the discord erupted.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f822f3c2-bbb5-48a4-8eed-7f0ffcebb65a.png?height=1370&width=990)\n\n# The Art and Challenge of a Skeleton Drop\n\nYou can make the claim that Ethereum, Bitcoin, and even the initial World Wide Web protocol are all a kind of skeleton drop.

But on day four, things start to get weird. A friend in a separate camp just sold his, previously free, camp spot for a Maserati.

Projects like \"Heroes\" from Mirror which assure an NFT drop is for verified profiles and can't be immediately taken over by bots.\n\n[https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1433603537758351379](https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1433603537758351379)\n\nThe beauty of Loot is that if it falls apart, after flying past a trade volume of a quarter billion dollars in USD, it will provide invaluable lessons on how to structure projects in the future.\n\nIf Loot and More Loot evolve, if they find a way to incentivize a broader community to make a great game (or games), then this will also provide invaluable lessons on how to steward projects in the future.\n\nDom is [burning the keys](https://loot-talk.com/t/lip-0-burn-the-keys-to-the-loot-contract/1218). For the people sitting on a handful of SVG text files currently valued at $25,000+ each, the quest is on.\n\n*And PS. If you're a Loot holder/whale, and want to talk about ways to bring in others beyond ETH, [DMs are open](https://twitter.com/codybrown).*\n\nSpecial thanks to [@caro](https://twitter.com/caro) and [@casualdiego](https://twitter.com/casualdiego) for the edits.

Each member is encouraged to flow between roles to find harmony with the way that they contribute to the DAO:\n\n* Someone might act as a Staff Member for the whole organization, a Core Contributor for the Writer‚Äôs guild this week, and some bounties in the Growth Guild today.\n* A Token Holder may be a Casually involved and yet have great influence and authority among the community based on their reputation across multiple communities.\n\nThat being said, there is an expectation that members with higher commitment levels contribute for longer time-horizons: Casual members are expected to participate in important, but ad-hoc, governance decisions, while Staff members are expected to contribute steadily throughout multiple Seasons.\n\n![Forefront: The port of entry to web3 digital cities](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5da45d7b-305f-4bf0-bf2d-cefca4c7f4cd.jpeg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n\n---\n\n## Evolutions\n\nAs you might have noticed, Forefront did not formally design these zones or roles ‚Äì they‚Äôve developed organically.\n\nForefront will undoubtedly change in both language and structure over time. It‚Äôs inevitable that new contribution zones and commitment levels will emerge. By listening instead of enforcing we can develop new operating models for our new technology foundation.\n\nWe encourage all DAOs to nurture a space for experimentation so that the right operating model emerges for ***your*** DAO.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fededaffina) or subscribe to [Discovering the Future](https://federico1.substack.com/) to join me on my journey getting deep into the weeds of all things crypto.*\n\n## 1.¬† Introduction\n\nOne of the first blockchain trends to gain momentum was the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Vitalik Buterin first[ wrote about them](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/) in 2014, before Ethereum‚Äôs launch in 2015. After a quiet five years since [the DAO hack](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao), DAOs are back in the spotlight, partly thanks to the development of blockchain infrastructure and the growth of DeFi and NFTs.\n\nToday, according to analytics tool [Deep DAO](https://deepdao.io/#/deepdao/dashboard), there are over 100 DAOs with a total of ‚àº715k members managing ‚àº$9B in assets, and growing rapidly. Spinning up new DAOs is becoming increasingly easy, especially after the emergence of tools such as [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/), which ‚Äî when combined ‚Äî allow anyone in the world to create a community with shared ownership of capital (e.g. a treasury) that collectively and trustlessly decides on where to allocate it.\n\nHowever, there are still many challenges facing DAOs that must be solved to form resilient communities. As DAOs get larger and more decentralized over time, it becomes much harder to organize teamwork effectively, track accountability, measure contributions, and maintain the same dedication and drive from participants.\n\nAfter outlining the current DAO tooling landscape, I will analyze some of the most important issues with DAO management and share my thoughts on the future. I‚Äôll also explain why the most effective tooling will be built to enhance community interactions, coordination, and connections ‚Äî thus prioritizing social cohesion.\n\n## 2. DAO Tooling Landscape\n\nTraditional organizations use bank accounts to manage funds and numerous enterprise software solutions to coordinate effectively (e.g. Slack, Zoom, Google Docs, Asana, DocuSign). Similarly, various tools have emerged to tackle different aspects of DAO management and ensure well-functioning communities.\n\nThe following are some DAO tools I‚Äôve come across through my personal experience and research:\n\n### 2.1. Most Popular\n\n* [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) ‚Äì blockchain developer platform to facilitate the creation of new apps and tools\n* [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) ‚Äì operating system for DAOs and DAO apps\n* [Boardroom](https://www.boardroom.info/) ‚Äì integrated governance and communications management portal to aid decision-making\n* [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/) ‚Äì system used to create token-gated group chats\n* [Colony](https://colony.io/) ‚Äì DAO infrastructure for reputation-based task management and dispute resolution\n* [Deep DAO](https://deepdao.io/) ‚Äì analytics and information-gathering for DAOs\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/) ‚Äì messaging app mainly used for synchronous conversations amongst community members\n* [Discourse](https://discourse.org/) ‚Äì forum used for asynchronous proposals and conversations, heavily used in governance\n* [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) ‚Äì multi-signature wallet used to pool and manage funds\n* [Llama](https://llama.community/#/) ‚Äì treasury data provider for financial reporting, asset allocation, budget planning, and fiscal policy\n* [Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/) ‚Äì publishing platform with a suite of crypto-native tools\n* [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/) ‚Äì application that allows you to earn rewards for using crypto applications and educating yourself on the space\n* [Sablier Finance](https://sablier.finance/) ‚Äì continuous and autonomous payroll management\n* [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) ‚Äì token-based voting platform where off-chain governance decisions are made\n* [Tally](https://www.withtally.com/) ‚Äì dashboard that tracks and analyzes on-chain governance information\n\n### 2.2. To Keep an Eye On\n\n* [Comity Labs](https://www.notion.so/Comity-Labs-4db692ff37934e4893fcf14695f50c6c) ‚Äì platform for funding, engaging and incentivizing communities\n* [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) ‚Äì coordination game to determine the most valuable contributors and reward them\n* [Garnet](https://www.garnet.app/) ‚Äì application to coordinate and interact with your community\n* [Kleros](https://kleros.io/) ‚Äì arbitration service to fairly adjudicate blockchain-based disputes\n* [Multis](https://multis.co/) ‚Äì multi-signature wallet designed for organizations\n* [Orca Protocol](https://www.orcaprotocol.org/) ‚Äì open-source community management tool\n* [Parcel](https://parcel.money/) ‚Äì simplified treasury management products built on top of Gnosis Safe\n* [PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/) ‚Äì app to collectively bid on NFTs and fractionalize ownership\n* [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) ‚Äì a peer-to-peer stack for code collaboration\n* [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) ‚Äì tool for communities to measure and reward value creation\n* [Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/home) ‚Äì money streaming and rewards distributions protocol\n* [Sybil](https://sybil.org/#/delegates/uniswap) ‚Äì platform to find potential delegates and track their votes\n* [Syndicate Protocol](https://www.syndicateprotocol.org/) ‚Äì decentralized investing protocol and social network\n* [Tribute](https://tributedao.com/docs/intro/overview-and-benefits/) ‚Äì DAO architecture framework with an upgradeable and modular design\n* [XMTP](https://blog.xmtp.com/hello-world/) ‚Äì crypto-native communication protocol\n\nIf you‚Äôre a visual learner, here is a great visualization of the DAO infrastructure stack by function:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e70683c4-1ab8-44bb-8c5d-05e40ec5a818.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\nImage: From Kevin Nielsen‚Äôs [article](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-a-dao-mapping-out-the-ecosystem/) on The Defiant\n\n## 3.¬† Challenges to Address\n\nAlthough numerous tools have emerged to facilitate the creation and management of DAOs, there are still plenty of important challenges to address, which are similar to those faced by traditional organizations or political systems. In order to gain traction and resilience, DAOs will need better tools to support their tightly-knit communities.\n\n### 3.1.¬† The DAO Dilemma\n\nDAOs can sometimes be hard to coordinate, and these coordination costs have been a growing pain. As more experimentation has happened, a large trade-off has emerged: DAOs live on a spectrum between organization and decentralization.\n\n![The DAO Dilemma](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/717d407d-2cf9-4090-9b54-b764c0378a69.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nThe DAO Dilemma is the reason why most projects start out with centralized governance ‚Äî there are many decisions to be made at the start. Then, once a solid community is formed and some sort of DAO-market fit is found, some projects opt to decentralize over time. This is called ‚Äú[progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/)‚Äù.\n\nAlthough most DAOs have tried to improve this trade-off by creating smaller working groups or [core units](https://twitter.com/makergrowth/status/1408098195071279104?lang=en) to split tasks more clearly and efficiently, a lot of the activity and conversations between members still happen on web2 tools such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Discord](https://discord.com/), [Discourse](https://discourse.org/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en). Being a member of a couple of DAOs myself, I‚Äôve found it very time consuming to navigate these platforms and understand where I can provide the most value.\n\nWhile [stewards](https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-the-community-stewards-program/) can help by pointing participants in the right direction, there is still a need for better social and organizational tooling to improve community interactions, information flow and social cohesion. For example, [pods](https://showcase.ethglobal.co/marketmake/orca-protocol) ‚Äî ‚Äúorganizations that consist of a fixed number of member tokens each representing a single vote‚Äù, according to Orca Protocol ‚Äî¬† would be a great starting point to further improve project governance and community management.\n\n### 3.2.¬† Governance and Accountability\n\nWhen examining governance in politics, and in corporations more generally, three things are clear:\n\n1. When there are too many people in command, there will rarely be consensus.\n2. Certain decisions require specialization, as not all members are best suited to make them.\n3. Average users of a product/service don‚Äôt want to manage what they‚Äôre using; they just want it to work correctly.\n\n[Delegation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation) has emerged as a tool to pass on responsibility to more qualified and active members within these organizations. This system helps counter voter fatigue and improve decision-making quality and execution.\n\nBut with this comes accountability. Delegators want to make sure that their delegates align with their beliefs and that their actions reflect this. Tracking and managing ‚Äú[protocol politicians](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-life-of-a-protocol-politician)‚Äù is extremely important for the resilience of a project and its community (many existing political systems were built on these principals, such as [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy) in the US or the UK).\n\nOther tools have been created to incentivize smaller token holders to vote, such as the [one released by Andre Cronje](https://thedefiant.io/andre-cronje-curve-bribe-tool/) (founder of Yearn Finance), which allows DeFi protocols to offer token rewards to veCRV holders in exchange for their votes, effectively bribing them to achieve a greater allocation of CRV rewards and higher yields for their users. These new forms of ‚Äúvote buying‚Äù could be used by dangerous attackers ‚Äî a complex issue to solve with current token governance systems.\n\nCommunities need better tools to assess the accountability of individual participants who hold positions of power within them, put proper checks and balances in place, and [move beyond coin voting governance](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html).\n\n### 3.3.¬† Measuring Contributions\n\nDAOs have two main sources of capital they can use to achieve their goals: internal and external.\n\nInternal capital is mostly financial and resides in a DAO‚Äôs treasury. This is possibly the most important component for a DAO to grow, since internal capital is used to encourage participation and to improve the core product or service.\n\nExternal capital is made up of the humans that reside [at the edges](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/). While rewards are a great tool to incentivize the contributors who provide the most value, proper mechanisms to do this haven‚Äôt been entirely figured out yet (the most common approach I‚Äôve seen so far is to enter the work you‚Äôve done into a spreadsheet so that it can be tracked and assessed). [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/kudos), [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) and [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/cred) are working on interesting ideas to capture and quantify contributions.\n\nTo enable meaningful work and retain top talent in the long-term, it will be critical for DAOs to have more user-friendly tools that distribute ownership to smaller working groups with specialized objectives and use KPIs to evaluate their progress.\n\n### 3.4.¬† Legal\n\nLike the wider crypto industry, regulatory clarity for DAOs and implementing effective forms of taxation will be a fulcrum for community adoption and participation. Core contributors and engineers worry about the legal risks when it comes to working for a DAO because there is high uncertainty on possible repercussions. While some progress has been made in legal efforts like the [Wyoming DAO law](https://www.wyoleg.gov/2021/Introduced/SF0038.pdf), which legally recognizes DAOs as LLCs (the first state to do so in the US), there is still a lot of work to do.\n\nSome ideas have been proposed for [DAOs to work together on the technical layer](https://medium.com/primedao/exploring-dao2dao-collaboration-mechanisms-c37218a17a21). Since most DAOs are trying to figure out the same issues, legal or not, there are numerous opportunities to collaborate on the social layer and reach conclusions that will be mutually beneficial. We have started to see this in DeFi with projects such as the [DeFi Education Fund](https://defrapidgrants.org/), which is on a ‚Äúmission to educate policymakers about the benefits of decentralized finance and to achieve regulatory clarity for the DeFi ecosystem.‚Äù\n\n### 3.5.¬† Implementation\n\nDAOs still have many problems to solve from an operational and managerial perspective, which will require a lot of innovation in DAO tooling. Focusing on building out the means that will help DAOs achieve their goals is the priority.\n\nVarious tools are being built to ensure effective governance and voting, which has facilitated a lot of good ideas and proposals by the community. But there‚Äôs a lack of people actually implementing them. It can take weeks, if not months, depending on the proposal. Implementation tooling must be emphasized to facilitate the continual evolution and improvement of DAOs.\n\n# 4.¬† The Future of DAO Tooling\n\nToday, DAOs face many managerial, organizational and legal challenges. Although many tools are being built out, spanning from analytics to voting platforms to multi-signature accounts, there are still plenty of areas of opportunity.\n\n### 4.1.¬† Automation\n\n[Compound‚Äôs Autonomous Proposals](https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-autonomous-proposals-354e7a2ad6b7), which allow members to delegate votes to ideas instead of just people, give us a glimpse into the future. Establishing processes to carry out outcomes without having to rely on humans to carry out the will of the community (moving towards automation) will make DAOs extremely powerful. This is particularly important for [protocol DAOs](https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/the-dao-ecosystem-organizations-for-the-internet-age) to scale, as they could [reduce the need for governance](https://www.fehrsam.xyz/blog/governance-minimization) and achieve greater network effects through automation.\n\n### 4.2.¬† Composability\n\nIt is particularly hard to anticipate how DAOs will evolve and which use cases will be sought after by participants. Therefore, using a combination of developer platforms and composable tools ‚Äî such as bridging your Gnosis Safe multi-signature account to the Snapshot voting platform ‚Äî will allow DAOs to develop their own specialized tools to achieve their goals and solve for design-project fit. This is particularly important to keep experimenting with different organizational structures and practices tailored to fulfil the diverse purposes DAOs are built for.\n\n### 4.3.¬† Incentives\n\nEmphasis must be placed on economic rewards allocation and distribution tools to improve stakeholder participation and community building. Incentivizing [intrinsically motivated](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/how-to-grow-decentralized-communities-1bf1044924f8) participants who will provide long-term value from the start, such as builders and active community members, rather than speculators, is foundational for success. Other than [skin-in-the-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase)) mechanisms such as token vesting, limited transferability and early contributor rewards, there must be more experimentation with different tools to onboard smaller token holders and encourage them to contribute significantly, even though they may not have large economic stakes in a project to begin with. Perhaps this could be done by creating tools that allow participants to exercise power and governance through [reputation](https://medium.com/daostack/reputation-vs-tokens-6d7642c7a538) rather than token ownership.\n\n### 4.4.¬† Community\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the most successful projects have a core team that focuses on building out their community around their core mission and actively participates with members, motivating them by making them feel part of something real. Tools that facilitate coordination and social interactions on a more human level will enable stronger relationships to be formed amongst participants, improving the quality of the community. This is extremely important as a community‚Äôs success is defined by the bonds between its members and the strength of their mutual beliefs.\n\n## 5.¬† Final Thoughts\n\nCurrent DAO tools have played an incredible role in fueling the explosive growth of DAOs and their communities by reducing many technical and operational frictions. It will be interesting to witness how these tools will evolve to overcome current and future challenges, especially those related to social cohesion.\n\nIn the end, it is a DAO‚Äôs community that drives its success. What matters most is that the community keeps caring about their shared mission. The best DAO tools will be those built to optimize for a well-functioning community and ensure the community is happy and aligned long-term.\n\nGiven that the DAO revolution has just started, and the speed of innovation in the space shows no signs of slowing down, I‚Äôm confident that exciting, new tools will be built to help shape and support these communities, redefining the way we collaborate online. Perhaps, as virtual reality develops further, it will emerge as one of the most important tools for DAOs to improve interactions, coordination, and connections amongst community members.\n\n\n***\n\n*List of resources I used in researching this piece:*\n\n* [Adam Levi | Reputation vs Tokens](https://medium.com/daostack/reputation-vs-tokens-6d7642c7a538)\n* [Andre Cronje | Decentralized payroll management for DAOs](https://medium.com/iearn/decentralized-payroll-management-for-daos-b2252160c543)\n* [Andy Bromberg | Token Project & Token Sale Advice, Community, Adaptability, Bet On People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggM4_0uCQjM)\n* [Bankless | Virtual DAO Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xQLiVbz3EM&t=3973s)\n* [BlockScience | Exploring DAO2DAO Collaboration Mechanisms](https://medium.com/primedao/exploring-dao2dao-collaboration-mechanisms-c37218a17a21)\n* [Calvin Liu | Compound Autonomous Proposals](https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-autonomous-proposals-354e7a2ad6b7)\n* [Chase Chapman | On The Other Side | 09.

At Forefront we are developing the port of entry, a digital city unto itself.\n\nAs we collaboratively shape these new organization structures, we need to revisit old approaches to work and membership. At the same time, we must continue to ensure community members can contribute reliably to the collective vision.\n\nIt‚Äôs tempting to lean on traditional central planning practices as the pressure to grow and scale increases. However, our constant state of flux means we need new operating models that can respond quickly and effectively to rapid ecosystem changes.\n\nHeading into Season 2 of Forefront, we are introducing the idea of digital ‚Äúlocality‚Äù to work. We are calling this Contribution Zones. Like city zoning, each zone will help members better understand where they should focus their attention and invest their time.\n\n![How will we zone digital cities?

And, as a result of these rhythms, we now are seeing some patterns emerging.\n\nIt‚Äôs our hope that by clarifying our internal language we can stimulate member engagement and make the contribution paths clearer to members.\n\nAlthough the community members (ourselves included) aren‚Äôt really assigned ‚Äújobs‚Äù, members seem to be flowing through ***zones*** based on energy level, internal work demand, personal capabilities, and preferences.\n\nWe‚Äôve identified three main ***Contribution Zones*** so far: Casual, Core, & Staff.\n\n![Contribution Zones at Forefront](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/60c2de9e-219f-4596-993f-6bbae66f5ed0.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n> **(1) CASUAL:** *Signaling, passive activity, varied financial investment.*\n>\n> Casual contributors can participate very flexibly on an ad-hoc basis.

At Forefront we are developing the port of entry, a digital city unto itself.\n\nAs we collaboratively shape these new organizations, we need to revisit old approaches to work and membership. At the same time, we must continue to ensure community members can contribute reliably to the collective vision.\n\nIt‚Äôs tempting to lean on traditional central planning practices as the pressure to grow and scale increases. However, our constant state of flux means we need new operating models that can respond quickly and effectively to rapid ecosystem changes.\n\nHeading into Season 2 of Forefront, we are introducing the idea of digital ‚Äúlocality‚Äù to work. We are calling this Contribution Zones. Like city zoning, each zone will help members better understand where they should focus their attention and invest their time.\n\n![How will we zone digital cities?

And, as a result of these rhythms, we now are seeing some patterns emerging.\n\nIt‚Äôs our hope that by clarifying our internal language we can stimulate member engagement and make the contribution paths clearer to members.\n\nAlthough the community members (ourselves included) aren‚Äôt really assigned ‚Äújobs‚Äù, members seem to be flowing through ***zones*** based on energy level, internal work demand, personal capabilities, and preferences.\n\nWe‚Äôve identified three main ***Contribution Zones*** so far: Casual, Core, & Staff.\n\n![Contribution Zones at Forefront](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/60c2de9e-219f-4596-993f-6bbae66f5ed0.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n> **(1) CASUAL:** *Signaling, passive activity, varied financial investment.*\n>\n> Casual contributors can participate very flexibly on an ad-hoc basis.

So far, 2021 has been about NFTs (hot [jpeg summer](https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/summer.jpg-26722) anyone?)\n\n2022 will be all about Community DAOs.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1430694594753097728](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1430694594753097728)\n\n> *Community DAOs = DeFi infrastructure + NFT business models + Creative Humans*\n\nCrypto isn‚Äôt just a technology, it‚Äôs an [internet-native economy](https://p.mirror.xyz/1EpvJwUpx_KlRcHOKLNqADEkwHL_Z1ZYKobF2uLwgBg). Revenue is tracked in ETH. Key decisions are made with community governance. Transactions are enforced on-chain through smart contracts. Treasuries are controlled via multi-sigs. And value is captured with tokens.\n\nDAOs are the native corporate structure of these crypto economies.\n\nInstead of being incorporated in Delaware or the Cayman Islands, DAOs are incorporated in Discord servers and blockchains. DAOs provide an internet-native way of pooling capital, making collective decisions, and capturing value.\n\nThe org structure of DAOs looks like modern day [cooperatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative), but over the next decade I believe their scale and impact will rival some of the world‚Äôs largest public companies.\n\nThese days, it seems like there‚Äôs a DAO for pretty much everything; [Collecting NFTs](https://flamingodao.xyz/collection). [Socializing](https://www.fwb.help/). [Building software](https://twitter.com/prtyDAO). [E sports](https://twitter.com/blvkhvnd). [Musicians](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc). [Media](https://twitter.com/forefront__). [Education](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq). [Funding public goods](https://twitter.com/gitcoin).\n\nBut what makes a ‚ÄúDAO‚Äù a *DAO?*\n\n[https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1432728441481318410](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1432728441481318410)\n\nAlthough the purpose, scale, and sophistication of DAOs can vary, most include the same core components:\n\n* **Group chat.** DAOs usually start off with someone saying ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be cool if‚Ä¶‚Äù and then adding a few frens to a Telegram group or Discord server.\n* **Treasury.** The most common type of Community DAO collects blue-chip NFTs and stores them in a multi-sig. As we‚Äôve seen with [Party Bid](https://www.partybid.app/), people love aping into NFTs with their frens. It‚Äôs an experience. Community DAOs can also bootstrap their treasury through a [tokenized crowdfund](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc). This enables the DAO to fill their treasury with ETH to spend on operations and growth.\n* **Token.** As word gets out about how much fun your Community DAO is having, people start blowing up your DM‚Äôs begging you to let them in. At this point, many Community DAOs issue an ERC-20 token as a way to gate membership. Depending on the exclusivity of the Community DAO, membership can cost anywhere from a few dollars worth of ETH to a few mil.\n* **Governance.** Community DAOs with valuable treasuries and hundreds of members need a way to make collective decisions. Usually, rough consensus is reached in the group chat (with emojis, ofc) and the governance vote is just a formality. But it‚Äôs fun to see who voted, how much voting power they have, and what they voted for. Also, most Community DAOs empower small, focused teams of 5 to 10 members to own specific workstreams instead of requiring a governance proposal for every smol decision.\n* **On-chain cash flow**. This is the most nascent component of Community DAOs but also the most interesting. On-chain cash flow turns a fun group chat with your frens into a sustainable business. So far, the most common way to generate on-chain cash flow has been through NFT drops.\n\n**So, are these Community DAOs *actually* working?**\n\nOver the past few months, DAOs like [Fingerprints](https://fingerprintsdao.gitbook.io/fingerprints-dao/) and [Flamingo](https://twitter.com/FLAMINGODAO) have amassed five and six figure NFT collections.\n\n[https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1431778270727610371](https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1431778270727610371)\n\nDAOs like [Bright Moments](https://twitter.com/brtmoments) have sold millions worth of NFTs in minutes.\n\n[https://twitter.com/cryptovenetians/status/1427703534561206273](https://twitter.com/cryptovenetians/status/1427703534561206273)\n\n[Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), [Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq), [Forefront](https://twitter.com/forefront__), and [FWB](https://twitter.com/FWBtweets) are becoming the premier on-ramps for the next wave of active contributors in crypto.\n\n[https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1422577245671936000](https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1422577245671936000)\n\nSome DAOs like [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf/) just leave you thinking WTF.\n\n[https://twitter.com/yossihasson/status/1430815200354111488?s=20](https://twitter.com/yossihasson/status/1430815200354111488?s=20)\n\nAnd don‚Äôt even get me started on [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject)‚Ä¶\n\n[https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1432606797186179072)\n\nMultiple [top](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmUFFkMER4R54dnBRJXL3WTLsktfUTK8KrdTwBbZmRTjSn) [tier](https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/08/bright-moments-dao/) [VC](https://www.mechanism.capital/pleasrdao-thesis/) [funds](https://club.mirror.xyz/a5PQAwU0CuHJ90lEOmzq545nlC4qqNoTVTeHEGRrqow) have invested in these DAOs and I think they‚Äôll end up becoming some of the best performers in their portfolios over the next decade.\n\n[https://twitter.com/FingerprintsDAO/status/1433171214969737219](https://twitter.com/FingerprintsDAO/status/1433171214969737219)\n\nIn the rest of this post, we‚Äôll take a closer look at Community DAOs - how DAOs can become sustainable businesses, what the risks are, and what they may look like in the future.\n\n# Growing Community DAOs\n\nUnlike traditional startups, the *initial* purpose of most Community DAOs isn‚Äôt to maximize shareholder value. It‚Äôs about the vibes. People want to be surrounded by like minded individuals, make collective decisions, and move the community‚Äôs purpose forward.\n\n![thanks drizzy for the quick vibe check](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3c93cf33-7d15-44bd-b977-8d9d0b13a961.jpeg?height=500&width=625)\n\nBut given the growth of the broader crypto market, many of these Community DAOs are finding themselves sitting on [treasuries worth millions](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) and ERC-20 tokens with [$100M+](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/friends-with-benefits-pro/) market caps. In just the past few months, they‚Äôve gone from group chats to real businesses.\n\nOne of the keys to growing these Community DAOs will be recurring on-chain cash flow. There‚Äôs other important factors like community engagement, governance, tokenomics, etc. but generating on-chain cash flow gives Community DAOs capital to reward contributors, hire full time staff, and grow their treasury.\n\nBack in college, I studied Finance and one of the most boring things we learned was how to analyze a balance sheet. Turns out, it‚Äôs actually kinda useful.\n\nThere‚Äôs two types of assets on a Community DAO‚Äôs balance sheet:\n\n1. **Equity** (Blue-chip NFTs, Community DAO tokens, Crypto protocol tokens)\n2. **Cash** (ETH, USDC, DAI)\\*\n\n![FWB June 2021 Financials by Llama. Source: https://www.scribd.com/document/514782942/FWB-June-2021-Financials-by-Llama](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cb003939-eecf-4e09-acba-83e466da4d54.png?height=1090&width=1960)\n\n*\\*Technically ETH could be considered equity in the Ethereum network but for simplicity, let‚Äôs classify ETH as cash on the balance sheet since it‚Äôs the primary medium of exchange for DAOs*\n\nSo what can Community DAOs do with the cash and equity on their balance sheets? For many, crypto feels like a massively multiplayer [online game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game).\n\n[https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1432117673467416580](https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1432117673467416580)\n\nFor Community DAOs, the game is to increase the value of the treasury while maintaining the strong vibes that got the community going in the first place.\n\n[https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1427454307339706389](https://twitter.com/strangechances/status/1427454307339706389)\n\nThere‚Äôs a few ways Community DAOs can put themselves in a position to win this game:\n\n* Collect blue-chip NFTs\n* Earn membership fees\n* Release NFT drops\n* Launch a tokenized NFT gallery\n* Build a media company\n* Sell SaaS tools\n* Invest in tokens (in DeFi protocols, NFT protocols, and other DAOs)\n\nLet‚Äôs take a closer look at each.\n\n***Collecting Blue-Chip NFTs***\n\nThis is the most common way Community DAOs get started.\n\nA group of frens want to collect blue-chips like [Punks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), [Autoglyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs), [DEAFBEEF](https://www.deafbeef.com/), [Fidenzas](https://tylerxhobbs.com/fidenza), [Ringers](https://artblocks.io/project/13), etc. but don‚Äôt want to put all the capital up themselves. Instead, they pool their funds to purchase a portfolio of blue-chips.\n\nHowever, in practice, storing these NFTs in a vault is *illiquid.* It doesn‚Äôt directly generate revenue. As a result, some of these DAOs issue ERC-20 tokens as a way to let people speculate on the value of the underlying NFTs, earn trading fees, and decide when to sell. [PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO), one of the largest NFT Collector DAOs, [recently announced](https://pleasr.mirror.xyz/7hpdJOWRzQx2pmCA16MDxN2FiA3eY6dwcrnEtXKnCJw) a similar liquidity strategy for their 1 of 1 Doge NFT.\n\n[https://twitter.com/business/status/1432723721521876998](https://twitter.com/business/status/1432723721521876998)\n\nThis kinda ends up being like storing gold in a vault and issuing paper certificates against it ([sound familiar?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard)). You can redeem your paper certificate for the underlying asset but you need to trust that the asset will be available and worth something when you want to redeem. But instead of gold and paper certificates we have blue-chip NFTs and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nTo be fair, some of these vaults are *extremely* valuable and have a damn good chance of being worth billions some day. So maybe instead of being like storing gold in a vault, maybe it‚Äôs more like owning equity in [iconic](https://very.auction/doge/doge) [internet](https://foundation.app/@NyanCat/nyan-cat-219) [culture](https://foundation.app/@DisasterGirl/disaster-girl-25046) and some of the most [valuable IP](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/) in the world. But the reality is that in the near term, these vaults alone don‚Äôt generate recurring on-chain cash flow.\n\nInstead of near-term cash flow, these blue-chip NFTs serve as a focal point (or as crypto people would say: [‚Äúschelling point‚Äù](https://nav.al/schelling-point)) for top collectors, artists, founders, investors, and operators to get involved in the community.\n\nAs we‚Äôll see in the next few sections, the most valuable aspect of these vaults stuffed with blue-chip NFTs is that *they attract human capital* that converts illiquid jpegs into cash on the balance sheet.\n\n***Membership Fees***\n\n[https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera/status/1427330975227330565](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera/status/1427330975227330565)\n\nIdk about you, but the terms ‚Äúfollower‚Äù and ‚Äúsubscriber‚Äù feel weird to me. They imply a unilateral relationship. *I* follow *you*. *You* subscribe to *me*.\n\nBut the terms ‚Äúmember‚Äù and ‚Äúowner‚Äù hit different.\n\n*We* are *members*.\n\n*We* are *owners*.\n\nIn web3, membership and ownership are encapsulated in tokens. Balances are stored on the blockchain. And your assets are controlled by your private key.\n\nIf the vibes are off in the community or you need liquidity after getting rekt by yet another degenerate yield farm, you can sell your tokens on an [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) or head over to the #otc channel in Discord to negotiate a fair rate. No questions asked.\n\nBut as the Community DAO increases the value of the treasury and demand for membership increases, the value of the underlying membership token increases.\n\nIf you were an early member of the community or earned a large allocation through your contributions, this can turn into meaningful wealth.\n\n![Membership in $FWB went from being worth $1,000 to $12,000 over the past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b906bb8e-f5f7-4fcb-971c-744a35cd59de.jpg?height=2138&width=1169)\n\nHowever, membership tokens aren‚Äôt just about ‚ÄúnUmBeR gO uP‚Äù. At a deeper level, the token is a coordination mechanism to help online communities *create*, *capture*, and *redistribute* value.\n\nAnd because token holders are also community members, they don‚Äôt need to fire up an Excel spreadsheet and make resource allocation decisions based on a DCF analysis. Unless they want to.\n\nInstead, Community DAOs invest in whatever they want. Sometimes that‚Äôs [donating to charities](https://nouns.wtf/vote/1). Other times that‚Äôs [popping bottles in Paris](https://gallery.fwb.help/fwb-paris).\n\n***NFT drops***\n\nThis is the most common way Community DAOs generate on-chain cash flow. Some of these drops post serious numbers. This past weekend, Bored Ape Yacht Club sold $92M worth of [Mutant Ape NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/mutant-ape-yacht-club) in one hour.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Dogetoshi/status/1431792801751183363](https://twitter.com/Dogetoshi/status/1431792801751183363)\n\n[https://twitter.com/richerd/status/1431999591176572934](https://twitter.com/richerd/status/1431999591176572934)\n\nAnother one of my favorite drops recently was a collab between [Arihz](https://twitter.com/framergence) (an anonymous Brazilian computer scientist / NFT artist) and [FingerprintsDAO](https://twitter.com/FingerprintsDAO) (one of the leading collector DAOs for smart contracts as art). The drop was called [Avid Lines](https://avidlines.art/) and in the first 30 days, it‚Äôs done almost $10M in trading volume.\n\n[https://twitter.com/AvidLines/status/1430215479277146113](https://twitter.com/AvidLines/status/1430215479277146113)\n\nMore importantly, the drop was a great example of how to remix NFT IP in a fun and interesting way. It was a derivative of [Autoglyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs), which is the most valuable collection in the FingerprintsDAO treasury.\n\nHere‚Äôs how it worked:\n\n* Minters chose an Autoglyph to use as the base input for the generative algorithm\n* Autoglyph holders could whitelist their Autoglyphs to receive 10% of primary sales for mints that used their Autoglyph as the base input\n* The generative algorithm combined the base Autoglyph input with Arihz‚Äôs randomization code and the output was a remix called Avid Lines (and they‚Äôre fvcking beautiful)\n\n[https://twitter.com/dgntec/status/1417936546079072256](https://twitter.com/dgntec/status/1417936546079072256)\n\nSome of the most popular NFT drops are derivative projects that take blue-chip NFT IP and remix them in a way that‚Äôs fun, game-like, and visually appealing. These derivative projects are interesting because *they take illiquid jpegs* stored in a vault and *turn them into productive assets*. Some Autoglyph holders earned $40k worth of ETH by simply calling a whitelist function on a smart contract.\n\nAs DAOs look for new ways to increase the value of the NFTs in their treasury, we‚Äôll continue seeing more derivative drops like these that enhance the value of the core IP while also turning NFTs into productive assets.\n\n***Tokenized NFT Gallery***\n\nMost Community DAOs don‚Äôt have their own tokenized NFT gallery yet. But in the near future I think it‚Äôll become one of the most popular ways for Community DAOs to generate on-chain cash flow.\n\n[https://twitter.com/andy8052/status/1430715288622936066](https://twitter.com/andy8052/status/1430715288622936066)\n\nThe basic idea is:\n\n* Members use the Community DAO token to vote on which artists / drops can mint on their site\n* Multiple drop mechanisms are supported (reserve auctions, dutch auctions, editions, raffles, airdrops, generative, etc.) by letting devs register smart contracts with the DAO‚Äôs NFT gallery registry\n* Revenue from primary and secondary sales is shared between the artist, dev team, and DAO treasury\n* Artists, collectors, dev teams, and other contributors receive Community DAO tokens\n* Token holders get access to members-only features like exclusive drops, NFT badges, discounts, physical prints, merch, and more\n\nThis allows Community DAOs to build their own NFT marketplaces while rewarding token holders, artists, collectors, and devs with a mix of cash and equity. The curation abilities of top Community DAOs will eventually turn these NFT galleries into incubators for emerging artists.\n\nFor example, if you‚Äôre a generative artist and FingerprintsDAO votes you into the their gallery, it‚Äôs basically like being a fashion designer and getting your latest clothing line in Vogue. This creates a reflexive feedback loop where the top Community DAOs build status by curating high-quality NFT collections and then help the next generation of artists get distribution while earning fees.\n\nIt‚Äôs kinda like [CAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency) or a [record label](https://jarroddicker.medium.com/?p=e14b695c43b) for internet culture. But now the agents are fans, builders, and creatives.\n\n***Owned Media***\n\nBuilding media properties isn‚Äôt as sexy as a tokenized NFT gallery, but they work. Start a podcast and / or newsletter, find some sponsors, and boom. There ya go.\n\nThe top Community DAOs should have a pretty easy time finding sponsors given their community is filled with progressive individuals with cash to spend on random stuff like digital pet rocks.\n\n[https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/1431242146309238791](https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/1431242146309238791)\n\n[Club Top Shot](https://twitter.com/clubtopshot) is one of my favorite examples of a media company being built around an NFT collection.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ClubTopShot/status/1430519333613096964](https://twitter.com/ClubTopShot/status/1430519333613096964)\n\n[UTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Talent_Agency), one of the premier Hollywood talent agencies, [recently signed](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/) Larva Labs (creator of CryptoPunks, Autoglyphs, and Meebits) and will represent them across film, TV, video games, publishing, and licensing. Imagine Kevin Hart being the voiceover for a CryptoPunk or Meebit in a Netflix show lmfao. I‚Äôd watch that in a heartbeat.\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1432764961227481089](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1432764961227481089)\n\n***SaaS Tools***\n\nMost Community DAOs go through the following cycle pretty much every week:\n\n* A problem surfaces that needs to be solved\n* Somebody does research on the existing tools\n* Turns out none of the tools do exactly what the community needs\n* *\\*Ugh\\**\n\nFWB is one of the most active DAOs in building custom tooling for their community. When they needed a way to token-gate IRL events, [they built it](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/XU5_RYsow8fDbbckryr2snNyfrMV8HTJ0N39Cjkfy3s). When they needed a dashboard to highlight key information about the community, [they built it](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/KhvEi3kHy6rBJX9Lm4DI-iMkbzebEyNdM05uAB_StGY) (and it‚Äôs [vibey af](https://www.fwb.help/pulse)).\n\nA key thing FWB got right early on was seeding the community with high-quality members. Then, token-gating membership was a kind of ‚Äúproof-of-work‚Äù to ensure that only the most committed people would join the community and renew each season. This created a positive feedback loop where talented people get in, those people started building and shipping products, more talented people got interested and joined, more problems surfaced, and more problems got solved.\n\nAs Community DAOs become aggregators for top talent in crypto, we‚Äôll see more custom tooling built to serve the broader community. And similar to how YC startups usually get initial distribution from other startups in their batch, Community DAOs will get their initial distribution from the other DAOs and projects their community is involved with.\n\n***Tokens (DeFi protocols, NFT protocols, and other DAOs)***\n\nIt‚Äôs been interesting to see DAOs align incentives by investing in each other. A few months ago FWB and WHALE did a [token swap](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmWnifY3KD5ECJNtQ23m9GHt2oQ1McA3T4DEEpFarPy9jW) where the stake in $FWB was valued at $100k. Today, that stake is worth $1.5M.\n\nGiven the amount of human capital inside these DAOs, most crypto protocols will probably have a few DAOs on their cap table as strategic investors helping with distribution, connections, and domain expertise. As the crypto market grows, these DAO-to-DAO stakes could end up being very, very large. These stakes will also create a new type of mutual alignment at a level we haven‚Äôt seen before in the competitive world of business.\n\n# Risks\n\nLike any investable asset, Community DAOs live along a risk-reward spectrum.\n\nSome of the main risks of Community DAOs include:\n\n* **Bad OpSec.** A DAO‚Äôs assets (NFTs, ETH, and ERC-20s) are stored in a smart contract that lives on the blockchain. Usually, the contract is a multi-sig wallet controlled by a trusted group of community members. To withdraw assets, a threshold needs to be reached where multiple people sign a transaction with their crypto wallet to authorize it. This prevents one of the signers from going rogue and rugging the community. Or in case one signer loses access to their private key, there should be enough redundancy in the system that transactions can still be signed and submitted. Ideally, we remove the need for any trusted parties and integrate governance with trustless transaction execution through something like [SafeSnap](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f). But in practice, most communities will require some level of trust in a select group of community members to ensure assets are stored and managed securely.\n* **Potential ETH / NFT crash.** Are NFTs in a bubble? Probably. The recent run up in prices mimics the boom and bust nature of [most technology cycles](http://lao8n.com/blog/2015/12/3/carlota-perez-technology-revolutions-financial-capital). If ETH prices crash, Community DAOs will have less cash on the balance sheet and will need to mark down the book value of their NFT assets. It‚Äôs a real risk. Many DAOs implement treasury diversification strategies with the help of domain experts like [Llama](https://www.llama.xyz/) to ensure they‚Äôre able to weather a bear market. DAOs can convert ETH to stables like USDC or DAI to protect against ETH volatility. The best DAOs will have recurring on-chain cash flow and efficient cost structures that enable them to weather a bear market.\n* **Lack of community engagement.** People are the heartbeat of any community. DAO or otherwise. The best Community DAOs have a mission that goes much deeper than ‚ÄúnUmBeR gO uP‚Äù. Collective action towards this mission is what keeps the core contributors and active community members coming back every day. But when people get distracted by token prices, or the core team loses interest, culture deteriorates. The magic of these Community DAOs are the people. The Discord mods that stay up all night answering questions. The volunteers that write documentation to help new members. A lot of the most valuable work in communities goes unnoticed and unrewarded. Community members need [intrinsic motivation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5364176/) to drive the community forward. Otherwise, the community will slowly devolve into just another inactive group chat.\n* **Poorly designed tokenomics.** The two biggest risks with tokenomics are: 1) the core team not having a large enough stake to keep them incentivized and 2) adversarial whales accumulating too many tokens and using them to manipulate the network through governance and / or negative price action. We‚Äôre still in the early stages of understanding best practices for Community DAO tokenomics. Many communities bring on experts like [Fire Eyez](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao), [Delphi Digital](https://twitter.com/Delphi_Digital), and [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/GauntletNetwork) to help develop a robust token strategy.\n\n# Future of Community DAOs\n\nHere‚Äôs a few predictions on the future of Community DAOs:\n\n* **There will be many billion dollar Community DAOs.** This probably isn‚Äôt controversial amongst crypto-natives but if you take a moment to think about it, it‚Äôs pretty wild. Online communities live across Discord servers, Telegram chats, Twitter DM‚Äôs, FB groups, Patreon, etc. A DAO structure gives these online communities the ability to coordinate capital, make collective decisions, and capture value with an internet-native currency. The canonical example of a community that could‚Äôve used this functionality is [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) during the [GME short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze). Aside from just investing, I think there will be billion dollar community DAOs across gaming, publishing, music, education, art, software development, and more.\n* **Community tokens > Social tokens.** For the past couple years, social tokens were a hot topic when discussing the future of crypto-native consumer apps. The thought went, *‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be cool if you could invest in people the same way you can invest in stocks?‚Äù* [Bitclout‚Äôs](https://bitclout.com/) initial traction was a sign that there‚Äôs demand for this type of product. But social tokens focused on one person can lead to burnout, mental health issues, and regulatory risk. So instead of social tokens focused on individual people, I think *community tokens* focused on the *collective efforts* of groups of people will become the dominant model. Investing in the Mr. Beast token is boring. Being a member in the Mr. Beast community is fun. Social tokens feel like a top-down approach. A creator and their management team retains full control over creative decisions and IP. But as we‚Äôre seeing with [BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) and [Loot](https://twitter.com/lootproject), bottoms-up decentralized communities with the right incentives have the potential to create much more value than a centrally coordinated effort. In the previous era, open source projects like Android and Linux didn‚Äôt have a native business model. But now ERC-20 tokens and NFTs give open source software a business model. And not just open source software, but also open source IP. To me, social tokens imply a top-down centrally coordinated effort whereas community tokens imply a bottoms-up decentralized community with full access to the underlying IP. The latter is much more crypto-native and paves the way for a level of combinatorial creativity that we haven‚Äôt really seen before.\n* **Service DAOs will play a key role in scaling Community DAOs.** In crypto, there‚Äôs a whole new set of specialized skills needed to build a successful project. Things like tokenomics, treasury management, community management, onboarding, governance, smart contract development, data science, protocol security, OpSec, etc. Because there aren‚Äôt many experts in these areas yet, we‚Äôre already seeing crypto-native agencies (i.e., ‚ÄúService DAOs‚Äù) that aggregate the best talent for a specialized skill and provide services to other DAOs. There‚Äôs [Llama](https://www.llama.xyz/) for treasury management, [Fire Eyez](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao) for tokenomics, and [Vector](https://twitter.com/VectorDAO) for designing crypto apps. Service DAOs combine the flexibility of freelancing with the upside of startups. Most get paid in a combination of ETH and ERC20-tokens so there‚Äôs skin-in-the-game and aligned incentives. As these Service DAOs build out their processes, hire more talent, and build software to automate their services, it‚Äôll be much easier for Community DAOs to solve some of their toughest problems and help them scale.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nCommunity DAOs are the next evolution in online communities. It‚Äôs like if subreddits had a shared bank account, a token, and governance mechanisms. They‚Äôll become the [new social networks](https://www.notboring.co/p/status-monkeys). And the best way to learn is by actively contributing.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I usually share with friends interested in contributing to Community DAOs:\n\n* Join 3 to 5 Discord servers to get a sense of the different vibes\n* Introduce yourself in the #introductions channel and read the other intros to get an understanding of who‚Äôs in the community\n* Find two or three channels that are most relevant to you and check them multiple times a day. Ask questions. Answer questions. Offer encouragement.\n* Read the governance forum to understand what the top priorities are for the community and how they make decisions\n* Attend voice chats to build relationships with the most active contributors\n* Now, after this initial research phase, choose the top one or two Community DAOs you vibe with and *double down* on them\n* Find a committee you can help with and work on a project. As you get more comfortable, take on a leadership role\n* Try to get rewarded with the Community DAO‚Äôs token to align incentives and truly become an owner in the community\n* Iterate and repeat\n\nThe DAO maestro himself [Coopahtroopa](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa) recently published [an article](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw) with a bunch of DAOs you can contribute to as well as a list of people to follow.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1432403329422741504](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1432403329422741504)\n\nThe demand for talent in the space far exceeds supply so if you‚Äôre at all interested, don‚Äôt hesitate to jump in and start contributing.\n\nUntil next time ‚úåÔ∏è\n\n\n---\n\n*Shoutout to [Coopahtroopa](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa), [Elena](https://twitter.com/VirtualElena), [Chase](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman), [Dame](https://twitter.com/jacksondame), [Nir](https://twitter.com/nir_III), [Li](https://twitter.com/ljin18), [Jarrod](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker), and [Louis](https://twitter.com/albiverse) for their feedback on this post.

{"id": "89BjRtdZncnupGaJEiZxDeqXfVcYBmmDV6Kz4jvtXKQ", "title": "Shaping your Community‚Äôs Contribution Zones", "body": "### Communities in Constant Flux\n\nNew [digital native cities](https://zine.zora.co/worldbuilding-with-fwb) are emerging: first in the form of digital spaces (e.g. DAOs), and soon as physical expressions of their communities. At Forefront we are developing the port of entry, a digital city unto itself.\n\nAs we collaboratively shape these new organizations, we need to revisit old approaches to work and membership. At the same time, we must continue to ensure community members can contribute reliably to the collective vision.\n\nIt‚Äôs tempting to lean on traditional central planning practices as the pressure to grow and scale increases. However, our constant state of flux means we need new operating models that can respond quickly and effectively to rapid ecosystem changes.\n\nHeading into Season 2 of Forefront, we are introducing the idea of digital ‚Äúlocality‚Äù to work. We are calling this Contribution Zones. Like city zoning, each zone will help members better understand where they should focus their attention and invest their time.\n\n![How will we zone digital cities?

And, as a result of these rhythms, we now are seeing some patterns emerging.\n\nIt‚Äôs our hope that by clarifying our internal language we can stimulate member engagement and make the contribution paths clearer to members.\n\nAlthough the community members (ourselves included) aren‚Äôt really assigned ‚Äújobs‚Äù, members seem to be flowing through ***zones*** based on energy level, internal work demand, personal capabilities, and preferences.\n\nWe‚Äôve identified three main ***Contribution Zones*** so far: Casual, Core, & Staff.\n\n![Contribution Zones at Forefront](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/60c2de9e-219f-4596-993f-6bbae66f5ed0.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n> **(1) CASUAL:** *Signaling, passive activity, varied financial investment.*\n>\n> Casual contributors can participate very flexibly on an ad-hoc basis. They're invested in DAO success and complete available tasks (bounties) when they desire.\n\n> **(2) CORE:** *Production, moderate activity, moderate financial investment.*\n>\n> Core Contributors are responsible for getting stuff done within their respective domain. They push forward the agenda, create bounty opportunities, and engage other stakeholders throughout the process.\n\n> **(3) STAFF:** *Stewardship, high activity, high financial investment.*\n>\n> Staff members are responsible for enacting the community voice and making high-level decisions around product and vision. In other words, making sure the DAO is pointed in the right direction.\n\nThese zones shift the operational focus from a central process of ‚Äúdistinct jobs and activities‚Äù to a member-led process based on ‚Äúcommitment and investment level.‚Äù\n\nAcross the zones we are also seeing specific role categories emerging.\n\nUnlike roles in traditional organizations, these are based on commitment levels and activity types (long-term program steward vs. short-term contractor) - not knowledge specialization (Sales vs. Engineering).\n\n![Member Roles at Forefront](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64ab60e9-9737-450c-b62e-1a9e7d4e4559.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n> **(1) TOKEN HOLDER:** Member has a financial stake in the DAO and may participate in governance. Usually does not contribute to ongoing operations, projects or bounties.\n\n> **(2) BOUNTY HUNTER:** Member may not be involved in daily DAO operations or planning, but actively seeks and completes interesting bounties.\n\n> **(3) CORE CONTRIBUTOR:** Member actively attends DAO meetings, consistently works on larger DAO priorities, and potentially leads projects with other DAO members.\n\n> **(4) STAFF MEMBER:** Member is responsible for the survival and vision of the DAO, treasury management, and other high-level priorities such as Seasonal community guidance.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note: Each of these zones and roles is not mutually exclusive, and do not imply ‚Äúinner rings‚Äù. Each member is encouraged to flow between roles to find harmony with the way that they contribute to the DAO:\n\n* Someone might act as a Staff Member for the whole organization, a Core Contributor for the Writer‚Äôs guild this week, and some bounties in the Growth Guild today.\n* A Token Holder may be a Casually involved and yet have great influence and authority among the community based on their reputation across multiple communities.\n\nThat being said, there is an expectation that members with higher commitment levels contribute for longer time-horizons: Casual members are expected to participate in important, but ad-hoc, governance decisions, while Staff members are expected to contribute steadily throughout multiple Seasons.\n\n![Forefront: The port of entry to web3 digital cities](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5da45d7b-305f-4bf0-bf2d-cefca4c7f4cd.jpeg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n\n---\n\n## Evolutions\n\nAs you might have noticed, Forefront did not formally design these zones or roles ‚Äì they‚Äôve developed organically.\n\nForefront will undoubtedly change in both language and structure over time. It‚Äôs inevitable that new contribution zones and commitment levels will emerge. By listening instead of enforcing we can develop new operating models for our new technology foundation.\n\n![How To: Gathering Contribution Zone Signals](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f398e1b6-818b-48a8-b98b-a5817e9cd470.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nWe encourage all DAOs to nurture a space for experimentation so that the right operating model emerges for ***your*** DAO.  Let‚Äôs watch our interactions with curiosity, and listen to the **Contribution Zone Signals** that appear.\n\nThen, we can design new cities to take advantage of the organic structures that are in harmony with our ecosystem.\n\n\n***\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, be sure to leave a tip.

{"id": "2kBDHe_P5cZhSn4f5f21QAigqByk9eNPtvdbqN5KFyg", "title": "Unbundling social token economics, governance, and access", "body": "If you look at the[ social DAO landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw), you‚Äôll see communities with different social token models. Some, like FWB, use a fungible social token to gate community access. Many emerging PFP-based communities like BAYC use NFTs as the primary community gating mechanism. Whether fungible or non-fungible, social tokens in DAOs usually represent three different but overlapping roles:\n\n* Economic value\n* Governance rights\n* Membership & access\n\nShould all three of these roles be represented by a single token? Which of them are a better match for fungible and non-fungible tokens?\n\n**Economic value** is the simplest to reason about. While NFTs can store tremendous economic value, they are inherently illiquid. Barter economies based on non-fungible assets inevitably get replaced by much more liquid economies denominated in a common fungible token. You don‚Äôt trade a house (illiquid, non-fungible), you sell it in your local currency (liquid, fungible) before buying a different one. Fungible tokens used by communities as a medium of exchange for goods and services represents an[ incredible opportunity to build new economies](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1429585831899983876).\n\n**Governance rights** face similar challenges with both fungible and non-fungible tokens: ownership naturally tends to have a power-law distribution so the question becomes: what do you do about whales? This[ recent essay by Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) paints a clear picture for why this will become an increasingly problematic issue for DAOs, both in terms of incentive misalignment and vulnerability to attacks.\n\nThere are essentially three ways to deal with the whale problem:\n\n1. *Accept them*: treat the[ skin-in-the-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase)) of asset ownership as a feature instead of a bug\n2. *Minimize them*: use[ quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) to reduce their power in votes\n3. *Eliminate them*: implement some sort of[ proof-of-humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) mechanism to limit people to one-person-one-vote\n\nIf you go down the ‚Äúaccept‚Äù or ‚Äúminimize‚Äù routes, fungible tokens are better suited for governance. If you want to implement tighter controls to minimize or eliminate whales, non-fungible tokens (particularly with sybil-resistant proof-of-humanity) can be better.\n\n**Membership & access** can be managed with fungible and non-fungible assets, or any combination of them. Ultimately though, access becomes increasingly non-fungible or loses meaning. To take an extreme example, if a token is infinitely divisible and any quantity grants you access, a single token can grant access to everyone in the world. To get around this, ERC-20 gated communities like FWB have a minimum required number of tokens you have to hold.\n\nIn addition to being non-fungible by definition, NFTs have several other advantages for access and membership. PFP projects have demonstrated the advantages of an internal and external social signaling layers. Setting your profile picture to an NFT publicly shows your community affiliation and advertises the community to the world. The traits or rarity of your NFT may affiliate you with a sub-tribe of the community. Art with a greater sense of direct ownership can support complex social dynamics. As smart contracts, they also have the technical advantage of being programmed with more than just a numeric and/or social value.\n\nSo, what types of tokens should be used for which community purposes? As with most things in life, the answer is: it‚Äôs complicated! Each DAO needs to evaluate what type of community they are trying to build and determine the right combination of assets for economics, governance, and membership. But, generally speaking, we think it makes more sense for economies to operate on fungible tokens and access to operate on non-fungible tokens:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b1f1b3e8-d403-49ae-9cf2-897831035294.png?height=794&width=1564)\n\n### Printing money ü§ù Printing passports\n\nThis model isn‚Äôt novel‚Äîit‚Äôs how most countries already work. The two most important pieces of paper governments produce are money and passports. Money is the economic medium of exchange, passports represent rights of access and citizenship. Governance, in practice, ends up being dependent on both.\n\nCabin DAO currently operates a token-gated community accessed with $CABIN tokens. While $CABIN is a great internal medium of exchange, we want to explore membership, governance, and access privileges through non-fungible passport NFTs.\n\nIn the metaverse, [nobody knows you‚Äôre a dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog).

Some, like FWB, use a fungible social token to gate community access. Many emerging PFP-based communities like BAYC use NFTs as the primary community gating mechanism. Whether fungible or non-fungible, social tokens in DAOs usually represent three different but overlapping roles:\n\n* Economic value\n* Governance rights\n* Membership & access\n\nShould all three of these roles be represented by a single token? Which of them are a better match for fungible and non-fungible tokens?\n\n**Economic value** is the simplest to reason about. While NFTs can store tremendous economic value, they are inherently illiquid. Barter economies based on non-fungible assets inevitably get replaced by much more liquid economies denominated in a common fungible token. You don‚Äôt trade a house (illiquid, non-fungible), you sell it in your local currency (liquid, fungible) before buying a different one. Fungible tokens used by communities as a medium of exchange for goods and services represents an[ incredible opportunity to build new economies](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1429585831899983876).\n\n**Governance rights** face similar challenges with both fungible and non-fungible tokens: ownership naturally tends to have a power-law distribution so the question becomes: what do you do about whales? This[ recent essay by Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) paints a clear picture for why this will become an increasingly problematic issue for DAOs, both in terms of incentive misalignment and vulnerability to attacks.\n\nThere are essentially three ways to deal with the whale problem:\n\n1. *Accept them*: treat the[ skin-in-the-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase)) of asset ownership as a feature instead of a bug\n2. *Minimize them*: use[ quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) to reduce their power in votes\n3. *Eliminate them*: implement some sort of[ proof-of-humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) mechanism to limit people to one-person-one-vote\n\nIf you go down the ‚Äúaccept‚Äù or ‚Äúminimize‚Äù routes, fungible tokens are better suited for governance. If you want to implement tighter controls to minimize or eliminate whales, non-fungible tokens (particularly with sybil-resistant proof-of-humanity) can be better.\n\n**Membership & access** can be managed with fungible and non-fungible assets, or any combination of them. Ultimately though, access becomes increasingly non-fungible or loses meaning. To take an extreme example, if a token is infinitely divisible and any quantity grants you access, a single token can grant access to everyone in the world. To get around this, ERC-20 gated communities like FWB have a minimum required number of tokens you have to hold.\n\nIn addition to being non-fungible by definition, NFTs have several other advantages for access and membership. PFP projects have demonstrated the advantages of an internal and external social signaling layers. Setting your profile picture to an NFT publicly shows your community affiliation and advertises the community to the world. The traits or rarity of your NFT may affiliate you with a sub-tribe of the community. Art with a greater sense of direct ownership can support complex social dynamics. As smart contracts, they also have the technical advantage of being programmed with more than just a numeric and/or social value.\n\nSo, what types of tokens should be used for which community purposes? As with most things in life, the answer is: it‚Äôs complicated! Each DAO needs to evaluate what type of community they are trying to build and determine the right combination of assets for economics, governance, and membership. But, generally speaking, we think it makes more sense for economies to operate on fungible tokens and access to operate on non-fungible tokens:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a6fea35-5a25-44ff-a47b-9e61ecd86f4f.png?height=270&width=1746)\n\n### Printing money ü§ù Printing passports\n\nThis model isn‚Äôt novel‚Äîit‚Äôs how most countries already work.

At Forefront we are developing the port of entry, a digital city unto itself.\n\nAs we collaboratively shape these new organizations, we need to revisit old approaches to work and membership. At the same time, we must continue to ensure community members can contribute reliably to the collective vision.\n\nIt‚Äôs tempting to lean on traditional central planning practices as the pressure to grow and scale increases. However, our constant state of flux means we need new operating models that can respond quickly and effectively to rapid ecosystem changes.\n\nHeading into Season 2 of Forefront, we are introducing the idea of digital ‚Äúlocality‚Äù to work. We are calling this Contribution Zones. Like city zoning, each zone will help members better understand where they should focus their attention and invest their time.\n\n![How will we zone digital cities?

And, as a result of these rhythms, we now are seeing some patterns emerging.\n\nIt‚Äôs our hope that by clarifying our internal language we can stimulate member engagement and make the contribution paths clearer to members.\n\nAlthough the community members (ourselves included) aren‚Äôt really assigned ‚Äújobs‚Äù, members seem to be flowing through ***zones*** based on energy level, internal work demand, personal capabilities, and preferences.\n\nWe‚Äôve identified three main ***Contribution Zones*** so far: Casual, Core, & Staff.\n\n![Contribution Zones at Forefront](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/60c2de9e-219f-4596-993f-6bbae66f5ed0.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n> **(1) CASUAL:** *Signaling, passive activity, varied financial investment.*\n>\n> Casual contributors can participate very flexibly on an ad-hoc basis. They're invested in DAO success and complete available tasks (bounties) when they desire.\n\n> **(2) CORE:** *Production, moderate activity, moderate financial investment.*\n>\n> Core Contributors are responsible for getting stuff done within their respective domain. They push forward the agenda, create bounty opportunities, and engage other stakeholders throughout the process.\n\n> **(3) STAFF:** *Stewardship, high activity, high financial investment.*\n>\n> Staff members are responsible for enacting the community voice and making high-level decisions around product and vision. In other words, making sure the DAO is pointed in the right direction.\n\nThese zones shift the operational focus from a central process of ‚Äúdistinct jobs and activities‚Äù to a member-led process based on ‚Äúcommitment and investment level.‚Äù\n\nAcross the zones we are also seeing specific role categories emerging.\n\nUnlike roles in traditional organizations, these are based on commitment levels and activity types (long-term program steward vs. short-term contractor) - not knowledge specialization (Sales vs. Engineering).\n\n![Member Roles at Forefront](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64ab60e9-9737-450c-b62e-1a9e7d4e4559.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n> **(1) TOKEN HOLDER:** Member has a financial stake in the DAO and may participate in governance. Usually does not contribute to ongoing operations, projects or bounties.\n\n> **(2) BOUNTY HUNTER:** Member may not be involved in daily DAO operations or planning, but actively seeks and completes interesting bounties.\n\n> **(3) CORE CONTRIBUTOR:** Member actively attends DAO meetings, consistently works on larger DAO priorities, and potentially leads projects with other DAO members.\n\n> **(4) STAFF MEMBER:** Member is responsible for the survival and vision of the DAO, treasury management, and other high-level priorities such as Seasonal community guidance.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note: Each of these zones and roles is not mutually exclusive, and do not imply ‚Äúinner rings‚Äù. Each member is encouraged to flow between roles to find harmony with the way that they contribute to the DAO:\n\n* Someone might act as a Staff Member for the whole organization, a Core Contributor for the Writer‚Äôs guild this week, and then pursue some bounties in the Growth Guild today.\n* A Token Holder may be a Casually involved and yet have great influence and authority among the community based on their reputation across multiple DAOs.\n\nThat being said, there is an expectation that members with higher commitment levels contribute for longer time-horizons: Casual members are expected to participate in important, but ad-hoc, governance decisions, while Staff members are expected to contribute steadily throughout multiple Seasons.\n\n![Forefront: The port of entry to web3 digital cities](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5da45d7b-305f-4bf0-bf2d-cefca4c7f4cd.jpeg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n\n---\n\n## Evolutions\n\nAs you might have noticed, Forefront did not formally design these zones or roles ‚Äì they‚Äôve developed organically.\n\nForefront will undoubtedly change in both language and structure over time. It‚Äôs inevitable that new contribution zones and commitment levels will emerge. By listening instead of enforcing we can develop new operating models for our new technology foundation.\n\n![How To: Gathering Contribution Zone Signals](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f398e1b6-818b-48a8-b98b-a5817e9cd470.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nWe encourage all DAOs to nurture a space for experimentation so that the right operating model emerges for ***your*** DAO.  Let‚Äôs watch our interactions with curiosity, and listen to the **Contribution Zone Signals** that appear.\n\nThen, we can design new cities to take advantage of the organic structures that are in harmony with our ecosystem.\n\n\n***\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, be sure to leave a tip.

Some, like FWB, use a fungible social token to gate community access. Many emerging PFP-based communities like BAYC use NFTs as the primary community gating mechanism. Whether fungible or non-fungible, social tokens in DAOs usually represent three different but overlapping roles:\n\n* Economic value\n* Governance rights\n* Membership & access\n\nShould all three of these roles be represented by a single token? Which of them are a better match for fungible and non-fungible tokens?\n\n**Economic value** is the simplest to reason about. While NFTs can store tremendous economic value, they are inherently illiquid. Barter economies based on non-fungible assets inevitably get replaced by much more liquid economies denominated in a common fungible token. You don‚Äôt trade a house (illiquid, non-fungible), you sell it in your local currency (liquid, fungible) before buying a different one. Fungible tokens used by communities as a medium of exchange for goods and services represents an[ incredible opportunity to build new economies](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1429585831899983876).\n\n**Governance rights** face similar challenges with both fungible and non-fungible tokens: ownership naturally tends to have a power-law distribution so the question becomes: what do you do about whales? This[ recent essay by Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) paints a clear picture for why this will become an increasingly problematic issue for DAOs, both in terms of incentive misalignment and vulnerability to attacks.\n\nThere are essentially three ways to deal with the whale problem:\n\n1. *Accept them*: treat the[ skin-in-the-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase)) of asset ownership as a feature instead of a bug\n2. *Minimize them*: use[ quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) to reduce their power in votes\n3. *Eliminate them*: implement some sort of[ proof-of-humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) mechanism to limit people to one-person-one-vote\n\nIf you go down the ‚Äúaccept‚Äù or ‚Äúminimize‚Äù routes, fungible tokens are better suited for governance. If you want to implement tighter controls to minimize or eliminate whales, non-fungible tokens (particularly with sybil-resistant proof-of-humanity) can be better.\n\n**Membership & access** can be managed with fungible and non-fungible assets, or any combination of them. Ultimately though, access becomes increasingly non-fungible or loses meaning. To take an extreme example, if a token is infinitely divisible and any quantity grants you access, a single token can grant access to everyone in the world. To get around this, ERC-20 gated communities like FWB have a minimum required number of tokens you have to hold.\n\nIn addition to being non-fungible by definition, NFTs have several other advantages for access and membership. PFP projects have demonstrated the advantages of an internal and external social signaling layers. Setting your profile picture to an NFT publicly shows your community affiliation and advertises the community to the world. The traits or rarity of your NFT may affiliate you with a sub-tribe of the community. Art with a greater sense of direct ownership can support complex social dynamics. As smart contracts, they also have the technical advantage of being programmed with more than just a numeric and/or social value.\n\nSo, what types of tokens should be used for which community purposes? As with most things in life, the answer is: it‚Äôs complicated! Each DAO needs to evaluate what type of community they are trying to build and determine the right combination of assets for economics, governance, and membership. But, generally speaking, we think it makes more sense for economies to operate on fungible tokens and access to operate on non-fungible tokens:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b1f1b3e8-d403-49ae-9cf2-897831035294.png?height=794&width=1564)\n\n### Printing money ü§ù Printing passports\n\nThis model isn‚Äôt novel‚Äîit‚Äôs how most countries already work. The two most important pieces of paper governments produce are money and passports. Money is the economic medium of exchange, passports represent rights of access and citizenship. Governance, in practice, ends up being dependent on both.\n\nCabin DAO currently operates a token-gated community accessed with $CABIN tokens. While $CABIN is a great internal medium of exchange, we want to explore membership, governance, and access privileges through non-fungible passport NFTs.\n\nIn the metaverse, [nobody knows you‚Äôre a dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog). But in reality, it‚Äôs helpful to have some basic systems of trust to protect the safety of strangers sharing a space. As a DAO operating a physical space, we are interested in exploring ways of granting verified access to that space using web3 technologies. It‚Äôs also fun to LARP as a nation state.\n\nHere are some explorations of passports our artist guild has been working on:\n\n![designs by the magnificent @mel_being](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/59c501aa-a476-4974-8880-eca9a96a5deb.png?height=654&width=2598)\n\n### Where passports could go next\n\nNFT Passports offer a great way to combine aspects of membership, access, and identity verification. At the moment, the primary use-case for NFT smart contracts is as a transferable pointer to a jpeg on IPFS. But the possibilities of NFT smart contracts go way beyond that.\n\nNFTs can hold roles, durations, access levels, and other editable data. For example, when someone is voted into a Cabin DAO residency cohort, we could allow them to mint a passport with the role of ‚ÄúResident‚Äù, active for the duration of the Cohort. This passport could provide permissions both online and IRL.\n\nBeyond tying roles and permissions to a member‚Äôs passport, we would also like to explore verifying ownership in-person. We imagine we could do this by adding a QR code to the passport. When scanned, we can send the owner a transaction that they have to sign, therefore verifying ownership in the metaverse and the meat space.\n\nWe would also like to add the ability for passport holders to set a passport image. Rather than a headshot, you could set it to your favorite PFP or another NFT of your choice. We think there‚Äôs value in being able to show membership in a standard format (like a passport) while being able to show individuality through customization.\n\nWe will continue to explore new use-cases for NFT passports and would love to hear from other DAOs interested in their own pseudo-state LARPs!

{"id": "oFX7Z9W5ZGTQkhNUVUJFc5JftMNFH2TJ0Enl8Llb9XM", "title": "What is Fractional?", "body": "Fractional is a decentralized protocol where NFT owners can mint tokenized fractional ownership of their NFTs. These tokens then function as normal ERC20 tokens which have governance over the NFT that they own.\n\n## Fractional NFT Ownership\n\nThrough Fractional, it will become easy to **buy and own a percentage of an NFT**. This allows users who have been previously priced out of certain NFTs or artists (such as Beeple) to be able to buy a piece of their work. Alongside this, fractionalizing an NFT allows for the NFT‚Äôs original curator to be able to see some liquidity from their asset without selling the entire piece.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*el9UtMDOMzycF6KvqCZkAA.png)\n\n## NFT Baskets\n\nAlongside individual NFTs, users will be able to **fractionalize entire collections of NFTs** and release them under collection-specific fractional ownership tokens (referred to as fractions). This will allow users to enjoy learning and participating in NFT ownership through the industry knowledge of accomplished NFT collectors while being able to collect fractions from their curated vaults.\n\n## Fractionalization Incentives\n\nThere are several reasons why an NFT owner might want to fractionalize their asset.\n\n1. **Price Discovery**: The asset is extremely valuable and they want help finding price discovery, fractionalizing the item, and selling 20% on the market can be a valuable tool to help understand how the market values the NFT.\n2. **Liquidity**: Owners have significantly better exit liquidity than if they owned the NFT themselves. This can be achieved through on-chain exchanges such as Sushiswap and Uniswap.\n3. **Curator Fees**: NFT owners who lock up their assets will receive curator fees. These fees are set by the NFT owner, but guided by governance to disallow inordinately high fees. Curator fees are similar to an asset under management fee. Annually, a curator will earn a percentage of the total fraction supply. This unlocks properties for their NFT.\n\n## Fractional Ownership Perks\n\nOnce a user owns fractions of an NFT, they have the right to vote on the **reserve price** of the asset. This reserve price is the price in ETH required to be bid by a third party to initiate an auction for the entire NFT. A new fractional ownership token collector‚Äôs reserve price defaults to the current reserve price, but can be changed at any time. At the completion of a successful auction, all fraction owners will be able to cash in their fractions for ETH on a pro-rata basis. At any point, fractions are normal functioning ERC20 tokens and can be used as such.\n\n## How It Works\n\nAs an NFT owner, when you come to the Fractional platform you will be able to mint an **NFT Vault**. This vault will take custody of your NFT and in exchange, it will give you 100% of the fractional ownership tokens. At this point, the NFT owner can do whatever they please with the fractions they have. For example, they can sell them in a Dutch auction, add liquidity to Sushiswap or just give them to friends. Fraction owners maintain collective ownership on the locked-up NFT. In the instance a buyer emerges, they can send ETH equal to or greater to the reserve price of the asset. This initiates an auction. Upon completion, the auction winner will receive the NFT, and fraction owners will be able to claim the ETH paid.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*yDr_OEo0vcMt_3WCfHrxlw.png)\n\n## **Fractional Governance**\n\nThe forthcoming governance token for the Fractional platform will be charged with keeping fractional ownership NFT buyers safe and making sure the platform continues to perform well. Governance will also receive a small AUM fee for the work that is done to keep fraction owners happy.\n\n## Get Involved\n\nWe are actively looking for community members to help structure and build out the Fractional space. There are so many interesting distribution, buyout, and governance possibilities to be built.\n\nJoin us on:\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/fractional](https://discord.com/invite/fractional)\n\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/fractional_art>\n\n***Disclaimer:*** *The Fractional Token Company, its officers, team, and community representatives are not registered investment advisors.

This[ recent essay by Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) paints a clear picture for why this will become an increasingly problematic issue for DAOs, both in terms of incentive misalignment and vulnerability to attacks.\n\nThere are essentially three ways to deal with the whale problem:\n\n1. *Accept them*: treat the[ skin-in-the-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase)) of asset ownership as a feature instead of a bug\n2. *Minimize them*: use[ quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) to reduce their power in votes\n3. *Eliminate them*: implement some sort of[ proof-of-humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) mechanism to limit people to one-person-one-vote\n\nIf you go down the ‚Äúaccept‚Äù or ‚Äúminimize‚Äù routes, fungible tokens are better suited for governance. If you want to implement tighter controls to minimize or eliminate whales, non-fungible tokens (particularly with sybil-resistant proof-of-humanity) can be better.\n\n**Membership & access** can be managed with fungible and non-fungible assets, or any combination of them. Ultimately though, access becomes increasingly non-fungible or loses meaning. To take an extreme example, if a token is infinitely divisible and any quantity grants you access, a single token can grant access to everyone in the world. To get around this, ERC-20 gated communities like FWB have a minimum required number of tokens you have to hold.\n\nIn addition to being non-fungible by definition, NFTs have several other advantages for access and membership. PFP projects have demonstrated the advantages of an internal and external social signaling layers. Setting your profile picture to an NFT publicly shows your community affiliation and advertises the community to the world. The traits or rarity of your NFT may affiliate you with a sub-tribe of the community. Art with a greater sense of direct ownership can support complex social dynamics. As smart contracts, they also have the technical advantage of being programmed with more than just a numeric and/or social value.\n\nSo, what types of tokens should be used for which community purposes? As with most things in life, the answer is: it‚Äôs complicated! Each DAO needs to evaluate what type of community they are trying to build and determine the right combination of assets for economics, governance, and membership. But, generally speaking, we think it makes more sense for economies to operate on fungible tokens and access to operate on non-fungible tokens:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b1f1b3e8-d403-49ae-9cf2-897831035294.png?height=794&width=1564)\n\n### Printing money ü§ù Printing passports\n\nThis model isn‚Äôt novel‚Äîit‚Äôs how most countries already work. The two most important pieces of paper governments produce are money and passports. Money is the economic medium of exchange, passports represent rights of access and citizenship. Governance, in practice, ends up being dependent on both.\n\nCabin DAO currently operates a token-gated community accessed with $CABIN tokens. While $CABIN is a great internal medium of exchange, we want to explore membership, governance, and access privileges through non-fungible passport NFTs.\n\nIn the metaverse, [nobody knows you‚Äôre a dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog). But in reality, it‚Äôs helpful to have some basic systems of trust to protect the safety of strangers sharing a space. As a DAO operating a physical space, we are interested in exploring ways of granting verified access to that space using web3 technologies. It‚Äôs also fun to LARP as a nation state.\n\nHere are some explorations of passports our artist guild has been working on:\n\n![designs by the magnificent @mel_being](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/59c501aa-a476-4974-8880-eca9a96a5deb.png?height=654&width=2598)\n\n### Where passports could go next\n\nNFT Passports offer a great way to combine aspects of membership, access, and identity verification. At the moment, the primary use-case for NFT smart contracts is as a transferable pointer to a jpeg on IPFS. But the possibilities of NFT smart contracts go way beyond that.\n\nNFTs can hold roles, durations, access levels, and other editable data. For example, when someone is voted into a Cabin DAO residency cohort, we could allow them to mint a passport with the role of ‚ÄúResident‚Äù, active for the duration of the Cohort. This passport could provide permissions both online and IRL.\n\nBeyond tying roles and permissions to a member‚Äôs passport, we would also like to explore verifying ownership in-person. We imagine we could do this by adding a QR code to the passport. When scanned, we can send the owner a transaction that they have to sign, therefore verifying ownership in the metaverse and the meat space.\n\nWe would also like to add the ability for passport holders to set a passport image. Rather than a headshot, you could set it to your favorite PFP or another NFT of your choice. We think there‚Äôs value in being able to show membership in a standard format (like a passport) while being able to show individuality through customization.\n\nWe will continue to explore new use-cases for NFT passports and would love to hear from other DAOs interested in their own pseudo-state LARPs!

At Forefront we are developing the port of entry, a digital city unto itself.\n\nAs we collaboratively shape these new organizations, we need to revisit old approaches to work and membership. At the same time, we must continue to ensure community members can contribute reliably to the collective vision.\n\nIt‚Äôs tempting to lean on traditional central planning practices as the pressure to grow and scale increases. However, our constant state of flux means we need new operating models that can respond quickly and effectively to rapid ecosystem changes.\n\nHeading into Season 2 of Forefront, we are introducing the idea of digital ‚Äúlocality‚Äù to work. We are calling this Contribution Zones. Like city zoning, each zone will help members better understand where they should focus their attention and invest their time.\n\n![How will we zone digital cities?

And, as a result of these rhythms, we now are seeing some patterns emerging.\n\nIt‚Äôs our hope that by clarifying our internal language we can stimulate member engagement and make the contribution paths clearer to members.\n\nAlthough the community members (ourselves included) aren‚Äôt really assigned ‚Äújobs‚Äù, members seem to be flowing through ***zones*** based on energy level, internal work demand, personal capabilities, and preferences.\n\nWe‚Äôve identified three main ***Contribution Zones*** so far: Casual, Core, & Staff.\n\n![Contribution Zones at Forefront](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/60c2de9e-219f-4596-993f-6bbae66f5ed0.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n> **(1) CASUAL:** *Signaling, passive activity, varied financial investment.*\n>\n> Casual contributors can participate very flexibly on an ad-hoc basis. They're invested in DAO success and complete available tasks (bounties) when they desire.\n\n> **(2) CORE:** *Production, moderate activity, moderate financial investment.*\n>\n> Core Contributors are responsible for getting stuff done within their respective domain. They push forward the agenda, create bounty opportunities, and engage other stakeholders throughout the process.\n\n> **(3) STAFF:** *Stewardship, high activity, high financial investment.*\n>\n> Staff members are responsible for enacting the community voice and making high-level decisions around product and vision. In other words, making sure the DAO is pointed in the right direction.\n\nThese zones shift the operational focus from a central process of ‚Äúdistinct jobs and activities‚Äù to a member-led process based on ‚Äúcommitment and investment level.‚Äù\n\nAcross the zones we are also seeing specific role categories emerging.\n\nUnlike roles in traditional organizations, these are based on commitment levels and activity types (long-term program steward vs. short-term contractor) - not knowledge specialization (Sales vs. Engineering).\n\n![Member Roles at Forefront](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64ab60e9-9737-450c-b62e-1a9e7d4e4559.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n> **(1) TOKEN HOLDER:** Member has a financial stake in the DAO and may participate in governance. Usually does not contribute to ongoing operations, projects or bounties.\n\n> **(2) BOUNTY HUNTER:** Member may not be involved in daily DAO operations or planning, but actively seeks and completes interesting bounties.\n\n> **(3) CORE CONTRIBUTOR:** Member actively attends DAO meetings, consistently works on larger DAO priorities, and potentially leads projects with other DAO members.\n\n> **(4) STAFF MEMBER:** Member is responsible for the survival and vision of the DAO, treasury management, and other high-level priorities such as Seasonal community guidance.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note: Each of these zones and roles is not mutually exclusive, and do not imply ‚Äúinner rings‚Äù. Each member is encouraged to flow between roles to find harmony with the way that they contribute to the DAO:\n\n* Someone might act as a Staff Member for the whole organization, a Core Contributor for the Writer‚Äôs guild this week, and then pursue some bounties in the Growth Guild today.\n* A Token Holder may be a Casually involved and yet have great influence and authority among the community based on their reputation across multiple DAOs.\n\nThat being said, there is an expectation that members with higher commitment levels contribute for longer time-horizons: Casual members are expected to participate in important, but ad-hoc, governance decisions, while Staff members are expected to contribute steadily throughout multiple Seasons.\n\n![Forefront: The port of entry to web3 digital cities](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5da45d7b-305f-4bf0-bf2d-cefca4c7f4cd.jpeg?height=720&width=1280)\n\n\n---\n\n## Evolutions\n\nAs you might have noticed, Forefront did not formally design these zones or roles ‚Äì they‚Äôve developed organically.\n\nForefront will undoubtedly change in both language and structure over time. It‚Äôs inevitable that new contribution zones and commitment levels will emerge. By listening instead of enforcing we can develop new operating models for our new technology foundation.\n\n![How To: Gathering Contribution Zone Signals](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f398e1b6-818b-48a8-b98b-a5817e9cd470.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nWe encourage all DAOs to nurture a space for experimentation so that the right operating model emerges for ***your*** DAO.  Let‚Äôs watch our interactions with curiosity, and listen to the **Contribution Zone Signals** that appear.\n\nThen, we can design new cities to take advantage of the organic structures that are in harmony with our ecosystem.\n\n\n***\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, be sure to leave a tip.

The reserve price is set by the calculated weighted average of all ownership token owner votes.\n\nIf token owners who collectively own less than 50% of the total fraction supply are the only ones who have voted (or set a reserve price of 0), a reserve price will not be set and a buyout will not be possible. Additionally, token owners cannot set a reserve price greater or less than 5x the current weighted average.\n\nThe reserve price can only change by voting and is not impacted by the implied valuation of the vault based on the token supply in liquidity pools.\n\n***Examples:***\n\n* *If you own 100% of the ownership tokens and set the reserve price to 100 ETH, the reserve price will be 100 ETH. However, if you own 75% of the tokens and someone who owns the other 25% votes on a reserve price of 50 ETH instead, the reserve price will instead be 87.5 ETH.*\n* *If you only own 49% of the token supply and vote on a reserve price, but no one else who owns the remaining 51% of tokens has voted on a reserve price, there will be no reserve price set for the vault.*\n\n## Can Anyone Vote on the Reserve Price?\n\nTechnically yes, anyone can vote but if they don‚Äôt have any tokens then their vote weight is 0 and they‚Äôve wasted their own gas on a null vote.\n\n## What If I Own Fractions But Don‚Äôt Vote on the Reserve Price?\n\nIf enough people who collectively own 50% or more of the fraction supply do not vote, a buyout or auction will not be possible for that vault.\n\nIf you want a collector to have the chance to re-unify and completely claim the NFT you own a fraction of through a winning bid, you should vote on the reserve price.\n\n## How Do I Vote on the Reserve Price?\n\nYou can vote on the reserve price through the Fractional.art GUI or by directly interacting with the vault‚Äôs smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTo do this on fractional.art, navigate to the vault page of the respective fractional collection you‚Äôd like to vote a reserve price for [(sample)](https://fractional.art/vaults/0x9Ff4f50efD40C915f7d1476Bf36aCB8908e0C56D) and then follow these steps:\n\n1\\.

Similarly, initiate an auction in hopes no one else outbids you. If/when you win the auction, the NFT is transferred to your wallet. If a different wallet outbids you and you are priced out, at least you‚Äôll be able to trade in your 99.9% supply of the fractional ownership tokens and claim the ETH that was used to win the auction.\n\nComments, questions, or feedback?

Between the introduction of the **[Feisty Doge vault](https://fractional.art/vaults/0xDFDb7f72c1F195C5951a234e8DB9806EB0635346)** ($NFD) and the numerous buyouts of BEAUTIFUL Art Blocks Curated pieces, we‚Äôve been blown away each and every day. Whether it‚Äôs the growth of the Fractional Protocol, hitting our Twitter drinking age (21k followers, tho idk about you, we‚Äôre **[feeling 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgFeZr5ptV8)**), or our 3575+ discord members, one thing is certain, there is plenty of high energy to go around and CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION!!\n\nTo commemorate this amazing first month, we‚Äôve been working behind the scenes with one of our favorite creators, **[Pop Wonder](https://twitter.com/popwondernft?lang=en)**, to produce two stunning POAPs as badges for all you early adopters and contributors (we‚Äôve been noticing YOU) that are here with us at the beginning of our journey!\n\nBut before we introduce the POAPs, here‚Äôs a quick recap of the week: \\n \n\n## Hyped Happenings\n\nWe have seen our highest adoption volume week, thanks to the release of the Feisty Doge vault (lavender-colored bars below.) [Cryptopathic](https://twitter.com/Cryptopathic) created this vault and is building a community around the Feisty Doge meme. [Check out this podcast episode with Luke Martin and Path if you‚Äôd like to hear more about what Path‚Äôs doing with NFD.](https://twitter.com/Cryptopathic/status/1429962893181792259?s=20)\n\n![Collecting volume thanks to a¬†dashboard¬†created by¬†@andrewhong5297](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5a172aaa-2cd5-4380-ab63-400b936e4257.png?height=358&width=681)\n\nThis week, we‚Äôve also seen our largest fractional buyout ever. [Art Blocks Curated Series 3 sold for 358 ETH (‚âà$1,111,250.69) ](https://fractional.art/vaults/0x1823936E18f39E594463073C74E1565bDcfeEA65)The Fidenza in this vault has the Cool color palette which is quite rare. Only 12/999 Fidenzas [(are we saying that right?)](https://twitter.com/VonMises14/status/1429067241044205574) have this palette, and there was quite a bidding war.\n\n![Fidenza #871 from the Art Blocks Curated Series 3 Vault\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec089451-7c30-4213-8f15-6db5cbe72c7f.png?height=1000&width=833)\n\nAnd now, the fun stuff:\n\n## Pop Wonder POAPs\n\nWe are thrilled to announce that [Pop Wonder](https://twitter.com/PopWonderNFT) worked with us to create two incredible POAPs to celebrate our launch month and give back to the community. *[What‚Äôs a POAP you ask? Click here to learn.](https://poap.xyz/)*\n\nThe first of the POAPs is for **Early Adopters**, which we defined as those who own any fraction in their wallet by the end of our launch month. Also, if you vaulted an NFT or interacted with our smart contracts in almost any way, you will be eligible for this Early Adopters POAP!\n\nClaim your POAP here! <https://poap.delivery/fractionalearlyadopters>\n\n![Fractional Early Adopters POAP by Pop Wonder](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6ERAnuOOYlNn8IMTTYGQjQ.png)\n\nThe second of our POAPs is a special one for **Early Contributors**. We have been keeping a list (and checking it twice) which includes our influential vault curators plus active and helpful community members, and early individuals who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to help Fractional succeed. Without our Early Contributors, we wouldn‚Äôt be where we are today. üôå We will be reaching out to our early contributors individually for the next steps to claim their extra special POAP for all their hard work!\n\n![Fractional Early Contributors POAP by Pop Wonder](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ymReZGSFd8jt8gBqJrFq8g.png)\n\n## Two Last Things‚Ä¶ In Case You Missed Them:\n\n* [Andy and DeeZe talked to Ryan and David from the Bankless team about the absolute state of things in the NFT space](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bankless/id1499409058?i=1000533085099)\n* [DeeZe opened up to Luke Martin about his backstory, NFTs, Fractional, and what he thinks will happen as this NFT mania rages on](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/nft-bull-market-investment-strategy-outlook-w-deezefi/id1350247761?i=1000532620350)\n\nThat‚Äôs all for now, onward to September!\n\n### Join our Discord and follow us on Twitter!\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/fractional](https://discord.com/invite/fractional)\n\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/fractional_art>\n\n***Disclaimer:*** *The Fractional Token Company, its officers, team, and community representatives are not registered investment advisors.

We‚Äôve seen some pretty incredible adoption and engagement from this new community: there have already been over 200 unique curators and 2,500 unique owners of fractions who have come up with so many cool things we couldn‚Äôt have anticipated ourselves. A few to highlight:\n\n* ‚ô¶ [DEAD](https://fractional.art/vaults/0x0C7060BF06a78AAAAB3fac76941318A52a3F4613): Resulting from a PartyBid-based fractionalization which raised over 1200 ETH(!!!) in under 24 hours to win a zombie crypto punk auction. These NFT fractions have one of the widest distributions on the site and the zombie is one of the highest valued NFTs locked in Fractional.\n* ‚ô¶[ HOODIE](https://fractional.art/vaults/0xdffA3a7f5B40789C7A437DbE7B31b47F9B08FE75): A hoodie punk fractionalized by our very own Deeze, has grown a crazy community around it. ‚ÄúHoodie-gang‚Äù has set up its own channel in our discord where only HOODIE owners can hang and chat. We love seeing the fun micro-communities being formed around fractions.\n* ‚ô¶ [TWIN](https://fractional.art/vaults/0x82b2925E54AdE5e10F5E6be31f604e5154701aFa): Anonymoux, an NFT collector with a seriously impressive collection, worked with Justin Aversano to fractionalize Twin Flames #49 which was originally won in its entirety at the Sotheby‚Äôs auction house. Based on the current implied valuation of the NFT, it is the highest valued photography NFT to date.\n* ‚ô¶ [ABC123](https://fractional.art/vaults/0x9Ff4f50efD40C915f7d1476Bf36aCB8908e0C56D): One of the first fractional NFTs during our initial launch is a basket of 31 NFTs containing one of each of the first 31 Art Blocks Curated NFTs. There is a ton of excitement from our users about collecting these given Art Blocks‚Äô explosive popularity which has left many people priced out sitting on the sidelines unable to buy full pieces, until now!\n\nThe last month has brought a major rise in activity through the protocol and over 700 NFTs have been fractionalized! As engagement and collecting continue to grow, we want to provide this new community of creators, collectors, and curators with as many new and exciting features as we can, as quickly as we can. To help, we recently completed a **$7.9M seed finance round led by Paradigm** and with participation from Robot Ventures, Delphi Digital, Variant Fund, Divergence Ventures, Flamingo DAO, Mechanism Capital, among other major ecosystem contributors. All these organizations are deeply embedded in crypto and share a worldview with us about where this community can go and how the protocol can evolve and grow over the long term.\n\nWe have a ton of work to do to keep pushing the boundaries of NFTs and collecting, and we need help! If you feel as inspired by what‚Äôs happening in NFTs as we do and want to get involved, we are hiring for a number of roles including smart contract developers, a product design lead, in-house counsel, and a business development lead.\n\nAlongside this, Fractional has been working closely with collectors, creators, brands, and DAOs who want to use fractionalization for all sorts of fun and exciting things. If this is something that interests you or your team, please reach out to team@fractional.art to start the conversation.\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/fractional](https://discord.com/invite/fractional)Twitter: <https://twitter.com/fractional_art>\n\n*EDIT: Adjusted the picture of this announcement to our logo in the header*\n\n*\\*For those who are just now hearing about Fractional for the first time, fractional.art provides a new way for the NFT community to mint fractions of their NFTs through the fractional protocol, a decentralized smart contract accessible to anyone on Ethereum.

{"id": "oKnncoy71lvNmzpy8vdoE9q4cM1yCJa3umUV0AuWGQQ", "title": "Facts: Interacting With The Fractional Protocol Doesn‚Äôt Rely on Fractional.art", "body": "## The three smart contracts which power the fractional experience are accessible to anyone with an internet connection!\n\nThe Fractional Protocol is deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, a decentralized blockchain network, and it is not held, hosted, or controlled by any centralized database or entity. For an overview of the concepts and properties of the protocol, you can review the **[Gitbook docs](https://docs.fractional.art/fractional/)**. You can even see a deep dive into the contracts themselves to dissect each function thanks to 0xkowloon **[here](https://0xkowloon.substack.com/p/dissecting-the-fractional-protocol?justPublished=true).**\n\nWhile fractional.art has popularized the existing protocol by building a gateway for members of the community to interact with the smart contract, anyone is free to interact with these contracts directly, or even build their own front-end GUI using the freely available fractional smart contracts below:\n\n* **Fractional Contract For Creating Vaults Which Contain a Single NFT:** [0x85Aa7f78BdB2DE8F3e0c0010d99AD5853fFcfC63](https://etherscan.io/address/0x85Aa7f78BdB2DE8F3e0c0010d99AD5853fFcfC63#writeContract)\n* **Fractional Contract For Creating Vaults Which Contain Multiple NFTs:** [0xde771104c0c44123d22d39bb716339cd0c3333a1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde771104c0c44123d22d39bb716339cd0c3333a1#writeContract)\n* **Fractional Contract For Vault Governance Settings:** [0xE0FC79183a22106229B84ECDd55cA017A07eddCa](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE0FC79183a22106229B84ECDd55cA017A07eddCa#writeContract)\n\nWhen an NFT is fractionalized, it is transferred from the curator‚Äôs wallet to a new smart contract (i.e. vault) that is created by the fractional contract based on the inputs set by the curator (see steps at the bottom of this article). Fractional.art has no control over the vaults that are created nor can fractional.art alter or modify the behavior and capabilities of these smart contracts.\n\n**So What You‚Äôre Telling Me Is‚Ä¶ I Can Still Create, Manage, or Interact With a Vault Even If Fractional.Art Disappears?**\n\nYes! For the purposes of this post, we‚Äôll be looking at how to create a vault through etherscan.io for those of you who are either hesitant to use the GUI we‚Äôve built, would like to build your own interface to interact with the protocol, or just want to learn more about smart contracts by getting your hands dirty.\n\n**This Sounds Complicated, Are you Sure?**\n\nPositive, take a look at the following steps:\n\n**Step 1)** Navigate to [etherscan.io](http://etherscan.io/) and copy+paste the \\*Fractional Contract For Creating Vaults Which Contain a Single NFT \\*from the list above into the search bar (or just click [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x85Aa7f78BdB2DE8F3e0c0010d99AD5853fFcfC63#writeContract) for convenience)\n\n**Step 2)** Select ‚ÄòContract‚Äô then ‚ÄòWrite Contract‚Äô\n\n**Step 3)** Connect your Web3 wallet (such as MetaMask) which contains your Ethereum (for gas fees) and the ERC-721 NFT you‚Äôd like to fractionalize\n\n![Steps 2 and 3 are pictured here\n](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*YV86qj76LEu8GwizJ2w80Q.png)\n\n![If you‚Äôve performed step 3 correctly, you should now see this button with your wallet address in \\[brackets\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/848/1\\*8s4paril_Vg9_dOJXZh7Sg.png)\n\n**Step 4)** Select ‚ÄòMint‚Äô to reveal a drop down of fields\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*29ITkjrkvJqWPV712_-8rQ.png)\n\n**Step 5)** Input the NFT contract address from your wallet of the NFT you‚Äôd like to fractionalize in the ‚Äòid‚Äô field, and define all the parameters for its vault. See below for a description of each parameter:\n\n* **name**: the full name of the ERC-20 token which will represent the fractional ownership of your locked up NFT\n* **symbol**: your desired symbol (e.g., ABC123) of the ERC-20 fractions\n* **token**: the ethereum contract address of the NFT which you are choosing to fractionalize\n* **id**: the unique identifier used for your ERC-721 NFT in its respective smart contract\n* **supply**: the desired total supply of the ERC-20 token (no limits)\n* **listPrice**: the initial reserve price at the start of ERC-20 fraction ownership (no limits) Learn more [here](https://medium.com/fractional-art/reserve-price-a-key-fractional-vault-property-to-understand-6dbaf476beb3).\n* **fee**: the curator fee (from which is paid to the owner of the fractional asset (enter a value between 0 and 0.1, any values greater than 0.1 will return a failed transaction)\n\n**Step 6)** Select **‚ÄòWrite‚Äô** then sign and approve your transaction through your wallet and viola! Your vault has been created and you should now possess 100% of the new fractional token supply in the wallet you connected in step 3.\n\n**Step 7)** Choose to do whatever you‚Äôd like with your newly minted ERC-20 fractions\n\nOnce your vault is created, you can write directly to the vault‚Äôs contract\n\nComments, questions, or feedback?

Sounds like a win-win.\n\n## What you will need for this Quest:\n\n* ETH to purchase the NFT and cover gas fees\n* MetaMask wallet (or another web3 wallet)\n\nThis guide assumes you understand how to use a MetaMask wallet. If not, you should watch [this video](https://youtu.be/Af_lQ1zUnoM), set up your MetaMask wallet, and add funds to your wallet before moving forward.\n\n## What is OpenSea?\n\n![OpenSea Homepage](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9757c79b-c225-46c0-9713-72db6ba91707.png?height=425&width=1251)\n\n[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) is a peer-to-peer marketplace for NFTs ‚Äì showcasing everything from digital collectibles and art to virtual land and utility tokens.\n\nThink of OpenSea as the eBay of NFTs, where you can bid on an NFT auction, mint and sell your own NFT, or explore the wild west of non-fungibles. OpenSea is where most NFT collectors go to discover and invest in almost any project.\n\n## How to Purchase an NFT on Opensea\n\n### Step 1: Choose your NFT on OpenSea.\n\nGo to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) and choose which NFT you want to buy. It‚Äôs smart to do some research on what NFT you want to buy beforehand, and perhaps we will write a more in-depth NFT investing guide in the future.\n\nFor the purposes of this tutorial, simply **choose an NFT on OpenSea that you love** and would be happy holding on to for the long term (>1 year).\n\n***Pro Tips****:* \n\n* *You may need to pay additional gas fees if it‚Äôs your first time purchasing an NFT on OpenSea.*\n* *Toggle the filter* `Buy Now` *to buy instantly and avoid bidding on an auction and (unless you find something you want to make an offer on).*\n\n### Step 2: Click ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlace Bid‚Äù\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5af8e641-1a61-463b-bb8a-ac476a4a2bbe.png?height=145&width=586)\n\nSome NFTs are on auction while others can be bought right away.

Set the gas fee, and confirm your NFT purchase.\n\n### Step 4: Wait for confirmation.\n\nNow you wait for the transaction to confirm! Depending how much gas you used, it could take 30 minutes or longer for the payment to confirm.\n\nOnce confirmed, your NFT will show up in your wallet and displayed on your OpenSea profile for the world to see.\n\n### That‚Äôs all you need for now!\n\nCongratulations on buying an NFT on OpenSea!\n\nPlease let me ([@JonahBaer](https://twitter.com/JonahBaer)) know if this tutorial was helpful or if you have any questions on Twitter or the RabbitHole Discord.", "timestamp": 1631298659, "digest": "SyS09V5gsjVlFy4R9J8cUKfZxSovK1tTCGOS85pglAo", "contributor": "0xF69EFCc2dECE59Fbc75B23aE75f51DD7Be3bb1E1"}
{"id": "fyRVgjFVi_WsKoHTDxHVwOZ8VlnFcqVYvTpNDpO6IPs", "title": "The tradeoffs of cross-chain communication", "body": "*Thanks to [Alex Obadia](https://twitter.com/ObadiaAlex) and [Vaibhav Chellani](https://twitter.com/vaibhavchellani) for the conversations that led to this piece and for editorial help!*\n\nIf there's one thing I've learned over the past couple of years, it's that one synchronous block-space will not be sufficient for all of the applications we'll eventually see on-chain.\n\nThis wasn't as obvious in 2018, when the possibilities weren't as fleshed out. Last year's DeFi summer and this year's NFT summer have cemented the fact that there's a *lot* of application design space to play with. And the rise of non-Ethereum [Layer](https://polygon.technology/) [1s](https://solana.com/) this year have further drilled in that block-space is in very high demand.\n\nGiven that we're likely to live in a multi-chain world and applications on different chains will want to communicate with one another, it's valuable to understand how the connective tissue between chains will work. I want to explore one angle of this in an abstract sense, without necessarily picking on a single project\n\nIn this post, I want to examine a specific tradeoff inherent in these systems. It's a tradeoff that's kinda obvious when you reflect on it.\n\nI'm also standing on the shoulders of giants in presenting it; it's spelled out in [excellent paper](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/sokcommunication-across-distributed-ledgers/) by Zamyatin et al. I aim to just put some more color behind the core statement of that paper.\n\nThe tradeoff, in the words of the paper's authors, is that cross-chain communication is impossible without either:\n\n1. a trusted third party (TTP)\n2. OR a synchrony assumption beyond asynchrony\n\nThe relationship between these is fundamental and quite intuitive, but requires digging through a little bit of jargon. I hope to make the intuition clear here.\n\n## Making sense of the theory\n\nLet's talk a bit about synchrony assumptions. They're a common framework for thinking about communication in distributed systems and are criminally not well-understood.\n\nThink of a distributed system as a message-passing protocol that needs to work in spite of failures or adversaries in the communication infrastructure. We can then define how bad those failures can get before the system stops working. This is exactly what these synchrony assumptions aim to do.\n\nA system that functions under the 'synchronous' assumption assumes that messages can only be delayed by the network/adversaries by some known fixed upper bound.\n\nA system that functions under the 'asynchronous' assumption, on the other hand, assumes that the network/adversaries can delay messages by *any* finite amount of time.\n\nThe latter is more robust. It says that a system is better with dealing with the uncertainties introduced by the environment. There are also 'middle ground' assumptions that are usually called 'partial synchrony', but that's not necessary to define here.\n\nHow does this relate to cross-chain communication? Well, the aforementioned paper shows that if you have a system that implements asynchronous cross-chain communication, you could use it to solve an older problem called ['fair exchange'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_fair_exchange_protocol). And we know from a [much older paper](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/\\~shmat/courses/cs395t_fall04/pagnia.pdf) that *asynchronous fair exchange is impossible without a trusted third party (TTP)*.\n\nTherefore, asynchronous cross-chain communication is impossible without a TTP. And we can only give up this requirement on a TTP by having a more stringent synchrony assumption on the system.\n\n## Theory -> reality\n\nThis has all been very theoretical so far. Let's talk about real systems.\n\nFrom the previous section, we know that to communicate a message between two chains, we either:\n\n1. can't assume a completely asynchronous system\n2. OR need a TTP\n\nWhat *really* are the tradeoffs here? It might be helpful to compare systems that require a TTP with those that require a stronger synchrony assumption.\n\nTTPs seem well understood. A TTP is just a 'lower security/decentralization' middleman that exists between the two chains. Cross-chain systems that rely on a validator set separate from the two chains they're bridging are an example of this.\n\nA stronger synchrony assumption manifests as something like retry logic or a timeout. Hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs) are an illustrative example. A few years ago, hash time-locked contracts were considered *the* important primitive for cross-chain communication. In HTLCs, the stronger synchrony assumption manifests as necessary retry logic or a [free option problem](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/htlcs-considered-harmful/).\n\nIn the previous section, I stated that systems with minimal synchrony assumptions were better at dealing with uncertainties in the environment. In the case of something like a HTLC, the communication can fail if there's a strong financial incentive to make the communication fail. Like a market maker who wants to block or delay the value transfer because they hold certain assets in both venues.\n\nA strong enough financial incentive in the environment can make the communication fail.\n\nThis last point is sorta true of systems that require a TTP though! In that case, the TTP needs to be trusted to have a financial incentive to maintain the integrity of the bridge. The difference is in how the financial incentive to block communication is expressed.\n\nI believe there's a natural duality here. Either you have to trust a lower security 'middleman' or you need to trust that the communication won't be disrupted.\n\nIf the cross-chain communication introduces juicy enough [MEV](https://hackmd.io/ivUzk3piQEG8ALzCGbxlag), the communication might fail in either case! Either because the TTP goes corrupt or because a big enough market maker makes it fail.\n\n## Examples in the wild\n\nHow do modern cross-chain communication systems distribute across this tradeoff? There are [better articles](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/blockchain-bridges-5db6afac44f8) out there that categorize all systems; I'll juts look at a few illustrative examples here.\n\n[Connext's nxtp](https://github.com/connext/nxtp) is a classic example of a cross-chain system that adds a stronger synchrony assumption. Once users have finished their negotiation with routers, there's a two phase prepare/fulfill mechanism for completing the appropriate transactions on both sides of the bridge. If the communication doesn't happen within a timeout, it doesn't happen.\n\nOn the other hand, the [Wormhole bridge](https://wormholenetwork.com/en/) between Solana and Ethereum introduces a TTP. The 'guardian' validator set that exists between the two chains is required to make a 2/3 majority attestation about a transfer for it to be carried through. If this set is corrupted or (collectively) doesn't want a transfer to go through, it won't.\n\nOne thing that needs stressing is that neither approach is universally better. Marketing material from systems on either side of this tradeoff will claim that they're making the 'right' tradeoff, but as stated before, both tradeoffs present a way in which these systems can fail.\n\nThere are also some systems that make one of these tradeoffs less obviously. My favorite example is the [Optimism DAI bridge for fast withdrawals](https://hackmd.io/ivUzk3piQEG8ALzCGbxlag). The TTP here is the Maker DAO itself! Users require the DAO to provide DAI liquidity and thus integrity to the proposed fDAI asset.\n\nIt's kinda odd to think of a DAO as a TTP, but if we consider that anything with *less* robust security than the chains communicating is 'trusted' relative to them, a DAO can serve this purpose! I'm personally excited to see more DAOs taking on the role of TTP for facilitating cross-chain communications.\n\n## Onwards\n\nThe future looks multi-chain and facilitating communication between chains will present real opportunity for those ready for it. It's important for those of us using these new systems to understand the tradeoffs they're making.\n\nIn this post, I examined one fundamental tradeoff, between strong synchrony assumptions and trusted third parties (TTPs). The boundaries between chains are very interesting to me, so I'll dive into other facets in future ones.\n\nAs is true in everything I write, if this stuff is interesting to you, feel free to get in touch!

So when a new NFT project called Loot launched last week and unexpectedly took the crypto world by storm, we decided to scrap our plans and run an emergency newsletter.\n\n![Image 2021-09-10 at 3.14.59 PM](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7663ed87-6504-4c33-aeb3-887da2a8a804_1752x964.jpeg)\n\nLoot NFTs, as shown above, have no artistic value. They are nothing but 8 lines of computer-generated text on a black background. But this unprecedented form sparked lightning in a bottle, inspiring a massive and diverse community to start building a new metaverse together.\n\nSince jumping into the space in 2013, I‚Äôve only ever observed 3 communities as strong as Loot‚Äôs: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Yearn. So as the initial hysteria calms down and speculators leave, I would carefully watch the community that remains, including its on-chain footprint. I have a feeling we are going to be covering Loot a lot more in the future.\n\n\n***\n\n![This week our contributor analysts cover the Loot ecosystem.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa26f49e6-915e-42e4-ab4e-a04b490856f9_1336x106.png)\n\n# ‚ë†¬†Loot Project Overview\n\n**üë• [Mert Lostar](https://twitter.com/lostindefi)**\n\n**üìà Loot disrupts NFT scene with a 7-day Vol. of 46KŒû**\n\n**üëâ¬†[Community Discord](https://discord.gg/NXEntTSHgy)¬† üîé¬†[Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/colinplatt/loot)**\n\n* Loot has a simple concept. In the words of project creator [Dom Hofmann](https://twitter.com/dhof/), Loot is ‚Äútext-based fantasy crypto loot,‚Äù where individual NFTs represent ‚Äúbags‚Äù of loot containing different items. However, this simple concept has made a huge impact on the NFT scene, with the value of Loot NFTs appreciating from just the minting cost of gas to generating a 16KŒû daily volume (\\~$53M) on the secondary market in just 6 days. The volume seemed to fizzle out to more reasonable levels in the following days, similar to the way it rushed to the top.\n\n![Dune Analytics - @rantum](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a298949-d868-49f7-96d7-510ecf76cebf_624x308.png)\n\n* A steady decrease in the floor price of Loot NFTs, along with a decrease in volume, indicates that the hype around the project has subsided slightly since it started off at a fever pitch. Floor price took the biggest hit on September 4th, when the creator introduced More Loot, which created a dynamic supply of non-original loot. Even so, Loot changed the way we think about NFTs.\n\n![Dune Analytics - @rantum](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F152a9c87-d68d-4557-a10c-5f3e53ef50d0_624x304.png)\n\n* Incredibly, Loot had more 7-day volume than CryptoPunks, BAYC, and ArtBlocks combined. Just a little while ago, all we were talking about was the amazing growth these projects were experiencing! Then, the ‚Äúweird experiment‚Äù dropped. I believe stealing the spotlight is a huge understatement at this point.\n\n![Dune Analytics - @rantum](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f32de71-4e7f-4b12-9dd6-ec7fc1fd9789_624x308.png)\n\n\n***\n\n# ‚ë° Loot Project Overview (pt. 2)\n\n**üë• [Banterlytics](https://twitter.com/banterlytics)**\n\n**üìà Loot: A Weird Experiment to ETH 100K+ in Sales**\n\n**üîé¬†[Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/masroor/Loot-Season)**\n\n* Dom, Loot‚Äôs creator, called Loot a weird experiment. What really is this experiment? In simple words: a jpeg with randomized adventurer gear. Dom wanted people to use these traits to make something, hence no images or stats were included, leaving everything open to interpretation of the Loot holders. The initial 2 days saw little sales volume for Loot. Once the community realized the potential Loot presented, the money started to flow in.\n\n![Dune Analytics ‚Äî @Banterlytics](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcceefea6-7078-4bcb-9a62-e792601ac4b4_1327x711.png)\n\n* What really ignited the project was when community members started making projects that complemented Loot, such as Ability Score, Realm, and Character score.

The market cap reached an all-time high of $600m. The total number of unique addresses reached 4,543 and has since decreased to 4,339, suggesting a low engagement. The total supply on exchanges has reached an all-time high at 41%. This is substantial for a token without links to an exchange and suggest holders have been looking for liquidity.\n\n![Nansen](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F679eed9d-98dd-4d5a-9ea5-9d1f57df5adc_1290x796.png)\n\n* On the second day of its launch, AGLD volume on Uniswap reached $250m, equivalent to the third most traded pair.

As of now, there are over 40 Loot derivatives, not including other Loot factions like Bloot. Although there are many of them, not all enjoy equal success; most of them are free to mint if you're a Loot holder ‚Äî some do cost ETH, but others have supply open to the public. Cumulatively, derivatives have traded over \\~4000Œû on Opensea compared to original Loot, which has traded over \\~60,000Œû.\n\n![Dune Analytics - Dqniellew](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F948ed301-c248-413c-9501-bba893a63fe7_898x460.png)\n\n* Assuming the current number of unique owners of Loot is around 2.5k, early derivatives have enjoyed more participation than older ones. Some of them with the most mints include Abstract Loot, Characters, Treasures, and Realms with an exception for Doggos for Dog Owners which was announced a few days later.\n\n![Dune Analytics - Dqniellew](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99bd3d43-bab3-4a93-bd6c-2cdc8ff330e9_1280x710.png)\n\n* It is the same story for total volume and number of sales on Opensea. Some of the ones that have generated the most volume are Realms, Treasure, Ability Score, Characters and, Abstract Loot which make up \\~85% of all derivatives volume.
