{"id": "iDep7z65igUs2pu6nf4KMUI0s_mlUs_JFumLwXPzTpY", "title": "Where it’s at", "body": "I’m glad to remember an internet that didn’t feel like it was trying to drain my attention all the time. Growing up in small towns and being unschooled, the net was both a portal for seeing the world *and* contributing to it. I talked about it briefly in my last entry—[an introduction](https://jk.mirror.xyz/DkE-9_u8B9BdJYwWYSDN80ZKUpwk5fenwIaSHPP2VvA). I’ve always enjoyed building things with whatever material is around. Back then it was a hand-me-down Compaq and dialup. I didn’t have like, hand tools to build a treehouse, but a machine with a connection. Not really decision making—“I want to make sites!”—more environmental.\n\nSo it was disappointing to watch this thing I was so into become more and more adversarial over time. During my teens seeing big tech displace big oil felt pretty [Virilio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Virilio)-ish. The story is familiar, yeah? Not a unique experience; it’s broadly personal.\n\nAs someone compelled to build, this creates a lot of tension. Honestly, the difficulty in reasoning about compromise is paralyzing at times. Over the past few years it felt like building meant deciding to contribute to the mess, however indirectly.\n\n## Platform singularities\n\nAs the net enveloped more of life the platforms began trying to eat each other. It’s still going on. Facebook wants to become Snapchat wants to become Netflix wants to become Youtube wants to become Instagram wants to become Shopfiy wants to become Pinterest… and so on. I’m exaggerating, but it’s undeniable that platforms want to become their neighbor *before* their neighbor becomes them.\n\nIt seems like the pattern is a function of time. An indicator of an aging ecosystem. We remember AOL, yeah? These things that feel too big to ever go away, but they do. This isn’t really controversial. It’s how it goes.\n\n---\n\nEvery once in a while I revisit this lecture by Pinterest co-founder Evan Sharp at Columbia GSAPP, where he attended as a student. It’s one of the better (imo) schools for architecture and urbanization. Makes sense that Evan went there. *Everything* is architecture, right?\n\n[Evan Sharp at GSAPP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjlDWspIPvk)\n\nEvan is on it. The lecture is scatter-brained and cross-disciplinary, and includes phrases like “spiritual neuroticism” and “fragmented myths.” It’s *not* a tech talk, but one of culture, spirit, big glass walls and gardens (lol.) What inspires us. He’s able to better articulate a lot of the same metaphors used by those *critical* of platforms like Pinterest.\n\nAfter a few minutes of watching, a question always returns: How can someone with an understanding of things so dialed be responsible for… *Pinterest*?\n\nIf I had to guess, it’s partly about an interplay between inspiration and intuition. A sculptor or songwriter does not dictate their work. Instead they respond. It’s following your nose and being receptive to what a work *wants* to be. It requires an extreme sensitivity and the ability to move your ego out of the way to reveal the true shape of what’s in-front of you. Evan’s interests are on point. But Pinterest is less his creation and more the sum of what Pinterest *wanted* to be at scale. The idea *wanted* to grow.\n\nEvan and his team were in tune with what a platform within the “web2” attention economy wanted to be, and were able to set aside their sense of idealism for what the ecosystem afforded *and* what mass utility at scale required of them.\n\nTo build on web2 at scale today means accepting those same defaults and a willingness to repeat history. We’ve seen how it goes. The combination of platforms eating each other and these conditions (it’s either ads or subscriptions bb) indicate it’s the end of that timeline. Donezooooo.

But today, not every battle is legible to the untrained observer. While some grifts are plainly perpetrated by would-be thought leaders, other battles for narrative control are hiding in plain sight, happening under the guise of intellectual debate. When these battles go unrecognized for what they are, even the best among us fall victim to meaningless conversations that waste the time of those involved. In this piece, I introduce the concept of **scissor labels**, why they foment controversy, and how they're different from other linguistic debates. I then suggest how to respond to any form of narrative battle with a more fruitful long-term approach.\n\nThis essay is being crowdfunded on Ethereum.
