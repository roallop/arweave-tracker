After two weeks of onboarding, planning, and networking, we knew it was time to mint. We instituted the “Round” method of minting works in groups every Wednesday and Saturday. To date, 14 of those artists have successfully minted and released their first NFTs out into the world. This post serves as a highlight and reference to memorialize the group that started it all.\n\n\n**Key Stats**\n\n14 Artists\nFrom Argentina to Indonesia (Representing 6 Countries)\n2 Workshops (Featuring Cooper Turley and Osinachi)\n2 Weeks\n4 Rounds\n\n**Artists**\n\n✺ [Eddington Again](https://twitter.com/eddingtonagain)\n✺ [Tondji](https://twitter.com/t0ndji)\n✺ [Cy Tone](https://twitter.com/cy_tone)\n✺ [Kenneth Lartey](https://twitter.com/knnylrty)\n✺ [Rimbawan Gerilya](https://twitter.com/RIMBAWANGERILYA)\n✺ [Ravi Vasavan](https://twitter.com/ravivasavan) \n✺ [Niall Ashley](https://twitter.com/niallashley_)\n✺ [Sky Kawano](https://twitter.com/skykawano)\n✺ [Tigris](https://twitter.com/tigrisli)\n✺ [Baran Acar](https://twitter.com/_acarimo)\n✺ [Ikaro Cavalcante](https://twitter.com/occult3d)\n✺ [Magdalena Molinari](https://twitter.com/maggiemolinari)\n✺ [Christopher de la Guardia / Dela](https://twitter.com/artofdela)\n✺ [Ben Makgetlane](https://twitter.com/benmakgetlane)\n\n## What We Learned\n\nDuring the onboarding & minting process, We recognized a few things:\n\n> Not everyone's NFT will sell immediately;\n> Artists need more than just one stipend to mint creative works;\n> Not every artist will mint in a specific timeframe.\n\nTo accommodate this, and to celebrate all of our artists, we are experimenting with **$RECAP NFTs** — a special 1/1 gif that cycles through the artwork of our batch groups that will be auctioned off with the proceeds being split among each artist of that batch group, $BOUNTY holders, $BOUNTY NFT Auction Winner and Mint Fund DAO (a total of 47 recipients).\n\nTo do this, we are deploying Mint Fund's crowdfunded [Reserve Auction ($BOUNTY)](https://mint.mirror.xyz/mDws2xGmJCq55ehGDdcv8tGDCpSd_c_CfeqhexiKSqU), and using Mirror recently introduced Splits Auction feature. \n\nWe believe in redistribution at every level, and with our $RECAP series, we can ensure that artists can earn ETH so they can continue minting.\n\n[Token #3051](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3051)\n\n**Split Allocation**\n\n14 Batch 01 Artists / 80%\n31 $BOUNTY Holders / 10%\n$BOUNTY NFT Auction Winner / 5%\nMintFund DAO / 5%\n\n*The Final distribution percentage was rounded for simplicity.

This report outlines a sequence of BauDAO phases that begins with a collectively crowdfunded building project and moves towards a novel vision for an urban operating system. The BauDAO paradigm includes many novel software mechanisms that: \n\n- Reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of various urban assets. \n- Enable multi-tier governance protocols for determining and modifying ‘program’.\n- Sharply decrease capital barriers to ownership status by several orders of magnitude via smart contract crowdfunding mechanisms. \n\nEventually, the BauDAO becomes an Operating System which is applicable to the breadth of architectural typologies, including residential buildings, creative collectives, schools, and co-ops. Lastly, we argue that architects are uniquely positioned to redefine these socio-economic parameters of ownership and governance (Form follows Finance) by removing parasitic developers and the rentier system. As opposed to commodity service providers, architects become fractional owners of built works alongside the distributed communities that own their architecture.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/53418ecd-a4fe-407b-9081-49a311772a5b.jpg?height=2700&width=2700)\n\n\n\n\n\n## **The Problem of Memory in Digital Minds** \n-James Douglas Boyd\n\nDigital minds will differ from human ones in that they will be both intelligent agents and products of the engineering designs of others. It may not always be easy for a digital mind to differentiate the aspects of its intelligence that are autonomous and those that are features of others’ designs. Memory is one such aspect. We consider an experiment that a digital mind can conduct and two measures that it can estimate for choosing among hypotheses regarding the origins of its memories.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e42a92f8-2e95-463b-b022-d32d4726fbba.png?height=1084&width=2388)\n\n\n\n### *Going Forward*\nAs Cope grows, the issues will include more reports from a diversity of future thinkers.

On the positive side, NFT auctions have found a clear product market fit over the past few months as a new, crypto-native way for creators to monetize their work, inspiring a wave of new people to wade into crypto. But I’d argue there's still an anti-social element to NFT bidding and ownership, for instance:  \n\n- Only one person can win an NFT auction, excluding all other collections put forth from supporters who might have wanted to get involved with a work. Obviously, that also means only one person can own an NFT. \n- When you’re bidding, you’re bidding on your own. NFT auctions are single-player.\n- Crypto whales have an enormous edge over more humble patrons in these auctions.\n\nPartyBid aims to solve both the single-ownership and whale-dominance issue of NFT auctions by allowing bidders to pool their assets and bid as a collective. I see it working like this: \n\n1. A PartyBid (or multiple PartyBids) can be deployed for any NFT auction. \n2. Anyone can deposit ETH into the PartyBid, in return for a proportional stake represented by an ERC-20 token. They become partiers. \n3. The contract can be called to bid on the auction if it has enough ETH in the pool to place the highest bid. \n4. If it gets outbid, partiers can deposit more ETH into the PartyBid to make another bid. \n5. If the PartyBid wins, the DAO takes custody of the NFT.

I have heard that for as long as I have been in VC and probably have written it here a few times.\n\nWell, it turns out that is not right. Half of all venture funds outperform the stock market which is the benchmark most institutions measure VC funds against.\n\nMy friend Dan Malven [wrote about this on his blog yesterda](https://dan-malven.medium.com/why-institutional-investors-should-double-down-on-vc-5a0f103c1ae9)y:\n\n> A [working paper published](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28109) by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in November 2020 contradicts that notion, showing that half of all VC fund managers outperform the public markets, and are therefore worthy of institutional investment.\n\nThis study was based on a large sample of VC fund level returns from 2009 to 2017 and does not include the last few years which have been particularly strong for the VC sector.\n\nManager selection remains an important part of VC investing because the lower half of VC funds do not outperform the stock market. An interesting data point from this study is the VC “fund of funds” mostly outperform the stock market so a portfolio of VC funds will generally give you enough diversification that you can meet your performance objectives.\n\nThe best way to know what managers to pick is to be in the startup business in some way. All you need to do is watch how people behave to know who is good and who is not. The Gotham Gal and I have been investing in the VC funds of managers we know well and have worked with closely on boards of startups for about fifteen years now.\n\nThese are the gross return multiples of all of the funds that are “mature” meaning the returns are pretty clear now:\n\n|          |                            |\n| -------- | -------------------------- |\n| Multiple | Year Of Initial Investment |\n| 8.66     | 2006                       |\n| 3.65     | 2007                       |\n| 5.29     | 2007                       |\n| 3.31     | 2010                       |\n| 10.38    | 2010                       |\n| 7.63     | 2010                       |\n| 4.71     | 2010                       |\n| 2.01     | 2010                       |\n| 2.29     | 2012                       |\n| 8.58     | 2012                       |\n| 3.97     | 2012                       |\n\nI am not going to do the work of calculating performance against the stock market for these funds, but I suspect all buy maybe two of those eleven funds have outperformed the public markets.\n\nAs you can see, investing in VC funds can be very profitable. And I suspect it is getting more profitable, not less, as the capital markets and M\\&A markets are providing robust liquidity options for managers.\n\nSadly the VC market remains largely out of reach of many “main street” investors as the SEC limits these fund investments to qualified and accredited investors. That has never made sense to me and is yet another example of the “well meaning” rules resulting in the wealthy getting wealthier and everyone else missing out.\n", "timestamp": 1620249381, "digest": "PEJWtadEpKh-DKtrkIvJt5hLP4-aQJxmrU2yJV6VPtg", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

This report outlines a sequence of BauDAO phases that begins with a collectively crowdfunded building project and moves towards a novel vision for an urban operating system. The BauDAO paradigm includes many novel software mechanisms that: \n\n- Reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of various urban assets. \n- Enable multi-tier governance protocols for determining and modifying ‘program’.\n- Sharply decrease capital barriers to ownership status by several orders of magnitude via smart contract crowdfunding mechanisms. \n\nEventually, the BauDAO becomes an Operating System which is applicable to the breadth of architectural typologies, including residential buildings, creative collectives, schools, and co-ops. Lastly, we argue that architects are uniquely positioned to redefine these socio-economic parameters of ownership and governance (Form follows Finance) by removing parasitic developers and the rentier system. As opposed to commodity service providers, architects become fractional owners of built works alongside the distributed communities that own their architecture.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/53418ecd-a4fe-407b-9081-49a311772a5b.jpg?height=2700&width=2700)\n\n\n\n\n\n## **The Problem of Memory in Digital Minds** \n-James Douglas Boyd\n\nDigital minds will differ from human ones in that they will be both intelligent agents and products of the engineering designs of others.

{"id": "BtvcZPD5E4_5K7MLxVDf8HmXPenmWbLmxWMB9hOjT1g", "title": "This DAO is here to $PARTY", "body": "*Update: The crowdfund has been fully funded! Backers with at least 10 $PARTY tokens can now join the [PartyDAO Discord](https://discord.gg/mEgsCs78).*\n\n[Party DAO](crowdfund://0x402eb84d9cb2d6cF66Bde9B46D7277d3f4a16B54?network=homestead)\n\nAn amazing community coordination paradigm called PartyBid has emerged this week. I want to capture it in this post and invite you to get involved in PartyDAO.\n\nBut first, PartyBid’s backstory is essential.\n\nIn a recent deep [dive into web3](https://www.notboring.co/p/unwitting-collaboration-and-web3), Packy McCormick cited Chris Dixon’s 2013 post “What the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years”, signaling readers to pay attention to what people are doing with web3 after hours. Appropriately, PartyBid was spawned from a Twitter thread by Dave White that began “It’s friday night, let's build a mechanism together!” \n\nAn hour and a half later, I replied with the following:\n\n[](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1383238473767813125)\n\nIn short, a PartyBid is a pop-up DAO whose sole purpose is to win an NFT auction. \n\nThe idea was a response to a few drawbacks I see in NFTs. On the positive side, NFT auctions have found a clear product market fit over the past few months as a new, crypto-native way for creators to monetize their work, inspiring a wave of new people to wade into crypto. But I’d argue there's still an anti-social element to NFT bidding and ownership, for instance:  \n\n- Only one person can win an NFT auction, excluding all other collections put forth from supporters who might have wanted to get involved with a work. Obviously, that also means only one person can own an NFT. \n- When you’re bidding, you’re bidding on your own. NFT auctions are single-player.\n- Crypto whales have an enormous edge over more humble patrons in these auctions.\n\nPartyBid aims to solve both the single-ownership and whale-dominance issue of NFT auctions by allowing bidders to pool their assets and bid as a collective. I see it working like this: \n\n1. A PartyBid (or multiple PartyBids) can be deployed for any NFT auction. \n2. Anyone can deposit ETH into the PartyBid, in return for a proportional stake represented by an ERC-20 token. They become partiers. \n3. The contract can be called to bid on the auction if it has enough ETH in the pool to place the highest bid. \n4. If it gets outbid, partiers can deposit more ETH into the PartyBid to make another bid. \n5. If the PartyBid wins, the DAO takes custody of the NFT. Token holders can vote on what to do with the NFT.\n6. If the PartyBid loses, funds are returned to the partiers. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a2b3f80b-56be-475d-8d79-765d88955d37.jpeg?height=1138&width=2024)\n\nThe idea took off. Only a few days later, @_anishagnihotri built an initial implementation of PartyBid. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1384372491053846531\n\nA testament to the power of sharing ideas online—where they’re only ever a retweet away from a talented developer bringing it to life—PartyBid had attained minimum viable meme status. Enough people shared it. Someone built it. Now, Anish’s build is already evolving, boosting the idea’s viability in the memepool. \n\nYesterday, Anish and company deployed the PartyBid code to bid on Colin and Samir's auction.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1389747619388403714)\n\nThe success story even got its fairytale ending. The first PartyBid—deployed by Anish—won the auction for 9.70 ETH!\n\n[Token #2962](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2962)\n\nIt’s insane what the internet can do with an idea in two weeks, but we can take it even further. PartyBid could use a lot more work. Improved and generalized contract code. An audit by experienced solidity engineers. An interface that’s easy to use. Integration with popular NFT platforms, where all the action’s happening. Even Mirror integration! \n\nMeme power only gets an idea so far. To get to a production-ready smart contract or product, we need funding and coordination.\n\n### Introducing PartyDAO\n\nWhat if a DAO could form around PartyBid with the mission to get PartyBid production-ready and into the world?\n\nThe PartyDAO experiment starts now with the $PARTY crowdfund. Here’s how I see it playing out:\n\n- Backers can support the crowdfund with ETH in return for $PARTY tokens\n- $PARTY tokens represent membership in PartyDAO\n- The first feature of PartyDAO will be a tokenized Discord, gated by $PARTY. Backers will immediately be able to join the PartyDAO Discord. \n- $PARTY holders will coordinate in the Discord to decide on a plan for governance, development roadmap, and how to allocate the raised funds\n- 50% of $PARTY supply will be held back to airdrop on quality community members who'd like to participate but may not be able to back the project with ETH\n\nThe crowdfund will target a fundraise of 25 ETH, which will be deposited into a multisig governed by the backers. With PartyDAO, I imagine we could hire solidity developers to ensure PartyBid contracts are production-ready, hire designers and product engineers to build a web app and hire artists to create marketing materials, memes, and NFTs. \n\nThose are just some initial thoughts, and anything’s possible. Ultimately, $PARTY holders will decide. PartyDAO is just an experiment, but I believe it could serve as a blueprint for how communities fund, build, and evolve open infrastructure, as well as how the next generation of collective curation could work.\n\n*I'd like to recognized the influence of amazing DAOs in the ecosystem, such as [@PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO), that have pioneered collective collecting and have done extremely impactful charitable work. PartyBid stands on the shoulders of these giants and hopes to lower the cognitive and technical costs of DAO coordination to create a new wave of DAOs.*", "timestamp": 1620251203, "digest": "FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4", "contributor": "0x5507dbd48a5A5bAcE8a6030e878cC4E0af147C33"}

This report outlines a sequence of BauDAO phases that begins with a collectively crowdfunded building project and moves towards a novel vision for an urban operating system. The BauDAO paradigm includes many novel software mechanisms that: \n\n- Reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of various urban assets. \n- Enable multi-tier governance protocols for determining and modifying ‘program’.\n- Sharply decrease capital barriers to ownership status by several orders of magnitude via smart contract crowdfunding mechanisms. \n\nEventually, the BauDAO becomes an Operating System which is applicable to the breadth of architectural typologies, including residential buildings, creative collectives, schools, and co-ops. Lastly, we argue that architects are uniquely positioned to redefine these socio-economic parameters of ownership and governance (Form follows Finance) by removing parasitic developers and the rentier system. As opposed to commodity service providers, architects become fractional owners of built works alongside the distributed communities that own their architecture.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/52d4a83e-65bf-49df-b9a7-bfac68bf784b.jpg?height=3900&width=2700)\n\n\n\n## **The Problem of Memory in Digital Minds** \n-James Douglas Boyd\n\nDigital minds will differ from human ones in that they will be both intelligent agents and products of the engineering designs of others. It may not always be easy for a digital mind to differentiate the aspects of its intelligence that are autonomous and those that are features of others’ designs. Memory is one such aspect. We consider an experiment that a digital mind can conduct and two measures that it can estimate for choosing among hypotheses regarding the origins of its memories.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e42a92f8-2e95-463b-b022-d32d4726fbba.png?height=1084&width=2388)\n\n\n\n### *Going Forward*\nAs Cope grows, the issues will include more reports from a diversity of future thinkers.

Read through the end to find out why.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/82237053-7e22-484b-a906-4eb1bd7c8417.png?height=1626&width=2376)\n\n\n[1](about:blank#fn1)\n\nFrom the internet’s beginnings, we were promised that it would be the great equalizer. Analysts and tech prophets of the early 2000s wrote think pieces about how tech would transform the power dynamics of modern life and erode the hierarchies of society.\n\nBut the bright-eyed optimism of the early 2000s has been almost universally replaced by a techno-dread, a feeling that technology is creating more problems than it’s solving.\n\nToday's digital spaces, rather than democratizing wealth and access, amplify the inequities of the physical world.\n\n[One study](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/02/why-almost-no-one-is-making-a-living-on-youtube/) found that making it to the top 3.5% of YouTube channels—which means about 1 million views each month—only gets you $12,000 to $16,000 a year, right around the federal poverty line.\n\nFor all the talk about the democratization of the creator economy, thus far, it’s become a superstar-driven, winner-take-all affair, where a small number of people do incredibly well, while the rest struggle.\n\nSherwin Rosen attributes this to [joint consumption technologies](https://www.uvm.edu/pdodds/files/papers/others/1981/rosen1981a.pdf). Despite the internet giving everyone the same access, the best performers - even if marginally more ‘talented’ than the rest - can also now reach an internet-scale audience and serve a much bigger market, reaping an even greater share of wealth. In [The Rise of the 10x Class](https://www.drorpoleg.com/rise-of-the-10x-class/), Dror Poleg argues this dynamic is now carrying over to all parts of knowledge work, as the Internet makes it possible for people to work from anywhere and earning potential is no longer capped by geography.\n\nIn her seminal piece, [The Creator Economy Needs a Middle Class](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class), Li Jin argues that it is up to us to build platforms that strengthen the creator middle class and lays out design decisions that can help make success attainable by many.\n\nOut of the turmoil of the last twenty years, new and hopeful possibilities are emerging. Today, we’re seeing the confluence of a few major cultural and technological trends that make us optimistic that the vision of the Internet we had decades ago - creative, quirky, diverse, accessible, democratic - is making a comeback:\n\n1. A renaissance of individualism on the Internet that changes the definition of talent\n2. A shift away from ad-funded models towards creator empowerment\n3. Web3 technologies that unlock infinite remixability and more granular distributions of value\n\n### A Renaissance of Individualism on the Internet that Changes the Definition of Talent\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/29efa833-5753-4514-b7c9-6afd3fce6635.png?height=866&width=2256)\n\nThe assumption underlying the winner-takes-all market dynamic relies on creators being judged simply by a talent or excellence standard. However, we ignore that taste and talent are co-determined. Talent is the name we give to people who best deliver what we prefer. So if we disagree on what’s “best”, we disagree on who is most talented.\n\nEvery sport that uses ‘mechanical judges’, like stopwatches, instead of human ones are judged solely against an excellence standard. These athletes conform to a taste-free talent vector. We see the entry of a taste vector in Olympic sports that have human judges, such as gymnastics, figure skating and freestyle skiing. To become good at these sports, one must also move towards “connoisseurship”. This requires the development of a “[discriminative faculty to judge and express taste according to the aesthetic principles of a consumption domain](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/18-107_582d03d9-92fd-4290-8cc3-d720848ef6a8.pdf)”. For a long time, internet content was at the behest of the rigid mechanical judge that is “number of subscribers” or “view count”.\n\nTo demonstrate the phenomenon of taste distribution more practically, any walk down the supermarket aisles will show that the assortment needed to cater for a diversity of tastes broadens as one moves from say paper towels to soups to wines - products of increasing hedonic value. There is not much dispersion of preferences for paper napkins on any dimension other than price/sturdiness. But that is not true for even the subset of wines that sell in supermarkets. The same applies on the internet.\n\nBut what do people end up preferring? [Holbrook](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/3039/aaa-JCR-Publication-October-2007.pdf) theorizes that people, as a whole, are much more dispersed in what they prefer than is the ‘expert consensus’. Holbrook’s work draws from [Bordieu’s](https://web.stanford.edu/class/think53/bourdieu17.pdf), who famously discussed that those with the highest volume of “cultural capital” dictate what’s deemed “good taste” - and therefore “what’s best”.\n\nBut how do you accumulate the “cultural capital” to dictate “what’s best”? Bordieu, whose work is rooted in the study of the French bourgeoisie, describes how “the working-class ‘aesthetic’ is a dominated aesthetic...obliged to define itself in terms of the dominant aesthetics”. Holbrook argues that in more individualistic contemporary cultures, this gets distorted and we end up with more heterogeneous tastes.\n\nWinner-take-all outcomes happen in cultural markets under the influence of received expert opinion. But that’s at odds with the internet’s promise to “democratize everything” and to allow us to express our individuality - a culture that flourishes when we can each define what “talent” means to us and that is antagonistic to forced standards and received opinion.\n\nThus far, platforms as well as a select few “influencers” have taken on the role of “expert” taste-making and that has had a profound effect on what has social and cultural value.\n\nAnd so, we introduce “Jad’s Theory” (of talent & taste on the Internet). We’re witnessing a renaissance of individualism on the internet - a breakup with institutions and the rise of the individual and, with that, an unbundling of internet communities. For the creator middle class to rise, we need to see higher resolutions of taste preference and a breakup with singular, discriminatory platform algorithms and the opinion of the ‘few’ that arbitrate taste and force today’s dominant aesthetic. With that, individuals can decide on “what’s best” for themselves, allowing for the talent power law to play out across more taste vectors and spreading the opportunity to be perceived as “the best” - and, with that, spreading the opportunity to profit from that.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b8fb77c9-8409-4da6-9a59-7aa9014e35a0.png?height=988&width=2282)\n\n\n### A shift away from ad-funded models towards creator empowerment\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/50128c84-ac67-4904-982a-0c0abe7c5a85.png?height=1074&width=2094)\n\nWe’re currently living through a shift in the business model of the Internet, from ad-revenue to direct-to-creator monetization. We can’t underscore enough how profoundly this alters incentives - platforms are now less focused on driving eyeballs and more focused on building tools that make creators money.\n\nAd-funded models require content to be managed at scale, and as advertisers are the main customer, they start to fill the role of the “expert” that defines what is valuable. This causes content to naturally hew to what’s deemed ‘advertiser-friendly’ and the more popular becoming even more popular.\n\nThis also means that in an ad-driven world, monetizing your social presence is only accessible to popular creators, and the size of your fanbase is the single metric that matters.\n\nNew, creator-centric business models enable monetization based on intensity of fandom, not size. [Swipehouse](https://swipehouse.co/) & [Pearpop](https://pearpop.com/), for instance, allow fans to pay for interactions, something that makes sense for creators with 10,000 followers or 10 million followers.\n\nWhether it’s Substack leading the charge on newsletters, Clubhouse [announcing plans for creator payments](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/clubhouse-announces-plans-for-creator-payments-and-raises-new-funding-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/), Soundcloud introducing [fan-powered royalties](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/soundcloud-is-about-to-revolutionize-streaming-payouts-launching-user-centric-royalties-for-100000-indie-artists/), Twitter [unveiling Super Follow](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers), or Snapchat Spotlight distributing over $1m to creators every day, we’re seeing platforms offering a slew of on-platform revenue options, with a renewed focus on aligning their business models with creators of all sizes. This puts the onus on the user to decide “what’s best”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4afdcea-75cb-41f8-88a3-2184daa3d2ac.png?height=920&width=1278)\n\nHigh willingness to pay creators, along with better methods to monetize creative output is a potent combination that will lead to a massive rise in the number of people making money online, and new ways to scale income without scaling time. The opportunities around passive income will become a new keystone of the user experience of these platforms, pulling many creators out of the labor stack and into the capital stack. The mom-and-pop businesses of tomorrow will be the Clubhouse hosts, Substack writers, Twitch streamers, Discord Community Managers, Shopify dropshippers, TikTok stars, etc.\n\n\n### Web3 technologies unlock infinite remixability and more granular distributions of value\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/90d89a70-f3e9-4d8f-96d2-6fe7c98ecdb8.jpg?height=1324&width=2184)\n\n\nTikTok is proof that ease of remixing drastically lowers the barrier to creativity. When everything becomes a base from which you can create new content, the creative affordances are infinite. Usually, the original creator’s work is stolen and the distributor wins. [Stories](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/jalaiah-harmon-renegade-creator-viral-dance) like the [creator of the Renegade dance](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/the-original-renegade.html) that took off when Charli D'Amelio did it getting “frustrated because they weren’t tagging me or giving me credit” wouldn’t exist if everyone “on-chain” saw the financial reward from the rise of a remix.\n\nEvery idea, every project, every piece of content is just a remix of ideas that came before it. In the past, it hasn’t been possible to track the provenance of these ideas or to compensate their originators when they are being used. But technology is on the cusp of enabling us to compensate people for all instances in which their work ends up being useful.\n\n**The true power of Web3 technologies is the potential to reshape how value is created, shared, and distributed on the Internet, making distributing value as easy as sending and receiving an email. That’s a fundamental technology unlock that makes it possible for creators on the internet to earn more of the value they create.**\n\nAn underexplored undercurrent of Web 2.0 monetization tools is that creators have been incentivized to publish *good enough* content frequently vs. *great content* sporadically.\n\nOn Substack, for example, you’re paid monthly, creating pressure to write consistently. The problem is not just the inevitable burnout that comes from having to churn out 1-2 posts a week. The problem is this heavily skews towards pumping out bland and mediocre half-baked thoughts you’ve had a day to work on, not evergreen content that will still be valuable in five years.\n\nBut what if your back-catalog wasn’t stagnant, but rather an ever-evolving source of passive income? What if the value of your work was driven by the number of references and citations, and more references meant more dollars? What if the ROI of an essay that took hundreds of hours to write was orders of magnitude higher than those designed for virality or disposability?\n\nWe’re particularly excited about a web that can route economic value to sources of inspiration, one that can lead to a revival of the back-catalog resulting in a renewed focus on quality over quantity,and one **where *win and help win*** is the guiding philosophy.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a66ec04-ee51-4d22-ae10-ea029979fe4c.png?height=1626&width=2376)\n\n\n**NFTs give us a way to honor, in perpetuity, the people who’ve influenced our work.**\n\n### With that spirit in mind, this essay will be an experiment in **‘Attribution+’ -** where we not only attribute sources of inspiration but route economic value to them.\n\nIn practical terms, this means we are minting this essay as a NFT, and the proceeds of the NFT sale will be split between the authors AND the individuals that have influenced the **work.**\n\n\n### Thought Partners\n(acknowledgments: people whose work we referenced directly in the essay)\n\n[Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18)\n[John Deighton](https://twitter.com/HBSmktg)\n[Leora Kornfeld](https://twitter.com/lk617?lang=en)]\n[Brandon Baraban](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonbaraban/)\n[Gabriel Nessim](https://twitter.com/wacko_gabriel)\n[Dror Poleg](https://twitter.com/drorpoleg)]\n[Patrick Rivera](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera?lang=en)\n[Balaji](https://twitter.com/balajis)\n[Josh Nissenboim](http://joshnissenboim.com/)\n[Tanay Jaypuria](https://twitter.com/tanayj)\n[Caroline Nguyen\n](https://twitter.com/spacexponential?lang=en)\n\n### **How will the proceeds of the NFT be split?**\n\n- 55% of the proceeds will be split between the authors, Sari and Jad\n- 30% of the proceeds will go to the pool of thought partners we reference above, whose ideas and feedback were instrumental in shaping our own.\n- 5% will go towards [Josh Nissenboim](http://joshnissenboim.com/), the man behind the graphics.\n- 10% will go to readers (like you) who help us spread the word about the essay.\n\n[Thought Partners](split://0x2b1138A1294fC56269ec66A2F17a6d1575473844?network=mainnet)\n\n\n### **What are the benefits of owning this NFT?**\n\n- Be a proud owner of an experiment that honors the original ideals of the Internet - users and creators, unconstrained by intermediaries, sharing ideas and economic upside\n- A powerful signal to the world that you support the “win and help win” worldview, and are, unabashedly, an **Internet optimist.**\n- The prospect of turning a profit by reselling the NFT down the line (Patronage+)\n- Own the underlying illustrations we created for the essay.\n- We’ll also send you physical prints of the four illustrations (one of a kind because this is the only time we’ll ever print or sell them) which, TBH, we’d hang in our powder rooms - they’re great dinner conversation starters for the intellectually inclined.\n- A 1hr Zoom call with Sari and Jad to dive deeper into the thesis (for anyone who bids over 0.1ETH is invited to participate)\n- A lifetime [Startupy](https://startupy.world/) membership and early access to [koodos](http://koodos.com/) (for anyone who bids over 0.5ETH)", "timestamp": 1620304542, "digest": "etHY_neWXosxDJpGOhzuwi-cB0qOvMco_iwO5yJ1Ai0", "contributor": "0xF9875C1544f2C9AeACEc50feD687D984dDAa9D00", "nft": "{\"nftTransactionHash\": \"0x952422b30153269a7a48094aa506b9cd62faf011cd99355a2c2f1468a7c7e84d\"}"}
