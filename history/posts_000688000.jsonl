I developed a kidney stone last week and my doctors and I wanted to understand how large and where it was. The answer is 4mm and it was somewhere between my kidney and bladder as of last Thursday. That may be more information than you need to know.\n\nOver four appointments, I experienced how much progress we have made during the pandemic and how much more we have to go before we have a high functioning software powered health care system in the US.\n\nThe good news is that for all four of my appointments, I was able to check into them via an app on my phone and in most cases, leverage stored information in apps on my phone to complete most of the forms. The stack of forms that we all usually complete when arriving at a new doctor has been reduced significantly during the pandemic, but it is not yet zero. I still had to complete at least one paper form at three of my four appointments.\n\nThe pandemic has forced health care providers to use mobile apps and software to automate much of the check-in functionality and that is great news. The fact that they only went 90% of the way there is a bit depressing though.\n\nI also got most of my test results delivered into an app on my phone. But not the ultrasound and CT scans. I realize that I probably can’t read those scans, but I feel like I paid for them so I should have them. If I had them, I could post them here 🙂\n\nBut seriously, I feel like the last fifteen months have brought much needed and long overdue changes to the information collection and management practices of the US healthcare system. I can see the system changing in front of my eyes. And that is very exciting.\n\nBut I don’t feel like we are anywhere near where we can go and should go to leverage the power of information and software to optimize the experience for patients and providers. I hope the last fifteen months is the proof point that change is possible and that we can keep innovating and improving the experience without a crisis forcing it on us.\n", "timestamp": 1621248856, "digest": "tj_htcMbrCivJiRl2ab5EoahVvbWIL5A6zMZexzF7Wo", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

Or on Apple Music. Or on any of the other streaming platforms. \n\nWhy?\n\nWell, because there are new ways of releasing art on the Internet. And they are a whole lot more fun. \n\nNot only do they extend one’s creative reach past the artmaking and into the art’s distribution — but they also allow us to explore the value of that art’s ***resonance***. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/matthewchaim/status/1392530703020183556\n\nWe have too long been stuck in an online world that solves for *reach*.\n\nAs [Tony Lashley](https://twitter.com/TooonyL) speaks of in this incredible episode of *[Interdependence](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/human-music-curation-non-binary-thinking-bundles-scarcity-and-participation-with-tony-lashley-marine-snow)*, reach is a whole lot easier to measure than resonance. \n\nStreams, views, likes, subscribers. This is reach. We are living in a digital ecosystem built for it, and thus we build our distribution plans (or worse yet, the very art itself) around it. \n\n*How can I get on more Spotify playlists? How can I increase my Instagram followers?*\n\nThese are the questions so many artists are stuck asking, with no path towards something different to solve for. Something more creative. Something more in line with the very spark that brings them to their craft in the first place. \n\nNow, of course, it’s not completely black-and-white. There is *some* resonance to be found in our current metrics. \n\nSomeone liking your Instagram post means they resonated with it enough to double tap their thumb on the screen. Someone liking your song on Spotify, or subscribing to your Youtube channel, means they resonated enough with your content to click the little heart button.\n\nThe problem with these metrics, however, is two-fold. \n\nFirst, there is an unlimited supply of them. There is no finite supply to tapping your thumb on a screen, or clicking a button. \n\nAnd because of this, the value of those actions — though they do fall *somewhere* on the spectrum of resonance — fall far too short in terms of realizing any significant value for the receiving artist. \n\nThus, in order to get any level of action taken on our artwork that can realize *real* value (i.e. paying for our groceries type value), we must inevitably solve for reach. We must feed an already bloated system with more and more content, beg for more and more playlist coverage, accumulate more and more streams from more and more passive listeners so our numbers grow more and more and more and m— \n\nThere has got to be a better way.\n\n[Jon-Kyle](https://twitter.com/jondashkyle) and [Patrick Riviera](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera) of Mirror have been thinking a lot about this. They raise the question: what if there weren’t an unlimited number of likes you could give out? How would that change our behaviour?\n\nhttps://twitter.com/jondashkyle/status/1375220107962580996\n\nSuddenly those double-taps of yours are a whole lot more precious. And receiving one is a whole lot more meaningful. \n\nWe can see something to this effect happening with Mirror’s weekly [$WRITE race](https://mirror.xyz/race). Every Wednesday, 10 new people are let into Mirror’s beta. Those people are chosen through a voting process, in which participants have a limited supply of votes they can give out to others. \n\nIn the $WRITE race example, people are given finite “likes” to give out. And the result of receiving those likes really *means* something. There is value on the other end — access into a highly sought-after beta program. \n\n**So there is limited supply on both ends**. People get a limited number of votes. And only a limited number of people get into Mirror. \n\nIf we suddenly land in a world where the *likes* we can give out on Instagram or Spotify are finite, we’re going to feel way more cautious about hitting that button. We’re going to really think about what we use it for, because each one is a sacrifice. So we better get some real value for taking that action. \n\nThis idea starts to move ever closer to something we are very familiar with: *buying stuff*. We spend our money — something we have a limited supply of — on that which brings us value. \n\n**Music brings us value. Tons of it.**\n\nYet the only ways we are able to truly express that value is through buying stuff that *orbits* that art. Things that *point* to that music, like merchandise and concerts. And while those things also hold weight, they circle around the artist’s *actual artwork* — the music. \n\nToday’s online mechanics simply don’t allow us to properly express the direct value that we receive from the song itself. \n\n**This is because we have an issue of unlimited supply — on either end of the relationship.**\n\nOn Spotify, you have an unlimited supply of *likes* to give out. And my song has an unlimited supply of *streams* to give out. \n\nThere is something missing. Right in the middle of our relationship. Right at that point of contact — where the resonance of creation meets the resonance of experience. \n\nWe haven’t been solving for that resonance.  \n\n### But perhaps now we can… \n\nNFTs allow us to build in a *limited* supply to digital content, something that up until now has only had an unlimited supply. Some refer to this as “*artificial scarcity*”, and argue that we are *forcing* scarcity into something that is inherently abundant. \n\nI beg to differ. I am not here to say that music, for instance, should be locked away in NFTs that only the owner(s) can listen to. \n\nI instead believe that by creating a scarce vessel through the use of NFTs, we are in essence building a space for ***the weight of art’s resonance to be housed***. As I mention in that tweet at the top of the page, the weight of art is not found in the medium nor its file type. It is found in its resonance, and by giving that resonance a localized home in digital space, we can attempt to measure its value. \n\nThis is perhaps an esoteric way of saying that while a song’s MP3 file may be found ubiquitously across the Internet, that song’s creative resonance *is inherently rare*. The spark that led to that song’s creation came at a distinct moment in time from a distinct human or group of humans. And that natural *rarity* deserves a home. It deserves a place that we can point to, look at, and perhaps one day in the metaverse, even touch.\n\nThis digital playground is new. People are just starting to get their feet wet, and we aren’t all that sure how to use these tools. For that reason, I am very interested in throwing stuff at the wall and experimenting with how we might.\n\n### It is my view that the future of music will have an altogether new *release mix*. \n\nSo let’s see if we can try and figure out what that release mix might look like. For this release, I am experimenting with a release mix I like to call ***Canon, Collectibles and Copies***. \n\nWhich brings me back to where I started: on Thursday May 20th, I’m dropping my new album... \n\n***Textures Of A Long Forgotten Assumption* is my third album. The project includes 9 songs. 6 of those songs are finished. 3 of them aren’t. I need your help to finish them.**\n\nI’ll be using the ***Canon, Collectibles and Copies*** release mix for Thursday’s drop. Let’s get into what that means...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e300def1-dfb3-40c2-9006-02eded1b7f56.png?height=1000&width=3000)\n\n# The Canon\n\nThe word *canonical* seems ancient and obsolete. That is how I felt about it at least when I first heard it being used to reference Catalog NFTs. \n\n[Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/) is building the music-first NFT platform, with the ability to mint — or “*press*” — 1-of-1 digital records. \n\nAt first I saw these 1/1 NFTs akin to a 1-of-1 trading card that represents the song. But as I began to play with Catalog and taste it for myself, my mindset began to shift. I started to see these NFTs not as a rare collectible that *points* to the song, but as *the very song itself*. I think of it as the **original Internet master** of the song, encapsulating the creative spark and story behind its inception. \n\nIt is like the original pressing of a vinyl record. For instance, the first ever vinyl pressing of The Beatles’ *Abbey Road* holds a lot of meaning and value to people. The 10 millionth vinyl pressing holds a lot *less* value than the first. They may be the exact same object in a material sense, but the *story* encapsulated in that first pressing makes all the difference.\n\nWe can now port this ability to harness the origin story of a song into digital space. And this, to me, is where Catalog NFTs come in. By shrinking the supply down to 1, we create an artifact that holds the genesis value of that art. And suddenly, the words *canon* and *canonical* take on fresh meaning. \n\nMy Catalog NFTs make up my canon — a genuine collection of my *original works*, housed forever on the Internet. \n\nThis Thursday, **four of the finished songs from the album will be released as 1/1 Catalog NFTs and put up for auction here on Mirror**. (The other two finished songs have already been minted and sold on Catalog — [here](https://beta.catalog.works/chaim/form) and [here](https://beta.catalog.works/chaim/tear).)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ddde242d-ab01-41e1-adc7-e4ec35a200be.png?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n# The Collectibles\n\nCreating a canonical 1/1 NFT allows us to capture the essence of a song in a digital record. But it doesn’t solve all the problems I got into above. Shrinking supply down to 1 has its value. But in between an **unlimited supply** and a **supply of 1**, there is a whole spectrum of creative space to play in. \n\nThis is where *collectibles* come in. By creating 1/N editioned collectibles, we can create a middle ground of supply that both artists and fans can benefit from. As mentioned before, expressing the value of music *directly* is quite difficult in today’s online ecosystem. With collectibles, artists can create verifiably rare artifacts that reference a specific song. And they can sell those pieces at a price point that allows fans to express their love for that song without absolutely breaking the bank. \n\nWhile we may think of 1/1 Catalog NFTs like original vinyl pressings, multiple-editioned collectibles are like merchandise that more directly represent the song than, say, a t-shirt. They carve out a space for superfans to express their fandom by giving up something of limited supply (i.e. money) in return for something of limited supply (a rare digital collectible). \n\nTo take this a step further, artists can bake utility into these collectibles, such as access to exclusive content, or access to them personally. For example, everyone who collects any NFT of mine also receives an invitation into my private community *Homemade Universe*.  \n\nPerhaps we can take this a step further... If the resonance of a song is met at both the point of creation and point of experience, **what if artists could melt those two points into one**. This is what I intend to experiment with in Thursday’s drop. \n\nThe *Textures Of A Long Forgotten Assumption* album is made up of 9 songs. On Thursday I will release a series of 9 collectible NFTs, each one representing one of the songs. \n\nHowever, **3 of those songs are not yet complete. One of them is missing a second verse. And the other two are still in demo stage.** Through the use of collectible NFTs, I will test out different ways of involving my audience in the completion of those 3 songs. Here’s how...\n\nFor *Flavors*, the song with the missing second verse, anyone who collects *any* NFT of mine will have the opportunity to submit a verse — be it vocals or instrumental production. One of the submissions will be chosen to become the *official* featured artist on that record. They will also win the *Flavors* collectible NFT, and be involved in the eventual *Flavors* 1/1 Catalog NFT. \n\nThe other two unfinished demos will be completed with creative direction from those who collect their respective NFTs — one is a 1/1, meaning 1 person will be involved on that song, and the other is a 1/100, meaning 100 people will be involved together! More details on this to come. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8e30f16f-6375-4269-929b-0a014633a129.png?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n# The Copies\n\nWe’ve gone over 1/1 canonical pieces, and limited edition collectibles. Lastly, there are *copies*.\n\nA copy is the form factor we have grown accustomed to — streaming services like Spotify and online stores like iTunes and Bandcamp offer unlimited *copies* of a song. They reduce the value of each instance of the song, while increasing its ability to spread. This solves for reach, which — while over-emphasized in the current ecosystem — is still extremely valuable. \n\nBy including canonical and collectible NFTs into our release mix, we are able to solve for resonance while *still* solving for reach. This is because NFTs allow us to transcend the supposed conflict between scarcity and abundance. \n\nAgain, it is not our intention to “lock away” these songs in NFTs that only collectors get to enjoy. Instead, collectors *also* benefit from the widespread popularity of the song’s *copies*. As the song grows in popularity, that cultural value flows its way back into the canonical and collectible pieces. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/matthewchaim/status/1394296576215068675\n\nFor this release, **I am going to be selling the first copies of the album myself**. \n\nWhile streaming services allow for greater reach, they also limit control immensely. Spotify for instance gets to designate the price of each *copy*. \n\nIt also limits the malleability of my record. I can’t change songs once distributed to their platform. I can’t add more songs to a distributed album. My creativity with regard to the release is incredibly contracted. \n\nThis is also my way of bridging the gap between those who are in crypto land and those who aren’t. By offering copies in this way to people, for a price that can be paid in fiat, I also create a group who I can eventually airdrop NFTs to once they have Ethereum wallets. In this way I turn *copies* into *collectibles*. \n\nAfter all this is said and done, I will then release the finalized 9-track album on streaming platforms. Only after I’ve solved for resonance, will I switch gears and solve for reach. Because only then am I willing to commodify and freeze my album in the ways I must in order to benefit from platforms like Spotify. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/663c2899-10ea-4a89-9ea1-3a0563f6308e.png?height=1080&width=1080)\n\n## So there you have it. \n\nIf nothing else, I hope this release demonstrates that ***artists actually have a choice***. That the model of releasing on streaming platforms and running on the neverending hamster wheel of reach-optimization is not the only way. That the creative levers to releasing music are only unlocked once we see that there are avenues that solve for art’s *resonance*. \n\nThe level of autonomy and imagination that will come from this unlock — as more and more artists jump into this new sandbox — is impossible to overstate. \n\n***Textures Of A Long Forgotten Assumption* drops Thursday May 20th — via the Canon, Collectibles and Copies release mix.**\n\nFull details of the actual drop will be released on Wednesday. \n\nThanks for being here. 🌻\n\n", "timestamp": 1621268832, "digest": "0SRGluR6sYweDWV0qmgF6V1wsN0BvEKsvCVOZCFX7yU", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

INFINFT is co-run by [Delphi Digital](https://twitter.com/Delphi_Digital) and [gmoney](https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT) and is backed by [IDEO CoLab Ventures](https://twitter.com/IDEOVC), [Gabby Dizon](https://twitter.com/gabusch) (Yield Guild), [Jiho](https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie) (Axie Infinity), [Andrew Steinwold](https://twitter.com/AndrewSteinwold) (Sfermion), [Andy](https://twitter.com/andy8052?s=20) (Fractional), [Calvin Liu](https://twitter.com/cjliu49?s=20) (Compound), [Will Price](https://twitter.com/will__price?s=20), and many more.\n\nCollector and NFT Funds are just the third of many applications for Syndicate that are rolling out now and in the weeks ahead.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/447cd4f1-ee6a-4919-897c-03952ea4f104.png?height=1754&width=2878)\n\n## Turning Collectors into Investors\n\nIn the last few months, interest in NFTs has grown exponentially, bringing a new wave of users into the crypto ecosystem: creators, artists, fans, and collectors—people who come for the creativity and culture but are staying for the newfound social connections and economic freedoms that NFTs, DAOs, and crypto uniquely enable.\n\nFans and collectors have always had an influence over art and media, in terms of what gets attention and becomes valuable after they’re created. But what if this could be taken even further? What if fans and collectors could *proactively* invest in and shape what art and media gets created? What if fans and collectors could *proactively* invest in the new infrastructure that enables what art and media could be created in the first place, and in the future?\n\n**We believe that this is the future—not only for NFTs, but for art and media broadly: fans and collectors on the internet will evolve to become the biggest and most influential investors in art and media—and also in the infrastructure and technology that power them.**\n\nAnd all of this will be enabled at scale across the internet by DAOs.\n\n## Calling All Fans and Collectors \n\nWe’re pioneering state-of-the-art Decentralized Finance (DeFi), DAO, and cryptosocial technologies at Syndicate, and we’re applying them to democratize investing and bring radical new models for investing to the world that are fundamentally more open, free, and fair.\n\nIf you’re a group of passionate NFT fans and collectors who want to be a part of this transformative shift, [reach out to us](mailto:hello@syndicateprotocol.org), as we’re working with leading groups of NFT collectors to drive this change.\n\n[Follow Us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SyndicateDAO)\n[Sign Up for the Private Beta](https://syndicateprotocol.org)\n\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3114)\n", "timestamp": 1621275091, "digest": "P7NfgxOF8bwvU6UOIjXU66ruR0lEy7n3hGm0mP2Gei8", "contributor": "0x66B340673fcE10bd3bFbbe59997Ae188a16b6710"}

In addition to the use cases we’ve already seen, they present a particular opportunity we believe is especially worth highlighting: **the funding of public goods**.\n\n[Gitcoin, ETHGlobal and Mint Fund Split](split://0x92b6006233EF63DaBfb3A8FFaeD8b5914592A7eC?network=mainnet)\n\nWhen you think of philanthropy, one visual that might pop into your head is Time Magazine’s Person of the Year issue from 2005. On the cover, Bono is [sandwiched](http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20051226,00.html) between Bill and Melinda Gates, captioned “The Good Samaritans.” It portrays a narrative of how charity seems to work: become rich and famous and then choose your cause.\n\nSplits enable and encourage another scenario. They allow one’s charitable contributions and personal wealth to grow side by side, forever. You choose the cause you care about, add its Ethereum address to your split, determine the percentage allocation and you’re good to go. The feature commits you to the cause, automates the contribution and records everything publicly.   However much money you have, or however much money your work generates, value is flowing.\n\nMirror makes this entire process easy with its economic blocks. To demonstrate, we’ve created the first public goods split, featuring a few of our favorite organizations that help fund public goods. We’re officially dubbing it the **Gitcoin, ETHGlobal and Mint Fund Split**, which can be interacted with a tip directly in the block above.

All value-generating blocks on Mirror—like crowdfunds and NFT auctions—allow you to specify a \"funds recipient\". While historically one would be required to set their personal wallet as the sole recipient, splits allow you to include multiple Ethereum entities, including other splits. So an artist could create a split that routes 50% of the proceeds from an NFT auction to their own wallet and the other 50% to the Gitcoin, ETHGlobal and Mint Fund Split, automatically and immutably committing to support public goods in the process.\n\nCreators no longer need to wait around to land a Time Magazine cover to give back. Instead, they can encode that commitment into a smart contract at the inception of their work or business. The causes we’re interested in become baked into what we create and share in the success of that creation. They become part of the story.\n\nWe’ll leave you with a couple cool ideas Vitalik Buterin poses in a recent blog post, titled “[The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html)”.

{"id": "P3SsKGy9SUTeiCyntnfd65gSI1Lidez0W3Njp6i1cQ0", "title": "Give a Split: Using Mirror to Fund Public Goods", "body": "Last week, we [announced](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw) Splits, a new feature on Mirror that allows you to continuously route ETH to an unlimited number of Ethereum addresses, according to a set of percentage allocations. The feature took off in novel ways across the Mirror community, already demonstrating exciting signs of early product-market fit.\n\nA [music collective](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM) auctioned off songs as NFTs and used splits to share the upside. A [visual artist](https://vv.mirror.xyz/bE9MJMwZ3qimMP0NzUyS9qBdl9NmkhIrGkHQPS5wlag) used the feature to reward each of his previous patrons using the proceeds of a new NFT sale (aptly titled Infinite Players). A writer published an essay about [micro-economies](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/gWY6Kfebs9wHdfoZZswfiLTBVzfKiyFaIwNf2q8JpgI) and embedded a split at the end of the post, functioning as a tip jar that’d be shared amongst the author and those who inspired the text.\n\nAs a new primitive of economic attribution, patronage, and giving thanks, Splits hold a lot of potential. In addition to the use cases we’ve already seen, they present a particular opportunity we believe is especially worth highlighting: **the funding of public goods**.\n\n[Gitcoin, ETHGlobal and Mint Fund Split](split://0x92b6006233EF63DaBfb3A8FFaeD8b5914592A7eC?network=mainnet)\n\nWhen you think of philanthropy, one visual that might pop into your head is Time Magazine’s Person of the Year issue from 2005. On the cover, Bono is [sandwiched](http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20051226,00.html) between Bill and Melinda Gates, captioned “The Good Samaritans.” It portrays a narrative of how charity seems to work: become rich and famous and then choose your cause.\n\nSplits enable and encourage another scenario. They allow one’s charitable contributions and personal wealth to grow side by side, forever. You choose the cause you care about, add its Ethereum address to your split, determine the percentage allocation and you’re good to go. The feature commits you to the cause, automates the contribution and records everything publicly. However much money you have, or however much money your work generates, value is flowing.\n\nMirror makes this entire process easy with its economic blocks. To demonstrate, we’ve created the first public goods split, featuring a few of our favorite organizations that help fund public goods. We’re officially dubbing it the **Gitcoin, ETHGlobal and Mint Fund Split**, which can be interacted with a tip directly in the block above. It also lives on its own [permalink](https://dev.mirror.xyz/splits/0x92b6006233EF63DaBfb3A8FFaeD8b5914592A7eC) page for easy sharing.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/275d03d1-b184-4710-80cb-6195dda83f32.jpeg?height=1012&width=2024)\n\nThe organizations are each worth looking into:\n- [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) is a community helping thousands of projects and teams grow their open source ecosystems.\n- [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.co/) is a series of hackathons and summits onboarding thousands of developers into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n- [Mint Fund](https://themint.fund/) is a community-owned and funded initiative helping crypto creators mint their first NFTs.\n\nBeyond direct tips, things get really interesting when this split is composed with other economic blocks on Mirror. All value-generating blocks on Mirror—like crowdfunds and NFT auctions—allow you to specify a \"funds recipient\". While historically one would be required to set their personal wallet as the sole recipient, splits allow you to include multiple Ethereum entities, including other splits. So an artist could create a split that routes 50% of the proceeds from an NFT auction to their own wallet and the other 50% to the Gitcoin, ETHGlobal and Mint Fund Split, automatically and immutably committing to support public goods in the process.\n\nCreators no longer need to wait around to land a Time Magazine cover to give back. Instead, they can encode that commitment into a smart contract at the inception of their work or business. The causes we’re interested in become baked into what we create and share in the success of that creation. They become part of the story.\n\nWe’ll leave you with a couple cool ideas Vitalik Buterin poses in a recent blog post, titled “[The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html)”. Not only are the ideas great, they’re now fairly possible.\n\n*Some institution (or even DAO) could \"bless\" NFTs in exchange for a guarantee that some portion of the revenues goes toward a charitable cause, ensuring that multiple groups benefit at the same time. This blessing could even come with an official categorization: is the NFT dedicated to global poverty relief, scientific research, creative arts, local journalism, open source software development, empowering marginalized communities, or something else?*\n\n*We can work with social media platforms to make NFTs more visible on people's profiles, giving buyers a way to show the values that they committed not just their words but their hard-earned money to.

{"id": "H4raX_uCVFkEfwG_vbInrXahjO0OG-o_5gw3MfbvLTQ", "title": "It's Time to Build (For the Public Good)", "body": "Last year, Marc Andreessen famously (or infamously) wrote “[It’s Time To Build](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/)”, in which he lamented the failure of our institutions to act decisively in the face of the pandemic, and more broadly to collectively imagine and build towards a better future. For many of us he argued, our complacency with the status quo traps us, and makes us reluctantly accept the world around us in place of meaningful action.\n\nThe beauty of the Ethereum ecosystem to me is that although we’re still a nascent community, rarely do we fall into such complacency. In web3, we continuously imagine new ways to coordinate, and build tools and social norms that allow us to play new kinds of positive-sum, multiplayer games. In fact, some of these tools disrupt even the (slightly more technologically inclined) status quo Marc Andreessen represents.\n\nOne way to think about the space in which we play all of these coordination games is as a [digital nation](https://metaversal.banklesshq.com/p/metaverse-as-digital-nations). This isn’t a [perfect analogy](https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1386658153014730760), and even some of the most diehard cypherpunks would agree we won’t be without nation states any time soon, but the metaverse we’re building does share some interesting similarities: in shared culture, shared values, and now shared currency.\n\nIn an ideal social contract, as early modern philosophers like [Rousseau](https://iep.utm.edu/rousseau/) have described, everyone forfeits some rights so that they might also impose selected duties. To do this without sacrificing freedom though there has to be a proper process for choosing what rights and duties we care about in the first place. We have to make the relevant proposals, achieve consensus, and in short - play the game.\n\nIn the 20th century, governments shaped these games and determined the rights and duties that underpin these social contracts. For example, in most democracies today, citizens agree to pay taxes to fund and maintain basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, and electrical grids.\n\nIn the 21st century however, especially in the web3, we’re still coming to terms with what our shared contracts with each other are. In some corners of our space, we find ourselves asking if we should have any duties to each other at all. Somehow though, despite the fact that there’s no meta-government to appeal to, no local bank to borrow from, and no formal university to give us the knowledge we need, we manage to keep making progress. [DAOs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o) in particular have played an important role in this process, giving us structured ways to [collect](https://foundation.app/blog/pleasrdao), [invest](https://metacartel.xyz/), and [build](https://raidguild.org/) together.\n\nBut as Vitalik mentioned in his recent post on [legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), we still have work to do when it comes to creating new social norms to fund our public goods together. We need to use the power of our shared culture, values, and currency to create social norms that can take us out of the dark forest into the web3 citadel. Web3 is our city, it’s where we live, and we should take care of each other. \n\n\n**What Are Public Goods?**\n\nIf you’re not already familiar, public goods are a special class of goods that are simultaneously non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable meaning it’s extremely difficult to stop someone from using the good, like roads and bridges, and non-rivalrous meaning that it’s abundant, and one person’s use of the good doesn’t substantially reduce the amount left for someone else (e.g. there’s more than enough air to go around). Public goods are critical, even selfishly, because we all rely on them - having a new car doesn’t matter if there are no roads to drive it on.\n\nIt’s worth noting that determining what is “truly public” can be a difficult task, and it’s something every community has to decide. One distinction that’s often drawn is between public goods and club goods, those goods like golf courses or membership only gyms that are excludable but non-rivalrous. But to make things more confusing even some of the things we consider public goods can be excludable given enough time and effort. For example, if you’re not a particularly good driver you might have your license revoked. If you’re an American, you might not always be allowed into Canada to use the roads in the first place. \n\nDigital public goods are by default more public, and hence less excludable. There are far fewer restrictions on how we use open source software because the cost of restriction is so much higher. A book in a library is only available locally to those with a library card, but the infrastructure to coordinate information online is accessible around the world. And of course now in web3 the infrastructure to coordinate value can be available to everyone as well.\n\nThis seems like a great thing at first, and it is, but there’s one major problem: the more accessible a good is, the less people want to pay for it. A government only has interest in funding its own roads, companies like Facebook only have interest in funding their own infrastructure (even when it comes to the kinds of open source software they focus on e.g. React), and yes even libraries generally only take care of the books within their walls. As Nadia Eghbal has [written about extensively](https://nayafia.substack.com/p/22-working-in-public), the goods that are most critical and most public are often the least funded. \n\n\n**Funding Our Shared Infrastructure**\n\nThe good news is that together we can help solve these problems using our own shared web3 infrastructure, the kind that allows us to play positive-sum, multiplayer games together in the first place. And to add to that, we already have some social norms that we’ve been evolving as a community.\n\nOne such social norm the Gitcoin community has tried to set is that we need the community to be more involved in funding Ethereum’s “most public” digital public goods. We’ve done this by setting up quarterly matching rounds using [quadratic funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421), a novel mechanism designed by Vitalik, Glen Weyl, and Zoe Hitzig in 2018. The way this mechanism works is simple, projects in Ethereum can list themselves as public goods in need of funding, and participants can democratically allocate funds from a community managed matching pool by donating some of their own money. By its design, quadratic funding incentivizes every member of the community to fund the infrastructure they want to see in direct proportion to how useful it will be to them, providing a possible solution to our digital tragedy of the commons. \n\nTo date, this mechanism has distributed over $10mm to projects at their earliest stages, including WalletConnect, Uniswap, Prysmatic Labs, EIP-1559, and more. And all of their success is ours too as members of the Ethereum community.\n\nBut it's always worth questioning whether we're doing enough. The questions that keep me up at night are how we might encourage more WalletConnects, BrightIDs, and even more quadratic funding mechanisms like Gitcoin Grants. How we might focus less on price and the whims of Twitter personalities, and more on the money, culture, and community legos we want to see in our ecosystem. How we might focus less on speculation and more on participation. \n\n**It’s Time to Build (For the Public Good)**\n\nOver the coming weeks, Gitcoin will be making some announcements about how you can get involved in finding answers to these questions. We want to see more experimentation, and push the boundaries of what kind of public goods coordination is possible.\n\nOne experiment we’ve already started has been to bring more [community stewards](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41) into the fold, so that we can better understand the needs of those we’re serving in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAnother set of possible experiments, [as Vitalik outlined](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), are around NFTs:\n\n> Which NFTs people find attractive to buy, and which ones they do not, is a question of legitimacy: if everyone agrees that one NFT is interesting and another NFT is lame, then people will strongly prefer buying the first, because it would have both higher value for bragging rights and personal pride in holding it, and because it could be resold for more because everyone else is thinking in the same way. If the conception of legitimacy for NFTs can be pulled in a good direction, there is an opportunity to establish a solid channel of funding to artists, charities and others.\n\nHere, we've already seen some interesting developments on from PleasrDAO who in addition to purchasing Snowden's [first piece](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1383155552793026560) recently purchased a piece from the [Tor Project](https://twitter.com/trevortimm/status/1393333390003392512) to support their privacy efforts.\n\nBut for today, I'd like to start one more experiment right here on Mirror, by inviting anyone inspired by this post to contribute to the recently announced [public goods split address](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw).\n\n[For the Public Good](crowdfund://0x41eD7D49292b8FBF9b9311C1Cb4D6eB877646C58?network=homestead)\n\nI hope you'll participate, and that we'll find more experiments to explore together to support our shared infrastructure soon. \n\n**It’s time to build for the public good.**\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1621286462, "digest": "7nKKV4x17rVkZL9_C0vVL3Vax2rv1H1ciigleEgBAOw", "contributor": "0x48A63097E1Ac123b1f5A8bbfFafA4afa8192FaB0"}

Imagine where the DJ is, where the characters are, what type of house are you in? \n\nThe first of three notes in this trilogy called ***[\"Shīkurettopātī: One Night In Kurosakimachi\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/178)***, it's serendipitous that my phone picked up both a conversation I'm having about crate-digging at one of the only remaining Tower Record stores in the world *AND* amazing house music. The instrumentation swells with soulful synths as the conversation reaches a euphoric note as we resolve ourselves to buy records acknowledging how awesome the moment is.\n\nThe remaining two notes, ***[\"Not Now, But In The Future\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/189)*** and ***[\"Chinese Omelette OST\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/188)*** create this unintended effect of feeling like a short film with your own visual dreamscape constructing a memory that’s unique to you despite the fact that the audio is not your lived experience.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/189)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/188)\n\n*Chinese Omelette OST is the last remaining NFT of the Shīkurettopātī trilogy to be collected.*\n\nI've posted the NFTs in the order I believe to be the most chronologically accurate, although any DJ will tell you that there are many highs and lows in a set that when you *think* it's over, there is more around the corner! \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6985affa-945f-4a49-86f0-7f256904acbd.jpg?height=3024&width=3024)\n\n*Fig. A: Live band practice in Ext. of Beach House, Kurosaki Beach*\n\nI'd be super curious to see what YOU see, more so than my own recollection (and photo) of the space and the folks within it.\n\n\n---\n\n## Spatial Conversations\n\nIn the context of memories, archived works in many ways achieve a similar effect of nostalgia. While they may not draw from life as a form of `reporting-lived-experience-as-documentation`, works that pull on the thread of life can be memory-inducing. For me, one of those works is a live recording in 2014 of a freeform DJ set with my uni-mates after a day of getting unbelievably stoned called \"SYNESTHESIA\". \n\nYou might be wondering why it's called SYNESTHESIA. For me, and others who experience two or more sensory inputs involuntarily, DJing soundscapes puts me into a trance-like state of flow. I can see threads of light guiding me to my next note as if I'm being controlled. I really don't remember the act of playing only the fact that I've *played* a set. In a way, perhaps there is a narrative to it all that I cannot comprehend. Oddly enough, I've been watching a show called [The Nevers](https://www.hbo.com/the-nevers) which has a character who can sing but she cannot understand what she is actually communicating. Even stranger, only a certain group of people can hear it too. I haven't found a metaphor so closely aligned with my own personal experiences with music.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/1643)\n\nAs a treat to my uni-mates, and to break them into the NFT space, I decided to put \"SYNESTHESIA\" up for auction with a 1.5 ETH reserve on Zora, to show them one of the core principles that solidifies why crypto can lead to an equitable future. For being supporters of my experiments, I wanted to reward them a split from the proceeds of the sale from the 35-minute live session and essay.\n\nI believe redistribution at all levels should be explored. While there is nothing stopping me from gladly auctioning these NFTs without attribution, I am a firm believer in trying to capture the entire story involving my work. I am currently publishing an essay \"Creative Immortality\" that speaks to the inclusion of others as a necessary component to the preservation of work enabling the natural line of discovery to take place. \n\nAs creatives, we can never have enough inspiration. Attribution provides us with our next set of sources to draw from. And now, we can trace the value these inspirations give us and pay it forward.   \n\n---\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nI want to give a special thanks to everyone involved in the creation of the Secret Party Trilogy and SYNESTHESIA. The splits breakdown will derive from the sale of this essay, and both the Chinese Omelette OST + SYNESTHESIA NFMTs. Because SYNESTHESIA is auctioned through Zora's deployment of $BOUNTY and not on Mirror, 30% of those funds will be added as a tip to the two split contracts attached to this essay.\n\n**Why two separate splits?**\nTo emphasize proper attribution, and to test the limits of Splits on Mirror, I wanted to deploy one split contract with recipients that influenced the Secret Party Trilogy, SYNESTHESIA respectively. The following is a breakdown of the split % per contract. \n\n### Split Recipients of Secret Party Trilogy (Chinese Omelette OST Auction):\n\n**Fusion Art Japan Residency (30%)**\n[Starnilas Oge](https://twitter.com/SCOGE2222)\n*If you haven't checked out [Fusion.Art](http://fusionart.world/i), you should.

For many of us he argued, our complacency with the status quo traps us, and makes us reluctantly accept the world around us in place of meaningful action.\n\nThe beauty of the Ethereum ecosystem to me is that although we’re still a nascent community, rarely do we fall into such complacency. In web3, we continuously imagine new ways to coordinate, and build tools and social norms that allow us to play new kinds of positive-sum, multiplayer games. In fact, some of these tools disrupt even the (slightly more technologically inclined) status quo Marc Andreessen represents.\n\nOne way to think about the space in which we play all of these coordination games is as a [digital nation](https://metaversal.banklesshq.com/p/metaverse-as-digital-nations). This isn’t a [perfect analogy](https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1386658153014730760), and even some of the most diehard cypherpunks would agree we won’t be without nation states any time soon, but the metaverse we’re building does share some interesting similarities: in shared culture, shared values, and now shared currency.\n\nIn an ideal social contract, as early modern philosophers like [Rousseau](https://iep.utm.edu/rousseau/) have described, everyone forfeits some rights so that they might also impose selected duties. To do this without sacrificing freedom though there has to be a proper process for choosing what rights and duties we care about in the first place. We have to make the relevant proposals, achieve consensus, and in short - play the game.\n\nIn the 20th century, governments shaped these games and determined the rights and duties that underpin these social contracts. For example, in most democracies today, citizens agree to pay taxes in their shared currencies to fund and maintain basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, and electrical grids.\n\nIn the 21st century however, especially in the web3, we’re still coming to terms with what our shared contracts with each other are. In some corners of our space, we find ourselves asking if we should have any duties to each other at all. Somehow though, despite the fact that there’s no meta-government to appeal to, no local bank to borrow from, and no formal university to give us the knowledge we need, we manage to keep making progress. [DAOs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o) in particular have played an important role in this process, giving us structured ways to [collect](https://foundation.app/blog/pleasrdao), [invest](https://metacartel.xyz/), and [build](https://raidguild.org/) together.\n\nBut as Vitalik mentioned in his recent post on [legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), we still have work to do when it comes to creating new social norms to fund our public goods together. We need to use the power of our shared culture, values, and currency to create social norms that can take us out of the dark forest into the web3 citadel. Web3 is our city, it’s where we live, and we should take care of each other. \n\n\n**What Are Public Goods?**\n\nIf you’re not already familiar, public goods are a special class of goods that are simultaneously non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable meaning it’s extremely difficult to stop someone from using the good, like roads and bridges, and non-rivalrous meaning that it’s abundant, and one person’s use of the good doesn’t substantially reduce the amount left for someone else (e.g. there’s more than enough air to go around). Public goods are critical, even selfishly, because we all rely on them - having a new car doesn’t matter if there are no roads to drive it on.\n\nIt’s worth noting that determining what is “truly public” can be a difficult task, and it’s something every community has to decide. One distinction that’s often drawn is between public goods and club goods, those goods like golf courses or membership only gyms that are excludable but non-rivalrous. But to make things more confusing even some of the things we consider public goods can be excludable given enough time and effort. For example, if you’re not a particularly good driver you might have your license revoked. If you’re an American, you might not always be allowed into Canada to use the roads in the first place. \n\nDigital public goods are by default more public, and hence less excludable. There are far fewer restrictions on how we use open source software because the cost of restriction is so much higher. A book in a library is only available locally to those with a library card, but the infrastructure to coordinate information online is accessible around the world. And of course now in web3 the infrastructure to coordinate value can be available to everyone as well.\n\nThis seems like a great thing at first, and it is, but there’s one major problem: the more accessible a good is, the less people want to pay for it. A government only has interest in funding its own roads, companies like Facebook only have interest in funding their own infrastructure (even when it comes to the kinds of open source software they focus on e.g. React), and yes even libraries generally only take care of the books within their walls. As Nadia Eghbal has [written about extensively](https://nayafia.substack.com/p/22-working-in-public), the goods that are most critical and most public are often the least funded. \n\n\n**Funding Our Shared Infrastructure**\n\nThe good news is that together we can help solve these problems using our own shared web3 infrastructure, the kind that allows us to play positive-sum, multiplayer games together in the first place. And to add to that, we already have some social norms that we’ve been evolving as a community.\n\nOne such social norm the Gitcoin community has tried to set is that we need the community to be more involved in funding Ethereum’s “most public” digital public goods. We’ve done this by setting up quarterly matching rounds using [quadratic funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421), a novel mechanism designed by Vitalik, Glen Weyl, and Zoe Hitzig in 2018. The way this mechanism works is simple, projects in Ethereum can list themselves as public goods in need of funding, and participants can democratically allocate funds from a community managed matching pool by donating some of their own money. By its design, quadratic funding incentivizes every member of the community to fund the infrastructure they want to see in direct proportion to how useful it will be to them, providing a possible solution to our digital tragedy of the commons. \n\nTo date, this mechanism has distributed over $10mm to projects at their earliest stages, including WalletConnect, Uniswap, Prysmatic Labs, EIP-1559, and more. And all of their success is ours too as members of the Ethereum community.\n\nBut it's always worth questioning whether we're doing enough. The questions that keep me up at night are how we might encourage more WalletConnects, BrightIDs, and even more quadratic funding mechanisms like Gitcoin Grants. How we might focus less on price and the whims of Twitter personalities, and more on the money, culture, and community legos we want to see in our ecosystem. How we might focus less on speculation and more on participation. \n\n**It’s Time to Build (For the Public Good)**\n\nOver the coming weeks, Gitcoin will be making some announcements about how you can get involved in finding answers to these questions. We want to see more experimentation, and push the boundaries of what kind of public goods coordination is possible.\n\nOne experiment we’ve already started has been to bring more [community stewards](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41) into the fold, so that we can better understand the needs of those we’re serving in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAnother set of possible experiments, [as Vitalik outlined](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), are around NFTs:\n\n> Which NFTs people find attractive to buy, and which ones they do not, is a question of legitimacy: if everyone agrees that one NFT is interesting and another NFT is lame, then people will strongly prefer buying the first, because it would have both higher value for bragging rights and personal pride in holding it, and because it could be resold for more because everyone else is thinking in the same way. If the conception of legitimacy for NFTs can be pulled in a good direction, there is an opportunity to establish a solid channel of funding to artists, charities and others.\n\nHere, we've already seen some interesting developments on from PleasrDAO who in addition to purchasing Snowden's [first piece](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1383155552793026560) recently purchased a piece from the [Tor Project](https://twitter.com/trevortimm/status/1393333390003392512) to support their privacy efforts.\n\nBut for today, I'd like to start one more experiment right here on Mirror, by inviting anyone inspired by this post to contribute to the recently announced [public goods split address](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw).\n\n[For the Public Good](crowdfund://0x41eD7D49292b8FBF9b9311C1Cb4D6eB877646C58?network=homestead)\n\nI hope you'll participate, and that we'll find more experiments to explore together to support our shared infrastructure soon. \n\n**It’s time to build for the public good.**\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1621290947, "digest": "7nKKV4x17rVkZL9_C0vVL3Vax2rv1H1ciigleEgBAOw", "contributor": "0x48A63097E1Ac123b1f5A8bbfFafA4afa8192FaB0"}

Non-excludable meaning it’s extremely difficult to stop someone from using the good, like roads and bridges, and non-rivalrous meaning that it’s abundant, and one person’s use of the good doesn’t substantially reduce the amount left for someone else (e.g. there’s more than enough air to go around). Public goods are critical, even selfishly, because we all rely on them - having a new car doesn’t matter if there are no roads to drive it on.\n\nIt’s worth noting that determining what is “truly public” can be a difficult task, and it’s something every community has to decide. One distinction that’s often drawn is between public goods and club goods, those goods like golf courses or membership only gyms that are excludable but non-rivalrous. But to make things more confusing even some of the things we consider public goods can be excludable given enough time and effort. For example, if you’re not a particularly good driver you might have your license revoked. If you’re an American, you might not always be allowed into Canada to use the roads in the first place. \n\nDigital public goods are by default more public, and hence less excludable. There are far fewer restrictions on how we use open source software because the cost of restriction is so much higher. A book in a library is only available locally to those with a library card, but the infrastructure to coordinate information online is accessible around the world. And of course now in web3 the infrastructure to coordinate value can be available to everyone as well.\n\nThis seems like a great thing at first, and it is, but there’s one major problem: the more accessible a good is, the less people want to pay for it. A government only has interest in funding its own roads, companies like Facebook only have interest in funding their own infrastructure (even when it comes to the kinds of open source software they focus on e.g. React), and yes even libraries generally only take care of the books within their walls. As Nadia Eghbal has [written about extensively](https://nayafia.substack.com/p/22-working-in-public), the goods that are most critical and most public are often the least funded. \n\n\n**Funding Our Shared Infrastructure**\n\nThe good news is that together we can help solve these problems using our own shared web3 infrastructure, the kind that allows us to play positive-sum, multiplayer games together in the first place. And to add to that, we already have some social norms that we’ve been evolving as a community.\n\nOne such social norm the Gitcoin community has tried to set is that we need the community to be more involved in funding Ethereum’s “most public” digital public goods. We’ve done this by setting up quarterly matching rounds using [quadratic funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421), a novel mechanism designed by Vitalik, Glen Weyl, and Zoe Hitzig in 2018. The way this mechanism works is simple, projects in Ethereum can list themselves as public goods in need of funding, and participants can democratically allocate funds from a community managed matching pool by donating some of their own money. By its design, quadratic funding incentivizes every member of the community to fund the infrastructure they want to see in direct proportion to how useful it will be to them, providing a possible solution to our digital tragedy of the commons. \n\nTo date, this mechanism has distributed over $10mm to projects at their earliest stages, including WalletConnect, Uniswap, Prysmatic Labs, EIP-1559, and more. And all of their success is ours too as members of the Ethereum community.\n\nBut it's always worth questioning whether we're doing enough as web3 or even metaverse citizens. The questions that keep me up at night are how we might encourage more WalletConnects, BrightIDs, and even more quadratic funding mechanisms like Gitcoin Grants. How we might focus less on price and the whims of Twitter personalities, and more on the money, culture, and community legos we want to see in our ecosystem. How we might focus less on speculation and more on participation. \n\n**It’s Time to Build (For the Public Good)**\n\nOver the coming weeks, Gitcoin will be making some announcements about how you can get involved in finding answers to these questions. We want to see more experimentation, and push the boundaries of what kind of public goods coordination is possible.\n\nOne experiment we’ve already started has been to bring more [community stewards](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41) into the fold, so that we can better understand the needs of those we’re serving in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAnother set of possible experiments, [as Vitalik outlined](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), are around NFTs:\n\n> Which NFTs people find attractive to buy, and which ones they do not, is a question of legitimacy: if everyone agrees that one NFT is interesting and another NFT is lame, then people will strongly prefer buying the first, because it would have both higher value for bragging rights and personal pride in holding it, and because it could be resold for more because everyone else is thinking in the same way. If the conception of legitimacy for NFTs can be pulled in a good direction, there is an opportunity to establish a solid channel of funding to artists, charities and others.\n\nHere, we've already seen some interesting developments on from PleasrDAO who in addition to purchasing Snowden's [first piece](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1383155552793026560) recently purchased a piece from the [Tor Project](https://twitter.com/trevortimm/status/1393333390003392512) to support their privacy efforts.\n\nBut for today, I'd like to start one more experiment right here on Mirror, by inviting anyone inspired by this post to contribute to the recently announced [public goods split address](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw).\n\n[For the Public Good](crowdfund://0x41eD7D49292b8FBF9b9311C1Cb4D6eB877646C58?network=homestead)\n\nI hope you'll participate, and that we'll find more experiments to explore together to support our shared infrastructure soon. \n\n**It’s time to build for the public good.**\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1621291055, "digest": "7nKKV4x17rVkZL9_C0vVL3Vax2rv1H1ciigleEgBAOw", "contributor": "0x48A63097E1Ac123b1f5A8bbfFafA4afa8192FaB0"}

For many of us he argued, our complacency with the status quo traps us, and makes us reluctantly accept the world around us in place of meaningful action.\n\nThe beauty of the Ethereum ecosystem to me is that although we’re still a nascent community, rarely do we fall into such complacency. In web3, we continuously imagine new ways to coordinate, and build tools and social norms that allow us to play new kinds of positive-sum, multiplayer games. In fact, some of these tools disrupt even the (slightly more technologically inclined) status quo Marc Andreessen represents.\n\nOne way to think about the space in which we play all of these coordination games is as a [digital nation](https://metaversal.banklesshq.com/p/metaverse-as-digital-nations). This isn’t a [perfect analogy](https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1386658153014730760), and even some of the most diehard cypherpunks would agree we won’t be without nation states any time soon, but the metaverse we’re building does share some interesting similarities: in shared culture, shared values, and now shared currency.\n\nIn an ideal social contract, as early modern philosophers like [Rousseau](https://iep.utm.edu/rousseau/) have described, everyone forfeits some rights so that they might also impose selected duties. To do this without sacrificing freedom though there has to be a proper process for choosing what rights and duties we care about in the first place. We have to make the relevant proposals, achieve consensus, and in short - play the game.\n\nIn the 20th century, governments shaped these games and determined the rights and duties that underpin these social contracts. For example, in most democracies today, citizens agree to pay taxes in their shared currencies to fund and maintain basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, and electrical grids.\n\nIn the 21st century however, especially in the web3, we’re still coming to terms with what our shared contracts with each other are. In some corners of our space, we find ourselves asking if we should have any duties to each other at all. Somehow though, despite the fact that there’s no meta-government to appeal to, no local bank to borrow from, and no formal university to give us the knowledge we need, we manage to keep making progress.

And of course now in web3 the infrastructure to coordinate value can be available to everyone as well.\n\nThis seems like a great thing at first, and it is, but there’s one major problem: the more accessible a good is, the less people want to pay for it. A government only has interest in funding its own roads, companies like Facebook only have interest in funding their own infrastructure (even when it comes to the kinds of open source software they focus on e.g. React), and yes even libraries generally only take care of the books within their walls. As Nadia Eghbal has [written about extensively](https://nayafia.substack.com/p/22-working-in-public), the goods that are most critical and most public are often the least funded. \n\n\n## **Funding Our Shared Infrastructure**\n\nThe good news is that together we can help solve these problems using our own shared web3 infrastructure, the kind that allows us to play positive-sum, multiplayer games together in the first place. And to add to that, we already have some social norms that we’ve been evolving as a community.\n\nOne such social norm the Gitcoin community has tried to set is that we need the community to be more involved in funding Ethereum’s “most public” digital public goods. We’ve done this by setting up quarterly matching rounds using [quadratic funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421), a novel mechanism designed by Vitalik, Glen Weyl, and Zoe Hitzig in 2018. The way this mechanism works is simple, projects in Ethereum can list themselves as public goods in need of funding, and participants can democratically allocate funds from a community managed matching pool by donating some of their own money. By its design, quadratic funding incentivizes every member of the community to fund the infrastructure they want to see in direct proportion to how useful it will be to them, providing a possible solution to our digital tragedy of the commons. \n\nTo date, this mechanism has distributed over $10mm to projects at their earliest stages, including WalletConnect, Uniswap, Prysmatic Labs, EIP-1559, and more. And all of their success is ours too as members of the Ethereum community.\n\nBut it's always worth questioning whether we're doing enough as web3 citizens. The questions that keep me up at night are how we might encourage more WalletConnects, BrightIDs, and even more quadratic funding mechanisms like Gitcoin Grants. How we might focus less on price and the whims of Twitter personalities, and more on the money, culture, and community legos we want to see in our ecosystem. How we might focus less on speculation and more on participation. \n\n## **It’s Time to Build (For the Public Good)**\n\nOver the coming weeks, Gitcoin will be making some announcements about how you can get involved in finding answers to these questions. We want to see more experimentation, and push the boundaries of what kind of public goods coordination is possible.\n\nOne experiment we’ve already started has been to bring more [community stewards](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41) into the fold, so that we can better understand the needs of those we’re serving in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAnother set of possible experiments, [as Vitalik outlined](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), are around NFTs:\n\n> Which NFTs people find attractive to buy, and which ones they do not, is a question of legitimacy: if everyone agrees that one NFT is interesting and another NFT is lame, then people will strongly prefer buying the first, because it would have both higher value for bragging rights and personal pride in holding it, and because it could be resold for more because everyone else is thinking in the same way. If the conception of legitimacy for NFTs can be pulled in a good direction, there is an opportunity to establish a solid channel of funding to artists, charities and others.\n\nHere, we've already seen some interesting developments on from PleasrDAO who in addition to purchasing Snowden's [first piece](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1383155552793026560) recently purchased a piece from the [Tor Project](https://twitter.com/trevortimm/status/1393333390003392512) to support their privacy efforts.\n\nBut for today, I'd like to start one more experiment right here on Mirror, by inviting anyone inspired by this post to contribute to the recently announced [public goods split address](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw).\n\n[For the Public Good](crowdfund://0x41eD7D49292b8FBF9b9311C1Cb4D6eB877646C58?network=homestead)\n\nI hope you'll participate, and that we'll find more experiments to explore together to support our shared infrastructure soon. \n\n**It’s time to build for the public good.**\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1621292233, "digest": "7nKKV4x17rVkZL9_C0vVL3Vax2rv1H1ciigleEgBAOw", "contributor": "0x48A63097E1Ac123b1f5A8bbfFafA4afa8192FaB0"}

While they may not draw from life as a form of `reporting-lived-experience-as-documentation`, works that pull on the thread of life can be memory-inducing.

For me, and others who experience two or more sensory inputs involuntarily, DJing soundscapes puts me into a trance-like state of flow.

In a way, perhaps there is a narrative to it all that I cannot comprehend. Oddly enough, I've been watching a show called [The Nevers](https://www.hbo.com/the-nevers) which has a character who can sing but she cannot understand what she is actually communicating. Even stranger, only a certain group of people can hear it too.

For being supporters of my experiments, I wanted to reward them a split from the proceeds of the sale from the 35-minute live session and essay.\n\nI believe redistribution at all levels should be explored.

Because SYNESTHESIA is auctioned through Zora's deployment of $BOUNTY and not on Mirror, 30% of those funds will be added as a tip to the two split contracts attached to this essay.\n\n**Why two separate splits?**\nTo emphasize proper attribution, I wanted to deploy one split contract with recipients that influenced the Secret Party Trilogy, SYNESTHESIA respectively.

The splits breakdown will derive from the sale of this essay, and both the Chinese Omelette OST + SYNESTHESIA NFMTs. Because SYNESTHESIA is auctioned through Zora's deployment of $BOUNTY and not on Mirror, 30% of those funds will be added as a tip to the two split contracts attached to this essay.\n\n**Why two separate splits?**\nTo emphasize proper attribution, I wanted to deploy one split contract with recipients that influenced the Secret Party Trilogy, SYNESTHESIA respectively. At the end of the auction period, the ETH within these splits will be claimable to the recipients below.

With MintMusic + Voyager Sound, we have an opportunity to fund musicians at scale.\n\n* *VS is home to many talented artists including Yobi Bryant, Big Zay, VFL (Visual Fabric Library), Skyler Rossa, Seeno, and many more affiliates.*\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1621306849, "digest": "kVKneiFoAnwbEVabds1Si7VqkeZPJbMXTDP31L34dKc", "contributor": "0xEB95ff72EAb9e8D8fdb545FE15587AcCF410b42E"}
{"id": "JEHq6VUSXMggz82WCvTrEFmSnejPvg67TyzXqXcdyms", "title": "In Vitro Nostalgia: Minting Memories", "body": "## Non-Fungible Memory Tokens [NFMTs]\n\nMemories. What do they reveal about you? What do they remind you of? A forgotten time? The nostalgia of an experience since passed? \n\nhttps://twitter.com/enaraxr/status/1355450773212172290?s=20\n\nAs combed through the various voice recordings on my iPhone, I found a selection of memories from a secret party in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. I didn't immediately think to make them into NFTs. It wasn't until I had gone through the motions on Zora and the audio looped that it clicked; this was the perfect experiment in documenting, sharing, and collecting memories.\n\nWhat could I reveal to the listener? Could they learn about me? And because we had all been deprived of events, could these moments hold deeper meaning to the fleeting nature of socialization? Did we take for granted the ever innocuous social gathering? I'm not sure. But these are questions that have continued to come into view the longer I've sat with these voice notes.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/178)\n\n \n\nClose your eyes, think of yourself either as the observer of the scene, or part of the scene, and let your mind paint the picture of the environment. Imagine where the DJ is, where the characters are, what type of house are you in? \n\nThe first of three notes in this trilogy called ***[\"Shīkurettopātī: One Night In Kurosakimachi\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/178)***, it's serendipitous that my phone picked up both a conversation I'm having about crate-digging at one of the only remaining Tower Record stores in the world *AND* amazing house music. The instrumentation swells with soulful synths as the conversation reaches a euphoric note as we resolve ourselves to buy records acknowledging how awesome the moment is.\n\nThe remaining two notes, ***[\"Not Now, But In The Future\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/189)*** and ***[\"Chinese Omelette OST\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/188)*** create this unintended effect of feeling like a short film with your own visual dreamscape constructing a memory that’s unique to you despite the fact that the audio is not your lived experience.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/189)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/188)\n\n*Chinese Omelette OST is the last remaining NFT of the Shīkurettopātī trilogy to be collected.*\n\nI've posted the NFTs in the order I believe to be the most chronologically accurate, although any DJ will tell you that there are many highs and lows in a set that when you *think* it's over, there is more around the corner! \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6985affa-945f-4a49-86f0-7f256904acbd.jpg?height=3024&width=3024)\n\n*Fig. A: Live band practice in Ext. of Beach House, Kurosaki Beach*\n\nI'd be super curious to see what YOU see, more so than my own recollection (and photo) of the space and the folks within it.\n\n\n---\n\n## Spatial Conversations\n\nIn the context of memories, archived works in many ways achieve a similar effect of nostalgia. While they may not draw from life as a form of `reporting-lived-experience-as-documentation`, works that pull on the thread of life can be memory-inducing. For me, one of those works is a live recording in 2014 of a freeform DJ set with my uni-mates after a day of getting unbelievably stoned called \"SYNESTHESIA\". \n\nYou might be wondering why it's called SYNESTHESIA. For me, and others who experience two or more sensory inputs involuntarily, DJing soundscapes puts me into a trance-like state of flow. I can see threads of light guiding me to my next note as if I'm being controlled. I really don't remember the act of playing only the fact that I've *played* a set. In a way, perhaps there is a narrative to it all that I cannot comprehend. Oddly enough, I've been watching a show called [The Nevers](https://www.hbo.com/the-nevers) which has a character who can sing but she cannot understand what she is actually communicating. Even stranger, only a certain group of people can hear it too. I haven't found a metaphor so closely aligned with my own personal experiences with music.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/1643)\n\nAs a treat to my uni-mates, and to break them into the NFT space, I decided to put [\"SYNESTHESIA\" up for auction with a 1.5 ETH reserve on Zora](https://zora.co/sirsu/1643), to show them one of the core principles that solidifies why crypto can lead to an equitable future. For being supporters of my experiments, I wanted to reward them a split from the proceeds of the sale from the 35-minute live session and essay.\n\nI believe redistribution at all levels should be explored. While there is nothing stopping me from gladly auctioning these NFTs without attribution, I am a firm believer in trying to capture the entire story involving my work. I am currently publishing an essay \"Creative Immortality\" that speaks to the inclusion of others as a necessary component to the preservation of work enabling the natural line of discovery to take place. \n\nAs creatives, we can never have enough inspiration.

{"id": "abBFFleDiUwU98eBYge4lxVW4jou6CX_bLq5uvb9_Ho", "title": "It's Time to Build (For the Public Good)", "body": "Last year, Marc Andreessen famously (or infamously) wrote “[It’s Time To Build](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/)”, in which he lamented the failure of our institutions to act decisively in the face of the pandemic, and more broadly to collectively imagine and build towards a better future. For many of us he argued, our complacency with the status quo traps us, and makes us reluctantly accept the world around us in place of meaningful action.\n\nThe beauty of the Ethereum ecosystem to me is that although we’re still a nascent community, rarely do we fall into such complacency. In web3, we continuously imagine new ways to coordinate, and build tools and social norms that allow us to play new kinds of positive-sum, multiplayer games. In fact, some of these tools disrupt even the (slightly more technologically inclined) status quo Marc Andreessen represents.\n\nOne way to think about the space in which we play all of these coordination games is as a [digital nation](https://metaversal.banklesshq.com/p/metaverse-as-digital-nations). This isn’t a [perfect analogy](https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1386658153014730760), and even some of the most diehard cypherpunks would agree we won’t be without nation states any time soon, but the metaverse we’re building does share some interesting similarities: in shared culture, shared values, and now shared currency.\n\nHistorically, social contracts have played an important role in helping us synthesize and reflexively check our values as citizens of shared spaces. In an ideal social contract, as early modern philosophers like [Rousseau](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/) have described, everyone forfeits some rights so that they might also impose selected duties. To do this without sacrificing freedom though there has to be a proper process for choosing what rights and duties we care about in the first place. We have to make the relevant proposals, achieve consensus, and in short - play the game.\n\nIn the 20th century, governments shaped these games and determined the rights and duties that underpin these social contracts. For example, in most democracies today, citizens agree to pay taxes in their shared currencies to fund and maintain basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, and electrical grids.\n\nIn the 21st century however, especially in the web3, we’re still coming to terms with what our shared contracts with each other are. In some corners of our space, we find ourselves asking if we should have any duties to each other at all. Somehow though, despite the fact that there’s no meta-government to appeal to, no local bank to borrow from, and no formal university to give us the knowledge we need, we manage to keep making progress. [DAOs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o) in particular have played an important role in this process, giving us structured ways to [collect](https://foundation.app/blog/pleasrdao), [invest](https://metacartel.xyz/), and [build](https://raidguild.org/) together.\n\nBut as Vitalik mentioned in his recent post on [legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), we still have work to do when it comes to creating new social norms to fund our public goods together. We need to use the power of our shared culture, values, and currency to create social norms that can take us out of the dark forest into the web3 citadel. Web3 is our city, it’s where we live, and we should take care of each other. \n\n\n## **What Are Public Goods?**\n\nIf you’re not already familiar, public goods are a special class of goods that are simultaneously non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable meaning it’s extremely difficult to stop someone from using the good, like roads and bridges, and non-rivalrous meaning that it’s abundant, and one person’s use of the good doesn’t substantially reduce the amount left for someone else (e.g. there’s more than enough air to go around). Public goods are critical, even selfishly, because we all rely on them - having a new car doesn’t matter if there are no roads to drive it on.\n\nIt’s worth noting that determining what is “truly public” can be a difficult task, and it’s something every community has to decide. One distinction that’s often drawn is between public goods and club goods, those goods like golf courses or membership only gyms that are excludable but non-rivalrous. But to make things more confusing even some of the things we consider public goods can be excludable given enough time and effort. For example, if you’re not a particularly good driver you might have your license revoked. If you’re an American, you might not always be allowed into Canada to use the roads in the first place. \n\nDigital public goods are by default more public, and hence less excludable. There are far fewer restrictions on how we use open source software because the cost of restriction is so much higher. A book in a library is only available locally to those with a library card, but the infrastructure to coordinate information online is accessible around the world. And of course now in web3 the infrastructure to coordinate value can be available to everyone as well.\n\nThis seems like a great thing at first, and it is, but there’s one major problem: the more accessible a good is, the less people want to pay for it. A government only has interest in funding its own roads, companies like Facebook only have interest in funding their own infrastructure (even when it comes to the kinds of open source software they focus on e.g. React), and yes even libraries generally only take care of the books within their walls. As Nadia Eghbal has [written about extensively](https://nayafia.substack.com/p/22-working-in-public), the goods that are most critical and most public are often the least funded. \n\n\n## **Funding Our Shared Infrastructure**\n\nThe good news is that together we can help solve these problems using our own shared web3 infrastructure, the kind that allows us to play positive-sum, multiplayer games together in the first place. And to add to that, we already have some social norms that we’ve been evolving as a community.\n\nOne such social norm the Gitcoin community has tried to set is that we need the community to be more involved in funding Ethereum’s “most public” digital public goods. We’ve done this by setting up quarterly matching rounds using [quadratic funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421), a novel mechanism designed by Vitalik, Glen Weyl, and Zoe Hitzig in 2018. The way this mechanism works is simple, projects in Ethereum can list themselves as public goods in need of funding, and participants can democratically allocate funds from a community managed matching pool by donating some of their own money. By its design, quadratic funding incentivizes every member of the community to fund the infrastructure they want to see in direct proportion to how useful it will be to them, providing a possible solution to our digital tragedy of the commons. \n\nTo date, this mechanism has distributed over $10mm to projects at their earliest stages, including WalletConnect, Uniswap, Prysmatic Labs, EIP-1559, and more. And all of their success is ours too as members of the Ethereum community.\n\nBut it's always worth questioning whether we're doing enough as web3 citizens. The questions that keep me up at night are how we might encourage more WalletConnects, BrightIDs, and even more quadratic funding mechanisms like Gitcoin Grants. How we might focus less on price and the whims of Twitter personalities, and more on the money, culture, and community legos we want to see in our ecosystem. How we might focus less on speculation and more on participation. \n\n## **It’s Time to Build (For the Public Good)**\n\nOver the coming weeks, Gitcoin will be making some announcements about how you can get involved in finding answers to these questions. We want to see more experimentation, and push the boundaries of what kind of public goods coordination is possible.\n\nOne experiment we’ve already started has been to bring more [community stewards](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41) into the fold, so that we can better understand the needs of those we’re serving in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAnother set of possible experiments, [as Vitalik outlined](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), are around NFTs:\n\n> Which NFTs people find attractive to buy, and which ones they do not, is a question of legitimacy: if everyone agrees that one NFT is interesting and another NFT is lame, then people will strongly prefer buying the first, because it would have both higher value for bragging rights and personal pride in holding it, and because it could be resold for more because everyone else is thinking in the same way. If the conception of legitimacy for NFTs can be pulled in a good direction, there is an opportunity to establish a solid channel of funding to artists, charities and others.\n\nHere, we've already seen some interesting developments on from PleasrDAO who in addition to purchasing Snowden's [first piece](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1383155552793026560) recently purchased a piece from the [Tor Project](https://twitter.com/trevortimm/status/1393333390003392512) to support their privacy efforts.\n\nBut for today, I'd like to start one more experiment right here on Mirror, by inviting anyone inspired by this post to contribute to the recently announced [public goods split address](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw).\n\n[For the Public Good](crowdfund://0x41eD7D49292b8FBF9b9311C1Cb4D6eB877646C58?network=homestead)\n\nI hope you'll participate, and that we'll find more experiments to explore together to support our shared infrastructure soon. \n\n**It’s time to build for the public good.**\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1621308485, "digest": "7nKKV4x17rVkZL9_C0vVL3Vax2rv1H1ciigleEgBAOw", "contributor": "0x48A63097E1Ac123b1f5A8bbfFafA4afa8192FaB0"}

As Nadia Eghbal has [written about extensively](https://nayafia.substack.com/p/22-working-in-public), the goods that are most critical and most public are often the least funded. \n\n\n## **Funding Our Shared Infrastructure**\n\nThe good news is that together we can help solve these problems using our own shared web3 infrastructure, the kind that allows us to play positive-sum, multiplayer games together in the first place. And to add to that, we already have some social norms that we’ve been evolving as a community.\n\nOne such social norm the Gitcoin community has tried to set is that we need the community to be more involved in funding Ethereum’s “most public” digital public goods. We’ve done this by setting up quarterly matching rounds using [quadratic funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421), a novel mechanism designed by Vitalik, Glen Weyl, and Zoe Hitzig in 2018. The way this mechanism works is simple, projects in Ethereum can list themselves as public goods in need of funding, and participants can democratically allocate funds from a community managed matching pool by donating some of their own money. By its design, quadratic funding incentivizes every member of the community to fund the infrastructure they want to see in direct proportion to how useful it will be to them, providing a possible solution to our digital tragedy of the commons. \n\nTo date, this mechanism has distributed over $10mm to projects at their earliest stages, including WalletConnect, Uniswap, Prysmatic Labs, EIP-1559, and more. And all of their success is ours too as members of the Ethereum community.\n\nBut it's always worth questioning whether we're doing enough as web3 citizens. The questions that keep me up at night are how we might encourage more WalletConnects, BrightIDs, and even more quadratic funding mechanisms like Gitcoin Grants. How we might focus less on price and the whims of Twitter personalities, and more on the money, culture, and community legos we want to see in our ecosystem. How we might focus less on speculation and more on participation. \n\n## **It’s Time to Build (For the Public Good)**\n\nOver the coming weeks, Gitcoin will be making some announcements about how you can get involved in finding answers to these questions. We want to see more experimentation, and push the boundaries of what kind of public goods coordination is possible.\n\nOne experiment we’ve already started has been to bring more [community stewards](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41) into the fold, so that we can better understand the needs of those we’re serving in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAnother set of possible experiments, [as Vitalik outlined](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), are around NFTs:\n\n> Which NFTs people find attractive to buy, and which ones they do not, is a question of legitimacy: if everyone agrees that one NFT is interesting and another NFT is lame, then people will strongly prefer buying the first, because it would have both higher value for bragging rights and personal pride in holding it, and because it could be resold for more because everyone else is thinking in the same way. If the conception of legitimacy for NFTs can be pulled in a good direction, there is an opportunity to establish a solid channel of funding to artists, charities and others.\n\nHere, we've already seen some interesting developments on from PleasrDAO who in addition to purchasing Snowden's [first piece](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1383155552793026560) recently purchased a piece from the [Tor Project](https://twitter.com/trevortimm/status/1393333390003392512) to support their privacy efforts.\n\nBut for today, I'd like to start one more experiment right here on Mirror, by inviting anyone inspired by this post to contribute to the recently announced [public goods split address](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw).\n\n[For the Public Good](crowdfund://0x41eD7D49292b8FBF9b9311C1Cb4D6eB877646C58?network=homestead)\n\nI hope you'll participate, and that we'll find more experiments to explore together to support our shared infrastructure soon. \n\n**It’s time to build for the public good.**\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1621308677, "digest": "7nKKV4x17rVkZL9_C0vVL3Vax2rv1H1ciigleEgBAOw", "contributor": "0x48A63097E1Ac123b1f5A8bbfFafA4afa8192FaB0"}
{"id": "vGM4AzkXDZM4ZUKdlWlwLaxIYQL44OF8yaFQ_2TxPQA", "title": "It's Time to Build (For the Public Good)", "body": "Last year, Marc Andreessen famously (or infamously) wrote “[It’s Time To Build](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/)”, in which he lamented the failure of our institutions to act decisively in the face of the pandemic, and more broadly to collectively imagine and build towards a better future. For many of us he argued, our complacency with the status quo traps us, and makes us reluctantly accept the world around us in place of meaningful action.\n\nThe beauty of the Ethereum ecosystem to me is that although we’re still a nascent community, rarely do we fall into such complacency. In web3, we continuously imagine new ways to coordinate, and build tools and social norms that allow us to play new kinds of positive-sum, multiplayer games. In fact, some of these tools disrupt even the (slightly more technologically inclined) status quo Marc Andreessen represents.\n\nOne way to think about the space in which we play all of these coordination games is as a [digital nation](https://metaversal.banklesshq.com/p/metaverse-as-digital-nations). This isn’t a [perfect analogy](https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1386658153014730760), and even some of the most diehard cypherpunks would agree we won’t be without nation states any time soon, but the metaverse we’re building does share some interesting similarities: in shared culture, shared values, and now shared currency.\n\nHistorically, social contracts have played an important role in helping us form these shared cultures and values especially. In an ideal social contract, as early modern philosophers like [Rousseau](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/) have described, everyone forfeits some rights so that they might also impose selected duties. To do this without sacrificing freedom though there has to be a proper process for choosing what rights and duties we care about in the first place. We have to make the relevant proposals, achieve consensus, and in short - play the game.\n\nIn the 20th century, governments principally shaped these games and determined the rights and duties that underpin our social contracts. For example, in most democracies today, citizens agree to pay taxes in their shared currencies to fund and maintain basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, and electrical grids.\n\nIn the 21st century however, especially in the web3, we’re still coming to terms with what our shared contracts with each other are. In some corners of our space, we find ourselves asking if we should have any duties to each other at all. Somehow though, despite the fact that there’s no meta-government to appeal to, no local bank to borrow from, and no formal university to give us the knowledge we need, we manage to keep making progress. [DAOs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o) in particular have played an important role in this process, giving us structured ways to [collect](https://foundation.app/blog/pleasrdao), [invest](https://metacartel.xyz/), and [build](https://raidguild.org/) together.\n\nBut as Vitalik mentioned in his recent post on [legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), we still have work to do when it comes to creating new social norms to fund our public goods together. We need to use the power of our shared culture, values, and currency to create social norms that can take us out of the dark forest into the web3 citadel. Web3 is our city, it’s where we live, and we should take care of each other. \n\n\n## **What Are Public Goods?**\n\nIf you’re not already familiar, public goods are a special class of goods that are simultaneously non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable meaning it’s extremely difficult to stop someone from using the good, like roads and bridges, and non-rivalrous meaning that it’s abundant, and one person’s use of the good doesn’t substantially reduce the amount left for someone else (e.g. there’s more than enough air to go around). Public goods are critical, even selfishly, because we all rely on them - having a new car doesn’t matter if there are no roads to drive it on.\n\nIt’s worth noting that determining what is “truly public” can be a difficult task, and it’s something every community has to decide. One distinction that’s often drawn is between public goods and club goods, those goods like golf courses or membership only gyms that are excludable but non-rivalrous. But to make things more confusing even some of the things we consider public goods can be excludable given enough time and effort. For example, if you’re not a particularly good driver you might have your license revoked. If you’re an American, you might not always be allowed into Canada to use the roads in the first place. \n\nDigital public goods are by default more public, and hence less excludable. There are far fewer restrictions on how we use open source software because the cost of restriction is so much higher. A book in a library is only available locally to those with a library card, but the infrastructure to coordinate information online is accessible around the world. And of course now in web3 the infrastructure to coordinate value can be available to everyone as well.\n\nThis seems like a great thing at first, and it is, but there’s one major problem: the more accessible a good is, the less people want to pay for it. A government only has interest in funding its own roads, companies like Facebook only have interest in funding their own infrastructure (even when it comes to the kinds of open source software they focus on e.g. React), and yes even libraries generally only take care of the books within their walls.

The way this mechanism works is simple, projects in Ethereum can list themselves as public goods in need of funding, and participants can democratically allocate funds from a community managed matching pool by donating some of their own money. By its design, quadratic funding incentivizes every member of the community to fund the infrastructure they want to see in direct proportion to how useful it will be to them, providing a possible solution to our digital tragedy of the commons. \n\nTo date, this mechanism has distributed over $10mm to projects at their earliest stages, including WalletConnect, Uniswap, Prysmatic Labs, EIP-1559, and more. And all of their success is ours too as members of the Ethereum community.\n\nBut it's always worth questioning whether we're doing enough as web3 citizens. The questions that keep me up at night are how we might encourage more WalletConnects, BrightIDs, and even more quadratic funding mechanisms like Gitcoin Grants. How we might focus less on price and the whims of Twitter personalities, and more on the money, culture, and community legos we want to see in our ecosystem. How we might focus less on speculation and more on participation. \n\n## **It’s Time to Build (For the Public Good)**\n\nOver the coming weeks, Gitcoin will be making some announcements about how you can get involved in finding answers to these questions. We want to see more experimentation, and push the boundaries of what kind of public goods coordination is possible.\n\nOne experiment we’ve already started has been to bring more [community stewards](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41) into the fold, so that we can better understand the needs of those we’re serving in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAnother set of possible experiments, [as Vitalik outlined](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), are around NFTs:\n\n> Which NFTs people find attractive to buy, and which ones they do not, is a question of legitimacy: if everyone agrees that one NFT is interesting and another NFT is lame, then people will strongly prefer buying the first, because it would have both higher value for bragging rights and personal pride in holding it, and because it could be resold for more because everyone else is thinking in the same way. If the conception of legitimacy for NFTs can be pulled in a good direction, there is an opportunity to establish a solid channel of funding to artists, charities and others.\n\nHere, we've already seen some interesting developments on from PleasrDAO who in addition to purchasing Snowden's [first piece](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1383155552793026560) recently purchased a piece from the [Tor Project](https://twitter.com/trevortimm/status/1393333390003392512) to support their privacy efforts.\n\nBut for today, I'd like to start one more experiment right here on Mirror, by inviting anyone inspired by this post to contribute to the recently announced [public goods split address](https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw).\n\n[For the Public Good](crowdfund://0x41eD7D49292b8FBF9b9311C1Cb4D6eB877646C58?network=homestead)\n\nI hope you'll participate, and that we'll find more experiments to explore together to support our shared infrastructure soon. \n\n**It’s time to build for the public good.**\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1621308972, "digest": "7nKKV4x17rVkZL9_C0vVL3Vax2rv1H1ciigleEgBAOw", "contributor": "0x48A63097E1Ac123b1f5A8bbfFafA4afa8192FaB0"}
{"id": "uhuedA_6eYOuGtZFQIhKkKMefd8MgorryxETP4WTBxQ", "title": "It's Time to Build (For the Public Good)", "body": "Last year, Marc Andreessen famously (or infamously) wrote “[It’s Time To Build](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/)”, in which he lamented the failure of our institutions to act decisively in the face of the pandemic, and more broadly to collectively imagine and build towards a better future. For many of us he argued, our complacency with the status quo traps us, and makes us reluctantly accept the world around us in place of meaningful action.\n\nThe beauty of the Ethereum ecosystem to me is that although we’re still a nascent community, rarely do we fall into such complacency. In web3, we continuously imagine new ways to coordinate, and build tools and social norms that allow us to play new kinds of positive-sum, multiplayer games. In fact, some of these tools disrupt even the (slightly more technologically inclined) status quo Marc Andreessen represents.\n\nOne way to think about the space in which we play all of these coordination games is as a [digital nation](https://metaversal.banklesshq.com/p/metaverse-as-digital-nations). This isn’t a [perfect analogy](https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1386658153014730760), and even some of the most diehard cypherpunks would agree we won’t be without nation states any time soon, but the metaverse we’re building does share some interesting similarities: in shared culture, shared values, and now shared currency.\n\nHistorically, social contracts have played an important role in helping us form these shared national cultures and values. In an ideal social contract, as early modern philosophers like [Rousseau](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/) have described, everyone forfeits some rights so that they might also impose selected duties. To do this without sacrificing freedom though there has to be a proper process for choosing what rights and duties we care about in the first place. We have to continuously make relevant proposals, achieve consensus, and in short - play the game.\n\nIn the 20th century, governments principally shaped these games and determined the rights and duties that underpin our social contracts. For example, in most democracies today, citizens agree to pay taxes in their shared currencies to fund and maintain basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, and electrical grids.\n\nIn the 21st century however, especially in the web3, we’re still coming to terms with what our shared contracts with each other are. In some corners of our space, we find ourselves asking if we should have any duties to each other at all. Somehow though, despite the fact that there’s no meta-government to appeal to, no local bank to borrow from, and no formal university to give us the knowledge we need, we manage to keep making progress. [DAOs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o) in particular have played an important role in this process, giving us structured ways to [collect](https://foundation.app/blog/pleasrdao), [invest](https://metacartel.xyz/), and [build](https://raidguild.org/) together.\n\nBut as Vitalik mentioned in his recent post on [legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), we still have work to do when it comes to creating new social norms to fund our public goods together. We need to use the power of our shared culture, values, and currency to create social norms that can take us out of the dark forest into the web3 citadel. Web3 is our city, it’s where we live, and we should take care of each other. \n\n\n## **What Are Public Goods?**\n\nIf you’re not already familiar, public goods are a special class of goods that are simultaneously non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable meaning it’s extremely difficult to stop someone from using the good, like roads and bridges, and non-rivalrous meaning that it’s abundant, and one person’s use of the good doesn’t substantially reduce the amount left for someone else (e.g. there’s more than enough air to go around). Public goods are critical, even selfishly, because we all rely on them - having a new car doesn’t matter if there are no roads to drive it on.\n\nIt’s worth noting that determining what is “truly public” can be a difficult task, and it’s something every community has to decide. One distinction that’s often drawn is between public goods and club goods, those goods like golf courses or membership only gyms that are excludable but non-rivalrous. But to make things more confusing even some of the things we consider public goods can be excludable given enough time and effort. For example, if you’re not a particularly good driver you might have your license revoked. If you’re an American, you might not always be allowed into Canada to use the roads in the first place. \n\nDigital public goods are by default more public, and hence less excludable. There are far fewer restrictions on how we use open source software because the cost of restriction is so much higher. A book in a library is only available locally to those with a library card, but the infrastructure to coordinate information online is accessible around the world. And of course now in web3 the infrastructure to coordinate value can be available to everyone as well.\n\nThis seems like a great thing at first, and it is, but there’s one major problem: the more accessible a good is, the less people want to pay for it. A government only has interest in funding its own roads, companies like Facebook only have interest in funding their own infrastructure (even when it comes to the kinds of open source software they focus on e.g. React), and yes even libraries generally only take care of the books within their walls. As Nadia Eghbal has [written about extensively](https://nayafia.substack.com/p/22-working-in-public), the goods that are most critical and most public are often the least funded. \n\n\n## **Funding Our Shared Infrastructure**\n\nThe good news is that together we can help solve these problems using our own shared web3 infrastructure, the kind that allows us to play positive-sum, multiplayer games together in the first place. And to add to that, we already have some social norms that we’ve been evolving as a community.\n\nOne such social norm the Gitcoin community has tried to set is that we need the community to be more involved in funding Ethereum’s “most public” digital public goods.

{"id": "A_Ky1w9VLAiGrAMMUgMTWtpGH2GrFP1EoED-y4dYZnQ", "title": "The journey to releasing my first NFT", "body": "After more than 7 months of checking out the Web3 (crypto) space — reading on how blockchain tech works, and projects being made here and there — I recently minted my first NFT.\n\n***Note:** Everything mentioned here are my experiences in the Ethereum blockchain. Always remember to check whether the wallet and the platform you're minting on are on the same blockchain network.*\n\n-----\n\n### How did I find out about NFTs, Web3, and stuff\nBefore I share how I got to mint my first NFT, let me share how the fuck did I get in to this wild world of crypto and Web3.\n\nI don't recall exactly how, but I'm sure it's because of how [**RAC**](https://twitter.com/rac) — a Grammy-award winning producer — has back-to-back projects happening in the space. I think this was around October 2020, but I'd like to assume I've heard of these even earlier.\n\nFrom NFTs, the super wild [**$TAPE**](https://zora.co/rac/tape) project — a token representing a physical cassette tape, — to issuing his own social token, [**$RAC**](https://blog.ourzora.com/introducing-rac), where token holders can have access to a private area in his Discord server, get discounts to merch, or even get to interact with him more.\n\nI also was introduced to Audius because of one stream he did on Twitch! [**Audius**](https://audius.co/feed) is like Soundcloud, except you (the artist) have a say on what happens to the platform. You want to have a subscription feature? Vote using the tokens given to you every time you post! **The platform's future is in the artists' hands.**\n\nAll these projects were so fascinating to see. With more focus on NFTs, the mere fact that digital artists can make a living out of JUST doing things digitally is amazing to me. No need to print your digital works as stickers, prints, posters, etc. Blockchain technology made it possible for one specific file to be called THE official one. Because of that, all the other copies scattered around the internet, and the ones to be made by saving a copy of the same file, are worthless. **The original file gets value.**\n\n### How I was able to mint my first NFT\n\nMinting (*making*) an NFT can cost around US$40-$100 in gas (*transaction*) fees on a good day, and a disgusting $400-$800 on a bad one (although why would you mint during a bad day, lol). Gas fees don’t go to the platform, but rather the people running the whole Ethereum network.\n\nIn the Philippines, $40 is already 10+% of what an entry level employee is making monthly, while $100 is like 1/3 of the same salary. **Anyway, bottomline, it's just so fucking expensive for people here.**\n\n![Sees how much I need to mint an NFT](https://media.giphy.com/media/Y4JE51QwzefMLfknfq/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\nI honestly considered saving up for a mint fund, in hopes that I can get my money back and more. That doesn't mean I'm just here for the money. I'm also here for people to validate that my work has value, maybe even greater than what I would've expected.\n\nPosting on Instagram and Twitter, getting likes for my posts, and I can't make a living out of it because all the money goes to the platforms?! **I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THIS LOGIC AFTER KNOWING ABOUT NFTs.** Did I mention that if your NFT is resold in the secondary market, you get a cut of the resale???!!!\n\nThen, while I was looking around the Creator x Crypto side of Twitter, I discovered Mint Fund.\n\n[**Mint Fund**](https://twitter.com/themintfund) is a community project that helps artists in being able to mint their first NFT by giving a grant that's enough to cover for gas fees. **They prioritize funds to BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ artists especially outside North America and Europe.** They are also working on great projects for the space like making a crowdfund for an open-source protocol.\n\nI signed up for the grant a week after they launched, but sadly didn't get in the first batch. It just meant that I was still on the waitlist! I got an email around mid or late April saying that I got in the second batch. GURL, I WAS SHOOKT. I SAW THE EMAIL WHEN I WOKE UP. Now THAT's how you start a good day!\n\n![Walking out of my bedroom after seeing the email](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT1R9ZbWoZgo0leM5G/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\n***Side Note:** For artists in South East Asia, you might also want to apply at [**First Mint Fund**](https://twitter.com/firstmintfund)! It's another community project giving grants to artists so that they can mint their first NFT.*\n\n### Minting process\n\nY'all... minting an NFT is ***EASY AS FUUUUUUUCK.*** Uploaded the file, entered some details, clicked \"Proceed\", set up a price, and I'm done. No complicated shit!\n\nBut if you're starting from nowhere, you should get an Ethereum wallet (like [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/)) first, AND WRITE THAT SEED PHRASE DOWN (YES, THE 12 RANDOM WORDS). The seed phrase is like the ultimate password. Lose it, lose everything in your wallet.\n\nNow with that wallet, you can start connecting it to platforms like Zora, Rarible, Foundation, and more. If the platform is open to the public to mint on it, then go ahead!\n\nFor NFT platforms on the Tezos blockchain, like *hic et nunc* and Kalamint, I think Temple is one of the most used wallets there.\n\nAgain, EZ SHIT! But I do understand that it can get, or it looks overwhelming. If that's the case, just shoot me a DM on Twitter ([**@belgiangwaffles**](https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles))! I'll be happy to help you out. 😊\n\n### And here it is...\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3003)\n\nI'll be posting soon what the piece is about.\n*But for now... you might wanna... you know... make a bid or sumn...* 🥺👉👈\n\n### Zora as my chosen platform\n\nI chose [**Zora**](https://zora.co/) as the platform where I'll mint my first NFT for various reasons.\n- I feel like it's not as saturated as other open platforms.\n- They don't get a cut from my sale.\n- I have the option to not have a timed auction being started when somebody bids with my asking price.\n\n    I just feel like that it hypes the price more than the artwork itself, which I don't want to be the case. Also, I want to be able to pick who gets my piece, and not just someone because it was automated. The owner is as important as the piece, IMO.\n\n- Also, from my understanding, I can sell the same NFT on other platforms with the creator share still attached to it, so I am not stuck with Zora.\n\n    I have to verify if I understood this correctly. 💀\n\n- Lastly, I don't want to set my asking price with ETH. Speaking of...\n\n### Fun Fact: I'm not selling it for money.\n\n~~Now this, I think, is what the locals don't know, especially the outsiders hating on all of this, lmao.~~ Depending on where you mint your NFT, you can choose to sell your works NOT for money — ETH, or stablecoins (crypto that will forever be worth $1) like DAI or USDT — but for social tokens.\n\n![Yes. I'm not asking for money.](https://media.giphy.com/media/SXeezvYc8uRUc/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580)\n\nRemember the $RAC token I was talking about earlier? I'm asking for something like that.\n\nIt's like exchanging a print, postcard, painting, whatever, for access to someone's Netflix account for a period of time, or live in the buyer's house for a month. Sure, these things have monetary value, and so does social tokens, but I'm not interested in that.\n\nMy asking price is **60 $FWB** ([**Friends with Benefits**](https://fwb.help/)) which is enough for me to enter the FWB Discord server and apply to be a member. The membership, for me, is a way to widen my network especially with fellow creators in the crypto space. I want to get to know more people, see what kind of crazy projects they're up to, learn from them, exchange ideas, and maybe just chill with them as well. That's what I wish to get in exchange for my NFT.\n\nActually, you can swap your crypto to FWB. My asking price could've been the ETH or DAI equivalent of 60 FWB, but I think that's an easier route. For me, it means way more if someone from FWB sees my work and actually bids on it with their FWB tokens. It's like a cosign from a member, **legitimizing that I SHOULD be with them.**\n\n### What's next?\n\n~~Win the fuckin’ $WRITE Race!!!~~\n\nMy next goal is to join a social token community or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)! I want to know how these things work in a member's perspective, especially if I have a say on the governance of the community or organization.\n\nTHE MONEY SIDE OF CRYPTO IS TOO BORING FOR ME. The People side of crypto is where the fun is all at.\n\nI already got some $FF by [**Forefront**](https://forefront.market/). So I think I'm about to experience some of that soon.\n\nBut for now, let's **#GetGianInFWB** LMAOOOOOOO. (Yeah, tweet that hashtag.)\n## 😂 😂 💀 💀\n\n[](https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles/status/1392969582449598465?s=20)\n\n*Me when I got access to Mirror's member-only Discord...*\n\nBTW, huge thank you to [**Jackson Dame**](https://dame.mirror.xyz/) who edited my work. I met them because of the $WRITE Race!\n\nIf you like this post, feel free to to send in a tip (accepts ETH only)!
