I am grateful to my parents, my wife, and my genes (and anyone else responsible too). It is such a superpower.\n\nI don’t just mean optimism. I mean saying nice things about people. I mean keeping a smile on your face. I mean positivity in all things. I do have my moments of negativity, but they come infrequently and go away quickly.\n\nI saw Magic Johnson say something nice about the Lakers last night and I texted my son that I appreciate how Magic is always so positive. He always has a smile on his face. He is always saying nice things. I am sure he was a vicious competitor on the court, but he did it nicely.\n\nI recall when David Karp was building Tumblr, he refused to have comments. He refused to have downvotes. The only user engagement was a heart and a repost. He told me he wanted to emphasize positivity and de-emphasize negativity. And Tumblr was a very positive place to be during its heyday.\n\nFor every negative thought, there is a positive counter thought. If you don’t like the Celtics, maybe you like the Knicks. If you don’t like Trump, maybe you like Biden. If you don’t like Bitcoin, maybe you like Ethereum. It is a pretty simple move, and also a very powerful move, to focus on what you like versus what you don’t like.\n\nDoing this not only can change how others feel about you, it can change how you feel about yourself. I highly recommend it. I hope it becomes a trend. We would all be happier and nicer. Social media would be tolerable.

As I thought about how we're all experiencing this collective moment, comforting friends, sharpening our Twitter fingers, and grieving lost ones, the word liminality came to mind. Since then, I haven't been able to get the word out of my head, so I looked it up, like [listening to the end of a song]([https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/03/21/heres-how-get-song-out-your-head/99264896/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/03/21/heres-how-get-song-out-your-head/99264896/)) to resolve the tension. \n\nLiminality [can be defined as follows:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality)\n\n> In anthropology, liminality (from the Latin word līmen, meaning \"a threshold\") is the quality of ambiguity or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of a rite of passage, when participants no longer hold their pre-ritual status but have not yet begun the transition to the status they will hold when the rite is complete. During a rite's liminal stage, participants \"stand at the threshold\" between their previous way of structuring their identity, time, or community, and a new way, which completing the rite establishes.\n\nPut differently, it's like [a space between two worlds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUGEdttx04k), a stage between stages.\n\nPer the table below (yes, it's Wikipedia, feel free to refute the vibes) there are different types of liminality, based on the participant, and their respective perspective(s):\n\n![https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9e216fd3-140e-4cda-93a5-057439af017b.jpeg?height=797&width=1716](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9e216fd3-140e-4cda-93a5-057439af017b.jpeg?height=797&width=1716)\n\nPer the above, liminality can be in respect to time (entering into periods of war, celebration, forgiveness), physical space (crossing borders like Ellis Island, traveling across biomes), and cultural space (rites of passage, joining clubs or cultures, experiences with different cultures).

For instance, if one wants to calculate the volume of a 3-dimensional shape, one might take the area of a small slice of the shape, and then sum the areas of the slices. If we look at the years and years of our lives, we can see that our lives are also made up of millions and millions of moments where we take or are taken by action. This is both empowering and disenchanting. When we look at the way that stories have been, are, and always will be told, we seem to prefer [distinct points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOGru_4z1Vc&t=22s) in a story.

I brushed it off as buggy AI, and went to the local farmer's market. Determined to have a productive day, I bought a cold brew Blue Bottle Coffee as well as a warm green tea.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ae7bd94c-a134-4651-9dee-f6ef8c4c4874.jpeg?height=1082&width=1080)\n\nLater that day, as the caffeine wore off, I started to feel worse. My team and I were trying to launch something important, and it was important that I stay focused. Eventually I checked my temperature, and it was 101 F. Fever!\n\nAs I went to lie down, I checked on Whoop again, and saw that my heart rate was above 100bps. Internally I was straining at some invisible enemy -- and probably been for hours or days already. \n\nIf I had paid more credence to the data I was collecting, I would have realized this. The problem is, I wasn't ready to accept that these health devices were more than gimmicks. Even though I wanted to believe in this technology, my brain hadn't accepted that a 1% recovery score actually meant that I needed to rest.\n\nBut reflecting on this new evidence, it was amazing to me that the Whoop strap had seemed to predict my fever better than I could have. I certainly didn't have a fever when I woke up in the morning, and so Whoop's algorithm, which sums heart rate variability and respiration, must have been able to deduce that my body was going through some major stress.\n\nThe next day when I woke up, I eagerly checked the Whoop stats again, and it was 1% again! My fever was worse than ever, and so I called a doctor over Zoom and we decided on a treatment on antibiotics.\n\nAfter two days of taking the antibiotic, I had no reason to think that I was getting better. I penned the doctors, questioning whether they had made a mistake with the antibiotics. I was feeling terrible, and my temperature was still 103.8 F.\n\nThe only thing that was improving was my Whoop recovery score — it had gone from 1% to 9% to 16%. \"It's crazy, but maybe I should just trust this thing?\" I remember thinking. After all, it had predicted my descent *into* illness, maybe it could predict my flight out of illness as well.\n\nThe next day, I still felt bad, but my recovery score had gone up again, reaching a high mark of 62% that suggested that my body was healing. Around this time, the fever started to fluctuate below 100 F for the first time in days.\n\nFinally, on the 7th day, I woke up and my fever had broken. I noticed that I was sweating for the first time during the entire ordeal, and the fever had descended into the 90s. My recovery score was 82%.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/df764b92-8ac2-46ca-8f3e-8d072ebac347.jpeg?height=1428&width=1080)\n\nSo it turned out that Whoop was exceptionally good at predicting my descent into fever and my recovery. This was quite amazing, and I can say that I'm ready to trust these stats more and use them to inform my recovery. Quite excited to do so, actually.\n\n", "timestamp": 1617057707, "digest": "O7d5ywOAccDjlISupZP93kMlB3s13nNY7xan8mtFlK8", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn’t meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you’d think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend’s living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn’t just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it’s not just a technology. It’s a philosophy. It’s a belief system. It’s a way of viewing the world. It’s about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you’re batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the “aha moment” when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn’t have to sign up for Stripe. I didn’t have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn’t have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas. But a couple months ago I read a [manifesto](https://cryptomedia.wtf/) by [Zora](https://zora.co/) that changed how I thought about crypto.\n\nIt described a world where crypto could be used to give any digital media file (eg an image, a song, an essay, digital art, etc.) property rights. It explained how cryptonetworks could turn digital media into liquid financial assets, secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.\n\nAlthough the individual ideas weren’t new, they were combined and articulated in a way that just made sense. And not just to me.\n\n[Digital artists](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9), [athletes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html), [social media influencers](https://cryptoslate.com/logan-paul-nfts-sell-3-5-million-worth-on-first-day-of-release/), [tech executives](https://scottbelsky.medium.com/the-furry-lisa-cryptoart-the-new-economy-of-digital-creativity-6cb2300ea081), [media executives](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI), and [journalists](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1366554892035219462) that never took the crypto weirdos seriously, seem to be taking notice.\n\nBut let’s be real. Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there’s been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it’s a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it’s a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn’t just a technological revolution. It’s also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I’m old and senile, I believe we’ll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that’ll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it’s at least worth trying.", "timestamp": 1617063909, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

With this being my first entry *on* Mirror I figure it can serve as an introduction to help provide context for future entries. What follows are a few personal anecdotes and speculation on things like cultural protocols, social(ish) interfaces, absolutely devouring fresh pizza in the mountains and possibilities for sustaining creative practices. Elaborations on prior work and thinking to set up both *why Mirror* and *what might it be*?\n\nWith some patience, and since everything connects, let’s go into the weeds (a little.) I’m not suggesting any of it’s interesting, or to imply singular solutions to complex issues, but as a form of personal sense-making for myself and those who care enough (or just have the time) to continue reading.\n\nThis will be a small series, and this is part one ✌️\n\n---\n\nI’d been working for several years on a project called [Cargo](https://cargo.site) a, personal publishing platform for designers, musicians, architects, photographers and the like. People creatively minded. I landed an early invite to the project in 2009 after spending days exploring [Space Collective](https://spacecollective.org), another project by the same team. “Where forward thinking terrestrials exchange ideas and information about the state of the species, their planet and the universe, living the lives of science fiction today.” It’s still an absolute favorite, and I’ve never seen anything else like it.\n\nThe invite enabled me to create my own site using the tools which had been developed for Space Collective, now white-labeled and able to be associated with any domain. In addition to a selection of designs you also had full access to the `html` and `css`. With that level of access I couldn’t stop messing with it. It was the first time I’d seen `AJAX`. It was also an introduction to unfamiliar culture like paintings by Bosch, design from Emil Ruder, or quotes of Timothy Leary—all examples of the filler content used instead of uninspired *lorum ipsum*. The designs were focused, mostly typographic, and emphasized the work over interface. “*The content is the Cargo*.” A couple days after receiving the invite an email hit my inbox.\n\n> “So you keep changing the design of your Cargo site, do you want to visit us in Los Angeles?”\n\nMy family is in the music industry, and I was touring that summer as a for-hire drummer in a group I had no interest in. I’m grateful to have gotten a first hand look at life as touring musician before having spent years chasing it, and parts of it were fun. Waking up in a new city each day, traveling on a tour bus, and (sounds corny) the energy you feel when performing live. But I realized it wasn’t something for me to pursue long term.\n\nWhat got me excited was the internet. Or… not the internet as some discrete entity, but the possibility it affords. I stopped going to school at age 10 to basically surf online all day with no curriculum. *Un-schooling*. We lived in a small town in central Pennsylvania. The browser window was literally a *window* where access to the entire world was possible. And not only that; you could contribute to building that world by uploading, too. \n\n---\n\nAfter Cargo had extended the offer there wasn’t much of an internal debate. I hopped a flight from Nashville to Los Angeles to be the first full time hire on the Cargo team. Still unsure exactly *how* that happened.\n\nA concern that grew over time was that of *attribution*. In addition to creating sites for presenting ones’ own work, many created image blogs. Some of them [my favorites](http://haw-lin.com/). Most were good about crediting the sources for images, but it was an impossible thing for us to keep track of—and not our place to chase people down. The livelihood of anyone creative depends upon their work being shared and credited, so it was important to us[^1].\n\n![Scenes from Cargo, 2010–2016](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f6da73f5-60f0-49b1-a9fc-e163acf3655f.jpeg?height=1300&width=2600)\n\nClicking around one afternoon [MediaChain](http://www.mediachain.io) by [Denis Nazarov](https://mirror.xyz), [Jesse Walden](https://jessewalden.com) and crew scrolled into view(port.) “*Mediachain is a singular data fabric for open-first media applications.*” More clicking around revealed some relation to Ethereum. Although friends had been involved in the cryptocurrency space for some time I had avoided it, aside from attempting to mine Dogecoin[^2] late one night. At least Doge was explicitly a joke when so many other projects postured as *not*… which is generally the case when something *is*.\n\nI began reading through the documentation for the *Mediachain Attribution Engine* and it appeared directly related to the problem at Cargo. It was around this time I also came across IPFS.\n\nSometime in 2017 I left Cargo to pursue projects touching on these questions of attribution, data ownership and archival. If you *are* your data, you should *own* your data. Or at least to the same degree that your mind or body are your own. Coming from a cultural project, I looked at these questions through a cultural lens. *What form could a cultural protocol take?*\n\nFundamentally, culture wants to propagate—information wants to be free. So I began looking into the peer-to-peer space. The work happening around [Decentralized Archive Transport](https://dat.foundation) (Dat Protocol) caught my eye. It’s a torrent-like network, with features like versioning, and is good for everything static files based. Turns out a website is essentially a collection of static files, and the [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) team had realized just that, building a browser with the `dat://` protocol baked in. Being a peer on the network meant what you visited then worked offline—going offline being the *ultimate luxury* these days.\n\n![Scenes from Peer-to-Peer Web, 2018](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0db76df3-48fc-45a9-b7da-312918bd173b.jpeg?height=1300&width=2600)\n\nI began working on projects utilizing `dat`, including an experimental publishing tool called *Enoki*. Perhaps the most meaningful contribution was organizing a series of relaxed afternoons about decentralized publishing and culture called *Peer-to-Peer Web*. Instead of convening in tech offices we met in spaces such as the [Los Angeles Contemporary Archive](http://www.lacarchive.com/), the [School For Poetic Computation](https://sfpc.io/), and [Folder Studio](https://folder.studio/#projects/parergon). Events took place in Los Angeles, New York, and Berlin. [Callil Capuozzo](https://callil.com) who organized the New York hang now happens to be the lead designer at [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org). Small world.\n\nAround this time I was living in New York, and in addition to peer-to-peer publishing projects I took a few commissions. One of those was for the design and development of a featured editorial for Bloomberg News about the [Ethereum DAO Exploit](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-the-ether-thief/) written by [Matt Leising](https://twitter.com/mattleising). They gave me a desk in their Midtown Manhattan office for the month, where both the Bloomberg Terminal and Bloomberg News are created directly beside each-other. This was also peak ICO boom of 2017. You couldn’t get a coffee in Brooklyn without hearing someone shilling a shitcoin. A special type of hell that helped solidify my position at the time that crypto is largely a toxic (and energy intensive) continuation of the financialization of everything. Solutions desperate for problems.\n\n---\n\nAfter several years of staring at screens I was getting a little burnt out. While living in Los Angeles I enjoyed going on day hikes in the [San Gabriel Mountains](https://www.are.na/jon-kyle-mohr/san-gabriels) on weekends. Reading about the Sierra Nevada and looking at topographic maps was my favorite form of escapism when living in New York. After returning to California I decided to hike the [Pacific Crest Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail), a 2650 mile path running from Mexico to Canada along the mountains spanning the west coast.\n\nWhat I expected to be a break from technology ended up being four months of walking a marathon (or two) each day while contemplating technology, perception, environment and how it all overlaps.\n\n![Scenes from the PCT, 2019](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fa71a599-1da0-44bc-a896-2749c614dba4.jpeg?height=1300&width=2600)\n\nAfter a four day stretch of one-hundred(ish) miles and relative isolation all I could think about was food. At the end of a long leg like this it’s the ultimate motivation, and at a certain point becomes the only thing you can think about. That is to say; you start thinking with your stomach instead of your head. Up until agricultural abundance most humans did—pretty recent on the planetary time scale. When moving at a biological pace—walking with two feet—across distances long enough to register as “*substantial*” when looking at a globe, and through an environment which has shaped your evolution over millennia, your sense of scale adapts to become more planetary. This as opposed to scrolling while staring at a dumb screen. I digress…\n\nAnother day of slogging along the trail behind me, I arrived at a clearing in the woods. A gas station—the only structure around for at least an hour drive. I walked through the door and ordered a pizza. I literally *could not believe it*. It was absolute magic. How the fuck does this pizza exist *here*? And how can I hand over a piece of *plastic* and begin immediately recovering calories without having to like, apprentice for a month? In that moment everyday occurrences summed up into something totally euphoric. Again, it’s worth emphasizing the difference between thinking with your head vs your stomach. One is logical and the other is evolutionary, or something… literally head vs gut. It’s like, in that moment of eating pizza after walking 100 miles I was experiencing the collective shock of all my ancestors at what is possible today, as if they were there to see it, too.\n\nI was telling this story to a friend recently and he said, “You sound like the ultimate block chain bro. Going on some hiking pilgrimage and having epiphanies about the role of capital.” Shit! I’m unsure how to articulate much of this without it sounding totally ridiculous. I mean… it is 🤷\n\n---\n\nAlthough seemingly disparate, all of this connects directly in my mind. The state of publishing online over the past decade—from blogs to websites to stories. Questions of data ownership and attribution, and what it means to centralize around the creator—not the platform. The environments we find ourselves in, what they afford, and how we shape them.\n\nSo this is how it’s been.  \nIt’s now a question of *where it’s at*.\n\nTest\n\nPart two will follow soon enough.  \nStay in the loop by [subscribing to updates](https://jon-kyle.com/subscribe).\n\n[^1]: It’s also a saturation issue. Reverse Google Image search often returns pages of Pinterest boards as sources. All unattributed.\n[^2]: Shit… really should’ve held onto that wallet 🙃\n", "timestamp": 1617063917, "digest": "DkE-9_u8B9BdJYwWYSDN80ZKUpwk5fenwIaSHPP2VvA", "contributor": "0xFf37A713c920F6e94043D10c1230e30B13F4d500"}

I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn’t meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you’d think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend’s living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn’t just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it’s not just a technology. It’s a philosophy. It’s a belief system. It’s a way of viewing the world. It’s about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you’re batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood.

But I am writing again as there is likely to be a bunch of chatter about Dapper, Flow, and NBA Top Shot as the news of a financing round comes out today.\n\nFinancings don’t really interest me but companies do. And this is a fascinating company.\n\nDapper Labs came out of an incubator called Axiom Zen back in 2017. The Axiom Zen team was looking at interesting things they could build using Ethereum. They contributed to [the ERC 721 standard for non-fungible tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) and started building an NFT collectible game that became [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/). That got our attention and led to a financing that spun out the team and Cryptokitties into [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/). I wrote [a short post on the USV blog announcing that we had invested in Cryptokitties](https://www.usv.com/writing/2018/03/cryptokitties-2/), but in truth, we invested in much more. We are only seeing the entire vision now.\n\nAfter building a few more collectible experiences on Ethereum, the Dapper Labs team concluded that the NFT experiences they wanted to create needed a different blockchain and they started building [Flow](https://www.coinbase.com/price/flow). Flow is [a proof of stake blockchain](https://www.onflow.org/) that was designed from the ground up for consumer experiences that require scale and performance and more.\n\nAnd then they started building NBA Top Shot on Flow. That required a deal with the NBA which they made happen a few years ago. And it required Flow to launch. And it required a crypto wallet experience that was tightly integrated into the game that allowed new users to fund their wallets with credit cards in addition to crypto assets. Building all of that was quite a task but they got it all done by the middle of last year and launched NBA Top Shot into beta last summer.\n\nSlowly but surely Dapper let more users into NBA Top Shot and iterated on the experience and by the end of the year, they had a hit on their hands. [Hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions a month](https://evaluate.market/) happen between collectors on NBA Top Shot. Pack drops sell out more or less instantly.\n\nThe success of NBA Top Shot has led many developers to Flow seeking to build additional collectible experiences and I expect that we will see many more great games and experiences on Flow in the coming months and years.\n\nIt is rare in the crypto sector to find a team that has successfully launched a blockchain, a wallet, and a number of popular applications. The Dapper team has done all of that and I am excited to watch what they do next.\n", "timestamp": 1617109572, "digest": "NgwM2jeC_y7ueMsX147W1ZiQz4oj2vjObykEWF4Heno", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

Credit: BBC](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/121F7/production/_117713247_screen_sueztrafficjam_phr1b_20210325.jpg)\n\n\nIn response to COVID, we've all mapped out our work schedules, habits, and rituals to adjust to working, schooling, and living at home. As I thought about how we're all experiencing this collective moment, comforting friends, sharpening our Twitter fingers, and grieving lost ones, the word liminality came to mind. Since then, I haven't been able to get the word out of my head, so I looked it up, like [listening to the end of a song](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/03/21/heres-how-get-song-out-your-head/99264896/) to resolve the tension. \n\nLiminality [can be defined as follows:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality)\n\n> In anthropology, liminality (from the Latin word līmen, meaning \"a threshold\") is the quality of ambiguity or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of a rite of passage, when participants no longer hold their pre-ritual status but have not yet begun the transition to the status they will hold when the rite is complete. During a rite's liminal stage, participants \"stand at the threshold\" between their previous way of structuring their identity, time, or community, and a new way, which completing the rite establishes.\n\nPut differently, it's like [a space between two worlds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUGEdttx04k), a stage between stages.\n\nPer the table below (yes, it's Wikipedia, feel free to refute the vibes) there are different types of liminality, based on the participant, and their respective perspective(s):\n\n![https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9e216fd3-140e-4cda-93a5-057439af017b.jpeg?height=797&width=1716](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9e216fd3-140e-4cda-93a5-057439af017b.jpeg?height=797&width=1716)\n\nPer the above, liminality can be in respect to time (entering into periods of war, celebration, forgiveness), physical space (crossing borders like Ellis Island, traveling across biomes), and cultural space (rites of passage, joining clubs or cultures, experiences with different cultures). Things like rooms, puberty, asceticism, wars, festivals, athletic teams, fraternities, and even [modernity](https://twitter.com/giorgiomomurder/status/1375265079889780741?s=20) can be defined as liminal states!\n\nThis resonates deeply with with the way I think about my place in the world because that interpretation encourages us to recognize the liminality in each passing moment. For instance, if one wants to calculate the volume of a 3-dimensional shape, one might take the area of a small slice of the shape, and then sum the areas of the slices. If we look at the years and years of our lives, we can see that our lives are also made up of millions and millions of moments where we take or are taken by action. This is both empowering and disenchanting. When we look at the way that stories have been, are, and always will be told, we seem to prefer [distinct points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOGru_4z1Vc&t=22s) in a story. As a result of being either socialized or intrinsically attuned to distinct narrative beats, we (myself included) can be prone to letting moments slip by, being taken by our actions or otherwise unable to correct course. I have about 400 tabs related to ideas, and 20 drafts for Notion blog posts. In this hesitation, I sense an aversion to scarcity and an inclination to hoard knowledge for myself. Is it a reactive response to feeling as though the world is moving in ways I cannot understand? In avoiding the consumption of these tabs, I reject the assumed future state where I have attained the skills nestled within: a knee-jerk fear that mastery of those skills will:\n\n- (a) never come.\n- (b) leave me changed in ways I will not be able to appreciate until that familiar sense of self is gone.\n\nOn the other hand, something that I'm working on recognizing is the power that I often wield to both [define and take control of](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Gw1mUq9I9p0J:https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/08/life-stories-narrative-psychology-redemption-mental-health/400796/+&cd=11&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) the course that I and the world set for ourselves, and one another. Externally, the crypto space is moving at what feels like a breakneck speed. When I was last in front of people in Osaka, everyone was abuzz about DeFi and DAOs, but the conference felt different. Now, the market is recognizing the value and power of these tools, and more people are throwing their hats into the ring. It will be interesting to see how changes in the physical and fiscal world will play out online, especially as people eventually are presented with going to the office.\n\nTo put it differently, it's like the fig tree in Sylvia Plath's *Bell Jar:*\n\n> \"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.\"\n\nThe metaphor represents the same liminality that we all face, regardless of our life stage. The holding pattern that we've collectively been forced into for over a year is creating a wellspring of pent-up anticipation, and we're seeing it expressed in [predictable ways](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/2021/03/27/median-age-covid-19-cases-florida-has-now-fallen-35/7030775002/). We can recognize how we all yearn to be outside, living in the moment, doing hoodrat stuff with our friends in a sunny place where COVID is only an afterthought. But that anticipation for a return to preceding times doesn't serve us: time has passed, people have died, and the world has already changed as a result of the pandemic. Time only moves forward for beings like us, and instead of waiting for some return to normalcy, we can take control of the actions, habits, routines, and decisions we can affect, and pull ourselves and our loved ones into ideal futures.\n\nAfter we've passed through this liminal \"COVID\" space, will we ever stop being Chronically Online? How will we modify how we prioritize spending time and interacting with one another? For one, I believe that people will recognize and respect people not wanting to be on camera, and remote work will become more accepted as a direct result of employees empathizing with remote work. I also anticipate that people will also build and retain more close-knit micro-communities. In crypto, this could happen in the form of DeFi tokens, community tokens, NFT collectives, or DAOs, where the community leaders or teams guide their communities into their own respective promised lands in the metaverse. Outside of crypto, I think that we'll continue to see the creation of a [creator middle class](https://li.substack.com/p/building-the-middle-class-of-the) as creators build communities on sites like TikTok, YouTube, OnlyFans, and Patreon. \n\nAcross both crypto communities and otherwise, the value of curation will continue to increase as people associate the negative aftertaste of being online with social networks effectively [pitting users against one another for clout.](https://youtu.be/N74cnBa_Bmc?t=34) To that point, it will be captivating to see how social tokens will be adopted, both in the short term as creators [try to supplement income lost due to COVID](https://hyperallergic.com/558089/95-of-us-artists-have-lost-income-due-to-pandemic-survey-says/) and in the long term, as people determine which clout games [are worth playing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcspUD0kF7g)\n\nUltimately, I think that recognizing the liminality in our day to day moments can reveal to us the moments that afford us maximum agency, if we're willing to look for them. In this act of assuming control, we can better understand what's going on in the present, and pull ourselves into the future we want for ourselves. For me, [by naming the resistance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZToRdS2HRc) I find the ability to chart a course for myself where doing the work becomes a habit, a means in and of itself. In that process, there's a beauty in that.\n\n---\n\n- *First post is short, but wanted to get the nervousness of the first rep shaken off!*\nThanks to everyone who proofread and sanity checked this document late night on a Sunday.", "timestamp": 1617122779, "digest": "l5qX3iWbrypYEyGd7GHywnJXDHG10ZtfAl6qf8-O1vg", "contributor": "0x66Da63B03feCA7Dd44a5bB023BB3645D3252Fa32"}
