{"id": "LMd2V3_Lh1KMlAcVY58Urs5JxCLPT_cTPXfAqDY9Wyo", "title": "STARS Token Distribution and Airdrop", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 2/3). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 667M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4 billion STARS**.\n\n![Total supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4zhWsUYN9KbC12rOFyAZM.png?height=126&width=1284)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooIF-U44MYirt21oEg4LL.png?height=1542&width=1630)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nTokens for seed investors, validators, founders, and advisors are locked up for 1 year, and linearly vest after that for another 6 months - 1 year. This helps align values with the the development team and early stakeholders.\n\n## The Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **2,453 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 4,906 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 of launch. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Why don’t I have an airdrop? I staked ATOM.**\n\nThe airdrop is only available to those that staked with non-centralized exchange validators. Staking with the following centralized exchanges ***do not*** qualify: Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Huobi, CoinOne, and OKEX.\n\n**I staked 0.1 ATOM, where is my airdrop?**\n\nYou must have staked at least 5 ATOM or 50 OSMOS to qualify.\n\n**I had my Osmosis LP tokens unbonded on Oct 11th. Do I still qualify?**\n\nYes.\n\n**What is the price of STARS?**\n\nThe token has no value until the network has launched and the token is trading on exchanges.\n\n**Where can I buy STARS?**\n\nSTARS will be available on decentralized exchanges in the Cosmos ecosystem such as [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and Gravity DEX (via [Emeris](http://osmosis.zone/)) a few weeks following launch.\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635257571, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}
{"id": "0LgQTajNEapvfSZ4f0FPVIBdeZ6C49_YtVaMXCoLL3o", "title": "Oracles: Getting Real-World Data into the Blockchain", "body": "Welcome! This is a gentle 10 minute introduction to Oracles on web3: **How can we feed real world data into a blockchain?**\n\n## What an oracle does\n\nSaid simple:\n\n> \"An oracle is a **bridge** between the blockchain and the real world. They act as **on-chain APIs** you can query to get information into your smart contracts. This could be anything from price information to weather reports. Oracles can also be bi-directional, used to **\"send\" data out to the real world**.\" ([@minimalism, October 2021](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/oracles/#:\\~:text=Oracles%20are%20data%20feeds%20that,settle%20payments%20based%20on%20events.&text=They%27ll%20use%20an%20oracle,and%20payout%20to%20the%20winners.)).\n\nSuppose a smart contract handles betting on a 'real world' (off-chain, from now on) outcome. For example, who wins the next presidential election. **The Oracle would confirm this 'real world' result**.\n\nNote that there are no API calls from a blockchain. This will be resolved by the Oracle.\n\nYes, the Oracle is an intermediary.\n\n\n---\n\n## The problem the Oracles seek to solve\n\n* **Blockchains are designed to be deterministic**. That is why, in principle, we cannot make on-chain API calls. We must do this through services such as Chainlink. Decentralization requires that all nodes in a system confirm the **same result**. There should be no ambiguity. Common APIs may not meet the no-change requirement. For example, Juan sends Carla the equivalent of $10 in ETH. Then use a off-chain API to get the ETH/USD value at that time. Transactions are recorded at a node on the blockchain and other nodes must validate the transaction by calling the same API that provided the ETH/USD value. However, this API service is likely to be dynamic and change the value within a minute. So if a single validator calls the API and gets a different value, the transaction will not validate. **This is why blockchains need to be deterministic, so that validation can happen**: if we replay every transaction from the first block, then we should be able to get the same results ([this amazing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJfkNzyO7-U&t=99s) was the source of inspiration for this example).\n* **The Oracle problem**. An Oracle is only as good as the data sources it uses. A single source of truth would be insecure and violate the goal of decentralization. An API provided by a private company, for example, could be manipulated or hacked to pursue particular objectives. Even a source like government agencies or big tech companies could, and have been, hacked and manipulated. (see [this](https://www.wired.com/story/navy-facebook-page-hack-russia-phishing-syniverse-hack-security-news/) and [this](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/06/politics/russian-solarwinds-hackers-active/index.html)). This could be solved by a decentralized oracle that gets the information from various data sources. If one source fails, the others will continue to provide the required information.\n\n\n---\n\n## How an Oracle works\n\nAn Oracle requests from an off-chain API and writes the result to the blockchain. Other contracts will need to get the data from the contract where the Oracle wrote it.\n\nTo provide the most accurate and safe ETH/USD price possible, MakerDAO collates multiple data sources (gets the median value). It would only update the price if the (1) new price, collected from different external sources, differs by more than 1% from the last price; and (2) the last price update was made more than 6 hours ago. This would allow not to change the price relationship if it is not necessary ([MakerDAO](https://developer.makerdao.com/feeds/)).\n\nOnce MakerDAO decides that it should update the ETH/USD price ratio, based on the decision criteria outlined above, it writes the new one onto the blockchain through its price feed contracts, called Medianizers. I *believe* the Medianizer name comes in because it calculates the median value of all prices feeds and this is the value it writes. This would allow a permanent record of that price on the blockchain, keeping it deterministic and capable of being validated by all nodes.\n\nAn Oracle like this is called a Decentralized Oracle Network (DON). It processes several off-chain sources in a way that would allow to deal with (1) deterministic blockchains and (2) the Oracle problem. This provides end-to-end decentralization.\n\nIn what applications can an Oracle be used?\n\n> \"Major industries benefit from combining oracles and smart contracts including asset prices for finance, weather information for insurance, randomness for gaming, IoT sensors for supply chain, ID verification for government, and much more.\" ([Chainlink](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles)).\n\n\n---\n\n## How to send custom off-chain data to the blockchain\n\nChainlink, for example, allows you to interact with off-chain data with API calls (see [here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/request-and-receive-data/)). The service advertises itself as being able to call any API (read [here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/make-a-http-get-request/) for how to make GET requests) :\n\n> \"Whether your contract requires sports results, the latest weather, or any other publicly available data, the  [Chainlink contract library](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/tree/master/contracts) provides the tools required for your contract to consume it.\" ([Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/docs/request-and-receive-data/)).\n\nThe exact mechanics on how we can request data from **any** external API, even using a Chainlink, would be material for other text. **The question of how not to fall into the Oracle problem remains**: What if the data we want to GET is only available through a single source of truth? Only one company provides this information. Theoretically, this would violate decentralization and vulnerize the blockchain.\n\n[Here's a very cool contract in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/APIRequests/APIConsumer.sol&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js) that GETs data from an external API using Chainlink.\n\n\n---\n\n## Thanks for reading!\n\nFeel free to reach out to me with thoughts, comments and feedback via Twitter.([@espejelomar](https://twitter.com/espejelomar)) or email ([espejelomar@protonmail.ch](mailto:espejelomar@protonmail.ch)).", "timestamp": 1635257991, "digest": "vhdPl84lhYDCTgf8dV_3XZ1U0fWkEU9yN3cFi2_EXCk", "contributor": "0xC606d7ea8fE2c134CC35874Bf05EEB76f6371F44"}

{"id": "nnRhvdkl3CHD_P03bEfWSWIxAHKxg7roiL-wIiSg0PU", "title": "STARS Token Distribution and Airdrop", "body": "Stargaze is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 2/3). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be 667M STARS. This leads to an **asymptotic max supply of 4 billion STARS**.\n\n![Total supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4zhWsUYN9KbC12rOFyAZM.png?height=126&width=1284)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooIF-U44MYirt21oEg4LL.png?height=1542&width=1630)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nTokens for seed investors, validators, founders, and advisors are locked up for 1 year, and linearly vest after that for another 6 months - 1 year. This helps align values with the the development team and early stakeholders.\n\n## The Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **2,453 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 4,906 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 later in the year.

{"id": "8XJNeuA4dUstBBvc1gpW7xbvMOJkaNMZtAvBUjaO_Fk", "title": "Over the Hump with SC03", "body": "Although it seems somewhat impossible, the calendar suggests we’re already past the halfway point of SC03. \n\nIt feels like just yesterday we had a bunch of baby ideas crawl into our discord, and we’re so proud of the projects they’re becoming 😭. Not really true, many were already off to the races, but you get the sentiment.\n\nWe’re lucky to have the support of some of the biggest brains in web3, and even luckier that they’re willing to spend time sharing their knowledge and experience with our projects. We’ve already had group sessions with Trevor McFedries, Cooper Turley, Denis Nazarov, Reuben Bramanathan, Alex Zhang, and more focused coaching sessions with many others.\n\nWe’re actively working on finding the right way to record and distribute all the knowledge that’s shared in these sessions with our broad community without hurting the intimacy of them, but aren’t quite there yet. So in the meantime here’s an overview of some of the big topics we’ve discussed so far, followed by some project updates, and finishing with a hot alpha leak.\n\n**Proof of Community**\n\nMany of our projects are either early in their community building phases, or have large existing communities on web2 platforms, so advice on how to kickstart and grow web3 communities is something we frequently discuss.\n\nWe typically advise projects to start very small, find a core group of people who are value-aligned with the community they’re trying to build, and focus on engagement and having quality conversations. Trying to attract a big name, or bringing your entire web2 audience over is often counterproductive to this.\n\nTrevor McFedries perfectly conveyed how scrappy this stage can often be. He recommended to start by just finding “some group chat that you’re into and then find more people that are having those same conversations in different places and get everyone together.”\n\nJess suggests pitching your community through the narrative of a huge adventure that you’re embarking on, and to make it so compelling that people can’t ignore. If you get that right and are able to bring together a group of people who are really bought into that adventure, then you’ll be in a great place to start figuring everything else out.\n\n**Community Building**\n\nOnce you have some semblance of community and a shared mission, your focus turns to building momentum towards a shorter term goal. Ideally you’re able to pull some early community members into this, but that often takes time so don’t be discouraged if your founding team is doing all the heavy lifting for a while.\n\nEven if community members aren’t stepping up it’s important to go out of your way to involve them. Alex Zhang told us that he was having individual conversations with 5 or 6 community members per day when he stepped in to lead FWB to gather input into the vision and roadmap. He dropped the gems that “community building is gardening not architecture” and that “being a good leader in a DAO is like being a good dinner party host” which we fully agree with.\n\nIt’s this type of leadership that will earn trust, encourage community members to start contributing, and attract new members. It also helped Alex identify the people that had potential to move into core contributor/leadership roles.\n\nA week later Denis dropped arguably the bomb of the cohort so far when he told everyone to “build for people to collectively lose their shit together”. That’s what we’re talking about.\n\n**Path to Tokenization**\n\nWe’re a tokenized community accelerator so naturally if and when to launch a token is something we explore deeply with our projects. While this is very contextual to the product and vision you’re building towards, our speakers shared some helpful lenses to help us explore the question.\n\nThe first thing we make clear is that you don’t need a token to build a community, and introducing a token won’t make a stale community vibrant. Tokens are used for governance, shared ownership, and rewarding contributions. If there’s nothing valuable to govern or nobody wanting to contribute to the mission, tokens aren’t going to help.\n\nMany of our speakers have also recommended using NFTs as membership as a stepping stone to launching a fungible token. If you don’t immediately need to reward contributions, or have the need for flexible governance, this can be a great way to introduce ownership (and raise money) without having to jump into a token model.\n\nBut all of this being said, as Cooper explained there’s “never a right time to launch a token because you have no idea what you’re going to need until you actually do it”. So we always tell teams to just go. Jess frequently reminds everyone that as long as you operate with transparency and earn credibility from your community, you’ll have the freedom to make adjustments to your token mechanics as your community and needs evolve.\n\nOnce you are ready to launch a token and planning a crowdfund or airdrop it’s important to take a step back and remember why you’re doing this. Alex told everyone to “get your token in the hands of people who are value aligned with what your building, aren’t price speculative at all, and will ride or die with the community”.\n\n**Maturing Your DAO**\n\nWe have a few projects that have already launched tokens and have communities really leaning in to contribute, so we’ve been exposing them to a lot of advice about maturing their DAOs. This includes topics like treasury diversification, legal, hiring for consistent roles, generating on-chain revenue, collaborating with other DAOs, etc.\n\nDiscussing these is beyond the scope of this article, but here are some treats for you to chew on.\n\n“Over-incentivize early contributions and make those people feel wanted and loved and let them really lean into the roles. The more they get to define the roles themselves the better.” - Cooper\n\n“As the leader of your DAO your fingerprints should be all over the project as well. If you’re too much of a researcher you’ll get stuck in this middle ground where you can’t make the decisions.” - Alex\n\n“When it became clear \\[that FWB was going to work\\] we took a few steps backwards to build the foundation and make sure it was built correctly. We wanted to weather proof it for a crypto winter because things change a lot when price go down.” - Trevor\n\n**Just Go**\n\nWhile all of this general advice can be helpful to give you the confidence to move, it’s the movement that will provide you with the answers. So much of the real progress is made in our office hours or intimate coaching sessions where we work directly with teams to clarify their next steps and then push them to take them. So if there’s one thing we want to leave you with, it’s to “just fucking go”. Or maybe it should be “join SC04”.\n\n**SC03 Project Milestones**\n\nIt’s only been 3 weeks but we’ve been blown away by what these projects have been able to accomplish so far.

A speculative artist whose work often floats freely in liminal spaces between the organic and synthetic, science and science fiction, the utopian and dystopian—and occasionally the slimy and the sublime—Yan maps geographies of futuristic worlds in which the human has devolved into nature. Even that distinction may be a bit dubious, however, given the ways that Yan shows nature is, well, never quite natural itself.***\n\n*Each of these pieces also holds a talismanic weight as the first ever released by ecodao, and as such, they’ll entitle holders to additional powers as well.

Of course, I would never *actually* be able to imagine a goldfish's experience, but the thought experiment always took me to a visual field in my mind where the boundaries of “objects” dissolve, everything is alien to me, and I don’t even have a self-awareness to observe *through*.\n\nCreating this series was in some way a form of invoking that state of existence—or rather that experience I call “primordial vision.” It is seeing before language, and even before distinguishing ‘things’ apart. **What lies within this visual field is alien, unknowable and unknown—not least because there is not yet a power dynamic between the perceiver of the vision and what is perceived.** There is a suspension, a gasp in our processing--\n\nI started thinking and reading a lot about nature and biology this year. My initial exploration of olfactory arts and technologies shifted to reading about fungi, algae and alternative food systems—I began musing on a future of fungal technological systems—and to reading Donna Haraway and Timothy Morton. I started taking a bioengineering class. Recently I’ve been reading about biofabrication and synthetic biology, and picked up *A History of Biology*. \n\nLooking back, it was a logical reaction to the pandemic. After spending the majority of my waking hours clicking and typing in front of multiple screens for a year, I was ready to exercise my sensory muscles more dynamically and immerse myself in both nature and learning about nature. \n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460)\n\nGrowing up in a city of 20 million people in China, I compartmentalized nature as either a “thing” outside the zone of human existence—like the mountains my dad would drive hours to take me to hike during the breaks—or the patches of carefully assorted trees and flowers in the fancier neighborhoods. It took me a while to realize that “nature” as I understood it was a concept constructed just a few centuries ago.\n\nWe are standing at the cusp of some paradigm shift with biology. So much of what biologists are doing in real life today, I, an artist, could not have imagined in my wildest mind. We can take a gene from a single-celled algae species [to make a blind man see shapes](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/24/1025251/a-blind-man-can-perceive-objects-after-a-gene-from-algae-was-added-to-his-eye?curius=1159). We can make xenobots that treat DNA as a cellular hardware [implementing rewritable physiological software](https://www.growbyginkgo.com/2020/06/29/is-dna-hardware-or-software/?curius=1159), which means genome editing isn’t the only way for programming species. We can 3D print tissues like brain organoids, from a real human cell, [to test drugs on mini brain models](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/biofabrication) for more precise medicine. There’s a new CAD software that scientists use to perform *de novo* whole-genome [design of new cells from any species](https://engineeringbiologycenter.org/?utm_source=NEO.LIFE&utm_campaign=5a4aa5937f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_10_19_11_26&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_253ae8788d-5a4aa5937f-88759182). Recently synthetic chemists and synthetic biologists worked together to create interactions [that wouldn’t have otherwise existed](https://phys.org/news/2021-10-synthetic-biology-realm-unnatural.html). \n\n**The way I created *Primordial Vision: 02021* was very much like a combination of alchemy and 3D printing.** In the software, I layered images, gave them varied heights and roughness, mixed their colors and opacities, stacked them in specific orders, and added weathering or other natural effects. The result is these orbs, floating in a slightly tinted void that even I, the “creator”, don’t completely understand. I view them with the same fascination as an interested audience, perhaps just like how biologists today must feel about their own field.\n\n*Primordial Vision: 02021* is my intuitive imagination of future relationships amongst materials, regardless of their “alive-ness.” But more than that, **I want to bring back a sense of magic.** Before the 16th century, magic and science were very much the same. The “things” around us seemed to have some intrinsic nature that enchanted us precisely because we could not place it. Today, we linger in the vertigo from the naive illusion that we were close to knowing everything, which we briefly held a century or so ago. **In a time when value has long decoupled from fact, we simultaneously suffer from being directionless, due to the lack of a guiding ethos, and having a dangerously singular direction, because of the technological determinism too many people in power hold.**\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=459](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=459)\n\nModern science brought us to an increasingly mechanistic view, with great precision, of our relationships with ourselves and the world around us. We’re now able to code genes and synthesize novel chemical reactions, which makes it all the more urgent for us **to restore an organic understanding of technology**. I’d like to quote the contemporary philosopher [Byung-Chul Han](https://artreview.com/byung-chul-han-how-objects-lost-their-magic/): “It’s not objects but information that rules the living world. We no longer inhabit heaven and earth, but the Cloud and Google Earth.” \n\nHow do we live through rapidly evolving technologies and sciences, and thus constant updates to our model of the world, while retaining an organic view of the universe and remaining enchanted and awed? I find myself grappling with this question through all my intellectual and creative explorations this year. \n\nWhen the framework of the Anthropocene was proposed in 2000, it made us urgently aware of our species’ capacity to significantly alter our environment that’s co-inhabited by countless other organisms. We seem to have immense power over nature. But the climate crisis is a crisis precisely because it poses a near-existential threat upon us: **the power we felt was an illusion, and we are still very vulnerable within nature.** \n\nThese days we talk, or joke, nervously, a lot about the end of the world. It doesn’t require a lot of technical knowledge to become acutely aware of the many ways in which we face near-existential or existential risks. The atomic bomb opened the first chapter of our *serious* thinking on extinction, though it seems a small harbinger of the risks we were yet to conceive. [Thomas Moynihan, an Oxford historian of ideas, observed](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/x-risk): “the discovery of human extinction may well yet prove to have been the very centrepiece of that unfolding and unfinished drama that we call modernity.”\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=458](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=458)\n\n**While we are standing at the mesmerizing cusp of unlocking new understandings of the natural world in a degree of complexity and precision unimaginable to us not too long ago, we are also just beginning to live with the idea of *our* death. I use *02021* to denote this year in the work’s title, to hold a more expansive timeline of humanity. But more importantly, we need to collectively instill a long-term worldview that includes *all* sentient beings**\n\nThis is where artists come in, in cooperation with other thinkers: to reimagine a future encompassing the terrain past human sight and reason, a terrain that nevertheless already surrounds us on this earth. After all, so many crises come down to our models of what we are, and how we relate to other “things.” We are not ever gods, and we need to intentionally walk away from an instrumental view of nature as objects to tame, or manipulate, for our *own* enjoyment and survival.\n\nMaybe you could look at these orbs as planets. Not as planets we will inhabit or that Earth will become. But as planets inhabited by some aliens that have different ways of moving and interacting with the substances around them. What is their nature, what is their technology, and what, frankly, is the difference? — *Wendi Yan*\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=441](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=441)\n\n \n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1635262178, "digest": "bIw-JK1_X0khl2WTc3vq14dHjYWMeulzQqpVMcR7NdU", "contributor": "0xB1059fA05452c48495C7607a6615d5F1DB8109f9"}

I won’t go into the pro/con tradeoffs here, but these are top of mind for a reason and I think there’s a place for each of them in the coming Cryptocosm.\n2. **Allocate & Diversify.** “Okay I’m on board, will put a % of portfolio into crypto, now how do I split that up on risk-reward-adjusted basis?”  I usually recommend beginners start with a market-cap-weighted allocation, which with those 4 coins would look like \\~ 67% BTC, 28% ETH, 3% SOL, 2% DOGE. \n3. **Why?** Some people have never bought any crypto, or never taken it seriously.  So the natural question is *why* or “What makes your conviction so strong?”  I like to mention my experience moving between Cuba & America, with how frustrating it is to move money; and for a reading recommendation, *The Sovereign Individual*.\n4. **No Thanks, too risky!**  I wonder about these people the most – always curious what will be the eventual trigger that gets their attention: how bad does hyperinflation have to get? how much does bitcoin have to “number go up”?  or WHAT THE HECK are they investing in that’s outperforming crypto?\n\nMore to come on my responses to each of these types soon.\n\nBut pulse check – which Bucket are YOU in on crypto journey?", "timestamp": 1635262215, "digest": "QQjCJ4HqhQsTpndDAp7_naTslI8AIF61EM9gN-lYr7c", "contributor": "0xd98B36bC66bD4a5b8D15E41951aafDF328240953"}

{"id": "dkUsWGMZ4wWI5aX2j5wHawzlLY4Vpc-jB8_BXoJAS90", "title": "PRIMORDIAL VISION: 02021", "body": "*ecodao is very proud to present five works by the artist [Wendi Yan](https://wendiyan.com/), “Primordial Vision: 02021,” alongside an original essay Yan has written on the work. A speculative artist whose work often floats freely in liminal spaces between the organic and synthetic, science and science fiction, the utopian and dystopian—and occasionally the slimy and the sublime—Yan maps geographies of futuristic worlds in which the human has devolved into nature. Even that distinction may be a bit dubious, however, given the ways that Yan shows nature is, well, never quite natural itself.*\n\n*Each of these pieces also holds a talismanic weight as the first ever released by ecodao, and as such, they’ll entitle holders to additional powers as well. Each will be a passport into the ecodao community that will offer owners the right to first purchase of ecodao’s token if they’re holding when ecodao decides to tokenize—pending, yes, legal confirmation and tokenization.*\n\n*More immediately, each will also be a passport to **ecodao’s first party, late-night on November 5th, at a secret location in Williamsburg DJed by [BRUX](https://soundcloud.com/whoisbrux)**. Once you’ve collected a work, you’ll just need to pull it up in your wallet at the door to get automatic admission. **Just head to our Discord [here](https://alpha.guild.xyz/guild/ecodao)** when the work hits your wallet, and we’re excited to welcome you to our own little alternate universe—and, we hope, to meet next week.*\n\n*Oh, and: when you collect, 50% will go to Yan, **25% will go to the [Rainforest Foundation](https://rainforestfoundation.org/)**, which supports indigenous communities with land rights and reforestation to fight climate change, and 25% will go to ecodao to support events, art collection, tech development, and what we hope will be the first artist UBI—and first web3 museum. You can read more about our vision [here](https://eco.mirror.xyz/zhtmSvJzPvBcWut0IKHQFgP6P3bEuvte3UKZDWZenNU).*\n\n*With extreme gratitude for helping make ecodao what it is, and in the spirit of speculative futurism, for enabling it to be all it will be. — ecodao*\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=461](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=461)\n\n**In elementary school, I tried to imagine myself as a goldfish.**\n\nWhat would it feel like to be a goldfish, with a few seconds of memory, no linguistic capabilities and maybe no specific mechanism to differentiate objects? Of course, I would never *actually* be able to imagine a goldfish's experience, but the thought experiment always took me to a visual field in my mind where the boundaries of “objects” dissolve, everything is alien to me, and I don’t even have a self-awareness to observe *through*.\n\nCreating this series was in some way a form of invoking that state of existence—or rather that experience I call “primordial vision.” It is seeing before language, and even before distinguishing ‘things’ apart. **What lies within this visual field is alien, unknowable and unknown—not least because there is not yet a power dynamic between the perceiver of the vision and what is perceived.** There is a suspension, a gasp in our processing--\n\nI started thinking and reading a lot about nature and biology this year. My initial exploration of olfactory arts and technologies shifted to reading about fungi, algae and alternative food systems—I began musing on a future of fungal technological systems—and to reading Donna Haraway and Timothy Morton. I started taking a bioengineering class. Recently I’ve been reading about biofabrication and synthetic biology, and picked up *A History of Biology*.\n\nLooking back, it was a logical reaction to the pandemic. After spending the majority of my waking hours clicking and typing in front of multiple screens for a year, I was ready to exercise my sensory muscles more dynamically and immerse myself in both nature and learning about nature.\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460)\n\nGrowing up in a city of 20 million people in China, I compartmentalized nature as either a “thing” outside the zone of human existence—like the mountains my dad would drive hours to take me to hike during the breaks—or the patches of carefully assorted trees and flowers in the fancier neighborhoods. It took me a while to realize that “nature” as I understood it was a concept constructed just a few centuries ago.\n\nWe are standing at the cusp of some paradigm shift with biology. So much of what biologists are doing in real life today, I, an artist, could not have imagined in my wildest mind. We can take a gene from a single-celled algae species [to make a blind man see shapes](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/24/1025251/a-blind-man-can-perceive-objects-after-a-gene-from-algae-was-added-to-his-eye?curius=1159). We can make xenobots that treat DNA as a cellular hardware [implementing rewritable physiological software](https://www.growbyginkgo.com/2020/06/29/is-dna-hardware-or-software/?curius=1159), which means genome editing isn’t the only way for programming species. We can 3D print tissues like brain organoids, from a real human cell, [to test drugs on mini brain models](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/biofabrication) for more precise medicine. There’s a new CAD software that scientists use to perform *de novo* whole-genome [design of new cells from any species](https://engineeringbiologycenter.org/?utm_source=NEO.LIFE&utm_campaign=5a4aa5937f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_10_19_11_26&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_253ae8788d-5a4aa5937f-88759182). Recently synthetic chemists and synthetic biologists worked together to create interactions [that wouldn’t have otherwise existed](https://phys.org/news/2021-10-synthetic-biology-realm-unnatural.html).\n\n**The way I created *Primordial Vision: 02021* was very much like a combination of alchemy and 3D printing.** In the software, I layered images, gave them varied heights and roughness, mixed their colors and opacities, stacked them in specific orders, and added weathering or other natural effects. The result is these orbs, floating in a slightly tinted void that even I, the “creator”, don’t completely understand. I view them with the same fascination as an interested audience, perhaps just like how biologists today must feel about their own field.\n\n*Primordial Vision: 02021* is my intuitive imagination of future relationships amongst materials, regardless of their “alive-ness.” But more than that, **I want to bring back a sense of magic.** Before the 16th century, magic and science were very much the same. The “things” around us seemed to have some intrinsic nature that enchanted us precisely because we could not place it. Today, we linger in the vertigo from the naive illusion that we were close to knowing everything, which we briefly held a century or so ago. **In a time when value has long decoupled from fact, we simultaneously suffer from being directionless, due to the lack of a guiding ethos, and having a dangerously singular direction, because of the technological determinism too many people in power hold.**\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=459](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=459)\n\nModern science brought us to an increasingly mechanistic view, with great precision, of our relationships with ourselves and the world around us. We’re now able to code genes and synthesize novel chemical reactions, which makes it all the more urgent for us **to restore an organic understanding of technology**. I’d like to quote the contemporary philosopher [Byung-Chul Han](https://artreview.com/byung-chul-han-how-objects-lost-their-magic/): “It’s not objects but information that rules the living world. We no longer inhabit heaven and earth, but the Cloud and Google Earth.”\n\nHow do we live through rapidly evolving technologies and sciences, and thus constant updates to our model of the world, while retaining an organic view of the universe and remaining enchanted and awed? I find myself grappling with this question through all my intellectual and creative explorations this year.\n\nWhen the framework of the Anthropocene was proposed in 2000, it made us urgently aware of our species’ capacity to significantly alter our environment that’s co-inhabited by countless other organisms. We seem to have immense power over nature. But the climate crisis is a crisis precisely because it poses a near-existential threat upon us: **the power we felt was an illusion, and we are still very vulnerable within nature.**\n\nThese days we talk, or joke, nervously, a lot about the end of the world. It doesn’t require a lot of technical knowledge to become acutely aware of the many ways in which we face near-existential or existential risks. The atomic bomb opened the first chapter of our *serious* thinking on extinction, though it seems a small harbinger of the risks we were yet to conceive. [Thomas Moynihan, an Oxford historian of ideas, observed](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/x-risk): “the discovery of human extinction may well yet prove to have been the very centrepiece of that unfolding and unfinished drama that we call modernity.”\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=458](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=458)\n\n**While we are standing at the mesmerizing cusp of unlocking new understandings of the natural world in a degree of complexity and precision unimaginable to us not too long ago, we are also just beginning to live with the idea of *our* death. I use *02021* to denote this year in the work’s title, to hold a more expansive timeline of humanity. But more importantly, we need to collectively instill a long-term worldview that includes *all* sentient beings**\n\nThis is where artists come in, in cooperation with other thinkers: to reimagine a future encompassing the terrain past human sight and reason, a terrain that nevertheless already surrounds us on this earth. After all, so many crises come down to our models of what we are, and how we relate to other “things.” We are not ever gods, and we need to intentionally walk away from an instrumental view of nature as objects to tame, or manipulate, for our *own* enjoyment and survival.\n\nMaybe you could look at these orbs as planets. Not as planets we will inhabit or that Earth will become. But as planets inhabited by some aliens that have different ways of moving and interacting with the substances around them. What is their nature, what is their technology, and what, frankly, is the difference? — *Wendi Yan*\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=441](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=441)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635262375, "digest": "bIw-JK1_X0khl2WTc3vq14dHjYWMeulzQqpVMcR7NdU", "contributor": "0xB1059fA05452c48495C7607a6615d5F1DB8109f9"}

This can’t go on. As the masses swarm into a space formerly reserved for the elites, Synapse promises to unite both by enabling them to share in the spoils of the same investment process.\n\nIn 2020, Brian Armstrong — a CEO of the Coinbase cryptocurrency trading company — hosted a panel titled “Setting Up and Scaling a Crypto Company.” He pointed out that raising money for a start-up is very difficult as it requires access to a perfect match of investors who understand the drive of a project and have the will to get behind it. “Crypto has the potential to democratise fundraising and make it available. This alone could increase the number of start-ups in the world by an order of magnitude which would be really good for the world.” From the CEO of one of the most successful companies operating in the space of cryptocurrencies, the sentiment that fundraising through ICOs might be one of the most important breakthroughs offered by the DeFi space serves as an apt introduction for the synapse network.\n\nIf there’s any quandary more nerve-wracking than the decision of where to invest your hard earned wealth in 2021, it’s where to invest the billions of corporate and government funds entrusted to your care.\n\nWith crypto, investors are gathered in the same virtual room to make their own value judgments on an investment. The rules and protections are equal whether you are investing millions of dollars or a single cent and, with Synapse, speculators can move their stake from one medium to another as was previously impossible without tariffs and administration costs.\n\nFounded on a basis of integrity, Synapse paves the way for a new consensus between those who have always been on the opposite sides of the spectrum. The eternal conflict between the Davids and Goliaths seems to be coming to its conclusion. We are witnessing a paradigm shift in crypto investment perception and with the discourse revision comes an actual implementation of the democratic ideals. Coming back to the very concept that gave birth to the crypto space, Synapse establishes a platform based on equality and accessibility.\n", "timestamp": 1635263346, "digest": "pxzgk_qfc3u_khgplWUcQ5RbmXMR_w0i8W42JBDtcx8", "contributor": "0x88d93ecff2B67ba407dB4A08E410647138FdeC4C"}

Many thought $ETH or $ADA will be the new decade winner and believe me they will be the winner.\n\nBitcoin is so manipulative because there are many big tycoons in the bitcoin, and they are other than Tesla or Goldman Sachs.\n\nBut we know very little about them, and we don’t even know who they are and how they manage their bitcoin. We only know this much amount was transferred from this wallet to this wallet, because of the privacy of the blockchain.\n\nMaybe $BTC will be $100K and there is no denial in it. But recent new highs of Bitcoin tell a lot about Bitcoin Community.\n\nWhen the whole Crypto Market is there where it was a month ago (WITH A LITTLE CHANGE), Bitcoin has reached $45K to $60K. This shows that retail is not investing in the crypto market, there are more big players, which are manipulating the crypto market.\n\nYou can read this article to know if you want to know more about Bitcoin at $100K:\n\n## Some Personal Advice:\n\nMaybe Bitcoin will go after $100K, but I'm still going to go after $ETH and $ADA because they have value in their blockchain.\n\nWith the current outlook on Bitcoin, it's too manipulative currency right now, maybe in the future it will be less manipulative, but right now, bitcoin is not my cup of tea.\n\nA little piece of advice through a popular quote:\n\n> All that glitters is not gold. But maybe it’s gold, who knows?\n\nAccording to my opinion, right now is the best chance to buy $ADA or $ETH.

{"id": "nFn2dceQep6IF4woW7mtx36DU4ORXJbYCAkCSD0tPTI", "title": "Why Web3 - Sean Bonner - Medium", "body": "In the summer of 1993 I saw the World Wide Web for the first time and to this day it remains one of the most exciting moments of my life. The possibility and the potential was so obvious. This was a place where anything could happen, and everyone could see it. Over the next few years it stopped feeling like a destination and I no longer differentiated between “the real world” and “online” — it was all real and always happening, sometimes I was away away from my keyboard.\n\nBy the early 2000’s these amorphous blobs of content we were putting online started to find ways to work together. [Small pieces loosely joined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Pieces_Loosely_Joined). We were on the verge of connecting everything and it was going to be incredible. Tech conferences felt like summer camps. All the people you’d met online coming together and hanging out in hotel lobbies. We put faces to names, and stayed up all night imagining the future. That feeling changed in 2004 when the O’Reilly Emerging Technology Conference was rebranded as The Web 2.0 Conference. e-Tech became Web 2.0, officially.\n\nThat year I ran into a friend outside of the conference. They looked upset, almost distraught. I asked what was wrong. They told me they’d just taken an elevator that was packed with people they didn’t recognize. They’d looked at name tags to try and find a connection and rather than seeing familiar startups or friend’s projects they saw SAP, Oracle and various banks. I said “so what?” They said, “When the money and enterprise guys show up, you know it’s over.” I laughed off the comment at the moment but thought about it a lot in the following years. That was the beginning of the end, at least of our dreams of anything being possible.\n\nIt wasn’t a night and day change and of course there was plenty of talk of “users” instead of “people” in what we now call the “dot-com era” or “Web 1.0” though we didn’t call it those things at the time. But Web 2.0 brought in the big guns. The focus became controlling what people could do, and owning their information. Our content, our data, anything they could get their hands on. This was the golden age of luring people in with free services and *War and Peace* length Terms of Service that no one read, so we didn’t realize how much we were giving up. Once we did, it was too late.\n\nIf you’ve been with me over these years you know I’ve been critical of Web 2.0. I have spent a considerable amount of time talking about the web and what we do with it, what we could have done, and where we went wrong. I had so much hope, and felt so much disappointment. Obviously I wasn’t the only one, which is how we found our way to Web3.\n\nWeb3 is not Web 3.0. It’s not a sequel or an update to Web 2.0, it’s a separate fork. You could maybe argue it’s a prequel but one informed by the errors of what was yet to come. While Web 2.0 was the fire started by sparks from the dot-com era, this a rewind and do-over with flameproof lining. Web3 looked at Web 2.0, saw the foundation was rotting and rather then renovating decided to build fresh on the plot next door. I could keep running with these analogies but I’m sure you get the point. When you see Web 2.0 talking heads steaming and stomping their feet that “NFTs and Crypto are not Web 3.0!!” they are right, but just not in the way they think. Web 3.0 was [The Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web#Web_3.0) — [it already happened](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-1-0-web-2-0-and-web-3-0-with-their-difference/) and chances are you never even heard about it. Web3 is something else.\n\n```\nDialup ---> Dot-Com Era ---> Web 2.0 ---> Web 3.0\n             |\n             |----------------------------------- Web3\n```\n\nWeb3 upends the power structures we’ve grown accustomed to and puts artists and creators back into the drivers seat. Without exception, every person I’ve spoken to who I know from my mid 1990’s internet adventures agrees this feels just like that. Suddenly there are possibilities again. Suddenly all options are on the table. Suddenly Anything can happen. It’s exciting. And scary. A little bit dangerous. It’s like the run down part of town where all the artists have studios because thats where they can afford lots of space. Sure you have to be careful where you park so your car doesn’t get broken into, but the creativity and inspiration around every corner is worth the visit.\n\nAfter 2020 lots of people have been asking if there is actually a reason to go back to the office, to go back to a job they hate. Web3 is giving many of those people the ability to say no, they aren’t going to suffer through a 9–5 they hate just to barely scrape up enough to pay rent. Web3 offers a future where people are in charge of their own identities, not beholden to the whims of data hoarding corporations. People control their own accounts, own their own futures. Detractors are outraged that currency and wallets play a central part in this, but currency and wallets have always played a central role — the only thing that has changed is who benefits. It’s intellectually dishonest to pretend otherwise. In 1993 [John Gilmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist)) said “The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it” and in a way that is what has happened here, but we’re talking about an economy rather than censorship. The Net interpreted walled gardens and institutional lock-ins as damage. Web3 is a creator economy like we’ve never seen — by and for the people.\n\nNow that may sound idealistic and is, admittedly. Proudly even. Because that’s what a reimagining should be. If you are going back and starting over you need to be idealistic, you need to believe anything is possible and that the best outcome is realistic. The unified, decentralized dream is sitting right in front of us. Of course it’s not assured, and there are no shortage of power hungry or greed driven actors trying to centralize things for their own benefit. We’re already seeing compromises billed as simplification. We’re seeing sour grapes from people who called this a trend or a scam and expected it to fade away years ago. There’s no shortage of self proclaimed early adopters who didn’t adopt this early enough and are mad that they made the wrong call. That’s OK, it’s to be expected. The good is the momentum is strong and things are moving in the right direction. The secret is it’s not too late. We are still so incredibly early. The surface has barely been scratched.\n\nAnother incredibly important thing here — the kids all get it. For every person over 40 arguing about the legitimacy of cryptocurrency or the value of JPGs there are 2 people under 20 who don’t even question it. Digital gold, a catalog of avatars and identities — this is the world they grew up with. It made sense in countless video games, why not everywhere else? And when you take into account that there’s been a financial crisis almost non-stop since 2001, with an ever growing list of shysters and conmen getting caught for decades of scams and frauds, or politicians getting pay offs, or secret back room deals where almost everyone gets screwed — the appeal of a public ledger for all transactions becomes crystal clear. The next generation is all to aware of the short end of the stick they’ve been left to hold, and they are simple deciding not to.\n\nSo if you are asking “Why Web3?” The answer is simple. Web3 is the future.", "timestamp": 1635263988, "digest": "5vA0W4P3tl9xjPM6VDR_EqZMW4_RaXAPPosm_wnG6sE", "contributor": "0xc93C7f71581DFEAAb59BEd908888dAC5689F312a"}

Currently, NFT creators and owners earn money on sale and resale. Yup proposes a new revenue stream for creators we're calling NFT Creator Rewards.\n\nUntil now we’ve mainly focused on rewarding and recognizing curators, but creators play an essential role in [Yup](https://app.yup.io) too. In its previous form, the Yup Protocol rewarded curators in newly-minted YUP based on the success of their social signaling.\n\nWith NFT Creator rewards, artists themselves can now earn [YUP](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/yup) for the NFTs that people have liked or rated, starting with Opensea, Foundation, and SuperRare.\n\n[https://twitter.com/yup_io/status/1430566002585182209?s=20](https://twitter.com/yup_io/status/1430566002585182209?s=20)\n\nCreators can check how many rewards they are eligible for here. Claiming happens automatically when an account is created with the right Ethereum address. Sign up, share, and the [YUP](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/yup) is yours!\n\nNFT YUP rewards will benefit collectors, creators, and curators in a manner that doesn't hinder the existing trading experience but provides an additional revenue stream that should benefit participants and inform collectors. Memes are often used an example where provenance would be a killer use-case. But the real value associated with provenance comes in royalties.\n\nFor this initial roll-out, we’re limiting rewards to top creators based on Yup curation and Ethereum layer 1 NFTs. Creator rewards will turn into passive income for NFT artists and communities.\n\nThe [NFT creator reward page](https://app.yup.io/rewards) allows you to see how much creators have earned from their NFTs. Simply type in an Ethereum address to check how much they've earned. If you're an artist or someone who's curious about how much artists have already earned, definitely check it out.\n\n### Coming Soon: Collector Rewards\n\nIn the next few weeks, we’ll be releasing Collector Rewards for NFT owners and collectors as well as curator DAOs. With YUP as a recurring revenue stream, NFT creators, curators, and collectors will all be more incentivized and informed on the social value of the token.\n\n### We \\* like \\* the NFTs\n\nNFT curation makes up a large amount of curation on Yup, with NFT curators earning over $300k in YUP rewards so far. NFTs make up roughly 40% of the content on Yup.\n\nHere are some NFT collections recently curated on Yup:\n\n[https://app.yup.io/collections/a/qgNKEM6](https://app.yup.io/collections/a/qgNKEM6)\n\n[https://app.yup.io/collections/nfts/LOiLR1A](https://app.yup.io/collections/nfts/LOiLR1A)\n\n[https://app.yup.io/collections/robo-nft/rsN3CiC](https://app.yup.io/collections/robo-nft/rsN3CiC)\n\nLearn more about Creator Rewards [here](http://docs.yup.io).\n\nWe’re looking to collaborate and support creators, if you know any, [message us](https://twitter.com/yup_io) or connect with them directly if you feel so inclined!", "timestamp": 1635264623, "digest": "Nu93ZvI8tvV1jybT8rSIl6kDydCEpGGfS42hCXFVG7w", "contributor": "0x30E838D51c61811d382962B4e0699715462DcdE1"}

{"id": "Kg7FYFMsqkigxmmPc2ALAdkPuZQf63gZh_tcbLlvC7Q", "title": "PRIMORDIAL VISION: 02021", "body": "*ecodao is very proud to present five works by the artist [Wendi Yan](https://wendiyan.com/), “Primordial Vision: 02021,” alongside an original essay Yan has written on the work. A speculative artist whose work often floats freely in liminal spaces between the organic and synthetic, science and science fiction, the utopian and dystopian—and occasionally the slimy and the sublime—Yan maps geographies of futuristic worlds in which the human has devolved into nature. Even that distinction may be a bit dubious, however, given the ways that Yan shows nature is, well, never quite natural itself.*\n\n*Each of these pieces also holds a talismanic weight as the first ever released by ecodao, and as such, they’ll entitle holders to additional powers as well. Each will be a passport into the ecodao community that will offer owners the right to first purchase of ecodao’s token if they’re holding when ecodao decides to tokenize—pending, yes, legal confirmation and tokenization.* \n\n*More immediately, each will also be a passport to **ecodao’s first party, late-night on November 5th, at a secret location in Williamsburg DJed by [BRUX](https://soundcloud.com/whoisbrux).** Once you’ve collected a work, you’ll just need to pull it up in your wallet at the door to get automatic admission. Just head to our Discord [here](https://alpha.guild.xyz/guild/ecodao) when the work hits your wallet, and we’re excited to welcome you to our own little alternate universe—and, we hope, to meet next week.*\n\n*Oh, and: when you collect, 50% will go to Yan, **25% will go to the [Rainforest Foundation](https://rainforestfoundation.org/)**, which supports indigenous communities with land rights and reforestation to fight climate change, and 25% will go to ecodao to support events, art collection, tech development, and what we hope will be the first artist UBI—and first web3 museum. You can read more about our vision [here](https://eco.mirror.xyz/zhtmSvJzPvBcWut0IKHQFgP6P3bEuvte3UKZDWZenNU).*\n\n*With extreme gratitude for helping make ecodao what it is, and in the spirit of speculative futurism, for enabling it to be all it will be. — ecodao*  ** \n **\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=461](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=461)\n\nIn elementary school, I tried to imagine myself as a goldfish. \n\nWhat would it feel like to be a goldfish, with a few seconds of memory, no linguistic capabilities and maybe no specific mechanism to differentiate objects? Of course, I would never *actually* be able to imagine a goldfish's experience, but the thought experiment always took me to a visual field in my mind where the boundaries of “objects” dissolve, everything is alien to me, and I don’t even have a self-awareness to observe *through*.\n\nCreating this series was in some way a form of invoking that state of existence—or rather that experience I call “primordial vision.” It is seeing before language, and even before distinguishing ‘things’ apart. **What lies within this visual field is alien, unknowable and unknown—not least because there is not yet a power dynamic between the perceiver of the vision and what is perceived.** There is a suspension, a gasp in our processing--\n\nI started thinking and reading a lot about nature and biology this year. My initial exploration of olfactory arts and technologies shifted to reading about fungi, algae and alternative food systems—I began musing on a future of fungal technological systems—and to reading Donna Haraway and Timothy Morton. I started taking a bioengineering class. Recently I read about biofabrication and synthetic biology, and picked up *A History of Biology*. \n\nLooking back, it was a logical reaction to the pandemic. After spending the majority of my waking hours clicking and typing in front of multiple screens for a year, I was ready to exercise my sensory muscles more dynamically and immerse myself in both nature and learning about nature. \n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460)\n\nGrowing up in a city of 20 million people in China, I compartmentalized nature as either a “thing” outside the zone of human existence—like the mountains my dad would drive hours to take me to hike during the breaks—or the patches of carefully assorted trees and flowers in the fancier neighborhoods. It took me a while to realize that “nature” as I understood it was a concept constructed just a few centuries ago.\n\nWe are standing at the cusp of some paradigm shift with biology. So much of what biologists are doing in real life today, I, an artist, could not have imagined in my wildest mind. We can take a gene from a single-celled algae species [to make a blind man see shapes](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/24/1025251/a-blind-man-can-perceive-objects-after-a-gene-from-algae-was-added-to-his-eye?curius=1159). We can make xenobots that treat DNA as a cellular hardware [implementing rewritable physiological software](https://www.growbyginkgo.com/2020/06/29/is-dna-hardware-or-software/?curius=1159), which means genome editing isn’t the only way for programming species. We can 3D print tissues like brain organoids, from a real human cell, [to test drugs on mini brain models](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/biofabrication) for more precise medicine. There’s a new CAD software that scientists use to perform *de novo* whole-genome [design of new cells from any species](https://engineeringbiologycenter.org/?utm_source=NEO.LIFE&utm_campaign=5a4aa5937f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_10_19_11_26&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_253ae8788d-5a4aa5937f-88759182). Recently synthetic chemists and synthetic biologists worked together to create interactions [that wouldn’t have otherwise existed](https://phys.org/news/2021-10-synthetic-biology-realm-unnatural.html). \n\n**The way I created *Primordial Vision: 02021* was very much like a combination of alchemy and 3D printing.** In the software, I layered images, gave them varied heights and roughness, mixed their colors and opacities, stacked them in specific orders, and added weathering or other natural effects. The result is these orbs, floating in a slightly tinted void that even I, the “creator”, don’t completely understand.

A speculative artist whose work often floats freely in liminal spaces between the organic and synthetic, science and science fiction, the utopian and dystopian—and occasionally the slimy and the sublime—Yan maps geographies of futuristic worlds in which the human has devolved into nature. Even that distinction may be a bit dubious, however, given the ways that Yan shows nature is, well, never quite natural itself.*\n\n*Each of these pieces also holds a talismanic weight as the first ever released by ecodao, and as such, they’ll entitle holders to additional powers as well. Each will be a passport into the ecodao community that will offer owners the right to first purchase of ecodao’s token if they’re holding when ecodao decides to tokenize—pending, yes, legal confirmation and tokenization.*\n\n*More immediately, each will also be a passport to **ecodao’s first party, late-night on November 5th, at a secret location in Williamsburg DJed by [BRUX](https://soundcloud.com/whoisbrux).** Once you’ve collected a work, you’ll just need to pull it up in your wallet at the door to get automatic admission. Just head to our Discord [here](https://alpha.guild.xyz/guild/ecodao) when the work hits your wallet, and we’re excited to welcome you to our own little alternate universe—and, we hope, to meet next week.*\n\n*Oh, and: when you collect, 50% will go to Yan, **25% will go to the [Rainforest Foundation](https://rainforestfoundation.org/)**, which supports indigenous communities with land rights and reforestation to fight climate change, and 25% will go to ecodao to support events, art collection, tech development, and what we hope will be the first artist UBI—and first web3 museum. You can read more about our vision [here](https://eco.mirror.xyz/zhtmSvJzPvBcWut0IKHQFgP6P3bEuvte3UKZDWZenNU).*\n\n*With extreme gratitude for helping make ecodao what it is, and in the spirit of speculative futurism, for enabling it to be all it will be. — ecodao* \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=461](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=461)\n\nIn elementary school, I tried to imagine myself as a goldfish.\n\nWhat would it feel like to be a goldfish, with a few seconds of memory, no linguistic capabilities and maybe no specific mechanism to differentiate objects? Of course, I would never *actually* be able to imagine a goldfish's experience, but the thought experiment always took me to a visual field in my mind where the boundaries of “objects” dissolve, everything is alien to me, and I don’t even have a self-awareness to observe *through*.\n\nCreating this series was in some way a form of invoking that state of existence—or rather that experience I call “primordial vision.” It is seeing before language, and even before distinguishing ‘things’ apart. **What lies within this visual field is alien, unknowable and unknown—not least because there is not yet a power dynamic between the perceiver of the vision and what is perceived.** There is a suspension, a gasp in our processing--\n\nI started thinking and reading a lot about nature and biology this year. My initial exploration of olfactory arts and technologies shifted to reading about fungi, algae and alternative food systems—I began musing on a future of fungal technological systems—and to reading Donna Haraway and Timothy Morton. I started taking a bioengineering class. Recently I read about biofabrication and synthetic biology, and picked up *A History of Biology*.\n\nLooking back, it was a logical reaction to the pandemic. After spending the majority of my waking hours clicking and typing in front of multiple screens for a year, I was ready to exercise my sensory muscles more dynamically and immerse myself in both nature and learning about nature.\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460)\n\nGrowing up in a city of 20 million people in China, I compartmentalized nature as either a “thing” outside the zone of human existence—like the mountains my dad would drive hours to take me to hike during the breaks—or the patches of carefully assorted trees and flowers in the fancier neighborhoods. It took me a while to realize that “nature” as I understood it was a concept constructed just a few centuries ago.\n\nWe are standing at the cusp of some paradigm shift with biology. So much of what biologists are doing in real life today, I, an artist, could not have imagined in my wildest mind. We can take a gene from a single-celled algae species [to make a blind man see shapes](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/24/1025251/a-blind-man-can-perceive-objects-after-a-gene-from-algae-was-added-to-his-eye?curius=1159). We can make xenobots that treat DNA as a cellular hardware [implementing rewritable physiological software](https://www.growbyginkgo.com/2020/06/29/is-dna-hardware-or-software/?curius=1159), which means genome editing isn’t the only way for programming species. We can 3D print tissues like brain organoids, from a real human cell, [to test drugs on mini brain models](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/biofabrication) for more precise medicine. There’s a new CAD software that scientists use to perform *de novo* whole-genome [design of new cells from any species](https://engineeringbiologycenter.org/?utm_source=NEO.LIFE&utm_campaign=5a4aa5937f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_10_19_11_26&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_253ae8788d-5a4aa5937f-88759182). Recently synthetic chemists and synthetic biologists worked together to create interactions [that wouldn’t have otherwise existed](https://phys.org/news/2021-10-synthetic-biology-realm-unnatural.html).\n\n**The way I created *Primordial Vision: 02021* was very much like a combination of alchemy and 3D printing.** In the software, I layered images, gave them varied heights and roughness, mixed their colors and opacities, stacked them in specific orders, and added weathering or other natural effects. The result is these orbs, floating in a slightly tinted void that even I, the “creator”, don’t completely understand. I view them with the same fascination as an interested audience, perhaps just like how biologists today must feel about their own field.\n\n*Primordial Vision: 02021* is my intuitive imagination of future relationships amongst materials, regardless of their “alive-ness.” But more than that, **I want to bring back a sense of magic.** Before the 16th century, magic and science were very much the same.

No PFP project seems to succeed without it, though it's very hard to define just what that means.\n\nIs that an active Discord? Is that an artist who's regularly making updates? Is that a dedicated, full-time team who promises a roadmap? Is that a ton of sales, a high floor, a smattering of WGMIs, GMs, and reactions? Something else?\n\nI'm very hesitant to promise any kind of roadmap for a project like this. It just kind of happened, it may not work, and promising a roadmap (from the product designer inside of me) seems like a crazy idea for something so nascent.\n\nSo rather than promising a roadmap, I'm thinking of promising an idea that resonates with me.\n\nIt's a very rudimentary concept at this point, so bear with me.\n\nI don't want Blergs to be yet another Discord, yet another community, yet another place to have notifications from and nothing more. Conversations about the project are helpful, conversations about a floor or sales are informative, but what is the reason that this exists?\n\nWhat is the unique value that I, the Blergmeister (oh that's going in my Twitter bio), can give to you all for minting, holding, or just being here?\n\nI can't be the expert of web3, I'm not even in the conversation for greatest art, but I can help provide a place to point to those who are.\n\nBlergs are based off of other PFPs or projects that have been influential to my discovery of web3. Many of the traits I'm making will be references to those collections, projects, and communities that I've discovered. So that's the value I can offer. I can point people to those places and collect the best examples for the community.\n\nSo to start, Blergs will be a project that points to other communities, articles, tools, and services. For now, it's a Discord. If it works, it may turn into more than that.\n\nA place that helps people discover what this whole web3 thing is, and maybe a place that could serve as a repository for information helpful for new members. Something that doesn't feel like you have to be tuned in 24/7/365 to get value from. Discord communities index strongly towards high engagement, which is fine, but also I don't like the addictive tendencies and the small windows of time with FOMO that make us make big decisions. I want to collect those tidbits and share them with the Blergs members so they can be consumed at a more manageable pace.\n\nMaybe a simple way of putting it would be that it to be a curated gateway. Links, definitions of terms, exciting projects, places to go to learn, helpful people to follow, projects that are novel or distinctive, etc. I want to find a way to incentivize people to share knowledge in a way that isn't a giant feed with information overload. I want Blergs to help others join in and make this new paradigm together.\n\nFor now, it's a fun PFP project, and I think the art is looking good. But next? Next would take support and help from the people who join.\n\nIf you want to learn, then this hopefully is the right place.\n\nIf you want to share, then this is hopefully the right place.\n\nI'll share what I know, but the first thing I can share is that you all know a heck of a lot more than me.\n\nLet's learn together.", "timestamp": 1635266937, "digest": "wA5lxAbyEfHtVGX3fidhEvCWT0k0hv58pKtQLYswh9s", "contributor": "0x6D8Df15FD3dC3505a4010CaC6937De159d68081C"}

A speculative artist whose work often floats freely in liminal spaces between the organic and synthetic, science and science fiction, the utopian and dystopian—and occasionally the slimy and the sublime—Yan maps geographies of futuristic worlds in which the human has devolved into nature. Even that distinction may be a bit dubious, however, given the ways that Yan shows nature is, well, never quite natural itself.*\n\n*Each of these pieces also holds a talismanic weight as the first ever released by ecodao, and as such, they’ll entitle holders to additional powers as well. Each will be a passport into the ecodao community that will offer owners the right to first purchase of ecodao’s token if they’re holding when ecodao decides to tokenize—pending, yes, legal confirmation and tokenization.*\n\n*More immediately, each will also be a passport to **ecodao’s first party, late-night on November 5th, at a secret location in Williamsburg DJed by [BRUX](https://soundcloud.com/whoisbrux).** Once you’ve collected a work, you’ll just need to pull it up in your wallet at the door to get automatic admission. Just head to our Discord [here](https://alpha.guild.xyz/guild/ecodao) when the work hits your wallet, and we’re excited to welcome you to our own little alternate universe—and, we hope, to meet next week.*\n\n*Oh, and: when you collect, 50% will go to Yan, **25% will go to the [Rainforest Foundation](https://rainforestfoundation.org/)**, which supports indigenous communities with land rights and reforestation to fight climate change, and 25% will go to ecodao to support events, art collection, tech development, and what we hope will be the first artist UBI—and first web3 museum. You can read more about our vision [here](https://eco.mirror.xyz/zhtmSvJzPvBcWut0IKHQFgP6P3bEuvte3UKZDWZenNU).*\n\n*With extreme gratitude for helping make ecodao what it is, and in the spirit of speculative futurism, for enabling it to be all it will be. — ecodao*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=461](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=461)\n\nIn elementary school, I tried to imagine myself as a goldfish.\n\nWhat would it feel like to be a goldfish, with a few seconds of memory, no linguistic capabilities and maybe no specific mechanism to differentiate objects? Of course, I would never *actually* be able to imagine a goldfish's experience, but the thought experiment always took me to a visual field in my mind where the boundaries of “objects” dissolve, everything is alien to me, and I don’t even have a self-awareness to observe *through*.\n\nCreating this series was in some way a form of invoking that state of existence—or rather that experience I call “primordial vision.” It is seeing before language, and even before distinguishing ‘things’ apart. **What lies within this visual field is alien, unknowable and unknown—not least because there is not yet a power dynamic between the perceiver of the vision and what is perceived.** There is a suspension, a gasp in our processing--\n\nI started thinking and reading a lot about nature and biology this year. My initial exploration of olfactory arts and technologies shifted to reading about fungi, algae and alternative food systems—I began musing on a future of fungal technological systems—and to reading Donna Haraway and Timothy Morton. I started taking a bioengineering class. Recently I read about biofabrication and synthetic biology, and picked up *A History of Biology*.\n\nLooking back, it was a logical reaction to the pandemic. After spending the majority of my waking hours clicking and typing in front of multiple screens for a year, I was ready to exercise my sensory muscles more dynamically and immerse myself in both nature and learning about nature.\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460)\n\nGrowing up in a city of 20 million people in China, I compartmentalized nature as either a “thing” outside the zone of human existence—like the mountains my dad would drive hours to take me to hike during the breaks—or the patches of carefully assorted trees and flowers in the fancier neighborhoods. It took me a while to realize that “nature” as I understood it was a concept constructed just a few centuries ago.\n\nWe are standing at the cusp of some paradigm shift with biology. So much of what biologists are doing in real life today, I, an artist, could not have imagined in my wildest mind. We can take a gene from a single-celled algae species [to make a blind man see shapes](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/24/1025251/a-blind-man-can-perceive-objects-after-a-gene-from-algae-was-added-to-his-eye?curius=1159). We can make xenobots that treat DNA as a cellular hardware [implementing rewritable physiological software](https://www.growbyginkgo.com/2020/06/29/is-dna-hardware-or-software/?curius=1159), which means genome editing isn’t the only way for programming species. We can 3D print tissues like brain organoids, from a real human cell, [to test drugs on mini brain models](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/biofabrication) for more precise medicine. There’s a new CAD software that scientists use to perform *de novo* whole-genome [design of new cells from any species](https://engineeringbiologycenter.org/?utm_source=NEO.LIFE&utm_campaign=5a4aa5937f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_10_19_11_26&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_253ae8788d-5a4aa5937f-88759182). Recently synthetic chemists and synthetic biologists worked together to create interactions [that wouldn’t have otherwise existed](https://phys.org/news/2021-10-synthetic-biology-realm-unnatural.html).\n\n**The way I created *Primordial Vision: 02021* was very much like a combination of alchemy and 3D printing.** In the software, I layered images, gave them varied heights and roughness, mixed their colors and opacities, stacked them in specific orders, and added weathering or other natural effects. The result is these orbs, floating in a slightly tinted void that even I, the “creator”, don’t completely understand. I view them with the same fascination as an interested audience, perhaps just like how biologists today must feel about their own field.\n\n*Primordial Vision: 02021* is my intuitive imagination of future relationships amongst materials, regardless of their “alive-ness.” But more than that, **I want to bring back a sense of magic.** Before the 16th century, magic and science were very much the same. The “things” around us seemed to have some intrinsic nature that enchanted us precisely because we could not place it. Today, we linger in the vertigo from the naive illusion that we were close to knowing everything, which we briefly held a century or so ago. **In a time when value has long decoupled from fact, we simultaneously suffer from being directionless, due to the lack of a guiding ethos, and having a dangerously singular direction, because of the technological determinism too many people in power hold.**\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=459](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=459)\n\nModern science brought us to an increasingly mechanistic view, with great precision, of our relationships with ourselves and the world around us. We’re now able to code genes and synthesize novel chemical reactions, which makes it all the more urgent for us **to restore an organic understanding of technology.** I’d like to quote the contemporary philosopher [Byung-Chul Han](https://artreview.com/byung-chul-han-how-objects-lost-their-magic/): “It’s not objects but information that rules the living world. We no longer inhabit heaven and earth, but the Cloud and Google Earth.”\n\nHow do we live through rapidly evolving technologies and sciences, and thus constant updates to our model of the world, while retaining an organic view of the universe and remaining enchanted and awed? I find myself grappling with this question through all my intellectual and creative explorations this year.\n\nWhen the framework of the Anthropocene was proposed in 2000, it made us urgently aware of our species’ capacity to significantly alter our environment that’s co-inhabited by countless other organisms. We seem to have immense power over nature. But the climate crisis is a crisis precisely because it poses a near-existential threat upon us: **the power we felt was an illusion, and we are still very vulnerable within nature.**\n\nThese days we talk, or joke, nervously, a lot about the end of the world. It doesn’t require a lot of technical knowledge to become acutely aware of the many ways in which we face near-existential or existential risks. The atomic bomb opened the first chapter of our *serious* thinking on extinction, though it seems a small harbinger of the risks we were yet to conceive. [Thomas Moynihan, an Oxford historian of ideas, observed](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/x-risk): “the discovery of human extinction may well yet prove to have been the very centrepiece of that unfolding and unfinished drama that we call modernity.”\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=458](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=458)\n\n**While we are standing at the mesmerizing cusp of unlocking new understandings of the natural world in a degree of complexity and precision unimaginable to us not too long ago, we are also just beginning to live with the idea of *our* death. I use *02021* to denote this year in the work’s title, to hold a more expansive timeline of humanity. But more importantly, we need to collectively instill a long-term worldview that includes *all* sentient beings.**\n\nThis is where artists come in, in cooperation with other thinkers: to reimagine a future encompassing the terrain past human sight and reason, a terrain that nevertheless already surrounds us on this earth. After all, so many crises come down to our models of what we are, and how we relate to other “things.” We are not ever gods, and we need to intentionally walk away from an instrumental view of nature as objects to tame, or manipulate, for our *own* enjoyment and survival.\n\nMaybe you could look at these orbs as planets. Not as planets we will inhabit or that Earth will become. But as planets inhabited by some aliens that have different ways of moving and interacting with the substances around them.

It just kind of happened, it may not work, and promising a roadmap (from the product designer inside of me) seems like a crazy idea for something so nascent.\n\n![Blerg blerg](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fLKYo7m9aSwH5Cl2hh2IK.gif?height=1800&width=5800&&size=medium)\n\nSo rather than promising a roadmap, I'm thinking of promising an idea that resonates with me.\n\nIt's a very rudimentary concept at this point, so bear with me.\n\nI don't want Blergs to be yet another Discord, yet another community, yet another place to have notifications from and nothing more. Conversations about the project are helpful, conversations about a floor or sales are informative, but what is the reason that this exists?\n\nWhat is the unique value that I, Tom, the Blergmeister (oh that's going in my Twitter bio), can give to you all for minting, holding, or just being here?\n\nI can't be the expert of web3, I'm not even in the conversation for greatest art, **but I can help provide a place to point to those who are.**\n\nBlergs are based off of other PFPs or projects that have been influential to my discovery of web3. Many of the traits I'm making will be references to those collections, projects, and communities that I've discovered. So that's the value I can offer. I can point people to those places and collect the best examples for the community.\n\nSo to start, Blergs will be a project that points to other communities, articles, tools, and services. For now, it's a Discord. If it works, it may turn into more than that.\n\nA place that helps people discover what this whole web3 thing is, and maybe a place that could serve as a repository for information helpful for new members. Something that doesn't feel like you have to be tuned in 24/7/365 to get value from. Discord communities index strongly towards high engagement, which is fine, but also I don't like the addictive tendencies and the small windows of time with FOMO that make us make big decisions. **I want to collect those tidbits and share them with the Blergs members so they can be consumed at a more manageable pace.**\n\nMaybe a simple way of putting it would be that it to be a curated gateway. Links, definitions of terms, exciting projects, places to go to learn, helpful people to follow, projects that are novel or distinctive, etc. I want to find a way to incentivize people to share knowledge in a way that isn't a giant feed with information overload. I want Blergs to help others join in and make this new paradigm together.\n\nFor now, it's a fun PFP project, and I think the art is looking good. But next? Next would take support and help from the people who join.\n\nIf you want to learn, then this hopefully is the right place.\n\nIf you want to share, then this is hopefully the right place.\n\nI'll share what I know, but the first thing I can share is that **you all know a heck of a lot more than me.**\n\nLet's learn together.", "timestamp": 1635267361, "digest": "wA5lxAbyEfHtVGX3fidhEvCWT0k0hv58pKtQLYswh9s", "contributor": "0x6D8Df15FD3dC3505a4010CaC6937De159d68081C"}

It took me a while to realize that “nature” as I understood it was a concept constructed just a few centuries ago.\n\nWe are standing at the cusp of some paradigm shift with biology. So much of what biologists are doing in real life today, I, an artist, could not have imagined in my wildest mind. We can take a gene from a single-celled algae species [to make a blind man see shapes](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/24/1025251/a-blind-man-can-perceive-objects-after-a-gene-from-algae-was-added-to-his-eye?curius=1159). We can make xenobots that treat DNA as a cellular hardware [implementing rewritable physiological software](https://www.growbyginkgo.com/2020/06/29/is-dna-hardware-or-software/?curius=1159), which means genome editing isn’t the only way for programming species. We can 3D print tissues like brain organoids, from a real human cell, [to test drugs on mini brain models](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/biofabrication) for more precise medicine. There’s a new CAD software that scientists use to perform *de novo* whole-genome [design of new cells from any species](https://engineeringbiologycenter.org/?utm_source=NEO.LIFE&utm_campaign=5a4aa5937f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_10_19_11_26&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_253ae8788d-5a4aa5937f-88759182). Recently synthetic chemists and synthetic biologists worked together to create interactions [that wouldn’t have otherwise existed](https://phys.org/news/2021-10-synthetic-biology-realm-unnatural.html).\n\n**The way I created *Primordial Vision: 02021* was very much like a combination of alchemy and 3D printing.** In the software, I layered images, gave them varied heights and roughness, mixed their colors and opacities, stacked them in specific orders, and added weathering or other natural effects. The result is these orbs, floating in a slightly tinted void that even I, the “creator”, don’t completely understand. I view them with the same fascination as an interested audience, perhaps just like how biologists today must feel about their own field.\n\n*Primordial Vision: 02021* is my intuitive imagination of future relationships amongst materials, regardless of their “alive-ness.” But more than that, **I want to bring back a sense of magic.** Before the 16th century, magic and science were very much the same. The “things” around us seemed to have some intrinsic nature that enchanted us precisely because we could not place it. Today, we linger in the vertigo from the naive illusion that we were close to knowing everything, which we briefly held a century or so ago. **In a time when value has long decoupled from fact, we simultaneously suffer from being directionless, due to the lack of a guiding ethos, and having a dangerously singular direction, because of the technological determinism too many people in power hold.**\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=459](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=459)\n\nModern science brought us to an increasingly mechanistic view, with great precision, of our relationships with ourselves and the world around us. We’re now able to code genes and synthesize novel chemical reactions, which makes it all the more urgent for us **to restore an organic understanding of technology.** I’d like to quote the contemporary philosopher [Byung-Chul Han](https://artreview.com/byung-chul-han-how-objects-lost-their-magic/): “It’s not objects but information that rules the living world. We no longer inhabit heaven and earth, but the Cloud and Google Earth.”\n\nHow do we live through rapidly evolving technologies and sciences, and thus constant updates to our model of the world, while retaining an organic view of the universe and remaining enchanted and awed? I find myself grappling with this question through all my intellectual and creative explorations this year.\n\nWhen the framework of the Anthropocene was proposed in 2000, it made us urgently aware of our species’ capacity to significantly alter our environment that’s co-inhabited by countless other organisms. We seem to have immense power over nature. But the climate crisis is a crisis precisely because it poses a near-existential threat upon us: **the power we felt was an illusion, and we are still very vulnerable within nature.**\n\nThese days we talk, or joke, nervously, a lot about the end of the world. It doesn’t require a lot of technical knowledge to become acutely aware of the many ways in which we face near-existential or existential risks. The atomic bomb opened the first chapter of our *serious* thinking on extinction, though it seems a small harbinger of the risks we were yet to conceive. [Thomas Moynihan, an Oxford historian of ideas, observed](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/x-risk): “the discovery of human extinction may well yet prove to have been the very centrepiece of that unfolding and unfinished drama that we call modernity.”\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=458](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=458)\n\n**While we are standing at the mesmerizing cusp of unlocking new understandings of the natural world in a degree of complexity and precision unimaginable to us not too long ago, we are also just beginning to live with the idea of *our* death. I use *02021* to denote this year in the work’s title, to hold a more expansive timeline of humanity. But more importantly, we need to collectively instill a long-term worldview that includes *all* sentient beings.**\n\nThis is where artists come in, in cooperation with other thinkers: to reimagine a future encompassing the terrain past human sight and reason, a terrain that nevertheless already surrounds us on this earth. After all, so many crises come down to our models of what we are, and how we relate to other “things.” We are not ever gods, and we need to intentionally walk away from an instrumental view of nature as objects to tame, or manipulate, for our *own* enjoyment and survival.\n\nMaybe you could look at these orbs as planets. Not as planets we will inhabit or that Earth will become. But as planets inhabited by some aliens that have different ways of moving and interacting with the substances around them.

A speculative artist whose work often floats freely in liminal spaces between the organic and synthetic, science and science fiction, the utopian and dystopian—and occasionally the slimy and the sublime—Yan maps geographies of futuristic worlds in which the human has devolved into nature. Even that distinction may be a bit dubious, however, given the ways that Yan shows nature is, well, never quite natural itself.*\n\n*Each of these pieces also holds a talismanic weight as the first ever released by ecodao, and as such, they’ll entitle holders to additional powers as well. Each will be a passport into the ecodao community that will offer owners the right to first purchase of ecodao’s token if they’re holding when ecodao decides to tokenize—pending, yes, legal confirmation and tokenization.*\n\n*More immediately, each will also be a passport to **ecodao’s first party, late-night on November 5th, at a secret location in Williamsburg DJed by [BRUX](https://soundcloud.com/whoisbrux).** Once you’ve collected a work, you’ll just need to pull it up in your wallet at the door to get automatic admission. Just head to our Discord [here](https://alpha.guild.xyz/guild/ecodao) when the work hits your wallet, and we’re excited to welcome you to our own little alternate universe—and, we hope, to meet next week.*\n\n*Oh, and: when you collect, 50% will go to Yan, **25% will go to the [Rainforest Foundation](https://rainforestfoundation.org/)**, which supports indigenous communities with land rights and reforestation to fight climate change, and 25% will go to ecodao to support events, art collection, tech development, and what we hope will be the first artist UBI—and first web3 museum.

Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 2/3). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be \\~667M STARS. This infinite sequence is a [geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series) which leads to a  fixed **asymptotic max supply of 4 billion STARS**.\n\n![Total supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4zhWsUYN9KbC12rOFyAZM.png?height=126&width=1284)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooIF-U44MYirt21oEg4LL.png?height=1542&width=1630)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nTokens for seed investors, validators, founders, and advisors are locked up for 1 year, and linearly vest after that for another 6 months - 1 year. This helps align values with the the development team and early stakeholders.\n\n## The Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **2,453 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 4,906 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\nTo see how much STARS you’re eligible to claim, please visit <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.\n\n***Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 later in the year. Please see Phase 3 below.***\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Why don’t I have an airdrop? I staked ATOM.**\n\nThe airdrop is only available to those that staked with non-centralized exchange validators. Staking with the following centralized exchanges ***do not*** qualify: Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Huobi, CoinOne, and OKEX.\n\n**I staked 0.1 ATOM, where is my airdrop?**\n\nYou must have staked at least 5 ATOM or 50 OSMOS to qualify.\n\n**I had my Osmosis LP tokens unbonded on Oct 11th. Do I still qualify?**\n\nYes.\n\n**What is the price of STARS?**\n\nThe token has no value until the network has launched and the token is trading on exchanges.\n\n**Where can I buy STARS?**\n\nSTARS will be available on decentralized exchanges in the Cosmos ecosystem such as [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and Gravity DEX (via [Emeris](http://osmosis.zone/)) a few weeks following launch.\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635270406, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}

A part of our mission & research is focused around how loosely connected individuals in a community collaborate towards a goal while maintaining individual freedom. A part of the answer lies around a synergy between AI agents & creative individuals but we’re not there yet.*\n\n![Source: 70s Sci Fi Art ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L_LRYzGZIEgY7vp2m3aeY.jpeg?height=1024&width=974)\n\nToday, a web3 community can be broken down into guilds that focus on an area of expertise & further into more niche categories that all collectively work towards goals. On-chain proposals & incentives define structure but a large portion of the community aren’t active contributors. Onboarding efforts can be spent on converting lurkers into core contributors but this shouldn’t be the goal. The orbit-model framework illustrates on finding the right match between community expectations & how much a member is willing to contribute. \n\n[https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model](https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model)\n\nA part of why DAOs are exciting is because they’ve created ways to achieve financial stability while doing things you already love. It could be creating a tiktok video, writing a proposal or moderating a discord server. The lines get blurred when expected contribution goes against your expectations and work starts to look a lot like a traditional grueling 9-5 job.\n\nAt [Coinvise](https://coinvise.co), we work quite independently. We’re broken down into four components -- product design, engineering, content and community. Each of these components are defined by actionable milestones and structured with a “Freedom Coefficient” (FC). FC stands for the amount of milestones you’re willing to complete while optimizing for personal freedom. We ensure that FC is at least >= the number of members in a team. \n\nThis doesn’t require work to be highly defined, in most cases building & growing communities can feel chaotic. But the goal is to ensure members aren’t forced down a path of turning themselves into a core contributor. Optimizing for the right FC for new and existing community members is crucial for long-term retention & building trust. \n\nIf you’re contributing to a DAO, optimize for emotional stability as much as you do for economic stability. The 1% decrease in your mental health isn’t worth the tokens. \n\n*If any of this is interesting to you, come help us build Coinvise, we’re looking for protocol and product designers and [more](https://jobs.coinvise.co).*", "timestamp": 1635271222, "digest": "PziTYEWhnHVi9g68_-dx7oIxhb5bAvBjhfQy8s31ono", "contributor": "0x8df737904ab678B99717EF553b4eFdA6E3f94589"}

{"id": "eLrJ6RzdZMo2JLdwtv-iKw4tverambDZoVEVViuJcH4", "title": "My First Encounters with Crypto", "body": "Over the past several months, I’ve been diving deeper into the world of web3 (DeFi, NFTs, etc.) and related technologies and innovations in the space. If I’m being honest, this interest is primarily being driven by me becoming active on twitter again and having conversations about crypto (and related innovations in the space) bubble up by virtue of folks I’m following and engaging with on the platform.\n\nWhen I say innovations, I don’t necessarily mean current innovations (as in this just happened) but more to do with my encounters with said innovations - in the sense that I am the one just starting to encounter cool things that are happening in the space. These innovations are still relatively recent though and when viewed through the lens of the entire populations that they will someday hopefully start to impact, it is all really fascinating.\n\nAnyways, while I never was a crypto skeptic, I was indifferent about the space till relatively recently. But the recent developments and applications have made me want to learn and engage more with the technologies and people in the space and with that in mind, I wanted my first post on mirror to be about my first encounters with crypto back in 2010-2013. And hopefully, in follow on posts, I’ll write about newer topics in the space that I’m learning about.\n\nBack in 2009, I was a pretty nerdy sophomore majoring in computer science at Georgia Tech (I switched majors later, which is a topic for a different essay) and at some point had stumbled upon hacker news via someone in the computer labs at the university. It was a fascinating website - a bright orange mast - really interesting topics and deep discussions by folks that were sometimes involved in the stories that were being talked about. Anyways after lurking about for some time I finally made an account in 2010 and a few weeks later stumbled upon a discussion about Bitcoin - I don’t exactly remember the post but I think it was written with the perspective of how to get started with bitcoin (or something along those lines). The post in question linked to the bitcoin whitepaper so naturally I clicked on it and made an effort to read it. To be honest, I did not fully understand the paper - it had a lot of jargon that was foreign to me and while I made a decent effort to read through it - I probably left with a rudimentary understanding of what the paper was talking about and that was it.\n\nThere were a few other discussions I encountered over the next year or so and I finally started to grok what bitcoin was - in the sense that it was a digital currency that we could transact with over the internet without intermediaries.\n\nBitcoin became more obvious to me when I first learned about Silk Road - I could now see more obvious use cases - but still, it wasn’t something I was thinking about every day. I think my thoughts at the time were more along the lines of, \"oh cool thing exists - in case I need to buy some weed on the internet\". The conventional wisdom at the time was that bitcoin was anonymous (or at least that’s what I believed at the time till learning otherwise later). Anyways long story short, I finally bit the bullet and bought some bitcoin in early 2013, signed up for Coinbase in 2014, and made lots of comments on reddit (another forum I was active on) in the 2012-2013 period that I’m probably not going to post here as I don’t want to dox my anon account and because some of those old comments are a bit embarrassing but here’s a gem from a hacker news post discussing the state of bitcoin miners at the time. \n\n![A comment by sgpl on hacker news circa 2013](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2UxGKT0Vgr30aHU1nk0XX.png?height=684&width=1950)\n\nAnyways over the intervening years, I sold my limited bitcoin holdings as the prices rose. In all honesty, I didn’t foresee bitcoin prices at the levels they’re currently are at. And frankly, it was hard for me to imagine bitcoin blowing up in the way it has over the past decade - so in a way I admire people who could see this possibility then.\n\nI think a lot of early talk by prominent believers (at least this is my impression anyway) was about the use cases for bitcoin as a medium of exchange/transactions - while that has happened to some extent, I’d say it’s limited. But the believers were rewarded more as bitcoin has, over the years, become a store of value and as the OG of crypto continues to see wider adoption with institutions as well as individuals.\n\nI also read about Ethereum for the first time on hacker news on a discussion that was pretty highly upvoted at the time but I don’t think I really took time to understand the innovations that Ethereum brought about to the space. \n\nAnyways so that’s the story of my early encounters with crypto. I think I pretty much slept on this space after about 2015. But I’m now starting to see the future again with some more clarity and it’s obvious to me that a revolution driven by web3 technologies is going to be a driving force in a lot of our future lives.", "timestamp": 1635274995, "digest": "UbDTlkzqyK60EodQV5BcIfinNX0gCab3cXLpGFO9PCc", "contributor": "0x286ba9aFB6e54fd6ccc8ad3fE5d843656E9D691D"}
{"id": "nRzMPrWYrXnI8lUZLwGiRbiyDKluZiJnhChRZHltCio", "title": "The Guide to DeFi Governance", "body": "Written By: [Ratan Kaliani](http://twitter.com/ratankaliani), [Annamira O’Toole](http://twitter.com/annamirajo) & [Shivam Patel](http://twitter.com/VagariViatorem)\n\n*In the spirit of decentralization, DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols have been empowering their communities to guide the future of these protocols through on-chain governance. However, the ecosystem of DeFi governance and token delegation can often be hard to navigate. Here at [Blockchain at Berkeley](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu) (B@B), we’ve learned a lot from running our delegation program for 4 protocols ([Uniswap](https://uniswap.org), [Compound](https://compound.finance), [Aave](https://aave.com), [Fei](https://fei.money)) over the past year . This guide intends to distill some of those learnings into a digestible format to help other delegates & future community members hit the ground running.*\n\n**DeFi Governance Overview**\n\nProtocols use DeFi governance to empower community members to work together to make key decisions regarding protocol changes, launching new initiatives and transforming the long-term vision for the protocol. In the most common model, [token-based governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token), 1 token corresponds to 1 vote in the protocol, enabling every token holder of a protocol to participate in governance. By leveraging governance, DeFi protocol teams decentralize decision-making across the community.\n\nThe governance process, like the DeFi protocols themselves, are controlled by smart contracts. In most protocols, once a governance proposal and its protocol change is approved, the proposal moves into a timelock where it is held frozen for a period of time (such as two days) before being integrated. Timelocks allow for a buffer for the community to counteract potentially malicious or misinformed activity before they are incorporated into the protocol.\n\nFor example, [Governor Bravo](https://compound.finance/docs/governance#governor-bravo) is a popular set of governance contracts developed by Compound Labs. Any proposal made in Governor Bravo contract is made of a set of actions: call contract function, upgrade contract by redeploying and setting proxy address of new version, etc. These changes then go to a vote, of which the result is either cancelled or sent to the timelock before execution.\n\n*How are proposals integrated into the protocol? (Courtesy of [Open Zeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/proxy-patterns/))*\n\nWith Governor Bravo and similar governance contracts, certain smart contracts designated by the protocol are able to be upgraded without needing to change the proxy address. However, smart contracts not deployed under these frameworks are immutable, and as such many DeFi protocols use proxy contract patterns to interface between the client and the actual contract logic.Users and client applications use the address of the proxy contract and interact with its functions. The proxy contract then points to the protocol’s contract logic. This enables upgrading protocol parameters and redeploying contracts to the chain without necessitating that clients change the addresses they interact with; rather, clients simply change what version of the protocol logic that the proxy contract points to.\n\n**Token Delegation**\n\n*Why does delegation matter?*\n\nEarly investors & protocol builders often hold an outsized amount of governance tokens and delegation of these tokens serves as a vector to encourage diverse participation from the community. For example, a16z recently [open-sourced their token delegation program](https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program/), which looks to increase the quality of the governing body of protocols by delegating to community members who demonstrate early leadership in governance.\n\n[https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program/](https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program/)\n\nVoting power is delegated by use of utility functions in the governance token smart contracts. These functions enable token holders to delegate their on-chain governance rights to others who they as view as adept “protocol governors”.\n\n*How do you become a delegate?*\n\nWhen bootstrapping a DeFi Governance initiative, it helps to first show a depth of knowledge in a protocol by being active in the forums and the community at large. After gaining familiarity with the protocol and understanding the value-add your organization can bring to the table, contributing to the protocol and being an early community leader in a protocol is the best avenue to receiving your first delegation. Connecting with VC firms and protocol teams/founders are potential avenues as well, but the most effective method to make an impact is still simply being very active in moving the protocol forward & making your voice heard. In our experience, we’ve seen that by being active protocol governors in the community, investors & founders will start reaching out to you directly with delegation proposals. However, it is necessary and your responsibility as a delegate to do your due diligence on protocols and only participate as delegates in protocols that are legitimate. Being transparent, accountable and independent are key towards earning the community’s trust, and you must actively seek all to be an impactful community member.\n\n[https://twitter.com/CalBlockchain/status/1416082070208712705?s=20](https://twitter.com/CalBlockchain/status/1416082070208712705?s=20)\n\nThe legal contracts associated with the delegations can vary, but they generally include a gas stipend to cover the costs of gas fees for on-chain voting, along with the delegated token amount and duration of the contract. It’s standard practice for a clause to be included that allows for the revocation of delegated tokens should your organization become inactive in the community. We’d highly recommend having a legal contract in place just to make sure that all parties are on the same page in terms of delegation details and expectations.\n\n*Example of a DeFi governance delegation letter (Courtesy of a16z)*\n\n[https://github.com/a16z/crypto-governance/blob/main/delegation/delegation_letter.md](https://github.com/a16z/crypto-governance/blob/main/delegation/delegation_letter.md)\n\n**Our Approach to DeFi Governance**\n\n*Mission*\n\nWe strongly value being active in the entire governance process, from forum discussions to temperature checks to proposal discussions to intermediate and final votes. We engage our community not only through forums, but also on Twitter, where we explain our voting decisions and meet to discuss protocol changes with community leaders within each protocol. By being active governors & community members, we hope to leave a lasting impact on DeFi governance and help shape the future of DeFi.\n\n*Committee Structure*\n\nAlthough we aim to incorporate as much information as possible into our governance decisions, we’ve found that a carefully structured core Governance team helps ensure that we stay on top of protocol developments and are informed voters & contributors in governance. The core team ensures the decisions that our organization makes in DeFi governance are democratic and well-reasoned.\n\nInitially, we began with a committee where each member would be active in the community of each of the protocols that we were delegates in and would come together as a group to discuss the proposals to reach consensus. While this model works well as delegates in 1–2 protocols, we quickly recognized that it wouldn’t scale as we became delegates in new protocols. Currently, we designate core members to serve as leads for specific protocols & DAOs within a protocol (ex. B@B’s involvement in the [Aave Risk DAO](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-aave-risk-dao/4729/14)). Our core governance team meets on a consistent basis for our governance committee to debate the merits of governance proposals. In meetings, our protocol leads relay the specific details and nuances of protocols to the committee, allowing us to make more informed votes as a team.\n\n*Case Study: Temporarily Disable COMP Rewards (Compound Proposal 63)*\n\nTo dive in deeper into what our governance process looks like, we’ll explain our evaluation process for our recent vote AGAINST COMP Proposal 63, which looked to temporarily disable COMP rewards in response to the [Comptroller exploit](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/30/defi-money-market-compound-overpays-15m-in-comp-rewards-in-possible-exploit/) from an [overlooked error in COMP Proposal 62](https://twitter.com/Mudit__Gupta/status/1443454935639609345).\n\n[https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-proposal-63-temporary-patch-for-comp-distribution-bug-9-29-21/2327](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-proposal-63-temporary-patch-for-comp-distribution-bug-9-29-21/2327)\n\n1. The first aim of our team is to get the context, goals, downsides & implementation of the proposal at hand, spearheaded by our protocol leads. Proposal 63 needed to be fast-moving to respond to the $100M+ at risk from the exploit, and as such was a rudimentary solution: give the community the ability to suspend all COMP claims to prevent more money from being at risk. However, this proposal came with a significant downside - all integrations with the protocol (ex. a protocol using Compound as a part of an investment strategy) involving the *claimComp* function would be bricked. Proposal 64 was released two days later and fixed the same problem with a more nuanced solution: only those users who did not interact with exploited markets would be able to withdraw their COMP. After further research, we recognized that this solution was not only more elegant, but better maintained trust in the Compound protocol in the wider DeFi community. As a result, the initial research led the Compound protocol leads to recommend voting AGAINST the proposal.\n2. After completing the research phase of evaluation, the Compound protocol leads presented their preliminary findings & initial research to the committee for a full vote by the core team. Due to the potential implications of the vote and importance of finding a solution to the exploit, our team dedicated significant time towards individually researching the merits of the proposal. After doing so, the committee convened to vote and a majority decided to vote AGAINST Proposal 63.\n3. Because Proposals 63/64/65 were interrelated, we included our justification for all 3 proposals in one tweet that we released to the community. By including our reasoning in our tweets, we hope to educate & help guide those in the community towards making well-informed governance voting decisions.\n\n[https://twitter.com/CalBlockchain/status/1445631256113270799?s=20](https://twitter.com/CalBlockchain/status/1445631256113270799?s=20)\n\n**Future Steps**\n\nBy being active delegates & contributors in DeFi Governance, we hope we can help educate the wider crypto community and take ownership in moving protocols forward. We aim to release our specific views and objectives for B@B’s DeFi Governance impact in a future post. To give a teaser - as DeFi continues to go mainstream, rethinking incentive mechanisms for community engagement & access to governance are integral prerequisites to mass adoption. As always, we’re excited to continue contributing to the community in a transparent & public manner!\n\n**General Resources**\n\nThe governance tooling ecosystem has evolved rapidly in tandem with the growth of DeFi and we’ve found that having a hub for these resources is key towards improving awareness & efficiency in DeFi Governance.

{"id": "Xw0rSat2FcdzuvGu57OQZZgEc2QxCO3Kd1pY-vYV5IA", "title": "My First Encounters with Crypto", "body": "Over the past several months, I’ve been diving deeper into the world of web3 (DeFi, NFTs, etc.) and related technologies and innovations in the space. If I’m being honest, this interest is primarily being driven by me becoming active on twitter again and having conversations about crypto (and related innovations in the space) bubble up by virtue of folks I’m following and engaging with on the platform.\n\nWhen I say innovations, I don’t necessarily mean current innovations (as in this just happened) but more to do with my encounters with said innovations - in the sense that I am the one just starting to encounter cool things that are happening in the space. These innovations are still relatively recent though and when viewed through the lens of the entire populations that they will someday hopefully start to impact, it is all really fascinating.\n\nAnyways, while I never was a crypto skeptic, I was indifferent about the space till relatively recently. But the recent developments and applications have made me want to learn and engage more with the technologies and people in the space and with that in mind, I wanted my first post on mirror to be about my first encounters with crypto back in 2010-2013. And hopefully, in follow on posts, I’ll write about newer topics in the space that I’m learning about.\n\nBack in 2009, I was a pretty nerdy sophomore majoring in computer science at Georgia Tech (I switched majors later, which is a topic for a different essay) and at some point had stumbled upon hacker news via someone in the computer labs at the university. It was a fascinating website - a bright orange mast - really interesting topics and deep discussions by folks that were sometimes involved in the stories that were being talked about. Anyways after lurking about for some time I finally made an account in 2010 and a few weeks later stumbled upon a discussion about Bitcoin - I don’t exactly remember the post but I think it was written with the perspective of how to get started with bitcoin (or something along those lines). The post in question linked to the bitcoin whitepaper so naturally I clicked on it and made an effort to read it. To be honest, I did not fully understand the paper - it had a lot of jargon that was foreign to me and while I made a decent effort to read through it - I probably left with a rudimentary understanding of what the paper was talking about and that was it.\n\nThere were a few other discussions I encountered over the next year or so and I finally started to grok what bitcoin was - in the sense that it was a digital currency that we could transact with over the internet without intermediaries.\n\nBitcoin became more obvious to me when I first learned about Silk Road - I could now see more obvious use cases - but still, it wasn’t something I was thinking about every day. I think my thoughts at the time were more along the lines of, \"oh cool thing exists - in case I need to buy some weed on the internet\". The conventional wisdom at the time was that bitcoin was anonymous (or at least that’s what I believed at the time till learning otherwise later). Anyways long story short, I finally bit the bullet and bought some bitcoin in early 2013, signed up for Coinbase in 2014, and made lots of comments on reddit (another forum I was active on) in the 2012-2013 period that I’m probably not going to post here as I don’t want to dox my anon account and because some of those old comments are a bit embarrassing but here’s a gem from a hacker news post discussing the state of bitcoin miners at the time.\n\n![A comment by sgpl on hacker news circa 2013](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2UxGKT0Vgr30aHU1nk0XX.png?height=684&width=1950)\n\nAnyways over the intervening years, I sold my limited bitcoin holdings as the prices rose. In all honesty, I didn’t foresee bitcoin prices at the levels they’re currently are at. And frankly, it was hard for me to imagine bitcoin blowing up in the way it has over the past decade - so in a way I admire people who could see this possibility then.\n\nI think a lot of early talk by prominent believers (at least this is my impression anyway) was about the use cases for bitcoin as a medium of exchange/transactions - while that has happened to some extent, I’d say it’s limited. But the believers were rewarded more as bitcoin has, over the years, become a store of value and as the OG of crypto continues to see wider adoption with institutions as well as individuals.\n\nI also read about Ethereum for the first time on hacker news on a discussion that was pretty highly upvoted at the time but I don’t think I really took time to understand the innovations that Ethereum brought about to the space.\n\nAnyways so that’s the story of my early encounters with crypto. I think I pretty much slept on this space after about 2015. But I’m now starting to see the future again with  more clarity and it’s increasingly becoming obvious to me that web3 technologies will impact our lives and futures in meaningful ways.", "timestamp": 1635275322, "digest": "UbDTlkzqyK60EodQV5BcIfinNX0gCab3cXLpGFO9PCc", "contributor": "0x286ba9aFB6e54fd6ccc8ad3fE5d843656E9D691D"}

A speculative artist whose work often floats freely in liminal spaces between the organic and synthetic, science and science fiction, the utopian and dystopian—and occasionally the slimy and the sublime—Yan maps geographies of futuristic worlds in which the human has devolved into nature. Even that distinction may be a bit dubious, however, given the ways that Yan shows nature is, well, never quite natural itself.*\n\n*Each of these pieces also holds a talismanic weight as the first ever released by ecodao, and as such, they’ll entitle holders to additional powers as well. Each will be a passport into the ecodao community that will offer owners the right to first purchase of ecodao’s token if they’re holding when ecodao decides to tokenize—pending, yes, legal confirmation and tokenization.*\n\n*More immediately, each will also be a passport to **ecodao’s first party, late-night on November 5th, at a secret location in Williamsburg DJed by [BRUX](https://soundcloud.com/whoisbrux).** Once you’ve collected a work, you’ll just need to pull it up in your wallet at the door to get automatic admission.

Of course, I would never *actually* be able to imagine a goldfish's experience, but the thought experiment always took me to a visual field in my mind where the boundaries of “objects” dissolve, everything is alien to me, and I don’t even have a self-awareness to observe *through*.\n\nCreating this series was in some way a form of invoking that state of existence—or rather that experience I call “primordial vision.” It is seeing before language, and even before distinguishing ‘things’ apart. **What lies within this visual field is alien, unknowable and unknown—not least because there is not yet a power dynamic between the perceiver of the vision and what is perceived.** There is a suspension, a gasp in our processing--\n\nI started thinking and reading a lot about nature and biology this year. My initial exploration of olfactory arts and technologies shifted to reading about fungi, algae and alternative food systems—I began musing on a future of fungal technological systems—and to reading Donna Haraway and Timothy Morton. I started taking a bioengineering class. Recently I read about biofabrication and synthetic biology, and picked up *A History of Biology*.\n\nLooking back, it was a logical reaction to the pandemic. After spending the majority of my waking hours clicking and typing in front of multiple screens for a year, I was ready to exercise my sensory muscles more dynamically and immerse myself in both nature and learning about nature.\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=459](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=459)\n\nGrowing up in a city of 20 million people in China, I compartmentalized nature as either a “thing” outside the zone of human existence—like the mountains my dad would drive hours to take me to hike during the breaks—or the patches of carefully assorted trees and flowers in the fancier neighborhoods. It took me a while to realize that “nature” as I understood it was a concept constructed just a few centuries ago.\n\nWe are standing at the cusp of some paradigm shift with biology. So much of what biologists are doing in real life today, I, an artist, could not have imagined in my wildest mind. We can take a gene from a single-celled algae species [to make a blind man see shapes](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/24/1025251/a-blind-man-can-perceive-objects-after-a-gene-from-algae-was-added-to-his-eye?curius=1159). We can make xenobots that treat DNA as a cellular hardware [implementing rewritable physiological software](https://www.growbyginkgo.com/2020/06/29/is-dna-hardware-or-software/?curius=1159), which means genome editing isn’t the only way for programming species. We can 3D print tissues like brain organoids, from a real human cell, [to test drugs on mini brain models](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/biofabrication) for more precise medicine. There’s a new CAD software that scientists use to perform *de novo* whole-genome [design of new cells from any species](https://engineeringbiologycenter.org/?utm_source=NEO.LIFE&utm_campaign=5a4aa5937f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_10_19_11_26&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_253ae8788d-5a4aa5937f-88759182). Recently synthetic chemists and synthetic biologists worked together to create interactions [that wouldn’t have otherwise existed](https://phys.org/news/2021-10-synthetic-biology-realm-unnatural.html).\n\n**The way I created *Primordial Vision: 02021* was very much like a combination of alchemy and 3D printing.** In the software, I layered images, gave them varied heights and roughness, mixed their colors and opacities, stacked them in specific orders, and added weathering or other natural effects. The result is these orbs, floating in a slightly tinted void that even I, the “creator”, don’t completely understand. I view them with the same fascination as an interested audience, perhaps just like how biologists today must feel about their own field.\n\n*Primordial Vision: 02021* is my intuitive imagination of future relationships amongst materials, regardless of their “alive-ness.” But more than that, **I want to bring back a sense of magic.** Before the 16th century, magic and science were very much the same. The “things” around us seemed to have some intrinsic nature that enchanted us precisely because we could not place it. Today, we linger in the vertigo from the naive illusion that we were close to knowing everything, which we briefly held a century or so ago. **In a time when value has long decoupled from fact, we simultaneously suffer from being directionless, due to the lack of a guiding ethos, and having a dangerously singular direction, because of the technological determinism too many people in power hold.**\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460)\n\nModern science brought us to an increasingly mechanistic view, with great precision, of our relationships with ourselves and the world around us. We’re now able to code genes and synthesize novel chemical reactions, which makes it all the more urgent for us **to restore an organic understanding of technology.** I’d like to quote the contemporary philosopher [Byung-Chul Han](https://artreview.com/byung-chul-han-how-objects-lost-their-magic/): “It’s not objects but information that rules the living world. We no longer inhabit heaven and earth, but the Cloud and Google Earth.”\n\nHow do we live through rapidly evolving technologies and sciences, and thus constant updates to our model of the world, while retaining an organic view of the universe and remaining enchanted and awed? I find myself grappling with this question through all my intellectual and creative explorations this year.\n\nWhen the framework of the Anthropocene was proposed in 2000, it made us urgently aware of our species’ capacity to significantly alter our environment that’s co-inhabited by countless other organisms. We seem to have immense power over nature. But the climate crisis is a crisis precisely because it poses a near-existential threat upon us: **the power we felt was an illusion, and we are still very vulnerable within nature.**\n\nThese days we talk, or joke, nervously, a lot about the end of the world. It doesn’t require a lot of technical knowledge to become acutely aware of the many ways in which we face near-existential or existential risks. The atomic bomb opened the first chapter of our *serious* thinking on extinction, though it seems a small harbinger of the risks we were yet to conceive. [Thomas Moynihan, an Oxford historian of ideas, observed](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/x-risk): “the discovery of human extinction may well yet prove to have been the very centrepiece of that unfolding and unfinished drama that we call modernity.”\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=461](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=461)\n\n**While we are standing at the mesmerizing cusp of unlocking new understandings of the natural world in a degree of complexity and precision unimaginable to us not too long ago, we are also just beginning to live with the idea of *our* death. I use *02021* to denote this year in the work’s title, to hold a more expansive timeline of humanity. But more importantly, we need to collectively instill a long-term worldview that includes *all* sentient beings.**\n\nThis is where artists come in, in cooperation with other thinkers: to reimagine a future encompassing the terrain past human sight and reason, a terrain that nevertheless already surrounds us on this earth. After all, so many crises come down to our models of what we are, and how we relate to other “things.” We are not ever gods, and we need to intentionally walk away from an instrumental view of nature as objects to tame, or manipulate, for our *own* enjoyment and survival.\n\nMaybe you could look at these orbs as planets. Not as planets we will inhabit or that Earth will become. But as planets inhabited by some aliens that have different ways of moving and interacting with the substances around them. What is their nature, what is their technology, and what, frankly, is the difference? — *Wendi Yan*\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=441](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=441)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635277562, "digest": "8_z5JQrhmCAVSU6vi4V7_r7M6HQ-pOWuAVdTNPPtIJY", "contributor": "0xB1059fA05452c48495C7607a6615d5F1DB8109f9"}

However, the ecosystem of DeFi governance and token delegation can often be hard to navigate. Here at [Blockchain at Berkeley](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu) (B@B), we’ve learned a lot from running our delegation program for 4 protocols ([Uniswap](https://uniswap.org), [Compound](https://compound.finance), [Aave](https://aave.com), [Fei](https://fei.money)) over the past year . This guide intends to distill some of those learnings into a digestible format to help other delegates & future community members hit the ground running.*\n\n**DeFi Governance Overview**\n\nProtocols use DeFi governance to empower community members to work together to make key decisions regarding protocol changes, launching new initiatives and transforming the long-term vision for the protocol. In the most common model, [token-based governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token), 1 token corresponds to 1 vote in the protocol, enabling every token holder of a protocol to participate in governance. By leveraging governance, DeFi protocol teams decentralize decision-making across the community.\n\nThe governance process, like the DeFi protocols themselves, are controlled by smart contracts. In most protocols, once a governance proposal and its protocol change is approved, the proposal moves into a timelock where it is held frozen for a period of time (such as two days) before being integrated. Timelocks allow for a buffer for the community to counteract potentially malicious or misinformed activity before they are incorporated into the protocol.\n\nFor example, [Governor Bravo](https://compound.finance/docs/governance#governor-bravo) is a popular set of governance contracts developed by Compound Labs. Any proposal made in Governor Bravo contract is made of a set of actions: call contract function, upgrade contract by redeploying and setting proxy address of new version, etc. These changes then go to a vote, of which the result is either cancelled or sent to the timelock before execution.\n\n*How are proposals integrated into the protocol? (Courtesy of [Open Zeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/proxy-patterns/))*\n\nWith Governor Bravo and similar governance contracts, certain smart contracts designated by the protocol are able to be upgraded without needing to change the proxy address. However, smart contracts not deployed under these frameworks are immutable, and as such many DeFi protocols use proxy contract patterns to interface between the client and the actual contract logic.Users and client applications use the address of the proxy contract and interact with its functions. The proxy contract then points to the protocol’s contract logic. This enables upgrading protocol parameters and redeploying contracts to the chain without necessitating that clients change the addresses they interact with; rather, clients simply change what version of the protocol logic that the proxy contract points to.\n\n**Token Delegation**\n\n*Why does delegation matter?*\n\nEarly investors & protocol builders often hold an outsized amount of governance tokens and delegation of these tokens serves as a vector to encourage diverse participation from the community. For example, a16z recently [open-sourced their token delegation program](https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program/), which looks to increase the quality of the governing body of protocols by delegating to community members who demonstrate early leadership in governance.\n\n[https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program/](https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program/)\n\nVoting power is delegated by use of utility functions in the governance token smart contracts. These functions enable token holders to delegate their on-chain governance rights to others who they as view as adept “protocol governors”.\n\n*How do you become a delegate?*\n\nWhen bootstrapping a DeFi Governance initiative, it helps to first show a depth of knowledge in a protocol by being active in the forums and the community at large. After gaining familiarity with the protocol and understanding the value-add your organization can bring to the table, contributing to the protocol and being an early community leader in a protocol is the best avenue to receiving your first delegation. Connecting with VC firms and protocol teams/founders are potential avenues as well, but the most effective method to make an impact is still simply being very active in moving the protocol forward & making your voice heard. In our experience, we’ve seen that by being active protocol governors in the community, investors & founders will start reaching out to you directly with delegation proposals. However, it is necessary and your responsibility as a delegate to do your due diligence on protocols and only participate as delegates in protocols that are legitimate. Being transparent, accountable and independent are key towards earning the community’s trust, and you must actively seek all to be an impactful community member.\n\n[https://twitter.com/CalBlockchain/status/1416082070208712705?s=20](https://twitter.com/CalBlockchain/status/1416082070208712705?s=20)\n\nThe legal contracts associated with the delegations can vary, but they generally include a gas stipend to cover the costs of gas fees for on-chain voting, along with the delegated token amount and duration of the contract. It’s standard practice for a clause to be included that allows for the revocation of delegated tokens should your organization become inactive in the community. We’d highly recommend having a legal contract in place just to make sure that all parties are on the same page in terms of delegation details and expectations.\n\n*Example of a DeFi governance delegation letter (Courtesy of a16z)*\n\n[https://github.com/a16z/crypto-governance/blob/main/delegation/delegation_letter.md](https://github.com/a16z/crypto-governance/blob/main/delegation/delegation_letter.md)\n\n**Our Approach to DeFi Governance**\n\n*Mission*\n\nWe strongly value being active in the entire governance process, from forum discussions to temperature checks to proposal discussions to intermediate and final votes. We engage our community not only through forums, but also on Twitter, where we explain our voting decisions and meet to discuss protocol changes with community leaders within each protocol. By being active governors & community members, we hope to leave a lasting impact on DeFi governance and help shape the future of DeFi.\n\n*Committee Structure*\n\nAlthough we aim to incorporate as much information as possible into our governance decisions, we’ve found that a carefully structured core Governance team helps ensure that we stay on top of protocol developments and are informed voters & contributors in governance. The core team ensures the decisions that our organization makes in DeFi governance are democratic and well-reasoned.\n\nInitially, we began with a committee where each member would be active in the community of each of the protocols that we were delegates in and would come together as a group to discuss the proposals to reach consensus. While this model works well as delegates in 1–2 protocols, we quickly recognized that it wouldn’t scale as we became delegates in new protocols. Currently, we designate core members to serve as leads for specific protocols & DAOs within a protocol (ex. B@B’s involvement in the [Aave Risk DAO](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-aave-risk-dao/4729/14)). Our core governance team meets on a consistent basis for our governance committee to debate the merits of governance proposals. In meetings, our protocol leads relay the specific details and nuances of protocols to the committee, allowing us to make more informed votes as a team.\n\n*Case Study: Temporarily Disable COMP Rewards (Compound Proposal 63)*\n\nTo dive in deeper into what our governance process looks like, we’ll explain our evaluation process for our recent vote AGAINST COMP Proposal 63, which looked to temporarily disable COMP rewards in response to the [Comptroller exploit](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/30/defi-money-market-compound-overpays-15m-in-comp-rewards-in-possible-exploit/) from an [overlooked error in COMP Proposal 62](https://twitter.com/Mudit__Gupta/status/1443454935639609345).\n\n[https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-proposal-63-temporary-patch-for-comp-distribution-bug-9-29-21/2327](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-proposal-63-temporary-patch-for-comp-distribution-bug-9-29-21/2327)\n\n1. The first aim of our team is to get the context, goals, downsides & implementation of the proposal at hand, spearheaded by our protocol leads. Proposal 63 needed to be fast-moving to respond to the $100M+ at risk from the exploit, and as such was a rudimentary solution: give the community the ability to suspend all COMP claims to prevent more money from being at risk. However, this proposal came with a significant downside - all integrations with the protocol (ex. a protocol using Compound as a part of an investment strategy) involving the *claimComp* function would be bricked. Proposal 64 was released two days later and fixed the same problem with a more nuanced solution: only those users who did not interact with exploited markets would be able to withdraw their COMP. After further research, we recognized that this solution was not only more elegant, but better maintained trust in the Compound protocol in the wider DeFi community. As a result, the initial research led the Compound protocol leads to recommend voting AGAINST the proposal.\n2. After completing the research phase of evaluation, the Compound protocol leads presented their preliminary findings & initial research to the committee for a full vote by the core team. Due to the potential implications of the vote and importance of finding a solution to the exploit, our team dedicated significant time towards individually researching the merits of the proposal. After doing so, the committee convened to vote and a majority decided to vote AGAINST Proposal 63.\n3. Because Proposals 63/64/65 were interrelated, we included our justification for all 3 proposals in one tweet that we released to the community. By including our reasoning in our tweets, we hope to educate & help guide those in the community towards making well-informed governance voting decisions.\n\n[https://twitter.com/CalBlockchain/status/1445631256113270799?s=20](https://twitter.com/CalBlockchain/status/1445631256113270799?s=20)\n\n**Future Steps**\n\nBy being active delegates & contributors in DeFi Governance, we hope we can help educate the wider crypto community and take ownership in moving protocols forward. We aim to release our specific views and objectives for B@B’s DeFi Governance impact in a future post. To give a teaser - as DeFi continues to go mainstream, rethinking incentive mechanisms for community engagement & access to governance are integral prerequisites to mass adoption. As always, we’re excited to continue contributing to the community in a transparent & public manner!\n\n**General Resources**\n\nThe governance tooling ecosystem has evolved rapidly in tandem with the growth of DeFi and we’ve found that having a hub for these resources is key towards improving awareness & efficiency in DeFi Governance.

With the progress made during the [Amphora Interop event](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/10/15/amphora-merge-milestone/), the specification is now close to final 🎉\n\nBefore we dive into The Merge, though, a short update on the difficulty bomb!\n\n## Arrow Glacier 🏹🧊\n\nOn AllCoreDevs #124 ([recording](https://youtu.be/BTtwbvZZpfs), [tweets](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1449047538103767044)), we agreed to push back the difficulty bomb, set to go off in December 2021, to June 2022. To do so, we will have a network upgrade, [Arrow Glacier](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/arrow-glacier.md), which contains a single EIP, [EIP-4345](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4345), that pushes back the bomb.\n\nArrow Glacier is scheduled for block 13,773,000, expected on [December 8th, 2021](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/13773000).\n\nWe debated various options for the Ice Age pushback on AllCoreDevs. June was chosen because we had reasonable confidence that The Merge could happen before, and we wanted to avoid having to organize another difficulty bomb pushback right before it.\n\nOf course, The Merge is independent from the bomb: it will require a separate network upgrade and is activated based on a PoW `total difficulty` threshold. **This means that we do not need to \"wait\" for the difficulty bomb to go off in order to transition Ethereum to proof of stake. Similarly, if we encountered issues with the transition, we could decide to push back the bomb once more.**\n\nHopefully, Arrow Glacier will be the last network upgrade on PoW Ethereum 🤞🏻 Onto The Merge!\n\n## Post-Merge Architecture 🏗\n\nThe architecture for The Merge leverages the fact that Ethereum already has battle-tested clients built for both its execution (Eth1) and beacon (Eth2) chains. Given that these exist, it makes sense to keep using them.\n\nAt a high-level, at The Merge, clients will switch from following PoW to following PoS to determine Ethereum's latest valid block. Aside from that, most of the clients' functionality, and, more importantly, the EVM, its state, and how it executes transactions, will stay the same.\n\n**Post-merge, the current Eth1 and Eth2 clients respectively become the execution and consensus layers (or engines) of Ethereum. This means that node operators of either Eth1 or the Beacon Chain clients will need to run the \"other half\" of the stack to have a fully validating node.** Danny Ryan has great diagrams illustrating this. They've been [minted as NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/when-merge), with the proceeds going towards the engineers and researchers working on The Merge.\n\n![Post-merge client architecture. NFT. Artist: Danny Ryan](https://i.imgur.com/l65cGy0.png)\n\nThe above shows what a full Ethereum client will look like post-merge. Let's use this as our starting point to dive into each component!\n\n## Beacon Node 🚨\n\nToday, Beacon Nodes are tasked with coming to consensus on  empty (from end users' standpoint!) blocks. These contain pieces of consensus-related information, called Operations, such as attestations, the deposit contract root and validator slashings/exits, but do not contain any \"transactions\" in the Eth1 sense (e.g. sending ETH or interacting with smart contracts). The Merge is where this changes.\n\nAs The Merge happens, Beacon Nodes will watch the current PoW chain and wait for it to hit a predefined `total difficulty` threshold, called `TERMINAL_TOTAL_DIFFICULTY`. Once a block with `total difficulty >= TERMINAL_TOTAL_DIFFICULTY` is produced, it will be considered the final PoW block. Subsequent blocks will be produced and attested to by the validators on the Beacon Chain.\n\nTo do this, Beacon Nodes will communicate with their execution engine (formerly the Eth1 client) and ask it to either produce or validate `ExecutionPayloads`. These payloads are the post-merge equivalent of Eth1 blocks. They contain information such as the parent's hash, the state root, the base fee, and a list of transactions to execute. Once these have been produced or validated, the Beacon Node will share them with other nodes on the p2p network.\n\n![A post-merge block: the consensus layer (a.k.a. Beacon Node) validates all the fields currently part of Beacon Chain blocks. It passes ExecutionPayloads to the execution layer for validation as it receives them on the network.](https://i.imgur.com/9ju947n.png)\n\nTo establish communication between the consensus and execution layers, a new set of JSON RPC endpoints is introduced: the Engine API.\n\n## Engine API ⚙️\n\nThe [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/main/src/engine) is the communication interface between the consensus and execution layers. It is exposed on a separate port than the execution layer's public JSON RPC API. For simplicity, calls to the API are always initiated by the consensus layer and the API introduces only three methods: `engine_executePayload`, `engine_forkchoiceUpdated` and `engine_getPayload`. Let's go over what each of these does:\n\n* `engine_executePayload` asks the execution layer to validate that an `ExecutionPayload` conforms to all protocol rules.\n\n  After receiving a payload via this call, the execution layer will either return `VALID`/`INVALID` or, if it still has not synced to the tip of the chain, `SYNCING`. Because a block's validity is dependent on its parents' validity, if the execution layer is missing historical data to assess the payload's validity, it will fetch it from the network. \n \n* `engine_forkchoiceUpdated` is how the consensus layer informs the execution layer of a new head and finalized block on the network. In the case where the consensus layer needs the execution layer to produce a new `ExecutionPayload` on top of the latest head block, it will pass a `payloadAttributes` field along with this call.\n\n  The`payloadAttributes` field contains information relevant for the execution engine to produce an `ExecutionPayload`, specifically the `timestamp`, `random` and `feeRecipient` (formerly `coinbase`) values. Upon receiving this call, the execution layer will update its head, sync as needed, and, if required, begin building an `ExecutionPayload` with the values from `payloadAttributes`. \n \n* `engine_getPayload` asks the execution layer to return its best `ExecutionPayload` whose build process was previously initiated in an associated call to `engine_forkChoiceUpdated`.\n\n  This is how, when a validator must produce a block, it gets a valid one from its execution engine. Other nodes will then, upon receiving that block from the p2p layer, call `engine_executePayload` to assess its validity.\n\n... and that's it! With these three new endpoints, the consensus and execution layers can communicate information about the state of the chain and transactional payloads. Now, let's dive into how the execution engine works some more.\n\n## Execution Engine 🛠\n\nAs stated above, the execution engine is what becomes of Eth1 clients after The Merge. At that point, anything related to consensus is removed from their purview. Their main focus becomes state management, as well as block creation and validation, which is modified slightly. The bulk of the changes are described in [EIP-3675](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675).\n\nFirst, The Merge will require some change to the block format. Several fields, which are only relevant for PoW and not PoS, will be set to `0` (or their data-structure's equivalent). These are fields which either relate to mining (`difficulty`, `mixHash`, `nonce`) or to ommers (`ommers`, `ommersHash`), which are not possible in PoS. The length of `extraData` will also be capped to 32 bytes on mainnet.\n\nSecond, because issuance will only happen on the Beacon Chain post-merge, the execution layer will stop processing block and uncle rewards. That being said, the execution engine will still be in charge of handling transaction fees. Indeed, as it creates an `ExecutionPayload`, the execution engine ensures that all transaction senders can pay at least the current `baseFeePerGas` and that any extra fees are sent to `feeReceipient`. Note that `feeReceipient` refers to a \"legacy\" Ethereum address, and not a Beacon Chain validator.\n\nThird, once PoS has taken over from PoW, execution engines will stop gossiping blocks. This means deprecating the `NewBlockHashes (0x01)` and `NewBlock (0x07)` handlers at the p2p layer. Again, the execution layer will still be in charge of syncing the network state, gossiping transactions and maintaining its transaction pool.\n\nThe following diagram, again by Danny Ryan, shows the execution layer dropping PoW and relying on the Beacon Chain as The Merge happens.\n\n![PoW blocks stop appearing and Beacon Chain blocks begin to hold ExecutionPayloads after The Merge.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IpF4PeStURgtLYdXGs0Rn.png?height=740&width=2129&size=medium)\n\nWe've now covered all the core components of how clients process blocks and communicate internally post-merge. Now, let us briefly touch on the various \"edges\" of the system.\n\n## P2P Networking, User APIs and Sync 📡\n\nAs the first diagram in this post shows, post-merge, both the execution and Beacon Chain layers participate in a p2p network. Aside from block gossiping being deprecated on the execution layer side, everything else in the p2p network remains unchanged: Beacon Nodes will gossip attestations, slashings, etc. and the execution layer will share transactions, sync state, etc. each on their independent p2p network.\n\nSimilarly, the user APIs for both the [Beacon Chain](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-apis) and the [execution layer](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/) will remain independent, with the exception of the newly created Engine API.\n\nThe one component which will live across both layers is sync. Several syncing strategies are being developed for every possible edge case pre and post merge. These are still being refined and tested, and may be the subject of a future deep dive.. 👀\n\n## Next Steps 👀\n\nSince [Amphora](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/10/15/amphora-merge-milestone/), the focus has been on specification refinements and devnet testing. Over the coming weeks, expect the specifications to have settled to a point where we do not expect any more major modifications.\n\nIn the meantime, the [Pithos](https://pithos-explorer.ethdevops.io/) testnet is up and running with more client combinations being tested daily, and a [community call is scheduled for next week](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/402) for infrastructure & tooling providers to get up to speed on The Merge. See you then 👋🏻\n\n![The various client combinations running on Pithos, from https://pithos-explorer.ethdevops.io/charts](https://i.imgur.com/4Ymkvq9.png)\n\n\n---", "timestamp": 1635278571, "digest": "sR23jU02we6zXRgsF_oTUkttL83S3vyn05vJWnnp-Lc", "contributor": "0x10F5d45854e038071485AC9e402308cF80D2d2fE"}

Equity Ownership of Anything, and a New Digital World", "body": "## Introduction\n\nThe world of crypto and NFTs are exploding [for the 4th](https://a16z.com/2020/05/15/the-crypto-price-innovation-cycle/) and 1st times, respectively. I wrote this primer on the history and technical basics of NFTs for anyone with little or no background on the topic. The space moves so quickly - have a read if you are building a systems-level understanding and go from there. 😇 make sure to check out some of the links to see what these NFTs actually look like!\n\n## Definition of NFTs\n\nA non-fungible token, or \"NFT\", is a unique digital asset. Consider \"fungible\" assets, like bitcoin or a US Dollar: all bitcoins and US Dollars are non-unique and interchangeable. In contrast, an example of a non-fungible asset would be a unique, one-of-a-kind piece of art (2).\n\nNFTs can be used to register any digital assets on a blockchain. These assets could include, but are not limited to art, music, tickets, property, and more. What makes something an NFT is its encoding as part of the Ethereum blockchain. Most NFTs are today built on Ethereum, though some other blockchains implement their own versions of NFTs (1).\n\n## A Brief History of NFTs\n\n**2012-13 Colored Coins**\n\nOne of the earliest attempts to use a cryptocurrency to denote and verify real-world assets on the blockchain was Colored Coins. Colored Coins are equivalent to small denominations of bitcoin, as small as a single satoshi (the smallest unit of a bitcoin). Colored Coins were mentioned in a few blog posts and papers in 2012-13 by various authors including Yoni Assia, Meni Rosenfeld, Vitalik Buterin, and Lior Hakim. Colored Coins could be used to represent property, coupons, issue shares of a company, and act as digital collectibles or access tokens. However, there was one main limitation: the Colored Coins only represented a certain value if everyone agreed to their worth. Thus, they may be thought of as one of the first explorations of putting real-world assets onto distributed ledgers, but was far from foolproof.\n\n**2014-17 Counterparty, Spells of Genesis, Force of Will trading cards, and Rare Pepes**\n\nBetween 2014-16, Counterparty was founded as a peer-to-peer financial platform and distributed, open-source Internet protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, with use cases such as a trading card game. In 2016, popular trading card game, Force of Will, then the 4th largest trading card game (following behind Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Magic: The Gathering in North American sales), launched their cards on the Counterparty platform. This was another leap forward in putting assets on a blockchain. Around the same time, Counterparty users began creating a collection of memes, called \"[rare pepes](https://rare-pepe.com/)\", featuring a frog character. These memes were traded on Counterparty, built on the blockchain protocol, as well as on the Ethereum blockchain through a project named \"Peperium\", created in March 2017.\n\n**2017 CryptoPunks**\n\nIn June 2017, two individuals created a new NFT project on the Ethereum blockchain, \"[CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)\": a collection of 10,000 unique characters generated through random combinations of visual features (e.g., beard, sunglasses, skin tone, hairstyles, and other attributes). CryptoPunks were initially offered to anyone with an Ethereum wallet to claim for free, and quickly gave rise to a secondary marketplace where people bought and sold them for hundreds, then thousands, and now, millions of dollars. The most valuable CryptoPunk as of late summer 2021 was CryptoPunk #7523 which was auctioned by Sotheby's in July 2021 and sold for $11.75M at the ETH-to-USD exchange rate of the time.\n\n**2017 ERC271 and CryptoKitties**\n\n[CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/search?include=sale) is a virtual game that allows players to adopt, raise, and trade virtual cats, all on the blockchain. CryptoKitties took another big leap in making NFTs mainstream because they were all over the news as a \"digital cat\" or \"digital beanie babies\" that you can buy and trade with cryptocurrency. Some virtual cats sold for over $100,000.\n\nCryptoKitties were created by a Vancouver-based company called Axiom Zen and revealed at the ETH Waterloo Hackathon, the world's largest Ethereum hackathon. After the release of CryptoKitties, which coincided with the 2017 crypto bull market that saw bitcoin rise in value from $900 to $20,000 between December 2016 and December 2017. Axiom Zen spun out a company called [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), which raised $15M from a16z and Google Ventures (and much more since then), and remains today as one of the leading players in the NFT space, as the company partnering with the NBA to launch [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) collectible digital assets.\n\n**2018-19 Growing in the Background**\n\nThe NFT ecosystem continued to grow slowly, with marketplaces like OpenSea, SuperRare, Rarible, Nifty Gateway, and many more online platforms used to buy and sell NFTs.\n\nWeb3 wallets like Metamask made it easier to purchase and own NFTs.\n\nSome additional names from this era below courtesy of crypto newsletter [The Block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/).\n\n![Many of these players are present today; some have disappeared, and many more have entered!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tf4zc3LOGGNBlFZQQme-y.png?height=348&width=630)\n\n**2020-21 Explosion in the Consumer Mainstage**\n\nNFT assets grew from $40.9M in 2018 to $338M in 2020, with 150,000 total individuals participating in the NFT market, according to enthusiast-started market information site [Nonfungible.com](http://nonfungible.com), which also estimated the breakdown of NFT-related activities as follows: 25% metaverses, 24% art, 23% gaming, 13% sport, 11% collectibles, and 4% utility-based (6).\n\nIn September of 2021 alone, NFT asset sales totaled $2B in transaction volume.\n\nMany more notable projects were launched during this time, which I won't describe in detail, including: [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/home) (a profile picture & community project); [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/) (a simple drop of text files that catalyzed hundreds of projects building on top of the concept); and [RTFKT](https://rtfkt.com/) (a sneaker and metaverse brand).\n\nFor a more in-depth overview of the various categories of NFTs, I enjoyed this [Beginner's Guide to NFTs](https://www.notion.so/cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d), by Linda Xie of Scalar Capital.\n\n## Technical Background & Capabilities\n\nBefore I get to the business applications of NFTs, below is an overview of how the underlying blockchain technology works. Feel free to read, skim, or skip this section.\n\n**How Blockchains Work**\n\nNFTs historically, and most NFTs today, build upon the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain is a decentralized public ledger, similar to the Bitcoin blockchain. One of the important underlying mechanisms of the blockchain is the consensus algorithm, or the algorithm by which users are able to agree on the history of transactions and current state of a blockchain without reliance on a central authority (13).\n\nBitcoin was the first to solve this problem using a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system. Ethereum uses the same mechanism right now, though it is highly computationally intense and energy-inefficient, and Ethereum is soon transitioning to a more efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) method.\n\nIn order to maintain accuracy in a decentralized network, each time someone wants to make a transaction on a blockchain, other members of that blockchain ecosystem are asked to verify that transaction (more precisely, a group of transactions called a \"block\") as legitimate. One method is PoW, and relies on a consensus algorithm, where participating members (\"miners\") solve difficult math problems and publish the solutions with the goal of arriving at a consensus. These problems are computationally intensive and require real-world resources like computers and electricity. Miners are rewarded for arriving at the consensus solution and receive the currency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other currency of that Blockchain) generated in that block. This enables verification in a decentralized network because the only way to commit fraud would be to control enough total computing power that you can put forth your solution as the overwhelming consensus, implying that other users are misrepresenting the current state of the blockchain. Due to the magnitude of miners, PoW is expensive (in a real-world sense, due to high usage of electricity and computers) and controlling enough resources to outnumber enough other miners is expensively infeasible.\n\n**ERC-721 and NFT technologies**\n\nThe ERC-721 is an Ethereum Standard for NFTs, meaning that these NFTs are built on the Ethereum blockchain. The main feature of ERC-721 is that each Token is unique and can have a different value from other Tokens from the same Smart Contract. Smart contracts are programs that live and run on the blockchain and create and govern NFTs or decentralized apps. Mechanically, all NFTs have a `uint256` variable called `tokenId` and for any ERC-721 Contract, the pair `contract address`, `tokenId` must be globally unique. Then, a dApp can have a \"converter\" that uses the `tokenId` as input and outputs a range of media type, including an image, music, or more.\n\nThe ERC-721 standard is used widely for NFTs today and was originally proposed in January 2018 by William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs.\n\nAs NFTs have grown in popularity, some companies use private blockchains to power NFTs. In particular, Flow, operated by Dapper labs (and supporting NBA Top Shot) is devoted to NFT transactions and can be more efficient. (Though the very nature of private blockchains is somewhat counterculture to the original purpose of a decentralized network as a place where anyone can make transactions without oversight by any one institution).\n\n## Business Capabilities, and Why NFTs Represent a New Possibility Frontier in Crypto\n\nCryptocurrencies have always been traded, their value determined by supply and demand, as a currency. However, NFTs represent a difference in that the value of each token is not based on supply and demand for a commodity or currency, but rather, ownership (partial or fully) of an asset represented by each token.\n\n**NFTs in Collectibles**\n\nClearly, we have already seen the possibilities of NFTs as collectibles - from the $100,000+ CryptoKitties to $11M+ CryptoPunk to a Top Shot 2019-2020 LeBron James dunk moment, to of course, Beeple's art collection sold for $69M (7). At the high end, this market seems likely to continue for as long as the crypto nouveau-riche have their riches - driven by a powerful combination of the pursuit of social status and financial investing. In addition, some believe that players like NBA Top Shot and Autograph are bringing in the non-crypto audience as well.\n\n**NFTs in Art**\n\nArt can be thought of as a subset of collectibles, or at least at the intersection of the Venn Diagram between collectibles and art in its purest form - an expression and appreciation of human creativity. Art \"minted\" as NFTs means that the art has a digital representation on the Ethereum blockchain (\"minting\" is the act of adding representation for that artwork on the Ethereum public ledger) (9).\n\nPerhaps the significance of the NFT ecosystem for artwork is the ability to now buy and sell art - particularly digital art - with greater ease, confidence in its verification, and upside in its value thanks to the scarcity feature of NFTs and the thriving crypto wealth and ecosystem springing up around digital artwork.\n\nNFTs have a feature that enable the original artist to receive a percentage of sales every time the NFT is sold, or resold. This could mean that artists, for the first time, can get tangible value from their artwork as it trades hands.\n\nJust last week, [a friend of mine](https://twitter.com/_alexmaceda_) posted on Twitter that an anonymous collector had purchased ALL \\~two dozen of her paintings via NFT artwork marketplace, OpenSea. Without the NFT and crypto capital, it is hard to imagine where, to whom, or how she would have sold this artwork. However, now, her ability to earn income as an artist is significantly higher with an entire new world of crypto capital and digital patrons anywhere.\n\nEven more interesting is the intersection of traditional art and digital, programmatically generated art. Cryptopunks fall in this category as each Cryptopunk was generated algorithmically based on a set of traits; each trait had a certain number of variations and varying levels of rarity. More recently, in 2021, the creators of Cryptopunks created Meebits, using the same method, a custom generative algorithm.\n\n**NFTs in Gaming**\n\nCertain early pioneers of mobile games, such as Machine Zone CEO Leydon, believe NFTs have huge potential in gaming (8). As one illustration, games traditionally make significant revenue from in-game purchases (e.g., of weapons, character customizations, or other benefits). However, when someone stops logging into a game, the items they bought no longer have value. Imagine if players could then sell their items and make money, or bring their items across games into another game. Moreover, the players of a game were beholden the game creators - players had to follow game rules and received none of the value or revenues generated by the game. In a world of NFTs, a game in which players can buy NFTs used in the game (e.g., plots of land) means that suddenly, the players become owners and investors in the game.\n\n**NFTs as Access Tokens**\n\nAnother use case of NFTs is to give NFT-holders the ability to access certain experiences, products, or services - and transact that access. Imagine a celebrity wants to issue an NFT-based membership program to offer exclusive products, musical drops, or experiences to their fans. A fan could purchase an NFT access token and enjoy the offerings, as well as sell that NFT in the future when they no longer want to consume the offerings, or perhaps if the value of that artist's token has increased significantly and the fan wishes to sell the access token for a profit.\n\nFor example, one startup, Centerstage, is a digital events platform where seats are sold as NFTs. Users create online stadiums use the revenue from NFT seat sales to book artists to perform. NFT seat holders can then trade NFTs based on upcoming artists or hold onto their own seats and watch every show.\n\n**NFTs as Equity Ownership (in Music, Writing, and what's next?)**\n\nTo me, one of the most consequential implications of NFTs is the paradigm shift they have brought about - where anything digital can be owned, accrue financial meaning and value, and therefore become a new financial asset.\n\nAs an example, [Mirror.xyz](http://mirror.xyz) (where I have published this article!) is a platform where writers can offer pieces of writing as NFTs. You can actually buy (and eventually trade) fractional ownership in this article. Patrons who purchase an NFT associated with a particular piece of writing then display those NFTs on their profile. Similarly, [Royal.io](http://royal.io) is a music platform co-founded by DJ and early NFT enthusiast Justin Blau with serial entrepreneur JD Ross, where listeners can buy ownership in songs directly from artists and earn royalties alongside them. Thus, if a reader is a big fan of a certain piece of work or a creator, or a listener is a big fan of an artist, they now have a means of showcasing and supporting the work **not only for the benefit of the creator, but also for the social and financial gain of the patron.**\n\nIf the the prior generation of \"Patreon\"-style creator economy focused on giving fans a direct way of monetarily supporting creators, the new NFT economy represents a paradigm shift where anything can be turned into an asset and both user/fan/audience and creator can take part in the financial, equity ownership and financial appreciation of that asset.\n\n## Controversy & Criticism: The intangible nature of NFTs and The Climate Impact\n\n**NFTs don't actually come with rights to the artwork, just a digital representation**\n\nOne of the earliest experimenters with NFTs recently warned that spammers have been taking copies of famous artwork and selling them as NFTs (10). NFTs don't come with the artwork itself - even when the artwork is fully digital, the NFT doesn't have enough space to store the full details of an image; instead, an NFT typically points to an https URI address (uniform resource identifier, similar to a URL) or an IPFS address (powered by the InterPlanetary File System, a blockchain-based file storage provider) or includes a mathematical compression of the work (e.g., a checksum) to prove the work's identity.\n\n**NFTS are accused of being environmentally unethical**\n\nOne loud and growing criticism of NFTs are the environmental impacts. ArtStation, an online marketplace for digital artists, was met with fast backlash on Twitter hours after it announced plans to launch a platform for NFTs. Artists protested the \"ecological nightmare\" of NFTs and ArtStation scrapped its plans (11).\n\nSome argue that the greater the demand for NFTs, the greater the motivation for miners to continue their energy-intensive mining activities. The crypto world seems to believe that the upcoming move of Ethereum 2.0, using a PoS instead of PoW method, could be a solution to this problem. In addition, innovators are exploring solutions such as alternate blockchains or private chains which already use PoS methods, side chains that verify NFT transactions without using the main, expensive Ethereum chain, and interchain operability allowing interactions across NFTs built on any blockchain.\n\nIt will be interesting to see where, across all these options, NFT creators, collectors, and consumers end up over time.\n\n## A Few Conclusions: NFTs as Equity Ownership of Anything, and Ushering in the Digital New World\n\nNFTs have evolved gradually over the last many years and certainly exploded in the last 12 months. This was likely due to a combination of factors: the pandemic confining consumers much more so to digital experiences; the global macro environment, between financial heat-up in the stock markets and low interest rates, leading to significant capital seeking new assets to generate returns; the crypto ballooning in market size, from \\~$200B to $800B+ from 2019 to 2021 in bitcoin alone (14).\n\nRegardless of where the zealous interest and capital has come from, one thing is for sure: the popularity of NFTs has created a zeitgeist and permanent paradigm shift in business models. Namely:\n\n1. NFTs enable the creation of **equity ownership** in **anything**, while\n2. greatly reducing the friction and increasing the acceptance of valuing, owning, and trading digital assets.\n\nGiven the amount of interest and economy value the NFT economy has created, this paradigm is likely here to stay.\n\n\n---\n\nThis piece was originally written for my Stanford independent research project.

Our mission is to transform the way culture and public goods are funded, beginning with the arts. We are moving to web3 and invite you to join us as we build the [Artizen DAO](https://artizen.link/pitch-deck).\n\nArtizen helps communities come together and support the things they care about. We make it easy to crowdfund new grants, curate the awards, and earn NFTs from the winning projects — a positive-feedback cycle that powers sustained support for your field, community, or cause.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wh78apEs5zDx5xZeMcWIm.jpg?height=1185&width=1920&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n## The Problem\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4YP_U1sUzv-7_hQzrBcKT.jpg?height=838&width=2500)\n\nGrants are the lifeblood of the arts, but a [new model for grants is deeply needed](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/the-state-of-public-funding-for-the-arts-in-america/424056/). The current system is centered around institutions, not communities, and as a result is bureaucratic, inefficient, and does not align incentives between donors, grantmakers, artists and their fans.\n\n* **Donors**: few rewards, no voice in curation, no relationship with artists and little stake in their success.\n* **Grantmakers**: complex administration, overhead, challenges attracting and keeping donors.\n* **Artists**: insufficient funding sources, onerous application processes, weak ties to donors. Few grants go directly to artists, most go to nonprofit gatekeepers who can afford full-time grant writers.\n* **Fans**: excluded from the grant process entirely with no ability or incentive to donate to grants.\n\n## The Solution\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Bjad-DCei_4FB4_vo8q_H.jpg?height=802&width=2500)\n\nArtizen has developed a new model for grants that aligns the incentives of grantmakers, donors, fans and the artists they support. By combining crowdfunding, community curation, and NFT rewards, we can unlock new money, untapped network effects, and sustainable support for the artists in your community and every community around the world.\n\n* By giving donors a voice in where their money goes, we give fans a reason to become donors;\n* By eliminating bureaucracy, we give more money directly to artists, and simplify processes for both artists and grantmakers;\n* And by rewarding donors with NFTs, we give everyone a stake in the project’s success, attracting more donors and creating stronger ties between supporters and artists.\n\n## Artizen Grants Unite People\n\n![The Dance by Matisse](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S590-O_XWeO8WoW5-oULX.jpeg?height=997&width=1500)\n\nSince launching our MVP in 2021, Artizen has awarded nearly $500K to artists across more than 100 grants, grown to 12K+ members, and partnered with major companies and cultural institutions including Microsoft, HP, Unity Technologies, and the Cannes and Tribeca Film Festivals. These partners are excited to underwrite community grants because we give them a way to directly support causes they care about, while removing the complexities of running a grant themselves.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_8fyRkr5vVNpe3BixCRYi.jpg?height=1260&width=2410)\n\nIf you’re HP, or Academy Award Winner Viola Davis, and you want to encourage more Black visionaries to explore new technology, you can either create and run your own complicated grant, incubator, or mentorship program – or you can simply back an Artizen grant.\n\n## Artizen Curation Engine\n\nGroup decision-making is a challenge. How do you give a voice to donors without making it just another popularity contest? How can you give unknown artists an extra leg up? How can a grantmaker guarantee high standards for winning artists, and keep a grant aligned with its original mission? How do you create a positive, *[wagmi](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/art/nft-twitter-meanings-definitions)* culture and avoid a dynamic of ‘winners’ vs. ‘losers’? How do you balance the power of small donors against big donors?\n\nWe have been iterating on these difficult questions for over 100 grant cycles. The result is our Curation Engine, a selection system that balances and harmonizes these interests. Grantmakers select a jury of experts who review project submissions and curate 3-10 finalists. This guarantees that winning projects uphold the mission standards and mission of Artizen grants while allowing for thoughtful curation of projects that might not yet have large followings. [Quadratic voting](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html) balances small and large donor power while still incentivizing donation. And everybody wins: splitting prizes proportionally to upvotes avoids the disappointment and bad blood of winner-take-all contests.\n\n**Here’s how a grant works in practice**:\n\n* Artists submit project proposals;\n* Jury, selected by the grantmaker, chooses 3-10 finalists;\n* Community donates to buy upvotes;\n* Community votes for their favorite of the Finalists;\n* Project with the most upvotes wins the grant, but all Finalists receive funding in proportion to the number of votes they received;\n* Winning project mints an NFT Artifact to reward donors (more about this later).\n\n![Artizen Curation Engine](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZMRZDCSXjwYcQdEaX8zPa.jpg?height=1260&width=2410)\n\n## Community Curation Drives Growth\n\nWe’ve discovered something remarkable: community curation drives growth.  By giving donors a voice in selecting winners, artists have a reason to invite fans, and fans have a reason to become donors. The most successful Artizen grants grow rapidly because of this dynamic, and we are modeling the web3 version of Artizen on their success.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/idR26Y7n3QnguyQC8XbUX.jpg?height=908&width=2500)\n\n## NFT Rewards\n\nWe are building a new version of our platform on web3 for two reasons. The first is to use NFT rewards to ‘close the loop,’ connecting the value of the art to the donors who support it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H0CJWMuc8iMDHrGYku6rT.jpg?height=1260&width=2410)\n\nFor each grant cycle, donors will receive an NFT representing their support (a portion of an Artifact, described below).  Designed with the winning artist, it will combine the ideas of a [POAP](https://poap.xyz/) with NFT art – both a badge of support and a tangible asset that can appreciate in step with the growth of the artist’s career.  In addition, royalties from any trading of these tokens goes back into the Matching Fund to ‘pay forward’ into future grants. NFTs will also connect the success of individual grants to the health of the whole grant ecosystem through Artizen Artifacts.\n\n## Artifacts Power the Artizen DAO\n\nThe second reason we are moving to web3 is because we want Artizen to be owned by our community. Artizen Artifacts are NFTs that represent collective ownership of the platform, which will transition to a [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) (DAO). Artifact holders will be artists, donors, grantmakers, fans, and anyone else invested in building a brighter future for art, science, and culture.\n\nRoyalties from Artifact sales go back into the Matching Fund, which will provide ongoing support for all grants. Each grant cycle mints 3 new Artifacts, designed by the winning artist – one for the DAO, one for the artist, and one fractionalized as rewards to their donors. As the company transitions to distributed governance, the community can experiment with new structures and policies.\n\n![Artifact of van Gogh's Ear](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XXqUSUWJ_GT9L1MNosM2U.gif?height=450&width=800)\n\nThe collection begins with 1,111 objects from the history of art around the world, designed by [Nak Yong Choi](https://knocknak.com/) with sound by [Elliot Cole](https://www.elliotcole.com/). These 3D objects will be interoperable with [Jadu](https://opensea.io/collection/jadu-jetpack), [Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/), and elsewhere in the metaverse. And finally, this collection (and community) will grow as new grantwinning work is also memorialized in Artifacts.", "timestamp": 1635282206, "digest": "JG0qijxHRbh4a9I3xdwpsgWWno8lOKn1X2wGCeqXueI", "contributor": "0xfe5E90ba7cDAaDba443C0C27010eB1D51327EaFb"}

Lee earned a PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon in 1988 before working for Apple, Silicon Graphics, and Microsoft. In 1998, Lee help found Microsoft Research Asia, now considered one of the best computer science research centers in the world. In 2005, Lee left Microsoft for Google China, where he stayed for four years before leaving to found Sinovation Ventures, an investment firm focused on Chinese startups.\n\n**AI Superpowers has two key assertions:**\n\n1. China is likely to surpass the United States in AI leadership\n2. Ai is going to fundamentally change the world\n\nFor a quick primer on AI, click below:\n\n\n***\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/08/Sections-27.png)\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/09/AI-Superpowers-02.png)\n\nIn May of 2017, Google’s AlphaGo AI beat the world’s best Go player, a Chinese teenager by the name of Ke Jie. Go is a strategy board game similar to chess but has innumerable more possible moves (2.1 x 10^170 legal board positions). At one moment, the AI began playing moves that no human would ever play, stumping the world’s best player.\n\nAlphaGo’s defeat of Ke Jie served as a [sputnik moment ](https://www.space.com/10437-sputnik-moment.html)for the Chinese government, who quickly began to invest heavily in technology and AI research. In the same way that the Soviet Union’s launch of the Sputnik 1 satellite created the Space Race of the 1960s and 70s, **AlphaGo has signified the start of an AI race.**\n\nIn AI, the United States and China are the definitive global leaders \\[[1](https://hbr.org/2021/02/is-china-emerging-as-the-global-leader-in-ai)\\]. Kai-Fu Lee argues that while the United States leads in cutting edge research, China is leading in AI implementation. This distinction, of cutting-edge research versus implementation, is crucial to Lee’s arguments about the future of AI.\n\n**Lee asserts AI will be the next general-purpose technology,** more like the advent of electricity or the steam engine than an incremental invention like the personal computer.\n\nIf AI is like electricity, the country which builds out power lines and implements the technology will get first mover benefits. In AI this is especially important because AI tends to be winner take all. AI implementation is a virtuous cycle, with increased adoption leading to increased data, which improves the quality of algorithm, which leads to further adoption. Lee asserts that as AI leaves the lab and is adopted by the broader economy, the quantity of AI engineers will be more important than the quality of any individual engineer.\n\nWhile China will not create a true general-purpose AI, they will implement hundreds of AI which solve specific problems though out their economy.\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/09/AI-Superpowers-01.png)\n\n## HUNGRY ENTREPRENUERS\n\nKai-Fu Lee notes three currents in China – cultural acceptance of **copy catting**, a **scarcity** **mindset**, and a **willingness** to dive into any promising new industry – are the foundation of China’s internet ecosystem. These currents convince Lee that Chinese entrepreneurs are more willing to do anything to be successful, ultimately winning the AI Race. Lee points out that while in the US tech startups are mission driven – they build a product to accomplish a goal - in China they are market driven, creating products which will make money.\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/09/AI-Superpowers-06-1.png)\n\nFor this ruthlessness, Kai-Fu Lee describes the Chinese startup space as a **colosseum filled with gladiators.** In the United States, startups are afforded intellectual property\\*\\* (IP) protections\\*\\* and companies frequently sue each other for stealing IP. In contrast, China has little in the way of protections for their startups. In China, hundreds of small startups fight for market dominance despite little distinguishing features between them.\n\nOne can imagine hundreds of Chinese DoorDash clones, competing for market share in the streets of Guangzhou, copying new delivery methods, algorithmic tricks, or advertising methods. While in the US companies will rush to copyright their inventions, in China, history is written by the victor, and very few care how you got there.\n\nWang Xing, a Chinese tech entrepreneur, produced clones of Facebook (Xiaonei), Twitter (Fanfou), and Groupon (Meituan). Little action was taken by authorities for copyright infringement. Meituan is an excellent example of how China is pulling even with the US tech industry. While Meituan was originally a clone of Groupon, Groupon has declined to a valuation of $650 million whereas Meituan is now valued at $190.54 Billion.\n\nAnother driving factor in the Chinese market is a **comparative comfort with monopolization and scale**. Chinese companies are focused on the edicts of the government, not upholding a consumer welfare standard like American companies. Further, meeting the demands of the Chinese market - a population of nearly 1.4 billion – allows for extremely rapid user growth. While 330 million users for in the United States is 100 percent user adoption, 330 million users in China barely breaks 20 percent. Lee notes Chinese startups burn investment capital at rates American investors would be unwilling to accept because the upside, if you survive, is so high.\n\n## ABUNDANT DATA\n\nWhile historically China has been seen as a poor copy of the Internet ecosystem of the United States, this is no longer the case. The Chinese internet has developed its own paradigm, fueled by the 2010 Great Firewall and the explosion of WeChat.\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/09/AI-Superpowers-05.png)\n\nWeChat is the swiss army of all apps. In China, WeChat is a social media app for messaging, but can also be used to reserve hotel rooms, purchase food from the local farmers market, or call a rideshare like Uber. You can read more about WeChat by [clicking here.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/technology/wechat-china-united-states.html)\n\nWith 1.25 billion active users in 2021, WeChat creates an ocean of minable data. WeChat’s ubiquity as a remote control for life generates millions of data points for location/movement patterns, consumer purchasing habits, and natural speech patterns. In AI research, data is critical for training algorithms and is considered part of the [“AI Triad.”](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/the-ai-triad-and-what-it-means-for-national-security-strategy/) The variety of data collected by WeChat is easily machine readable, as it all is collected from a single source.\n\n**Kai-Fu Lee claims that if data is the new oil, China is the new Saudi Arabia.**\n\n## AI SCIENTISTS\n\nSince 2018, the top Chinese universities have offered majors in Artificial Intelligence, quickly becoming the fastest growing major in China \\[[2](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/2020/0914/c1668a18569/page.htm)\\] \\[[3](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/ai-education-in-china-and-the-united-states/)\\]. In China, the Ministry of Education is directly responsible for setting centralized long term goals for more than 282 million students and directly manages 75 elite universities. In contrast, the US allows each state to set its own education goals, complicating a unified direction for American education. ([link](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/education-in-china-and-the-united-states/)) The top-down style of the CCP is antithetical to how Silicon Valley and the US approach education.\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-5.57.38-PM.png)\n\nIt is projected that by 2025 Chinese universities will produce more than 77,000 STEM PhD graduates compared to approximately 40,000 in the US \\[[4](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/china-is-fast-outpacing-u-s-stem-phd-growth/)\\]. While US institutions maintain and recruit the highest quality AI researchers from around the world the sheer scale of China’s investment in AI will present a challenge to American dominance.\n\n## AI FRIENDLY POLICIES\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is doing everything it can to push AI development. In contrast to the United States, the CCP has little concern for market forces and is deeply involved in the day-to-day operations of the Chinese economy. In a study of Shenzhen’s International Technology Transfer Model and Measure to Improve it, the author notes that state action can directly impact technology transfers between regions \\[[5](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/a-study-of-shenzhens-international-technology-transfer-model-and-measures-to-improve-it/)\\]. Additionally, The Chinese Communist Party’s 14th Five-Year Plan, which passed the National People’s Congress in 2021, explicitly supports optimization and innovation in AI. \\[[6](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/china-14th-five-year-plan/)\\]\n\nWithout direction from the Chinese Communist Party, none of the above – a large computer science pipeline, entrepreneur access to abundant data, and hungry entrepreneurs – would be possible.\n\nMore reading on the subject can be found below:\n\n[How China is Preparing for an AI-powered Future](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/how-china-preparing-for-ai-powered-future)\n\n[U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) research and development (R&D) may be challenged by China’s recent and centralized policy planning aimed at rapidly developing AI-related technologies.

In the video, he explains his second point, that AI is going to fundamentally change the world, much better than I can. Click below to watch:\n\n\n***\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/08/Sections-31-1.png)\n\n### Cultural Revolution\n\nOne of the quotes I found most remarkable in the book was “When Bill Gates founded Microsoft in 1975, the People’s Republic of China was still in the middle of the Cultural Revolution.” I recently finished Mao: The Unknown Story and was struck by both the similarities and profound differences between the two eras in China. On one hand, technologists in China are competing with Americans on a level playing field, demonstrating the technical and economic progress China has made. On the other, Chinese Gymnasts at the 2020 Olympics wore Mao pins during the medal ceremony, symbolizing a return to Authoritarian Maoism to China \\[[7](https://www.wnct.com/sports/japan-2020/mao-pins-worn-by-chinese-athletes-may-test-olympic-rules/)\\] \\[[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism)\\].\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-25-at-5.05.40-PM.png)\n\nIn 1966, Mao supported radical university students attacking the school’s establishment as counterrevolutionaries, kicking off the Cultural Revolution. Unfortunately for these students, often the sons and daughters of elite Chinese, the Cultural Revolution would soon come for them in the “Down to the Countryside” movement. This movement, which targeted many of the original Red Guard students, forced young intellectuals into the countryside to perform manual labor. Given the [recent Chinese crackdown](https://chinatalk.substack.com/p/chairman-rabbit-on-the-tech-and-education?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MzQ3NTc0LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo0MDA2Mzk2NiwiXyI6InhiTWt1IiwiaWF0IjoxNjMyNTg1Njg4LCJleHAiOjE2MzI1ODkyODgsImlzcyI6InB1Yi00MjIwIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.wGxgsoIzb6j_DIXV_0nR_zzgDFqhMtU5J4KP1Ba-R_I) on consumer and education tech companies, I wonder if something similar is occurring. The Chinese Communist Party cares most about control, and the Red Guard students - while useful at diminishing the power of intellectuals – ultimately became too difficult for CCP to control as well, leading to punishment. The Chinese tech industry is providing incredible benefits to China but was punished to maintain the power consolidated to the CCP.\n\n### Compute and Semiconductors\n\nOne area of AI Kai-Fu Lee deeply underestimates is the importance of semiconductors and microchips in AI advancement. As mentioned above, the AI Triad is critical for the future of AI. Kai-Fu Lee highlights the incredible amount of data Chinese AI scientists can use to build better algorithms. This misses the importance of compute in creating the best AI. As IoT devices become more normalized, data will be abundant everywhere, diminishing China’s current advantage. According to Forbes, in the last two years, 90 percent of the data created by humans was created in the last two years. \\[[9](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/?sh=1cf0018960ba)\\]. As data becomes less important, cutting-edge compute will become the chokepoint for AI. In this area the United States and its allies are far ahead.\n\nThe following is an excellent overview of the international semiconductor industry and China’s efforts to build out a domestic version.\n\n[China, Semiconductors, and the Push for Independence - Part 1](https://lillianli.substack.com/p/china-semiconductors-and-the-push)\n\n[Guest post by Jordan Nel of Vineyard Holdings](https://lillianli.substack.com/p/china-semiconductors-and-the-push)\n\n![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/94c1453a-28bd-46f0-974b-cd9fd7df26e5/apple-touch-icon-1024x1024.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1200,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9a815d6-8e2c-4a65-9c0a-0c52834db187_1005x407.png)\n\n### Military Implications/Key Data\n\nWhile data on food purchasing habits is important to building a delivery AI, it is totally unhelpful in building an AI to deliver a missile. Kai-Fu Lee noted that while China may have an army of tinkerers, it is unlikely to push the ultimate frontier and discover a general-purpose AI. One aspect of the AI contest largely left out of AI Superpower is the impact AI will have on the future of warfare and the security posture of the United States. For example, if Chinese AI have data on the purchasing habits of Chinese consumers, it doesn’t help deliver a missile into the heart of Chicago. However, if Chinese AI were to have accurate data on the geography of the United States one can easily see how this would have military implications. Chinese AI with mass amounts of data on American transportation patterns could help identify a weakness in America’s defenses. Data protections, especially between the two AI superpowers, will be critical to national security moving forward.\n\n### AI Inequality\n\nAs discussed by Klaus Schwab in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, AI will create massive inequality, both within the United States and between the United States and other nations \\[[10](https://www.byteleg.com/the-fourth-industrial-revolution/)\\]. Few developed nations, such as the United States and China, will produce the world AI, eliminating ladders out of poverty for developing nations. If we’re not careful, in the same way that the American workforce could hollow out into two classes, countries throughout the world could do the same.\n\n\n***\n\n[State of AI Report 2020](https://www.stateof.ai/)\n\n[The State of AI Report analyses the most interesting developments in AI.

Lee earned a PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon in 1988 before working for Apple, Silicon Graphics, and Microsoft. In 1998, Lee help found Microsoft Research Asia, now considered one of the best computer science research centers in the world. In 2005, Lee left Microsoft for Google China, where he stayed for four years before leaving to found Sinovation Ventures, an investment firm focused on Chinese startups.\n\n**AI Superpowers has two key assertions:**\n\n1. China is likely to surpass the United States in AI leadership\n2. Ai is going to fundamentally change the world\n\n\n***\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/08/Sections-27.png)\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/09/AI-Superpowers-02.png)\n\nIn May of 2017, Google’s AlphaGo AI beat the world’s best Go player, a Chinese teenager by the name of Ke Jie. Go is a strategy board game similar to chess but has innumerable more possible moves (2.1 x 10^170 legal board positions). At one moment, the AI began playing moves that no human would ever play, stumping the world’s best player.\n\nAlphaGo’s defeat of Ke Jie served as a [sputnik moment ](https://www.space.com/10437-sputnik-moment.html)for the Chinese government, who quickly began to invest heavily in technology and AI research. In the same way that the Soviet Union’s launch of the Sputnik 1 satellite created the Space Race of the 1960s and 70s, **AlphaGo has signified the start of an AI race.**\n\nIn AI, the United States and China are the definitive global leaders \\[[1](https://hbr.org/2021/02/is-china-emerging-as-the-global-leader-in-ai)\\]. Kai-Fu Lee argues that while the United States leads in cutting edge research, China is leading in AI implementation. This distinction, of cutting-edge research versus implementation, is crucial to Lee’s arguments about the future of AI.\n\n**Lee asserts AI will be the next general-purpose technology,** more like the advent of electricity or the steam engine than an incremental invention like the personal computer.\n\nIf AI is like electricity, the country which builds out power lines and implements the technology will get first mover benefits. In AI this is especially important because AI tends to be winner take all. AI implementation is a virtuous cycle, with increased adoption leading to increased data, which improves the quality of algorithm, which leads to further adoption. Lee asserts that as AI leaves the lab and is adopted by the broader economy, the quantity of AI engineers will be more important than the quality of any individual engineer.\n\nWhile China will not create a true general-purpose AI, they will implement hundreds of AI which solve specific problems though out their economy.\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/09/AI-Superpowers-01.png)\n\n## HUNGRY ENTREPRENUERS\n\nKai-Fu Lee notes three currents in China – cultural acceptance of **copy catting**, a **scarcity** **mindset**, and a **willingness** to dive into any promising new industry – are the foundation of China’s internet ecosystem. These currents convince Lee that Chinese entrepreneurs are more willing to do anything to be successful, ultimately winning the AI Race. Lee points out that while in the US tech startups are mission driven – they build a product to accomplish a goal - in China they are market driven, creating products which will make money.\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/09/AI-Superpowers-06-1.png)\n\nFor this ruthlessness, Kai-Fu Lee describes the Chinese startup space as a **colosseum filled with gladiators.** In the United States, startups are afforded intellectual property\\*\\* (IP) protections\\*\\* and companies frequently sue each other for stealing IP. In contrast, China has little in the way of protections for their startups. In China, hundreds of small startups fight for market dominance despite little distinguishing features between them.\n\nOne can imagine hundreds of Chinese DoorDash clones, competing for market share in the streets of Guangzhou, copying new delivery methods, algorithmic tricks, or advertising methods. While in the US companies will rush to copyright their inventions, in China, history is written by the victor, and very few care how you got there.\n\nWang Xing, a Chinese tech entrepreneur, produced clones of Facebook (Xiaonei), Twitter (Fanfou), and Groupon (Meituan). Little action was taken by authorities for copyright infringement. Meituan is an excellent example of how China is pulling even with the US tech industry. While Meituan was originally a clone of Groupon, Groupon has declined to a valuation of $650 million whereas Meituan is now valued at $190.54 Billion.\n\nAnother driving factor in the Chinese market is a **comparative comfort with monopolization and scale**. Chinese companies are focused on the edicts of the government, not upholding a consumer welfare standard like American companies. Further, meeting the demands of the Chinese market - a population of nearly 1.4 billion – allows for extremely rapid user growth. While 330 million users for in the United States is 100 percent user adoption, 330 million users in China barely breaks 20 percent. Lee notes Chinese startups burn investment capital at rates American investors would be unwilling to accept because the upside, if you survive, is so high.\n\n## ABUNDANT DATA\n\nWhile historically China has been seen as a poor copy of the Internet ecosystem of the United States, this is no longer the case. The Chinese internet has developed its own paradigm, fueled by the 2010 Great Firewall and the explosion of WeChat.\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/09/AI-Superpowers-05.png)\n\nWeChat is the swiss army of all apps. In China, WeChat is a social media app for messaging, but can also be used to reserve hotel rooms, purchase food from the local farmers market, or call a rideshare like Uber. You can read more about WeChat by [clicking here.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/technology/wechat-china-united-states.html)\n\nWith 1.25 billion active users in 2021, WeChat creates an ocean of minable data. WeChat’s ubiquity as a remote control for life generates millions of data points for location/movement patterns, consumer purchasing habits, and natural speech patterns. In AI research, data is critical for training algorithms and is considered part of the [“AI Triad.”](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/the-ai-triad-and-what-it-means-for-national-security-strategy/) The variety of data collected by WeChat is easily machine readable, as it all is collected from a single source.\n\n**Kai-Fu Lee claims that if data is the new oil, China is the new Saudi Arabia.**\n\n## AI SCIENTISTS\n\nSince 2018, the top Chinese universities have offered majors in Artificial Intelligence, quickly becoming the fastest growing major in China \\[[2](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/2020/0914/c1668a18569/page.htm)\\] \\[[3](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/ai-education-in-china-and-the-united-states/)\\]. In China, the Ministry of Education is directly responsible for setting centralized long term goals for more than 282 million students and directly manages 75 elite universities. In contrast, the US allows each state to set its own education goals, complicating a unified direction for American education. ([link](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/education-in-china-and-the-united-states/)) The top-down style of the CCP is antithetical to how Silicon Valley and the US approach education.\n\n![](https://www.byteleg.com/content/images/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-5.57.38-PM.png)\n\nIt is projected that by 2025 Chinese universities will produce more than 77,000 STEM PhD graduates compared to approximately 40,000 in the US \\[[4](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/china-is-fast-outpacing-u-s-stem-phd-growth/)\\]. While US institutions maintain and recruit the highest quality AI researchers from around the world the sheer scale of China’s investment in AI will present a challenge to American dominance.\n\n## AI FRIENDLY POLICIES\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is doing everything it can to push AI development. In contrast to the United States, the CCP has little concern for market forces and is deeply involved in the day-to-day operations of the Chinese economy. In a study of Shenzhen’s International Technology Transfer Model and Measure to Improve it, the author notes that state action can directly impact technology transfers between regions \\[[5](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/a-study-of-shenzhens-international-technology-transfer-model-and-measures-to-improve-it/)\\].

{"id": "kKK4s_Kg6J34_0jzdSZdVjQGd_yX1j4ulvdT5slnOOQ", "title": "Phala Network - Privacy-Focused Smart Contract-Based Solution on Polkadot", "body": "# \n\n**In a blockchain, a set of blocks records transactions details upon the authentication and verification proceeded by network participants (nodes). Thousands of participants keep a copy of the ledger with themselves, so they double-check and validate all transactions before new blocks are added.**\n\n**Still, as transactions made in the blockchain are public, it is not impossible to identify someone by crossing data and proceeding with detail-oriented research (even considering all transactions are done peer-to-peer).**\n\n**To solve it, Phala Network created an innovative solution based on smart contracts to help users reclaim their utmost privacy when transacting in the blockchain ecosystem.** \n\n** \n **\n\n## Public Blockchain vs. Maximum User Privacy - Is it Even Possible? \n\nPublic blockchains are one of the most intriguing and unique innovations ever created by mankind. Yet, like everything else in life, they are not perfect. Although it is impossible to deny the innovations brought by public blockchains, there has been a rising concern about privacy and confidentiality associated with them.\n\nIn a public blockchain, all transitions that have ever occurred on a specific network are recorded. This way, it is a challenge to balance between maintaining this detailed database while scaling in terms of security and user privacy.\n\nNowadays, hackers, central agencies, spies, and security agencies could track individuals using public ledgers, considering every P2P (peer-to-peer) transaction is recorded and maintained in the digital database.\n\nHence, both the anonymity and privacy of the participants in a public blockchain are at constant risk. For example, the US National Security Agency (NSA) has been reportedly tracking and monitoring participants in the Bitcoin network. \n\nAlthough some may say it is all \"conspiracy theory,\" the fact is any public ledger is always vulnerable, exposed to hack attacks, tampering, data-stealing tactics, and network clogging. \n\n** \n **\n\n## What is Phala Network? \n\nEssentially, Phala Network is a cloud computing solution. Its primary goal is to offer next-level cloud computing power to protect the privacy of managed programs and preserve blockchain's secure and trustless properties. \n\nIn this context, the term \"managed programs\" means that the programs' internal states and the interactions between users and the program have no public visibility.\n\nStructurally, it combines the peer-to-peer (P2P) functionalities of hardware running open-source software with blockchain functionalities for extra security. On Phala, there is no centralized executor nor data controller, meaning the platform is completely trustless.\n\nAt the end of the day, the network simply acts as an intermediary, a mediator between computing power and users. This way, blockchain-based functionalities keep the transactions in order, without revealing the substance to ensure their absolute security.\n\nPlus, the solution offers much more than a smart-contract platform. Phala Network reunites the best aspects of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0, meaning users can enjoy the capacity of a centralized program while benefiting from decentralized aspects (trustlessness, privacy, etc.).\n\nWithin the project's own design, Phala provides a solid infrastructure for huge - and trustless- data exchanges between different parties. Hence, the parties do not need to trust each other, as the data can be used without being revealed.\n\n** \n **\n\n## How Does Phala Work? - In Detail \n\nThe platform's website provides an extensive, thorough whitepaper explaining all the essential aspects that represent the core of the project. First, they introduce their mindset, their security-oriented approach, how user privacy can be attained, and the underlying mechanisms that make it possible. \n\nBased on Polkadot, the confidential smart contract network is based on two types of nodes - TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) workers and gatekeepers. When compared to mining functions in PoW (Proof-of-Work) networks, TEE workers are responsible for transaction processing. \n\nThe TEEs operate the hardware behind the network's structure, securing all the code and data stored inside to be protected with their full integrity. In essence, these are tamper-proof processors, globally connected in a permissionless manner.\n\nWhile Bitcoin miners need a colossal hardware structure to participate in the world's most disputed network, the TEEs in Phala Network have more average people-friendly requirements. \n\nIn this sense, it is possible to connect to Phala and run its code with a home-based personal computer. The focus on making the network the most user-friendly as possible is part of the decentralized aspect, which is a key factor to maintain Phala's censorship-resistant properties.\n\nGatekeepers are responsible for verifying all hardware and software-related aspects are intact and secure, handling and managing several processing phases (e.g., worker rotation, factoring replication, recording inputs and outputs, etc.).\n\nManaging the connection between users and TEEs, Phala's gatekeepers run the nodes to maintain the blockchain. Neither the TEE workers nor gatekeepers have access to the actual inputs and outputs to Phala, as only the software inside TEEs does.\n\nWhen compared to other blockchains such as Ethereum, Tezos, or EOS, Phala Network is very lightweight. The project aims to launch its blockchain as a parachain on Polkadot, seizing advantages like interoperability, scalability, and next-level functionality.\n\n** \n **\n\n## Explaining the PHA Token \n\nThe PHA token is Phala's native utility token. As expected, the token has governance purposes, as stakeholders who own a required amount of PHA may join the PhalaDAO and participate in the community.\n\nThe network offers a multi-pronged infrastructure that encompasses cross-chain confidential widgets, trustless computing tools, and other features that are only accessible by PHA holders.\n\nAlso, only stakeholders who own a certain amount of PHA can be gatekeepers. If a gatekeeper betrays the rules, the stake may be fined and took. Users can also utilize PHA tokens to pay for specific services or products across different chains.\n\nMost importantly, PHA is a tradable asset on several exchanges, including Binance, Huobi, OKEx, KuCoin, Uniswap, 1inch, and Gate. \n\n** \n **\n\n## What Lies Ahead for the Project?\n\nFounded in 2018, the project invested plenty of time into building a strong community in its native country, China. Phala's co-founder and lead developer is Hang Yin, a former senior software engineer at Google with extensive experience in artificial intelligence and blockchain applications. \n\nAfter releasing the project's whitepaper in 2019, Phala earned the title of \"China's Polkadot Ambassador.\" In early 2020, the team started its release on testnet, completing the so-called \"planned stress-testing of the computing task module for the PoC3 stage.\"\n\nIn 2021, Phala became a parachain on Kusama and the PHA token got listed on different exchanges like Binance, OKEx, and KuCoin. Currently, the platform is ready to become a parachain on Polkadot, waiting to serve nodes and devs with unique privacy cloud properties and confidential smart contracts.\n\n** \n **\n\n## Conclusion \n\nWhen the infamous Satoshi Whitepaper first came out, the world witnessed the rise of a new way of storing and managing intangible data. However, public blockchains are not perfect, as they are still at-risk regarding user privacy.\n\nPhala Network is a Polkadot-based solution that utilizes smart-contract technology and innovative Web3 tools to provide a confidentiality layer between users and the blockchain. Powered by tamper-proof, trustless execution of contracts, the network processes sensitive data in isolated enclaves secured by hardware-based technology. \n\nPhala is building a platform to provide general-purpose privacy-preserving smart contracts, based on key factors such as confidentiality, code integrity, consistency, availability, and interoperability. \n\nNot fully launched yet, the platform plans to launch its privacy cloud and confidential smart-contract technology until the end of 2021.\n\n** \n **", "timestamp": 1635280723, "digest": "dvMdTF0OLU94-oXsaUmwlMil2NvoaR6Tb-bi9dFW4Xs", "contributor": "0xd57722111412Bf8fD260827426202A04de47899F"}

We jokingly called ourselves The Loot Alliance, and it stuck.\n\n### The Loot Alliance has been formed to shepherd and steer the ongoing Loot website as representatives of the wider Lootverse community.\n\n* We’re a collective of builders, designers, and geeks working together to create a strong foundation for players and builders.\n* We’re committed to building a healthy, sustainable and fun ecosystem in and around Loot.\n* Through cooperation and intentionality, we work to create order through the chaos of Loot (and the general chaos of Web3) so that players can dive in, have fun, and build together — within a common context, in the general direction of the same North Star, towards a shared purpose, as a global, decentralized trustless team.\n\nWe’ve been working furiously for weeks, quietly building bridges across projects and bringing together voices from across the community.  Today we are ready to unveil the new LootProject.com.\n\n### This website is not just a cosmetic change, but it is a milestone moment for the Loot ecosystem and a breakthrough for our community:\n\n> As a decentralized and distributed community, **we** (as a community!) **can still have an point of view**.\n\n> We can create structure and order and scaffolding that will make Loot more accessible, more enduring, more fun.\n\n### Our stated goals for the website:\n\n* Make it **easy** for new players to start playing.\n* Make Loot **fun.**\n* Create a foundation to help others **build on and work within the canon** and lore.\n* Help players understand the forest for the trees.\n* Point in the general direction of a distant **North Star** that will create community engagement and further creativity.\n* Reinforce the **collective will** of the community.\n* Design for **Players** and **Builders**, not skeptics.\n\n## With love, respect and reverence, we present you with:\n\n[LootProject.com](https://LootProject.com)\n\nSigned,\n\n* [The Genesis Project](https://genesisproject.notion.site/The-Genesis-Project-6144d1b50af34803be5cc791dd5b5970) ([Timshel](https://twitter.com/TimshelXYZ), Treppers, Holden, [Huh](https://twitter.com/benhuh), GrandMarquis, tenox, [Yoshi](https://twitter.com/ajwaxman))\n* [Realms / Bibliotecha](https://bibliothecaforloot.com/) ([Lordofafew](https://twitter.com/lordofafew), [RedBeard](https://twitter.com/RedbeardEth), [Squiddy](https://twitter.com/SquiddySquid4), [Coinspiracy](https://twitter.com/coinspiracynut), [MCD](https://twitter.com/MChainDirector), [Tikirey](https://twitter.com/LordTikirey))\n* [Lootmart](https://lootmart.xyz/) ([Jon](https://twitter.com/jonjyan), [rvorias](https://twitter.com/rvorias), [Chunk](https://twitter.com/garythung), [blocksandpixels](https://twitter.com/blocksandpixels), [dribnet](https://twitter.com/dribnet))\n* [Loot.exchange](https://loot.exchange) ([Peter Watts](https://twitter.com/ptrwtts), [LunarMayor](https://twitter.com/Lunarmayor), Jmaier)\n* [Loot Character](https://twitter.com/LootCharacter) ([afar](https://twitter.com/andrewfarah), [Jomessin](https://twitter.com/jordanmessina), [Kyle](https://twitter.com/kyle_ohara))\n* Adventure Gold ([Will Papper](https://twitter.com/WillPapper))\n* [LootSwag](https://twitter.com/LootSwag) ([TonyHe111](https://twitter.com/@he3hao), [AmberGroup.io)](https://twitter.com/@ambergroup_io)\n* [Shahruz](https://twitter.com/shahruz) ([Divine Robes](https://divineroles.com/))\n* George ([Loot Discord](https://discord.gg/NXEntTSHgy))\n* [Scotato](https://twitter.com/scotato) ([0xinventory.app](https://0xinventory.app/))\n* [DivineDAO](https://divinedao.com) ([Conway](https://twitter.com/ConwayAnderson))\n* [Gremplin](https://twitter.com/supergremplin) ([CrypToadz](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptoadz-by-gremplin))\n* [varley](https://twitter.com/highleyvarlet) (OG [Blitmap](https://blitmap.notion.site/blitmap/Blitmap-Wiki-0bcd2d06f95f41549b90ee8a11c2ff0c) artist)\n* [Loot Herald](https://lootproject.substack.com/) ([Andrew Gould](https://twitter.com/andrewdgould))\n* [Hierux](https://twitter.com/hieruxx) ([Loot-Talk](https://loot-talk.com/) & Community advocate)\n* [Dom](https://twitter.com/dhof) ([Loot](https://lootproject.com), [Blitmap](https://www.blitmap.com/))\n* If you’d like to nominate someone to join the Loot Alliance, please pop into the [#general channel in the main Loot Discord](https://discord.gg/7r4BEpH9Mw) and introduce yourself!\n* Or if you have website feedback, please post in [#website-suggestions in the main Loot Discord](https://discord.gg/7r4BEpH9Mw)", "timestamp": 1635284955, "digest": "NoVV9rjxOlOGpPkMcXZGcc3hEHsAZD0mEtgvqnKbuW0", "contributor": "0xaFbc3F98EEDB5f9A25a4AB2232d1346612efE77C"}

Typically between two entities.\n\nUsually it entails some sort of exchange of interaction, like if party 1 does X, then party 2 does Y.\n\n## What is a smart contract?\n\nA smart contract, as defined by Nick Szabo in 1996 \\[1\\] is\n\n> \"a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises.\"\n\n\"a set of promises\" covers the **contract** portion.\n\n\"specified in digital form\" is somewhat contract/smart contract agnostic.\n\n\"including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises\" entails what makes it **smart**. I see this phrase to mean that the contract itself is self-executing, i.e. it automates and/or ensures the execution of the promises. \\[2\\]\n\n### The classic vending machine example\n\nA great example of a smart contract—also from Nick Szabo in 1996—is a vending machine.\n\nHow a vending machine is a contract: if a person (party 1) puts money in (does X), the vending machine (party 2) will give potato chips (does Y).\n\nThe contract of the vending machine is not specified digitally, but more implicitly by a person’s understanding of the concept of the vending machine.\n\nThe mechanical system behind the vending machine automates the execution of the promises.\n\nYou may take note a difference here between a typical legal contract and the vending machine contract—instead of an agreement of terms upfront before the execution of promises, the vending machine presents a system of self-executing promises that will activate upon fulfillment of a condition, the condition being the input of money. This model of thinking will be helpful when extrapolating to blockchain.\n\n### Mental models for contracts\n\n*Normal idea of contract in our heads*: two people sign document, then go to work and don't break the contract (keep their promises).\n\n*New model for smart contract*: system of self-executing promises is exposed to public use; anyone can trigger the execution by providing proper inputs.\n\n## What is a smart contract in the context of blockchain?\n\nAt a high level, smart contracts on a blockchain are not much more than our established definition. In the case of a blockchain, the system that automates/ensures the execution of promises is code, and the promises are expressed/specified by the same code.\n\nSimilar to a vending machine, when you fulfill given conditions, i.e. provide money, you can then trigger the execution of said promises, i.e. blocks of code.\n\nWe can extrapolate this metaphor even further.\n\nWhen you insert money into a vending machine, you’re paying not only for the asset you might obtain as a result of execution, but for the service of execution as well. In other words, you pay for the chips themselves, as well as the machine itself for its convenience and its labor of swirling the little metal spiral to pop out your bag of chips. This is the same for smart contracts. You pay what's called a gas fee not only for 1) a possible asset you might obtain, but also to 2) trigger the execution of a smart contract, with the fee being roughly proportional to the computational resources expended to execute its code.\n\nWhen you put your money into a vending machine, you choose which item you want it to spit out. If you abstract away the bag of chips or candy bar, you're really choosing which function to run, that being the F2 function with your Fritos, or the E6 function with your Snickers. Like a vending machine, a smart contract specifies different functions, aka blocks of code, it can run, and when you use a smart contract, you specify which function you want it to run. \\[3\\]\n\n## How is that possible on a blockchain?\n\nWell, it's only possible on a blockchain that supports this capability.\n\nTake away any relation to money. Let's first just think about how there can be code execution on a blockchain.\n\nFirst, blockchain, if you don't have previous context, is just a software system that allows a network of computers to agree on arbitrary data without any central authority. You may hear this as a network being capable of \"decentralized consensus.\" \\[4\\]\n\nYou can think about a blockchain network as a bunch of computers updating each other on some data, and all the computers cooperate together through clever protocols to ensure that they all have the same data and updates all in the same order. You can think of these updates as pushing new data or editing data.\n\nWe can think of this data as the \"state\" of the network. In computer science, a state machine is just a system with some sort of state, that takes inputs and transitions to a new state in a consistent manner. It’s reasonable to think of a blockchain network as one big state machine, where the data is the state, and the updates are transitions to the states.\n\nNow imagine that one of these updates was pushing some new data, but that data was a block of code. Now everyone in the network has access to this code.\n\nImagine another update was pushing some new data, but this time the data was the output of that code. In this update, it would just include the instruction to get the output of the code, not the actual output itself. Given that everyone has the code, to make this update, they would be able to just run this code. Now you have code execution on the blockchain.\n\nImagine the code was unlimited in the kinds of things it could do. It could make updates, so it could push new data, edit data, push new code, and trigger the execution of other code. Imagine you could call this code from other software. Now you have a development ecosystem that can leverage code execution on this network of computers.\n\n## So is this how it works on real blockchains?\n\nWhat we've established so far is not far off from how smart contracts work on Ethereum.\n\nIf we combine this concept of code execution on a network of computers plus our idea of vending machines as smart contracts, we get Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nOn Ethereum, a smart contract specifies a set of functions, i.e. arbitrary blocks of code, that a user can trigger buy providing some money—to pay for the gas fee as well as any output—and specifying which function to run. Just like a vending machine.\n\nHow does code receive money? When a contract is deployed, an account is created that is connected to that contract, so smart contracts hold accounts that users can send ether to.\n\nBefore any code execution can happen, someone needs to write a contract, and put it on the blockchain, i.e. push data to the network of computers.\n\nThen when the code runs, it changes the state on the blockchain, aka updating data, adding new data, moving money from one account to another, allocating assets to accounts, etc. And instead of the state being totally arbitrary data, at its core it's a bunch of accounts with balances of ether, with the addition of totally arbitrary data.\n\nThis all happens through transactions. Transactions are not only their literal meaning of exchanging assets/services, but also they're arbitrary changes to the state. Sending money from my account to another account is a transaction. Inputting money into a smart contract is a transaction.\n\nThrough this system of state, transactions, and code execution, you can see that this whole blockchain ecosystem really amounts to a bunch of glorified vending machines, that is, glorified vending machines that are powering the future of the web.\n\n…\n\n## Notes\n\n\\[1\\] [Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Markets, Nick Szabo, 1996.](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html)\n\n\\[2\\] Typically a contract would be legally binding, giving parties involved great confidence that the other would fulfill their promises, as otherwise the law would enforce the execution of some consequence. In a smart contract, a system is provided that automates this fulfillment of promises. It gives you 100% confidence the promises will be fulfilled.\n\n\\[3\\] Another similarity between vending machines and smart contracts: you don’t have to inspect the insides of a vending machine to use it or to trust that it’ll actually give you potato chips and not just eat up your one dollar bill. A smart contract is the same way. In most cases the end user should not have to know exactly what’s going on inside a smart contract to use it.\n\n\\[4\\] The actual word \"blockchain\" refers to a particular aspect of the original blockchain's (bitcoin) implementation. This can make things confusing when you try to connect the word to what it means without understanding the technical aspects behind it.

{"id": "KWgXwqTbt9y5wXDmFr-JmmHN5dxed9q0woEt1DORKho", "title": "Lisbon Surfaced The Evolution of DAOs, Solarpunks vs. Lunarpunks and Web3 Social Media - The Defiant", "body": "As people from all over the world gathered in Lisbon, “gm’s” turned to “bd’s” and the metaverse met in meatspace for a week of events and fanfare kicking off with Liscon.\n\nWhether it was in the compact hilly cobblestones that lined the city streets or the rooftops overlooking the Pombaline skyline, there was a certain electricity in the air. Leaders from all over the Ethereum community and beyond came together to bring attention to developments happening with DAOs, DeFi and NFTs, and most importantly, communicate the narratives and memes shaping the direction of the space as a whole.\n\nAlthough he was not in attendance, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s influence was apparent as initiatives to build native Web3 [social media](https://genesisblockhk.com/ethereum-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-on-facebook-twitter-nft/) as well as create new governance models beyond [coin voting](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) were brought to attention.\n\n![image 50725377 2](https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_539,h_405/https://thedefiant.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image_50725377-2-1024x768.jpg)\n\nLiscon attendants waiting for the session to start.\n\n#### **Web1 to Web2 to Web3**\n\nDuring his speech, Steven Waterhouse of Orchid Labs gave a stark reminder to everyone in the room of what the foundation of Web3 is laid upon — the cyberpunk ethos of enfranchising people through transformational technology that overcomes systems of oppression.\n\nThat spirit was the driving force that filled the hearts and minds of the online communities that populated the Web1 era of the 1990s. As Web2 emerged in the 2000s, a new social contract was signed between users and the platforms in which users exchanged their data in order to use these platforms without charge. Yet over time, this social contract became heavily unbalanced and an internet once filled with the potential of digital liberation became a failed utopian experiment. A new system of extraction materialized in Web2 where platforms would capture immense amounts of intrusive information about individuals, leading to an Orwellian digital surveillance state hidden in plain site that is constantly pillaging data from its users without abandon. Yet over the past decade, the internet of information that defined the last two epochs made way for the internet of value that is at the core of Web3, which ultimately reimagines the humanity stack that is rooted in the dreams of Web1 but is crafted through novel incentive models and coordination games.\n\n#### **A New Type of Social Media**\n\nAave founder Stani Kulechov presented his vision for how social media exists on Web3 in his presentation at Liscon. Instead of entities capturing data from their users, he flips the model on its head by empowering users to own their data. Fundamentally, Kulechov views a Web3 native social media as a simple way to broadcast relationships, in addition to a tool for users to understand their social graphs, done by mapping connections with NFT ownership, DAO membership, DeFi interactions and more.\n\nAs new social media platforms such as the one that Aave is developing come into being, the “metaverse funnel,” which assimilates users in the Web3 world, will continue to take shape.\n\n#### **Launching Into the Metaverse**\n\nIn its current state, how people are onboarded into the crypto metaverse depends on a variety of factors such as location, access to capital and usability preferences, among other things\n\nNFTs have become a primary vehicle by which individuals begin to interact with Web3. Although, the pool of people is still relatively small. Currently, less than [600k registered addresses](https://dune.xyz/rchen8/opensea) have made at least one transaction on OpenSea but there’s also surging interest. When Coinbase announced their waitlist for their own NFT platform, over [1 million people](https://cointelegraph.com/news/almost-1-1-million-people-have-already-signed-up-for-coinbase-nft-waitlist) signed up on the first day alone.\n\nWhile marketplaces remain the top of the funnel for the NFT and greater metaverse ecosystem, individual projects can utilize them as well for their own initiatives. For example, during his talk at Liscon, Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki announced “The Greatest LARP,” an interactive game that is meant to educate players on the concept of Moloch and rewards those who participate fully in it with NFTs. Moloch is the Caanite God of Child Sacrifice which represents humanity’s failure to coordinate and is derived from Slate Star Codex’s piece [Meditations on Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) which would later become Moloch DAO’s namesake.\n\nMeanwhile, for many in developing countries, the top of the metaverse funnel are play-to-earn games which serve as an alternative employment opportunity for individuals to support themselves and their families. The most popular play-to-earn game is Axie Infinity where [2 million monthly active users](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/05/axie-infinity-nears-2m-daily-active-users-as-creator-raises-152m-series-b/) breed and fight Axie creatures (which are NFTs) and complete side quests and farm resources within the Axie universe.\n\nThe Philippines alone is home to 40% of all Axie players and the game has had such an effect on the archipelago nation that stores are now accepting Smooth Love Potion, Axie’s in-game currency, as [payment](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/25/some-filipino-merchants-prefer-payment-in-axies-slp/). The government also recently announced plans to [tax players](https://restofworld.org/2021/axie-players-are-facing-taxes/) (which caused a slight panic throughout the community).\n\n#### **DAO Participation**\n\nAfter NFTs and play-to-earn games, the second step in the metaverse funnel is becoming an active participant in a DAO.\n\nAs individuals become more and more adjusted to the world of Web3, it is only natural that they join associations that align with their interests in the same way they would outside of it. DAOs themselves are reminiscent of a phenomenon that 1800s French civil servant and aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville noticed while touring America — that individuals of the new nation would form voluntary associations of all kinds. And they [believed](https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/philanthropy-democracy-america-de-tocqueville) that associations strengthen democracy and extend it beyond the scope of public offices by bringing it down to people who share a common interest with each other. DAOs are the modern incarnation of Tocqueville’s observations.\n\nThere are all kinds of DAOs that exist today and a Cambrian explosion of them have formed, including social DAOs, venture DAOs, impact DAOs and more. As more people join DAOs, tools need to be created to both coordinates efficiently within the DAO and facilitate DAO to DAO, DAO to consumer or DAO to sovereign entity communication.\n\nIn terms of external DAO communications, The DAOist is an organization whose goal is to bridge those in the crypto community to those outside of it and serve as a resource for DAO education. Convinced that DAOs can be the trojan horse of legitimate acceptance, DAOist founder Felipe Duarte, better known as [Elementary Complexity](https://twitter.com/duartedao?lang=en), made the point that if 15% of a nation are employed by DAOs, then it will be much harder for governments and regulators to take action against them and alienate their constituents.\n\nDAOs are still in a nascent stage, but many in the industry bet that they will become the primary employment vehicle of those active in the Web3 world.\n\n![image 50407425 2](https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_471,h_354/https://thedefiant.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image_50407425-2-1024x768.jpg)\n\nKevin Owocki presenting at Liscon\n\n#### **The Evolution of DAO**\n\nThe term DAO has evolved greatly since the early days of Ethereum.\n\nKei Kreutler of Gnosis Guild explained in an interview that before DAOs, the most common term used to describe decentralized organizations was a DAC or Decentralized Autonomous Organization. After the infamous ‘The DAO’ hack in 2016 came a DAO winter, a time where DAOs had time to reimage what they were fully capable of and also to find a Schelling point to once again rally around.\n\nThe real turning point for DAOs — that is nearly universally agreed upon — was the rise of Moloch DAO, a grant-giving organization that solved a fundamental fundraising issue through the [ragequit](https://messari.io/asset/molochdao/profile#:\\~:text=MolochDAO%20is%20a%20decentralized%20autonomous,reduce%20the%20potential%20attack%20surface.) function. Moloch DAO’s model has been forked a number of times and summoned several other DAOs including MetaCartel Ventures and Marketing DAO. Not to mention, the narrative of “defeating Moloch” has been a persistent meme in the Ethereum community. Kreutler notes that over time, DAOs have evolved to have a larger spirit of good-will for solving coordination problems and stalemates.\n\nAs Kevin Owocki stated “DAOs are about reengineering the laws of economic gravity to favor coordination over defecting to Moloch.”\n\nFrom this perspective, Kei speculates that in the future, new token standards will be created that better serve mandates of DAOs to better reflect the emerging laws of economic gravity Owocki mentioned. For example, a token standard could be created whose value is determined by the outcome of an event or frequency of participation. What makes these standards possible to exist is the liquidity that can be provided to them in AMMs that are similar to Uniswap that instead of being ERC-20 based are “ERC-2000 based”.\n\nIn terms of communicating within DAOs, Kei theorizes that in the future, DAOs will become more adaptable organizations with granular governance processes that go beyond just simple token voting. Sub-DAOs can exist within DAOs that have their own ways of coming to decisions such as proof of personhood, proof of participation, or others, and then come to the main DAO with their decisions.\n\n#### \\*\\*More Punks \\*\\*\n\nTwo narrative frameworks that were apparent at Liscon were two forks of the cyberpunk philosophy, solarpunk and lunarpunk. And these actually complement each other more than most people realize.\n\nFor example, both ideological frameworks are in complete agreement that DeFi and DAOs are ideal bottom-up organized systems that empower individuals from the ground up and both would like to see a world where data is owned by individuals rather than extracted by ominous organizations. In addition, both concur that the ultimate goal of Web3 is to build parallel systems that individuals can enter and be viable alternatives to current power structures.\n\nWhile there is a difference of opinion in how to execute said goals, the diversity of opinion allows for wider experimentation in different areas of the humanity stack.\n\n#### **DarkFi Rising**\n\nRepresenting the mindset of the lunarpunks is Amir Taaki and his team at [DarkFi](https://dark.fi/), an anonymous DeFi network that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs that create a network of private money legos.\n\nWith intellectual groundwork rooted in agorism, lunarpunks hold anonymity not only in the highest regard, but absolutely necessary in order to protect individuals and DAOs from overbearing and hostile actors. Taaki contends that DeFi will inevitably split into two. Regulated Finance or RegFi is a severely water-down version of DeFi that is not much different than TradFi today. And then those who want sovereignty in their interactions will be forced into the darkness.\n\nHe states that the biggest issue facing the crypto community today is that the internet of value does not fully live up to its revolutionary potential because it bends too much towards the current incumbents of capital and power and the pressure to conform largely comes from those who benefit from the currently dominated fiat-based system.\n\nAlthough DarkFi has been in development for four years, the meme of DarkFi has recently come into the conversation on Twitter with notable accounts such as [Cobie](https://mobile.twitter.com/cryptocobain/status/1424062626410209281?lang=bg) and [Crypto McKenna](https://twitter.com/Crypto_McKenna/status/1424129573575401474?s=20) tweeting the term to their followers.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZwOreICDGH72rJyvACcrb.png?height=2560&width=1440)\n\nDarkFi pamphlet at Liscon\n\n#### **Private Play-to-Earn**\n\nJust as there is a metaverse funnel being created to onboard people into Web3, a ‘dark metaverse funnel’ will be created as well. A challenge that Taaki and his team have to overcome is “How do we bridge this financial power that is gained within Web3 to the local economic sphere of a local economic community and then after that economic power is realized how can it be bridged to the political sphere to enact meaningful change?”\n\nA possible solution to this is the creation of privacy-based play-to-earn games similar to Axie Infinity into DarkFi that helps bring in local communities in developing countries who Taaki sees as vital in empowering and he concludes from this dynamic, a new technological class can emerge.\n\n#### **Open-Source Maximalism**\n\nGitcoin’s Owocki describes himself as slightly more solarpunk than cyberpunk (or lunarpunk for that matter) and approaches building solutions in Web3 from the perspective of how we can better solve coordination problems.\n\nHe calls himself an “open-source maximalist” and states that Gitcoin’s primary mission is to be an incubator in coordination experimentation with quadratic funding coming out as one of its first major successes. Owocki thinks solving these coordination problems could also mean solving bigger problems, such as climate change, infrastructure development and the funding of public goods, He sees the challenge to overcome coordination failure as a massive ‘choose your own adventure game’ that ultimately defines the metaverse, and it is up to people to decide how to play it.\n\nThe choices players have in this game are between optimizing coordination in order to make a better world or defecting into private utopias that are walled gardens.\n\nThrough DAOs, Owocki states that there is now a better mechanism to communicate in a transparent and immutable way in order to build a more open financial system. Because of this, we have a much stronger foundation for coordinating the distribution of goods than ever existed before. In this system, he believes that solarpunks and cyberpunks can work together to build a world that aligns with their vision of empowerment to as many individuals as possible.\n\nAs attendees return back home and continue their journey into the crypto metaverse, these conversations on what DAOs are and how to build the Web3 stack will carry on. Many factors, including inside crypto and outside, such as what narratives people rally around, regulation, and more will play into what results are seen. Web3 will continue to be an increasing force in the daily lives of significant portions of the global population.", "timestamp": 1635290622, "digest": "PxJgW-sIqzB4XZGA1Yvial9q8cJbxo3SL89JRQCR8EU", "contributor": "0x4E2572d9161Fc58743A4622046Ca30a1fB538670"}

You may hear this as a network being capable of \"decentralized consensus.\" \\[4\\]\n\nYou can think about a blockchain network as a bunch of computers updating each other on some data, and all the computers cooperate together through clever protocols to ensure that they all have the same data and updates all in the same order. You can think of these updates as pushing new data or editing data.\n\nWe can think of this data as the \"state\" of the network. In computer science, a state machine is just a system with some sort of state, that takes inputs and transitions to a new state in a consistent manner. It’s reasonable to think of a blockchain network as one big state machine, where the data is the state, and the updates are transitions to the states.\n\nNow imagine that one of these updates was pushing some new data, but that data was a block of code. Now everyone in the network has access to this code.\n\nImagine another update was pushing some new data, but this time the data was the output of that code. In this update, it would just include the instruction to get the output of the code, not the actual output itself. Given that everyone has the code, to make this update, they would be able to just run this code. Now you have code execution on the blockchain.\n\nImagine the code was unlimited in the kinds of things it could do. It could make updates, so it could push new data, edit data, push new code, and trigger the execution of other code. Imagine you could call this code from other software. Now you have a development ecosystem that can leverage code execution on this network of computers.\n\n## So is this how it works on real blockchains?\n\nWhat we've established so far is not far off from how smart contracts work on Ethereum.\n\nIf we combine this concept of code execution on a network of computers plus our idea of vending machines as smart contracts, we get Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nOn Ethereum, a smart contract specifies a set of functions, i.e. arbitrary blocks of code, that a user can trigger buy providing some money—to pay for the gas fee as well as any output—and specifying which function to run. Just like a vending machine.\n\nHow does code receive money? When a contract is deployed, an account is created that is connected to that contract, so smart contracts hold accounts that users can send ether to.\n\nBefore any code execution can happen, someone needs to write a contract, and put it on the blockchain, i.e. push data to the network of computers.\n\nThen when the code runs, it changes the state on the blockchain, aka updating data, adding new data, moving money from one account to another, allocating assets to accounts, etc. And instead of the state being totally arbitrary data, at its core it's a bunch of accounts with balances of ether, with the addition of totally arbitrary data.\n\nThis all happens through transactions. Transactions are not only their literal meaning of exchanging assets/services, but they're arbitrary changes to the state. Sending money from my account to another account is a transaction. Inputting money into a smart contract is a transaction.\n\nThrough this system of state, transactions, and code execution, you can see that this whole blockchain ecosystem really amounts to a bunch of glorified vending machines, that is, glorified vending machines that are powering the future of the web.\n\n…\n\n## Notes\n\n\\[1\\] [Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Markets, Nick Szabo, 1996.](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html)\n\n\\[2\\] Typically a contract would be legally binding, giving parties involved great confidence that the other would fulfill their promises, as otherwise the law would enforce the execution of some consequence. In a smart contract, a system is provided that automates this fulfillment of promises. It gives you 100% confidence the promises will be fulfilled.\n\n\\[3\\] Another similarity between vending machines and smart contracts: you don’t have to inspect the insides of a vending machine to use it or to trust that it’ll actually give you potato chips and not just eat up your one dollar bill. A smart contract is the same way. In most cases the end user should not have to know exactly what’s going on inside a smart contract to use it.\n\n\\[4\\] The actual word \"blockchain\" refers to a particular aspect of the original blockchain's (bitcoin) implementation. This can make things confusing when you try to connect the word to what it means without understanding the technical aspects behind it.

{"id": "65CQY9wkBjP72MAAu4PFgJ5phaV8r399YdWC45dYE68", "title": "Lets talk about Rape", "body": "And no, I don’t necessarily mean the physical act. Or Rotherham, Telford and the other areas where the social services have allowed and enabled organised mass pedophilic rape to occur. Though we will come back to this.. Particularly the omerta or silence regarding it.\n\nI’m talking about the other meaning and how it applies to blokes, defined by [dictionary.com](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/rape) as..\n\n*3. an act of plunder, violent seizure, or abuse; despoliation; violation:*\n\n*the rape of the countryside.*\n\n### So how do you rape a bloke?\n\nHow do you abuse, plunder or violate a man? Physical rape is one aspect of this however I wonder whether it is necessarily wrong to equate this to other forms.\n\nI would posit that any man who has been to one of the secret family courts in the UK has likely been raped. Not by being overpowered by a violent homosexual hiding in a cupboard, but by the state.\n\nFor instance take [Pete Middleton’s 2014 documentary Traffic](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4061640/). Which is rather deliberately difficult to get hold of. Whilst it is listed on Amazon for just £84.99 the reviews relate to the Benicio Del Toro movie of the same name.\n\nIt contains a harrowing scene shot on a mobile phone where the police lie to gain entry to a man’s house, and then rip his new born baby from it’s mother’s arms. As a bloke he couldn’t have done more to protect his family, yet it was violated and abused. He was raped.\n\n[Traffic 2014 extract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRWuQGV4lic)\n\nIndeed take all of the victims who contributed footage and their stories to the making of that film. They were raped, raped by the state. Their families abused and despoiled. Often by violent seizure too.\n\nIt takes a remarkably brave man to speak out about such things, to tell their stories. They don’t do it for sympathy or the protective cloak of victimhood that women enjoy, merely to warn others of dangers to their own families.\n\nIn order to do so they relive their violation. They deserve our compassion and gratitude for doing so.\n\n### What do we value?\n\nIn order to plunder, despoil or violate it’s worth considering what we, as blokes, value the most. The greater the value to ourselves, the greater the violation.\n\nIf cars were what we valued most then the deliberate keying of a man’s car would be the greatest violation, for instance. Outside of those who endlessly watch repeats of Top Gear on Dave this probably isn’t relevant.\n\nI would suggest that the one thing men value above all other things is our relationships. Whether that be friends, family or intimate ones. In order to form relationships your reputation plays a key part. If you have a reputation for being a scumbag then you will struggle. Especially in intimate relationships.\n\nIndeed there is much evidence that men value their intimate relationships far more than women do. Take the following from Dr Tom Golden on relational aggression..\n\n[Relational Aggression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umZEqHF7GF4)\n\nAs men tend to initiate relationships with women they take relational aggression as a serious threat, though not a personal threat. It therefore slips under the radar in most cases.\n\nLogically if most relational aggression is from women, then it shows that they value the relationship less, though can use the threat of as a means to control. If the relationship ends they will be chased, wined and dined by other blokes. For the bloke they would have to chase, wine and dine.\n\nMost people would agree that a man’s rightful role is to protect his family and to ( at least help) provide for it. Knowing about relational aggression is one step to enable you to do the former; to spot trouble early and prevent it from escalating, potentially into third party abuse.\n\n## The Rape epidemic(s)\n\nDo we live in a society where men are the victims of rape? Emphatically yes! In fact it is institutionalised and even celebrated.\n\nTake divorce. From blue skies and on a clear day a man’s wife tells him that she wants a divorce. She has been carrying on an affair unbeknownst to him ( itself an act of relational aggression) and wants to leave him. What are his prospects?\n\nWell going from loving and providing for his family to the stress and torment of divorce proceedings is bad enough. He will more than likely lose his house, have to pay a large part of his wages to the Child Support Agency and will also have his reputation damaged.\n\nWorst of all she will get custody of the children and he will be allowed to ‘visit’ them on weekends. Which is an obscenity. He will be stripped of his right to protect his family and expected merely to provide money.\n\nNote the role of the state here in providing third party abuse. Whilst faultless he will lose his children and most of his possessions and be compelled by the state to comply with the woman’s wishes.\n\nHe has been raped. That which he prized most, his familial relationship, has been defiled, violated and abused. Let’s call it what it is.\n\nThe only fault here is his wife’s infidelity and relational aggression.\n\nAnd you wondered why the [MGTOW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_Going_Their_Own_Way) community was growing exponentially..\n\nI can only imagine how a man who is the victim of wrongful paternity feels. Violated? Abused? Almost certainly.\n\nWhat of a man wrongfully accused of sexual harassment, domestic violence, domestic abuse or even racism? The very accusation of such is rather abusive in my view, not to mention violating his reputation. He might be plundered of his job based upon merely an accusation of the former.\n\nAnd of his relationship. His wife and kids moved to a domestic violence shelter and eventually rehoused elsewhere. It is an act of rape facilitated by the state.\n\n### How dare you! That isn’t proper rape!\n\nQuite. It’s worse.\n\nIf I had a choice between being the victim of a violent homosexual or having my family destroyed, children taken into care and reputation wrecked I’d almost certainly, and reluctantly, take one for the team. I wouldn’t be buying Bubba any flowers afterwards but at least that which I prize most would be safe.\n\nDo you think the victims of social services would prize their anal virginity above the safety of their families? Granted there are almost 90,000 children in care and rising, hence almost certainly not enough violent male homosexuals to go around if there were such a perverse choice.\n\nHow many social workers are there though?\n\n### The Perfect Rapist.\n\nIf you were to design the perfect rapist would it look like Bubba just after the prison lights went out or the soap slipped out of your hand in the shower?\n\nOr something else? If you gave the problem to an engineer, what would he come up with?\n\nLet’s say we take one of those awful blue haired creatures you always see on the news protesting about something or other. The butch looking man hating mastodons with cankles always shrieking in someone’s face. Curiously enough they’re usually social workers on the sick.\n\nLet’s give them legal immunity from defamation such that they can lie and destroy reputations at will. Then let’s, as part of their training, indoctrinate them in radical feminism. All men are rapists and all women are victims.\n\nLet’s then make it financially advantageous to their employers that they seek children to snatch and get teachers and the wider public to unknowingly tip them off to situations where they might find it easier. Pay for every penny out of central government funds, such that it costs a local authority nothing. I say easier as I doubt any family no matter how well grounded or loving could survive their malign presence.\n\nThen let’s set up a system of secret courts where ‘justice’ cannot be overseen. Where abuses cannot be covered by the media and even the mention of such could lead to jail.\n\nWell it wouldn’t work… Clearly if said blue haired mastodon perjured themselves repeatedly then someone would notice. It would be their word against the families.\n\nSo, let’s call them professionals!\n\nNo matter how slovenly or illiterate if we call them professionals and direct the secret courts to give more weight to their testimony than anyone else’s then…. Yes, I think we’ve got it…. Might well be the Perfect Rapist.\n\n### Marketing the Perfect Rapist\n\nA good engineer however will ensure that his product is easy to replicate, such that the company producing it can grow.\n\nWell if we want the Perfect Rapist to really succeed then we need to justify their existence. We also need to ensure they are cheap to make. Noone is going to demand more Perfect Rapists just on a whim, and sales is all about establishing a need. Marketing it to the public too and making it an ever expanding industry..\n\nQuite a problem!\n\nMaking them cheap is simple enough. The lure of professional status with the lowest entry requirements of any profession should see to that. Hopefully should attract the sociopathic, socially inept, the slobs and the craven.\n\nTo establish a need though we are going to need some help. It’s unlikely that people will order the Perfect Rapist from amazon so let’s fire some binmen and charge Perfect Rapists to the taxpayer.\n\nNow if we open our borders to people from cultures hostile to our way of life… and ignore any rapes or crimes they commit then we can say we need Perfect Rapists to protect the very children we are allowing to be raped!\n\nGenius. Perfect engineering.\n\n## But, what about whistleblowers?\n\nOur engineer has thought of this, he taps his pipe knowingly, smirks and asks, “What whistleblowers?”\n\nWhat of the children being raped? They will complain, obviously..\n\n“Ah”, says the engineer, “You haven’t thought it through. We’ll call them racist for complaining. And they’ll be complaining to the Perfect Rapists. People tend to forget that political correctness is a feminist theory of social change.”\n\nOk, the press and TV stations… Newspapers, the media?\n\n“Staffed mainly by feminists these days old sport. Feminists don’t criticise other feminists, in fact I think you’ll find many of them running stories about how we need more Perfect Rapists to stop the actual rapists. If they mention it at all..”\n\nSocial Workers themselves? What about when they retire, move jobs, what if they speak out?\n\n“Hmmm.. There won’t be many, not even a handful” says the engineer. “When their main job is stealing children and they’ve perjured themselves silly to do so they aren’t going to speak against their former employers. Are they now?”.\n\nBut… People will notice. People will realise that something is wrong!\n\n“You think? If anything…”, he says lighting his pipe, “..they’ll notice young children being raped by beastly men. Which is a great recruiting sergeant for feminism. All blokes being nasty violent rapists etc.”\n\nSurely the police will do something? Child protection officers and the like?\n\nThe engineer shrugs, “Maybe, some. The few males ones. Not many though. You are a bloke and I’m sure you laugh if someone gets hit in the happy sack. Natural reaction, they are a genetic competitor. Course you think all women are princesses who wouldn’t view another woman’s reproductive organs as competitors in the gene pool.. We’ll see.”\n\nThis is monstrous. Despicable. An outrage!\n\n“No,” says the engineer whimsically, “This is the UK”.\n", "timestamp": 1635292405, "digest": "TtUMWUBZRIf6zVMBLiLnEa21HynD2_QOdK7o7LRiid0", "contributor": "0xD5EAbC1973b7d580D37ae256398eEF0977d05FA5"}

So how do you build a strong web3 community?\n\nCrypto investor [Peter Pan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_) has shared great insights on this topic. Below, I share key takeaways on 1) how to build the trust you need to build a strong community, 2) the three roles you need, and 3) the three phases you must go through.\n\n## How to Build Trust\n\n**To build a strong community, you need to build trust. To build trust, you need to get members to believe 4 things:**\n\n1. their contributions will be put to good use.\n2. the intentions behind the community are earnest.\n3. the community is capable of achieving its goals.\n4. the ppl in the community share the same values as they do.\n\n*You have a finite initial window of opportunity to build this trust before individuals start disengaging. **Most communities fail here.***\n\n## Three Roles in a Community\n\nThere are 3 roles in a community:\n\n1. the settlers (community management - day to day operations)\n2. the explorers (community growth - experimentation)\n3. the town planners (community strategy - direction)\n\n## Three Phases of Community Building\n\nThere are 3 phrases of community building:\n\n1. **Member acquisition:** attract potential community participants\n   1. your goal is to attract primarily intrinsically motivated members as opposed to extrinsically motivated members\n   2. this will lead to sustained participation even when the monetary upside is uncertain\n   3. focus on creating awareness around what differentiates the community, as opposed to the monetary incentives\n2. **Member engagement:** get members engaged\n   1. understand member goals so that you can guide them to their own goals to achieve MVP (minimum viable participation)\n   2. utilize community onboarding calls & 1 on 1 outreach calls to the most actively engaged community members you identify\n3. **Member leadership:** build community ownership\n   1. everyone wants active community governance from day 1 - in reality, community members need to become familiar with a community and invest enough of their time and energy to begin growing an ownership mentality\n   2. give opportunities to influence and participate in key community discussions and decisions\n   3. offer levels of progression\n\n## 3 bonus takeaways:\n\n> \"Communities only become real when they achieve their first win.\n>\n> Enthusiasm is not enough to keep a community alive.\n>\n> When no value is created, people disengage.\"\n\n> “You are your community's first contributor - if you do not show up, no one else will.”\n\n> “Community is not always about including everyone but a careful balance between curation and inclusion.”\n\n## Full Pieces Here\n\n[https://www.pet3rpan.net/blog/hard-thing-about-starting-communities](https://www.pet3rpan.net/blog/hard-thing-about-starting-communities)\n\n[https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/how-to-grow-decentralized-communities-1bf1044924f8](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/how-to-grow-decentralized-communities-1bf1044924f8)\n\n[https://www.pet3rpan.net/blog/roles-in-community-building](https://www.pet3rpan.net/blog/roles-in-community-building)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635293226, "digest": "90EzbcALJBERc5raRMZr8M9SJxtiLeR5V18h2tQh_f0", "contributor": "0x1a8A91688a3De0B1a53f73674C47CC6E76CccC41"}

{"id": "wI1tHl-kdYEdc8QxUZLKk6SLJ2f9FLK3w7mo26viXDc", "title": "Ministerial Incompetence – Connect the Dots.", "body": "A brief wibble by government department from a Red Pill perspective.\n\nOnce Bray coughs up the pints he owes me for grievous defeats on [Cricket Championship](https://www.cricket-championship.com/) we’ll be covering this via youtube on [Chaffers and Bray](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu313MeKnc_hkbz7o-yF4fw)\n\nCan you spot the connections?\n\n### The most incompetent of them all? ( Ministry of Demoralisation)\n\nShould be the blokiest but their ability to cock any and all projects up is legendary. You might be tempted to think that having 57,000 cucks ‘taking care of’ about 140,000 service personnel should be a jolly good ratio to ensure their needs are met.\n\nWell if launching endless war crimes witchunts to prosecute serving soldiers who have been cleared by the previous half dozen witchunts is ‘taking care of’ then I think we may be talking more of a mafia definition of the term.\n\nOn accommodation and basic rights they fail utterly. Demoralisation seems to be the aim. I recall joining a regular unit for the first time and being shown to my single room accomodation ( I know it was such as I was charged board for it) which comprised of a 4 man room with curtains separating each bed.\n\nOne bloke was AWOL, the second about to be chucked out for a drugs offence and the third ginger and terrified of everything.\n\nWhilst our forces were desperately short of helicopters in Afghanistan 8 brand new Chinooks were rotting away in a shed somewhere. Examples are legion.\n\n[This blog](https://thinpinstripedline.blogspot.com/) is an excellent example of a cuck book for instance. Mangina positively glistening at the recent documentary featuring four women and barely any blokes on the new aircraft carriers. The Red Arrows are red, and pretty! Far better than nasty weapons and stuff – for which this ex senior cuck has some wonderfully self contradictory excuses..\n\n### Educashun\n\n“It isn’t a game, it’s just a rout” sang a fat bloke with much better tits than most feminists, and he might have been talking about the gender gap in education.\n\nWomen massively outnumber men at university in almost every field, the only exceptions being maths, physics and IT. Which is clearly a problem.\n\nThe solution is STEMM and hiding the preponderance of women on medicinal science courses ( men in psychology are a very rare breed for instance) to make it appear that women are disadvantaged in the tiny number of courses they do not already dominate.\n\nCourse feminists believe in equality of outcome, which makes the gender gap in teaching rather hard to square. Finding a primary school with a single male teacher might be problematic, finding female teachers who don’t mark the same work with a boy’s name on it significantly lower a less well known one.\n\n###  Department for Foreign Fanny Scratching (International Development)\n\nThink of Foreign Aid and you’ll probably have an image in your head of a military transport aircraft doling out bundles of food in some drought stricken place. Under foreign fanny scratching rules however this wouldn’t even come from their budget, though technically it all comes under defence… Which is a right laugh.\n\nThe reality is quite different as most of the entire huge budget is devoted to feminist causes around the world. Interfering in foreign cultures takes the form of funding Eritrean versions of the spice girls and sub Saharan lesbians knitting yellow fin, nomadic condoms out of free range yoghurt raised on the shores of Mt. Fuji.\n\nNo stone is left unturned in the hunt for throwing our cash at feminist causes. India may have a space programme but they need feminist funding too!\n\nAnd the scale is huuuuuuge. For every £9 we spend on the NHS ( more later) we spend £1 on allowing some dizzy tart ( it’s always a dizzy tart) defending our foreign aid budget with some graceless virtue signalling.\n\n### Department of Fun ( Media, Culture and Sport)\n\nI really could not be more sick of seeing BBC bias threads on forums where lefties and righties argue endlessly on which way the BBC leans. It does so towards feminism, and horizontally so at that.\n\nPolitical correctness, pro-immigration, pro-fetus murdering, rabid radical feminist bollocks. They don’t even try to hide it anymore.\n\nThe cringeing, but huge budget, Olympics opening ceremony was their work. As it trying to make out that a few dykes who would be thrashed by Accrington Stanley are equal professionals to whichever men’s game.\n\nWomen’s cricket is pretty good though, very spinny.\n\n### Department for Looking after Foreigners ( Foreign and Commonwealth Office)\n\n“The ministry of Agriculture looks after cows and the Foreign Office looks after foreigners.” said Margaret Thatcher. Which is nice.\n\nIt is remarkably difficult to discern what else they do as that would mean looking for Foreign policy successes. Which over the last 100 years have been rather thin on the ground. If not altogether absent.\n\nA bit like looking for French military victories.\n\nDespite palaces and oodles of cash, not to mention inumerable honours doled out, can anyone actually convey what the FO’s foreign policy actually is? I’ll give you a clue, preventing sexual violence in conflict is a key concern of theirs…. Though as Boko Haram was roundly ignored whilst they burned thousands young blokes alive the moment they kidnapped some girls….. The world took notice.\n\nKidnapped that is, not….dead.\n\nUntil just before the referendum our brave and oh so superior Knights were confidently telling every foreign diplomat that we would vote to remain in the EU by a large margin. Hence the department entrusted to predict and analyse trends in foreign fields displayed quite conclusively that they didn’t have a clue about their own country. 🙂\n\nDon’t be confused by the Commonwealth in the title of this ministry.. They couldne give a shite about anything outside the EU.\n\n###  Ministry of (partial) Justice\n\nTo be fair to them they did notice that three out of four men in prison wouldn’t be there had they opted for a swift sex change. And that those men in prison spent on average 6.5 times longer in the clink than females who had committed the same crimes.\n\nEquality under the law my arse.\n\nThey published it in a report and everything.. Though no-one in the media covered it.\n\nMeanwhile the fuckwit radical feminists in the Crown Prosecution Service prosecute blokes merely accused of sexual crimes with a disregard for exculpatory evidence that would shame a kangaroo court. Evidence of almost equal victimhood for blokes in domestic violence is folded in with that against women to make the numbers appear more shocking.\n\nAlso the secret family courts have been turned into shooting galleries where social workers have great fun perjuring themselves to rape blokes of their families and reputations.\n\nPossibly the sickest of the sadistic in the list.\n\nAnd about to get even sicker! David Gauk has announced to much fanfare that women will be spared prison sentences unless absolutely necessary… As though they aren’t already…\n\nIn the name of equality?\n\n### Ministry of housing and.. stuff.\n\nWe need more houses right? For social justice say the left, to house immigrants say the right.\n\nWell in fact the housing stock has gone up by several million in a relatively short period of time. The biggest single pressure?\n\nThat would be no fault divorce and the breakdown of marriage. With canny blokes selecting the MGTOW gear and women taking their natural right to nick half of a married bloke’s stuff whilst destroying his life it means you need more houses to accommodate singles and separated rather than familes.\n\nOn social housing though, where do you think a single bloke in dire need would find himself on the housing ladder? On the streets is the answer, hence why 93% of the homeless are men.\n\nSo if you’re a young dude reading this and wondering whether you’ll ever own your own house the answer is probably only if you don’t marry. If you do you’ll lose it more than 50% of the time.\n\nFeminism has consequences huh? Whooda thunked it.\n\n###  The Treasonr.. Erm I mean Treasury\n\nFewer than 2000 cucks need £3Bn per annum to come up with economic justifications for mass immigration and manpower in the middle of the second industrial revolution where robotics is the way forward!\n\nThere must be gold in them thar paper clip stacks!\n\nCourse giving women indirect tax breaks and producing reports so hilariously wrong on future economic trends that they make North Korea’s propaganda look professional takes… creative talent.\n\nSo too does trying to block brexit by every means possible.\n\nWe should pity them as being an anachronism. The City of London trader chappies pay top dollar for real time economists, the treasonry works on data months old and still can’t get a shot within the corner flags, never mind the goal.\n\n### Department for work and pensions\n\nSo women live for longer… and get their pensions sooner. Currently 5 years sooner. Hence the blokes who pay 75% of the tax burden, often whilst working in jobs which are physically demanding, are likely to receive a state pension worth about half as much overall. Equality huh?\n\nFeminists of course campaign endlessly to get more women into top positions such as MPs or on the board of directors of companies. Which by the way tends to reduce their profits and effectiveness.\n\nWould more women in Parliament be a good thing? Well it depends upon the women as Parliament is massively overstocked with feminists of both sexes, but with very few normal healthy females.\n\nAll feminist shortlists, as practised by both parties have seen to this. Which raises the question as to whether normal healthy women are represented by feminists. I doubt it.\n\n###  The Department for Transport\n\nIncluded for completeness. Though… sorry dudes. I got nothing.\n\n### The Cabinet Office\n\nA bit like Top Gun for cucks. If you’ve abandoned all hope of ever finding anything lumpy in your trousers and are truly committed to a Marxist way of life you might have the opportunity to pit your witless self against the Ministry supposedly responsible under our constitution. As in one headed by an elected representative. Someone who is responsible to us.\n\nRules of engagement be damned, or the civil service code for that matter… Evry fule kno that elected people can’t be trusted to compile policy. Only our deep state, who actually seem to work for the EU commission, should be trusted with such things.\n\nWhether you be a National Security Advisor ( an economist) bravely and rightly avoiding any awkward questions from MPs or in charge of presenting a Brexit plan that the minister for Exiting the EU hasn’t seen once in 2 years your job is to be the best at subverting parliamentary accountability and standards in the land…\n\n###  Department against fishermen, farmers or anything else male and 3D job sounding.\n\nUsed to be called Maff, which was a bit too close to Muff, and almost gave the game away. Farmers being ruined and committing suicide? Fishermen with no quota to fish because no-one gives a shit about male 3D jobs? Don’t expect any help. Quite the opposite.\n\nAccording to their figures I ate half of my yearly quota of fish at Wetherspoons last week, seeing as they think the entire industry is worth £1 billion a year, or about £15 quid per person.\n\nAnd our farmers couldn’t survive without EU handouts… Nor did they in the thousand years before we joined the EU. All those green fields and well kept countryside are their work, not those of the farmers over countless generations. And those bird chomping windmills are not crucifixes to stupidity, they are modernity and progress.\n\nCourse if you need half a county to be flooded or draconian dystopian bastardry to be implemented which hobbles dairy farmers, beef farmers or any other male profession they they is good.\n\nHell we used to have fresh local milk delivered in recycled glass bottles by electric vehicles.. But they saw to that. Milk men you see. All that getting up early in the cold wasn’t attractive to our precious darling feminists who want comfortable warm jobs. Like in supermarkets.\n\n###  The Home Orifice\n\nThe daddy department of them all. Or rather sisterhood department.\n\nMust always be a feminist in charge as they have jurisdiction over mass immigration. And a feminist’s favourite policy must not be questioned.\n\nAnd we wouldn’t want trifles such as the mass pedophilic rape of 4500 schoolgirls in Rotherham, Telford etc getting out would we? And to be fair they were largely successful in this, kept it quiet for at least a decade or more.\n\nA report recently showed that every Home Secretary since the intrinsically feminist Blair Government was well aware of the ‘Asian Grooming Gangs’ though no Japanese people were involved. They certainly kept a lid on it.\n\n###  Department of Health and Social Care\n\nA stand up once quipped that men die 10 years earlier because they are married, and therefore want to. Though this bunch have a finger in the pie.\n\n51% of the population are born male, though only 48% make it. And as 14 of the top 15 preventable diseases disproportionately affect males in the UK you might be surprised to hear that Breast Cancer is the exception, the 15th.\n\nAnswers on a postcard for which receives the most funding, research and media attention!\n\nPlease also mention on said postcard when you last heard male suicide mentioned, the single biggest killer of people under 40.\n\nBut these people care… socially. Which basically means training and equipping an army of social workers. And then lobbying for ever increasing funding for them so they can child snatch, break up families and alienate fathers such that the epidemic of fatherless children is running at close to 40%. Ably abetted by social work degrees which encompass a wide range of influences.. feminism, radical feminism and… A bit more feminism.\n\nIf that is they were their children to begin with. DNA tests are cheap and easy but that more than 10% of children are actually raised under false paternity is a closely guarded secret.\n\nYou read that right. the last study by the CSA ( a bit like Jeremy Kyle only with threats of financial extortion) found about 25% of false paternity. As in a quarter of blokes who thought they were Dads… weren’t.\n\nBut surely it’s your right to know whether the children you raise are genetically yours?!\n\nHow naive, DNA actually means Do Not Ask what your missus was up to whilst getting pregnant. If you are on the birth certificate then you are the father, not that having an accurate family genetic history of health problems isn’t crucially important in modern diagnoses. It is.\n\nBut you have no reproductive rights in the first place.. Zero. Hence at least they are consistent.\n\nI would like to see how much of the NHS’s budget is spent on males versus females… Though suspect the answer is pretty obvious.\n\nIf estrogen levels had dropped 30% since the late 80s in women in the West across the board, and 65% in some major cities, do you think it would be an issue? A medical issue and public health concern? Well testosterone levels in Western males decrease by an extra 1% per year and nobody even  seems to have noticed.\n\n### So…. Can you connect the dots?\n\nCan you see a pattern in the incompetence?  The direction of travel, the division of resources? The muppetry and the blindness?\n\nIt’s worth remembering that those two eminent muppets, Statler and Waldorf, whilst endless critics were actually part of the show.\n\nAnd what, Champ, is your part in the show?\n\nIt might be worth considering where the incompetence and blindness manifested itself from in the first place….\n\nCould it be that clapping and cheering like a trained seal whilst deciding where to put your X in a box whilst someone virtue signalled about caring for women was actually dehumanising?\n\nSee it’s inbuilt. Part of our makeup and you don’t get extra brownie points for it. Though accepting someone as virtuous because they claimed to care about women more than you do diminishes your own moral authority.\n\nMaybe time to take stock and consider where the gender gaps actually lie, rather than where they tell you they do?\n", "timestamp": 1635292606, "digest": "dS9N88-9Scbp-tElzdu7fe3zLh6juQ4XTwXnHxwdqnk", "contributor": "0xD5EAbC1973b7d580D37ae256398eEF0977d05FA5"}

This desperation has led to the [compromise](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=compromise) of his beliefs and values, the [desecration ](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=desecration)of his dignity and self-worth, and his inability to stand up for himself and what he deserves as a human being, eg. loyalty, [fidelity](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fidelity), and honesty in a romantic relationship.\n\nAn easier offhand definition might simply be a male feminist. Whether explicitly or merely in a blue pill and too stupid to realise what they are sort of a way. And we all know at least one of them. Usually the object of great ridicule and mickey taking down the pub but have you ever considered the political significance of the cuck?\n\nThink back to the last time you bothered to watch anything but sport on the TV. Did you notice anything about the male characters whether real life or fictional?\n\nIf TV stereotypes are to be believed then you will either be a cuck of some varying degree, or a hapless idiot. Choose to raise a family for instance and the best thing that you can hope for, according to the media, is a Homer Simpson like existence, unless you go full cuck of course.\n\nDare to be religious and you’ll even get cucks in cassocks showing you the true light of righteousness. Two thousand year old doctrine be damned.\n\n### The political cuck\n\nWhilst #browgate was and is hilarious one can only assume that Canuck stands for Canadian cuck, judging by their choice of leader.\n\nWhilst we await the inevitable South Park episode it’s worth wondering how anyone ever took Justine seriously. How did a population that is presumably about 50% male vote for someone who clearly revels in taking an anti-male stance on any and every issue? And is a colossal asshat to boot?\n\nThe answer is simply that he was previously lost in the noise, it would be a challenge to name a single politician under the age of 50 who the word cuck does not apply to. They are however the amateurs, the copy cats of the cuck world.\n\n### The Great Cuck Repository\n\nTo find the true eunuchs and leaders of the pack, in an oxymoronic way, one must take to watch Parliamentary TV when a senior civil servant is questioned by a select committee. You can smell the grilled cuck a mile off, despite their shy and secretive nature. For the full virtue signalling, inability to answer a question, complete lack of balls and lickspittle smarminess just look for Knighthoods or other honours.\n\nWhilst once given for acts of manliness it seems that Knighthoods are now either given for paperclip organisation skills or extreme cuckliness beyond the beck and call of feminist duty. Indeed the entire civil service operates as a hugely efficient cuckocracy where the most extreme rise to the top.\n\nAnd there is a reason for this…\n\n### Cultural Marxism or the Frankfurt school\n\nMost philosophers spend their time thinking of ways to make the world a better place. To make you richer, freer, more successful or your country more powerful. And in a free market place of ideas those philosophers who demonstrably have a track record of such clearly have an advantage.\n\nThere are exceptions, but they’re generally a bit French.\n\nThe Frankfurt school is different as it takes it’s inspiration from butthurt. Namely the Marxists who successfully created the conditions for the German proletariat to rise up and seize control after the First world War only for the lazy feckless bastards to… not bother.\n\nTo compound this butthurt they then went on to choose an Austrian national socialist with a dodgy tache, which didn’t work out too well.\n\nFrankfurt school philosophy therefore resolved that the only aim was to prevent anyone with a dodgy tache taking power. It was and is designed exclusively as an anti-Nazi ideology.\n\nHence seeing as the old proletariat wasn’t up to the job they had to find a new one. Another group who could more easily be manipulated and who could control the means of production and all that Marxist whatnot. And they did.\n\n### Out with the old proletariat, in with the new.\n\nWhilst your average prole is more interested in getting his end away and the quality and price of beer than politics there is a group of malcontents who are interested in neither.\n\nThe paperclip shufflers in every government, admin and HR department. Whilst the local massage parlours may lay mattresses on the pool tables and double time their staff should a new office open, the heady mix of ready cash and low self esteem that characterises the Civil Service is very profitable. Their chances of being distracted otherwise by non paperclip related issues are slim.\n\nAnd they indirectly control and regulate everything.\n\nHence rather than having to convince anyone that your ideology is sound or useful you can merely pass it chunk by chunk in pointless EU rules and regulations. Those implementing and enforcing the regulations become Marxists over time purely by dint of their exposure. Those who are particularly susceptible, those who understand it, rise to the top. The cucks.\n\nThis is why the Frankfurt school philosophy sits at the heart of the EU. Whilst the civil servants think they work for the Crown they spend the vast majority of their time implementing or enforcing EU rules and regulations. How then are they not a mere extension of the EU Commission?\n\nThey love to blame new EU rules for their cockups and bungling but have you ever considered how much time they actually spend figuring out ways to do something despite these rules and regulations?\n\nTake Olly Robbins, the shadowy bureaucrat at the heart of the Brexit fiasco. A committed Marxist even before joining the Civil Service he rose to the top remarkably quickly.\n\nOne might even be predisposed to think that his mindset and ideology helped him on his path to promotion.\n\n### But it’s the politician’s fault!\n\nHow so? True enough that many act like mere Gauleiters however these tend to be Ministers who are constrained by the advice given by the Senior Civil Servants. The more experienced the minister the more cuckly they become.\n\nThose rules and regulations pass through parliament faster than a dodgy vindaloo and with less scrutiny.\n\nIt’s true that the politicians are technically responsible though even that appears to no longer be the case. Take David Davis who resigned recently, the first time he saw the Brexit White Paper was on the morning of the Chequers meeting, along with all the other Ministers.\n\nAnd he was supposedly the democratically appointed Minister responsible. Difficult to be responsible for something that you haven’t even seen.\n\nThe MP’s had to wait a further week.\n\nHence clearly policy is formed by a cuckly cabal who’ve demonstrated their proclivity to Marxist thought by being promoted to the top.\n\nFrankly this is a constitutional crisis right at the heart of Government, but one conducted mainly in the shadows.\n", "timestamp": 1635292510, "digest": "CvrjW_WxvQT1_rW1qPlaHYXQ0VRlp-DEjLY-4KYOdQ8", "contributor": "0xD5EAbC1973b7d580D37ae256398eEF0977d05FA5"}
{"id": "8AFE3dCqbB6CJraqZUcbqbjX-vyqzd5LPHm1gQfD3EU", "title": "Relationship Insurance", "body": "The purpose of insurance, according to [the Two Ronnies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBRiWcqMX6M), is for the client to pay the insurer large sums of money. It can however be useful to mitigate future risk.\n\nSome forms of insurance are mandatory, others are merely a personal choice.\n\nSo, if you were seeking to mitigate risk in your romantic relationships what would the factors likely be?\n\n## Risk Factors\n\nJust as with car insurance the make and model would be a factor. How expensive is it to run? Has it been in previous accidents, has indeed it been regularly serviced? Is it comfortable, or are you always on edge in case it does something unpredictable? What is the potential expense both in emotional and monetary terms if a crash occurs?\n\nClearly your own history plays a part here too. Just as your driving history offers clues as to your future potential for causing or suffering damage, so too does your prior relationship history. A poor driving history littered with bumps and scrapes indicates that maybe you weren’t able enough in handling your vehicle.\n\nFundamentally the actuaries would look at your risk factors, compare you to a cohort with similar characteristics, and work out a potential for future damage based upon their histories.\n\nIn other words how much have bad relationships caused people like you? It isn’t difficult to find instances where the sums are astronomical.\n\nSince the mid 60s the risks and costs have increased dramatically. The Boomers have a lot to answer for.\n\n## What is the potential for damage or loss?\n\nDepends greatly on your current status. A millionaire will likely to be aware of the risk posed by gold diggers, though some young dude living in their mother’s basement might never consider the impact a crash could have on his life and finances, and in particular his future earning potential.\n\nThe risks however are actually far greater for your common a garden dude compared to a millionaire. Losing half of your fortune still leaves you with…. A fortune.\n\nThe crimp in your finances in 10 or 20 years time due to maintenance, child support and the like is going to be a large percentage of your income. The prospect of losing a home that you don’t even currently own is likely the biggest individual cost, but also consider the damage to your reputation, your freedom and your self esteem from being rinsed in the family and divorce courts.\n\nIndeed the damage to your reputation could be a greater future cost even than the monetary aspects.\n\nMarrying a feminist for instance has reduced one of the biggest male stars in Hollywood, and even a Prince, to objects of ridicule. Having the status of Johnny Depp, or eligible Royalty with a proud military record one day, an unemployable actor, ginger cuck and laughing stock the next.\n\n## How to identify risk?\n\nOne way is by learning from the great scientists and philosophers who have gone before you. Pre-eminient amongst them…\n\nBeing Dana McLendon – featured below – though note that he has a Glock on his hip should a ginger hairdresser called Tiffany turn up.\n\nHe is a wise man, he has taken precautions. He quantifies risk, and so should you.\n\nNobody truly knows what house or rental prices will be in thefuture. Nor what our future earnings will be. We don’t know how many children we might have, nor where on the Hot Crazy matrix the lass doing a convincing impression of being a Unicorn will be in many years time.\n\nThe risks then are both front loaded and uncertain. But do they fall equally?\n\n[https://youtu.be/6_H85PH2gtw](https://youtu.be/6_H85PH2gtw)\n\n## Is this risk a two way street?\n\nIt is said that behind every great man there is a great woman, something that I personally hold to still be true. There are however a handful of obvious cases where the opposite has happened. The recently deceased Prince Philip for instance dedicated his life to walking behind her Maj, supporting her, his children didn’t even bear his name. Dennis Thatcher too played a supporting role.\n\nThe response from the feminists to these people? Unbridled hate.\n\nThe risk then is not a two way street. Even in the extreme circumstances of extremely successful and stable couples who have no lack of resources the man’s reputation is still the target on a one way shooting range.\n\n## Quantifying Risk\n\nJust imagine ringing a Relationship Insurance call centre with what you know, or think you know about your current girlfriend…\n\n“Yeah mate, she’s got blue hair, a Gender Studies degree, works for a domestic violence charity and has 4 kids from her previous 4 relationships, though none of the fathers are still in touch with her. They were all bastards apparently. She lives with her mother, says she is 36 and wishes she lived in Birmingham so she could vote for Jess Phillips. “\n\nWhat do you think your quote would be?\n\nIf you are outraged at the amount your car insurance costs as a young dude, imagine how much they might charge you for managing the risk of your relationships?\n\nMy guess, it would be an order of magnitude higher, so the wisest financial decision you can ever make might be in understanding the risks involved.", "timestamp": 1635293740, "digest": "JUMqpkdG-K9wZ41EY21-nYz4vBkPVG-kkT0-mfQRRlQ", "contributor": "0xD5EAbC1973b7d580D37ae256398eEF0977d05FA5"}

They might not be able to do a multi variant analyses of the underlying causes, and therefore often blame the wrong things, though their intuition expressed as feeling is rarely wrong.\n\nSo what do we make of the constant refrain that seems to echo through time?\n\n> For whosoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever has not, from him shall be taken away even what he has. \\\n>\n>\n> Matthew 13:12\n\n### The scapegoats\n\nAnd there are many.\n\nYou will find blue haired mastodons screaming abuse at everything from bankers to politicians. Multi national corporations to agri-tech.\n\nAnd chinless public school cucks blaming the feckless lower, than them, classes to immigrants. Schools to the overly generous, shallow laughs permitted, social security.\n\nAn oversimplification of a massive topic might be that the left blames a rigged system, and the right the inherent inability of those they distain from being able to steal as much money as themselves.\n\n### Define Poor\n\nWell let me first state that I don’t see this being entirely about money. Intuition does not follow the same spreadsheet formulas in use by those distanced from it.\n\nSo let’s define poorer more broadly, as fewer opportunities for personal advancement or choice; a greater struggle for meaning or fulfillment; a state of desperation.\n\nClearly this definition spreads the net far wider than mere economics.\n\n### Define Rich\n\n“Money may not make you happy, but at least you can choose the colour of your misery.” Quipped some millionaire or other. Money is an enabler, it allows good men to do good things and bad men to do bad things. It is entirely neutral spiritually.\n\nIndeed I suspect we all consider some people to have rich lives irrespective of their socioeconomic status. Similarly some extremely wealthy people appear to wallow in misery despite their resources.\n\nIf we take a leaf from those dissafected English terrorists who the Gumps wrongly think of as Americans ( they only became American several years after the Declaration of Independence, after the treaty of Paris specifically) then their constitution gives a decent precis for richness.\n\n> We hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable; that all men are created equal & independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent & inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, & liberty, & the pursuit of happiness; …\n\n### What does the persuit of happiness look like?\n\nWell we could tax our grey matter in general terms on this, but it is an individualistic thing. Or we could tax our purple matter and ask our knobs.. Which is both more amusing and more revealing.\n\nGranted the answer may come back as two Swedish bisexual supermodels on a weekend in Las Vegas. Which only begs the question of what would the persuit of happiness would look like from penis height after a few gullible individuals have believed your lies about such.\n\nAnd I think the answer is rather old fashioned in many ways. Once said Swedish supermodels have been ticked off the universal bucket list the ambition for most remains a family and monogamous lifelong relationship; the resources to raise your children and eventually retire in reasonable comfort to reminisce about Swedish supermodels.\n\n### So why do we all think the rich are getting richer, and the poor poorer?\n\nHypergamy basically.\n\nDefined as:\n\n> the action of marrying a person of a superior caste or class.\n\nWomen are hypergamous. Always have been.\n\nAn interesting exercise is to have a look through women’s dating profiles for those childless somewhat long in the tooth and short of body clock. No matter how hideous, poorly educated or fat they all appear to think they deserve a prince!\n\nMen rate women’s attractiveness on such as a perfect bell curve, the average being a 5/10. Women on the other hand rate men such that they consider 93% to be below averagely attractive. With no 10/10s at all.\n\nIt was once said that Tory MPs had sex scandals and Labour MPs had financial scandals.. As they were hoping to steal enough cash to have a sex scandal. So this isn’t restricted to social spheres.\n\nNor the physicality of location, due to internet dating mostly.\n\n### Hypergamy\n\nAffects every aspect of a chap’s persuit of happiness.\n\nWhether your knob, your wallet or the wider macro economics the strange and malign confluence of fascistic feminism with the pre existing hypergamic culture has reduced many chap’s pussy persuits to practically zero.\n\nAs feminist teachers undermark boy’s coursework at school we see fewer boys growing up to be graduate men. Which has already resulted in almost 2/3rds of recent graduates being female. Putting half those females out of hypergamic reach.\n\nAs feminists lobby for higher paid and easier jobs for women it leaves men with the lower paid 3D ( Difficult, Dangerous or Dirty) jobs, and puts those better paid women out of hypergamic reach of them.\n\nAs feminists lobby for ever more ridiculous prosecutions against men, and longer sentences too, it leaves more men with criminal records to be scorned by hypergamic women. The prison gender gap is already 20.6 men to every woman and growing.\n\nMeanwhile those tall, educated and rich enough to pick and choose gain a second high earner so the disposable income generated is considerable. At least until she files for no fault divorce, steals his house, assets and children and ruins his life for no good reason.\n\nBut even here hypergamy works overtime. The now poor bloke has to wine dine and chase, which as George Harrison put it, “Take’s a whole lot of spending money”, where the divorced woman is wined, dined and chased.\n\nCourse it also results in the mad old cat ladies who now seem to be giving up any idea of procreating, despite being in their early 40s.\n\n### The ratio\n\nIn wiser days women were paid less than men for the same work. Hence allowing even their mere peers to have a sniff.\n\nWith women’s net hourly wages increasingly overtaking men’s (certainly true for the under 30s) let’s have a look at the ratio of women available to three hypothetical blokes.\n\n**Bloke A** is a tall grad with his own house. He basically has the pick of the field, though may well simply pick the best set of tits unintentionally leaving another cat lady in his wake. And depriving the other tiers of a potential mate in the process.\n\n**Ratio 1:1**. Combined disposable income \\~£30,000 p/a\n\n**Bloke B** dropped out of Uni and works in a call centre. The 50% of women who graduated are beyond him, as are the feckless feminists promoted ahead of him for their ‘superior communication skills’ – otherwise known as nagging and getting someone else to do their work for them.\n\nSo he might be reasonable in thinking that 1/3 of the availble pussy is possible. But he competes with the myriad other blokes in a similar position, and those from the A tier. This third of women probably has to choose between realistically 2/3s of them men. Let’s be generous here…\n\n**Ratio 6:1** Combined disposable income \\~£5,000 p/a\n\n**Bloke C** is short, ginger and works in a 3D job at not much above minimum wage. All of the University grads, all of the better paid safe and comfy job females are out of sight. He’s left with the thick, lazy or unsuccessful. And competes with the tiers above him for even their affections.\n\n**Ratio: 20:1**. Combined disposable income \\~ £bugger all.\n\n### The Punchline\n\nSadly this isn’t comedy.. Standing in line to be punched in the dick is probably a good analogy for our young dudes on their way to finding out that the poor do indeed get poorer. And I cite this objectively for the underclass. The extreme end is called the Incel movement… Involunarily celibates. They deserve our compassion and action, but receive nothing but mockery.\n\nTake the sad wretches described in Orwell’s Road to Wigan Pier (1937). Their economic prospects were undeniably poor, their lives tough and their plight only covered by a chinless socialist snob on a jolly. Who incidentally only studied them, like ants, to determine why they were too stupid to revolt.\n\nThe nation they built though was capable of great things, as we discovered against an Austrian dude of historical significance just a few years after the tome hit the posh bookstores. Their labour and the coal they dug powered the nation during the war and they reaped the benefits of the technology developed during it to lead happy retirements, surrounded by their grand children.\n\nWhilst routinely displaying feats of strength and endurance probably beyond our athletes these days their pussy prospects were no worse than any other generation before.\n\nThese same, usually socially conservative, voices were the ones betrayed by no fault divorce and other feminist nonsense.. Robbing future generations of the only thing that adequately aleviates a life of poverty.\n\nConsider too the poor drudges who emigrated here, or their grown up children. Have a look at the wallflowers next time you are out in a nightclub and you’ll notice a clear trend. Whilst Londoners salivate over the notion of signalling their virtue by dint of having a black lass clean their bog they don’t marry them…\n\nIn group preference in sexual partner is neither controversial nor arguable, the statistics are stark.\n\nSo next time you hear of a Muslim terrorist attrocity consider why a young dude with few prospects other than his cousin might blow up a concert for young girls, or indeed why so many school shootings in the USA are attributed to Incels.\n\nMaybe the two are more… intimately.. linked than you realise?\n", "timestamp": 1635292985, "digest": "GAV1XAPhSaF0IaoMrWA2t4jRbHrQEz2kXEIb1K6O5g0", "contributor": "0xD5EAbC1973b7d580D37ae256398eEF0977d05FA5"}

Which I would argue is a damnedly British sort of a thing to do.\n\nAlmost as British as beating the frogs.\n\n### Fast forward to the modern day…\n\nAnd it is questionable whether Equality under the Law still exists in any realistic way.\n\nAs a bloke you are 3 times more likely to be convicted of a crime.\n\nYou are 6 times more likely to be sent to prison.\n\nThere are in fact 18 times as many men as women in prison. Mainly because men will on average receive 6.5 times more prison time than a woman for the same crime.\n\nThe deliberately misnamed 2010 Equalities act enshrined discrimination into law.\n\n### It’s a conspiracy theory!\n\nAnd one promoted by the Ministry of Justice then.. Whose own report laid bare these facts, and all normalised for statistical gubbins and goodliness such as comparing the same offences and mitigating factors across the sexes.\n\nBut the current Minister, a cuckly crusader by the name of Gauk, has actually made it MoJ policy to only send women to prison in extreme circumstances.\n\nWhat do you think would happen to you as a bloke should you attempt to ram your wife off the road three times, to chase her around 20mph speed limits at anything up to 90mph with three young children in the back of your car?\n\nWhat if you actually wrote your own car off in the process? What if your last attempt was at the entrance to a motorway roundabout trying to force your missus into oncoming traffic?\n\nIf your answer to the above was a hundred quid fine and, “Driving without due care and attention” then maybe you need to pay more attention to matters of justice.\n\nThis was very much a thing even before Gauk’s appalling policy change.\n\n###  Such as the much maligned Tommy Robinson\n\nDon’t forget chaps, his rights are your rights. And he has balls.\n\nSomeday it could be your daughter that he is fighting to protect. Or your Freedom of Speech that is threatened.\n\nHaving actually had the grace to watch the dude’s livestream before making my mind up I found it rather disconcerting that those convinced of his guilt clearly had not. And would not. After all, the Gruniad couldn’t possibly lie to them!\n\nWhilst the appeal judge effectively said that he wasn’t arrested, tried, sentenced or imprisoned with due regard to process or justice I’m not expecting an apology from the feminised lawyers, BBC paed.. erm I mean presenters.. and cucks who decided to take me to task on Twitter for my heretical ideas.\n\nThose little boys and shemales only knew that they could please their masters by turning up to the field of battle.\n\nA bit like the French.\n\n### Don’t be like the French\n\nCourage is contagious, said a man who has spent six years locked in the Venezuelan embassy.\n\nHe hasn’t seen his kids, which is something I can relate to, or the sun, or even suitably equipped doctors in many a year. Even the lentil eaters at the UN have decreed that his treatment is unjustifiable.\n\nAnd all because he exercised free speech and journalism to the embarrassment of our government. Who continue to persecute him.\n\nNow some of those Percys and other Norman lords might have ended up becoming a bit too french had they missed the boat to Hastings. They might have enjoyed the vassalage and over rated wine. And their sons might have ended up facing some uncouth peasants armed with nothing but longbows several generations later.\n\nThey chose the right path and became truly noble in nature, rather than merely name.\n\nAnd so should you.\n", "timestamp": 1635292569, "digest": "Qw5_InyWAHogBTODAnSQDK70tnNFqi5aRi7RvB_85Tk", "contributor": "0xD5EAbC1973b7d580D37ae256398eEF0977d05FA5"}

{"id": "G5Rur07PmkIBMQWDCRIiHmXkTcqwHpPNBj9cINLclUQ", "title": "Breaking Down Smart Contracts", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bAH4O1vpJjZLh4r-HYDG6.png?height=1454&width=2218)\n\n*The following is an attempt at consolidating my understanding of smart contracts, and expressing it in a way that is beneficial not only for those familiar with the space, but also someone with little to no background in blockchain.*\n\n## What is a contract?\n\nA set of promises. Typically between two entities.\n\nUsually it entails some sort of exchange of interaction, like if party 1 does X, then party 2 does Y.\n\n## What is a smart contract?\n\nA smart contract, as defined by Nick Szabo in 1996 \\[1\\] is\n\n> \"a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises.\"\n\n\"a set of promises\" covers the **contract** portion.\n\n\"specified in digital form\" is somewhat contract/smart contract agnostic.\n\n\"including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises\" entails what makes it **smart**. I see this phrase to mean that the contract itself is self-executing, i.e. it automates and/or ensures the execution of the promises. \\[2\\]\n\n### The classic vending machine example\n\nA great example of a smart contract—also from Nick Szabo in 1996—is a vending machine.\n\nHow a vending machine is a contract: if a person (party 1) puts money in (does X), the vending machine (party 2) will give potato chips (does Y).\n\nThe contract of the vending machine is not specified digitally, but more implicitly by a person’s understanding of the concept of the vending machine.\n\nThe mechanical system behind the vending machine automates the execution of the promises.\n\nYou may take note a difference here between a typical legal contract and the vending machine contract—instead of an agreement of terms upfront before the execution of promises, the vending machine presents a system of self-executing promises that will activate upon fulfillment of a condition, the condition being the input of money. This model of thinking will be helpful when extrapolating to blockchain.\n\n### Mental models for contracts\n\n*Normal idea of contract in our heads*: two people sign document, then go to work and don't break the contract (keep their promises).\n\n*New model for smart contract*: system of self-executing promises is exposed to public use; anyone can trigger the execution by providing proper inputs.\n\n## What is a smart contract in the context of blockchain?\n\nAt a high level, smart contracts on a blockchain are not much more than our established definition. In the case of a blockchain, the system that automates/ensures the execution of promises is code, and the promises are expressed/specified by the same code.\n\nSimilar to a vending machine, when you fulfill given conditions, i.e. provide money, you can then trigger the execution of said promises, i.e. blocks of code.\n\nWe can extrapolate this metaphor even further.\n\nWhen you insert money into a vending machine, you’re paying not only for the asset you might obtain as a result of execution, but for the service of execution as well. In other words, you pay for the chips themselves, as well as the machine itself for its convenience and its labor of swirling the little metal spiral to pop out your bag of chips. This is the same for smart contracts. You pay what's called a gas fee not only for 1) a possible asset you might obtain, but also to 2) trigger the execution of a smart contract, with the fee being roughly proportional to the computational resources expended to execute its code.\n\nWhen you put your money into a vending machine, you choose which item you want it to spit out. If you abstract away the bag of chips or candy bar, you're really choosing which function to run, that being the F2 function with your Fritos, or the E6 function with your Snickers. Like a vending machine, a smart contract specifies different functions, aka blocks of code, it can run, and when you use a smart contract, you specify which function you want it to run. \\[3\\]\n\n## How is that possible on a blockchain?\n\nWell, it's only possible on a blockchain that supports this capability.\n\nTake away any relation to money. Let's first just think about how there can be code execution on a blockchain.\n\nFirst, blockchain, if you don't have previous context, is just a software system that allows a network of computers to agree on arbitrary data without any central authority. You may hear this as a network being capable of \"decentralized consensus.\" \\[4\\]\n\nYou can think about a blockchain network as a bunch of computers updating each other on some data, and all the computers cooperate together through clever protocols to ensure that they all have the same data and updates all in the same order. You can think of these updates as pushing new data or editing data.\n\nWe can think of this data as the \"state\" of the network. In computer science, a state machine is just a system with some sort of state, that takes inputs and transitions to a new state in a consistent manner. It’s reasonable to think of a blockchain network as one big state machine, where the data is the state, and the updates are transitions to the states.\n\nNow imagine that one of these updates was pushing some new data, but that data was a block of code. Now everyone in the network has access to this code.\n\nImagine another update was pushing some new data, but this time the data was the output of that code. In this update, it would just include the instruction to get the output of the code, not the actual output itself. Given that everyone has the code, to make this update, they would be able to just run this code. Now you have code execution on the blockchain.\n\nImagine the code was unlimited in the kinds of things it could do. It could make updates, so it could push new data, edit data, push new code, and trigger the execution of other code. Imagine you could call this code from other software. Now you have a development ecosystem that can leverage code execution on this network of computers.\n\n## So is this how it works on real blockchains?\n\nWhat we've established so far is not far off from how smart contracts work on Ethereum.\n\nIf we combine this concept of code execution on a network of computers plus our idea of vending machines as smart contracts, we get Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nOn Ethereum, a smart contract specifies a set of functions, i.e. arbitrary blocks of code, that a user can trigger buy providing some money—to pay for the gas fee as well as any output—and specifying which function to run. Just like a vending machine.\n\nHow does code receive money? When a contract is deployed, an account is created that is connected to that contract, so smart contracts hold accounts that users can send ether to.\n\nBefore any code execution can happen, someone needs to write a contract, and put it on the blockchain, i.e. push data to the network of computers.\n\nThen when the code runs, it changes the state on the blockchain, aka updating data, adding new data, moving money from one account to another, allocating assets to accounts, etc. And instead of the state being totally arbitrary data, at its core it's a bunch of accounts with balances of ether, with the addition of totally arbitrary data.\n\nThis all happens through transactions. Transactions are not only their literal meaning of exchanging assets/services, but also they're arbitrary changes to the state. Sending money from my account to another account is a transaction. Inputting money into a smart contract is a transaction.\n\nThrough this system of state, transactions, and code execution, you can see that this whole blockchain ecosystem really amounts to a bunch of glorified vending machines, that is, glorified vending machines that are powering the future of the web.\n\n…\n\n## Notes\n\n\\[1\\] [Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Markets, Nick Szabo, 1996.](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html)\n\n\\[2\\] Typically a contract would be legally binding, giving parties involved great confidence that the other would fulfill their promises, as otherwise the law would enforce the execution of some consequence. In a smart contract, a system is provided that automates this fulfillment of promises. It gives you 100% confidence the promises will be fulfilled.\n\n\\[3\\] Another similarity between vending machines and smart contracts: you don’t have to inspect the insides of a vending machine to use it or to trust that it’ll actually give you potato chips and not just eat up your one dollar bill. A smart contract is the same way. In most cases the end user should not have to know exactly what’s going on inside a smart contract to use it.\n\n\\[4\\] The actual word \"blockchain\" refers to a particular aspect of the original blockchain's (bitcoin) implementation. This can make things confusing when you try to connect the word to what it means without understanding the technical aspects behind it.

{"id": "NPGYs4SpzrPcx9_nV4OjPkzeZtEpmsdCOaihaEcD1WQ", "title": "Shame, grace and reputation.", "body": "As my last post was about rape probably worth discussing how not to be raped. And no, we won’t be discussing male chastity belts or avoiding areas where a violent homosexual might happen to be lurking. Despite the feminist propaganda, such things are highly unlikely.\n\nFirst off, if a Perfect Rapist enters your life, and especially if you have a family and children, there is nothing unmanly about running for the hills. Just remember to take your family with you. You wouldn’t be alone, hundreds flee to Southern Ireland every year to get away from the feminist police, the SS, and their abuse.\n\n### Grace\n\nThe very antithesis of feminism, one could easily argue that the religions of the last 2000 years have been busily teaching grace in their various ways, and that they only differ in their interpretations of such, only to roll over and die as soon as a blue haired harridan started spouting her filth. That organised religion has abandoned the masses to such a fate should shame them immeasurably. We’ll come back to this.\n\nBy grace I am speaking about the mental quality, rather than that of being graceful in movement. Namely the ability to think well of others. Summing the bible up in one line could be done as, “The old Testament showed that laws alone were not enough, to live together people had to embrace grace in their interpersonal dealings.”\n\nThere you go, I just saved you a Theology degree. Not that you wanted one.\n\nFeminists however have almost utterly destroyed the concept. And quite deliberately too. If you find a feminist about as sexy as a rotting mackerel then it’s probably because you realise that grace is a function of objective beauty.\n\nOh and you are sane.\n\nStudies show that conservatives are more attractive, and the retention of grace is a part of this.\n\nSo some fucknut is writing a blog telling blokes to be more graceful? Fuck no, I’m saying you should look for it in your women. And here’s why…\n\n### Reputation\n\nYour reputation is important in forming all relationships. Whether friends, family or something more porkable. You were born naked and with no possessions, bar your name. Even your first name came later. If you harm your name you not only harm your wider family, you also make it more difficult to form the sort of relationships you want.\n\nIf you want your reputation to be one of a conquistador of women then don’t be surprised if the one you actually really want views you as a human urinal. Then again Mr goody two shoes is unlikely to get much pussy. You makes your choice, but what of when you have no choice?\n\nLet’s say you made the mistake of dating a feminist. You know she hates men but you reckon the power of your pork sword will wow her into admiration and respect.\n\nYeah….\n\nFeminists one and only identifying feature is a complete lack of grace. Every man is a rapist, every Muslim a gang rapist and every structure, society, alien race or star against them. But you’re different? Please don’t kid yourself.\n\nThe one and only guarantee is that she’s slagging you off behind your back. She will be harming your reputation because she is incapable of thinking well of anyone or anything. And that’s before the two of you break up for whatever reason…\n\nTake the [hot crazy matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbKYcBdVyk) and realise that even a Unicorn is going to jump occasionally to 10. When they do will they be talking fondly of you?\n\nNow imagine a Tiffany, hairdresser or suchlike. Minus 5 for anyone or thing lacking grace and you’ll be much safer in the long run, no matter how big their tits or bottle blonde their hair.\n\nThat bottle blonde who looks as though she spends all her money on cosmetics will be spending your money on them too, and she thinks she’s entitled to do so.\n\nIf a women harms your reputation through gossip or deed then dump em. Make it a line in the sand, a boundary. I can guarantee it isn’t the only form of [relational aggression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umZEqHF7GF4) she’ll be using.\n\nPlay life as a game of enhancing your reputation and you’re on the right track. That means avoiding [borderlines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dXabMP5liQ), feminists and other scumbags like the plague.\n\n### Shame\n\nIs usually the thing that drives us. To addiction, to success and to self discovery eventually.\n\nRealise that shame will often not be your fault. In the blue pill world you’ll be presented with situations where you have to eat the lesser of two shit sandwiches. Often too.\n\nBeing born into a dysfunctional family, especially where you are shamed for your needs, might lead you to either boom or bust. Yep, even those A grade highly achieving twats are probably motivated by shame as well.\n\nIf you have an addiction, it’s probably related to some shame that you can’t put your finger on. Porn, video games, work, drugs, beer. Whatever. Some forms of shame indeed are inherited.\n\nMore importantly, for the purposes of not being raped, is to avoid anyone who uses shame to control you. Particularly other blokes.\n\nAt the end of the day any young dude has been badly let down by his previous generations. Merely in monetary terms a boy born today in the UK saddles his part of £2 trillion of debt, and as blokes work 600 million hours a year to women’s 400 million it’s an unfair share of the burden. Bugger all of that £2 trillion was spent on your future, rather on other people’s pasts.\n\nIf he is going to be one of the decreasing number of blokes to go to University he’ll have to go into massive debt and will probably never own his own house. He will spend far less on himself than an equivalent woman does and pay more tax.\n\nIf that young dude is a Muslim then he’s going to be blamed for feminism’s crimes, excluded, scapegoated and probably mocked.\n\nPrevious generations, even the priesthood themselves, have allowed the antireligion of feminism to hold sway over every aspect of a young dudes life, you’ll do worse in school, probably have to work in a 3D job and face discrimination at every turn.\n\nDon’t let others control you, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t ascribe blame and shame to those who deserve it.\n", "timestamp": 1635292477, "digest": "arsXV8o4cgj5Qo5LH0aIb9dDggjY59YLyhAhxfEQTzg", "contributor": "0xD5EAbC1973b7d580D37ae256398eEF0977d05FA5"}
{"id": "VM16eiYROU4BTK0sj8KFnAv2xSxPFks4X1cgMINjkeg", "title": "On pain and it’s uses…", "body": "## An anecdote…\n\nBack in 2008 I joined the Territorial Army with the intention of doing a tour of Afghanistan. As a 34 year old unfit computer geek who used to be picked last for almost all sports at school, and one who ran the 100m in close to 20 seconds even when fit, the infantry might have been an odd choice.\n\nI was pretty good at swimming though my sporting prowess in purely physical terms ended there.\n\nWithin a year I was on pre-deployment training with a regular unit. And regular infantry units in the British Army are basically composed of young professional athletes who were picked first for sports at school.\n\nTo say that I struggled a bit would be an understatement, though whilst the injury rate from the brutal training was high I managed to scrape through. By the skin of my teeth.\n\nAnd I’ve been pondering upon how…\n\n### Physical pain\n\nTwo particular parts of the training stand out. One was bayonet training at Catterick and the other the CO’s phys training late on in the pre-deployment training with the regular unit.\n\nThe former had little to do with bayonets. During 4 hours I only recall actually stabbing the straw dummy 5 times. The rest of the time we were crawling across permafrost and a small frozen lake during one of the coldest winters I have experienced, back and forth to a small tree about 300m away.\n\nI think you can tell how tired someone is by how long it takes them to get up from the ground and I vividly recall younger fitter blokes staggering and falling back to the ground upon the call of, “Up!”.\n\nEvery time there was a perceived infraction in bayonetery we’d have to run round this tree, hitting the deck and crawling upon the call of, “Grenade!”. Many of these circuits were almost entirely crawled.\n\nAnd in a course where about 120 blokes started and much less than 40 finished it was the knowledge that my Dad had completed similar beastings to earn his Green Beret that kept me going.\n\nQuitting would have caused me emotional pain, even the thought of it did.\n\n### The Lake…\n\nNine months later and after months of marches with ever increasing weights on our backs, which resulted in over 5% casualties from serious back injuries alone, we had to complete the CO’s Friday fitness beasting.\n\nAs I recall this was about 14 miles up and down around a lake for the entire battalion with 85lbs inclusive of weapon and body armour. The advanced CFT fitness test is 8 miles on the flat with 50lbs… And I had a chest infection.\n\nThe 4 companies lead off staggered at half hour intervals and we were last to leave though eventually caught up to Bravos who were an hour ahead, with a great deal of doubling.\n\nI have never been more knackered. Indeed my girlfriend gave me a massage that weekend as I could barely move, though I don’t mind wondering that the screams it produced didn’t result in a visit from the cops!\n\nBoth of these pushed me well beyond where I thought my physical limits were.\n\n###  Looking back though…\n\nI think I had an unfair advantage.. Certainly not a superior physique, genetic brilliance, iron will or strength of character… Frankly I’m a pretty average IT geek.\n\nNope looking back when the intensity of training ramped up to extreme levels my thoughts were elsewhere.\n\nYou see a few weeks previously my girlfriend had miscarried. Which destroyed me. My hobby became staring at the floor to the extent that people started to think me a little cuckoo. Withdrawn, depressed and skittish only a few beers of an evening with the barmaid whose best friend had just died seemed to help.\n\nOh and Scott who had recently experienced similar emotional hardship after losing his penknife.\n\nIn addition I was confined to camp for some time, which enraged me as I wanted and needed to be with her. I couldn’t understand why they would confine me to camp…\n\nThe intensity of training had all sorts of odd effects upon the blokes with fairly few not displaying some signs of emotional distress. Odd things, often from their past and completely unrelated to their current situation. childhood experiences and old traumas seemed to surface.\n\nIndeed I’d say there was a correlation between how well I perceive that they performed in Afghanistan and this. Those who handled things without any obvious problems simply seemed to have a higher capacity, at least in a military context anyway.\n\nAnd looking back I wonder whether it was actually the emotional pain which blanked my own physical pain to the extent that I got through things which I had no right to expect, and whether those other blokes that struggled actually needed some emotional pain from their pasts to do similar.\n\n### Many years later…\n\nWhilst the girlfriend had turned into the wife I always knew there had been something wrong about the entire episode. Something didn’t sit right..\n\nAnd in the middle of one of her hair trigger rages she told me that she hadn’t miscarried but had in fact aborted. As she couldn’t stand the thought of me being killed out there.\n\nWhich, rewinding, must have put the Army in a very difficult situation. Help me dodge the immediate bullet of possibly finding out the truth, or letting me face a hail of bullets later.\n\nThe former would have been very bad, the latter my responsibility. I think they called it right.\n\n### Prognostication…\n\nSo whilst I’m not some body building weirdo or sports star I do wonder whether emotional pain can be used.. Productively.\n\nIf you were to do something eminently silly such as going for a run without being paid for it can you run for longer and faster if you concentrate on emotional pain once the lactic acid starts to bite?\n\nDoes a skilled Sgt Major with his trusty shouting skills magically enhance the physical attributes of a bunch of blokes? On this I am pretty sure the answer is yes.\n\nDoes a skilled Geordie lamenting his beloved penknife have a similar effect? ( note: we were accidentally issued with two! Hence he was not entirely left bereft) This is an absolute certainty and I would hazard that anyone who considers going to war without a skilled Geordie is ill equipped.\\*\n\nIndeed they say that all humour is based upon pain\n\nDoes emotional pain blank the physical in a bloke? And is it the opposite with the fairer sex?\n\nA few experiments seem to indicate so though I would be interested in your own experience of trying out such or observations.\n\n\\*Upon landing in Kandahar on our way to Bastion the tent, ISO container and concrete blast walls which were almost exclusively the building blocks of this vast dust city prompted the observations that, “It’s nicer than Middlesbrough like.”\n\n\\*In a test of our first aid skills prior to being accepted into service we had a very realistic scenario with fans blowing dust around and someone pretending to be a leg amputee, complete with blood pump etc. Our instructions were to follow the BCD book by the letter, hence when the pretend victim whispered, “Don’t forget to put a dressing on the leg.” said chap said, “Oh right!” and started putting a field dressing on the amputated bit! Course the next line instructed him to reassure the casualty so… It looked as though he was tending to an amputated leg and telling it that it would be fine, just a scratch… Even recounting the story months later produced tears of laughter from the pretend casualty.\n", "timestamp": 1635292538, "digest": "CaGLnor_3Xcsvgr-bY1eMAhGJle-MJq-tYXeCUsT3I8", "contributor": "0xD5EAbC1973b7d580D37ae256398eEF0977d05FA5"}
{"id": "xglhiNGDlgBNMGLqF8hGTx63aTAnlN-CQVKs8ngGoSM", "title": "The End of History and the last ( correctly coloured) Vagina.", "body": "## Where we are.\n\n329 years ago there was a spot of bother in Salem, Massacheussets. The witch trials, and their dramatisation in ‘The Crucible’, have become rightly famous. Afterall the absurdity of good people losing their lives due to immature women claiming invisible injury and redress due to mere words being spoken couldn’t have any modern parallels?\n\nMeanwhile in 2021 the [Hate Crime ( Mysogyny ) Bill ](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2718)is working it’s way through Parliament. Should it pass then immature women will be able to claim injury and redress due to mere words being spoken.\n\nAt least Abigail Williams and the other Salem accusers claimed that the words were maliciously targetting them directly, rather than merely their identity politics grouping of nutcases and weirdos.\n\nThis isn’t exactly progress in my humble opinion, though such is not shared by Nottinghamshire Constabulary who carried out the misogyny survey whose findings informed the Bill above, totalling a couple of hundred instances over 2 years. Misogyny being defined by them as including…\n\n*   Unwanted or uninvited physical or verbal contact or engagement;\n*   Sexually graphic and explicit obscene language;\n*   Use of mobile devices to send unwanted or uninvited messages or take photographs without consent.\n\nSo sending a feminist an univited message consisting of, “Fucking hell, look at these shoes, you’d look great in them!” Could have resulted in two separate misogynistic hate crime instances. Mentioning such to them in person could add the further incident of speaking to without being spoken to first. Taking a photo to show them how they’d look in said shoes might indeed result in the death penalty being applied if we regress just a little further.\n\n## Modern Heresy?\n\nCourse we don’t burn witches anymore, Salem represented the back end of witch related prosecutions and the religious fervour that such depended upon slowly drained away over the succeeding years and decades. The very thought of burning childless social misfits with an excess of cats and a graceless manner was already seen as a tadge excessive in Europe. Sadly.\n\nThey were simpler times, though tempting to think better in some ways. I doubt for instance that the good people of Nottinghamshire would have considered that Parliamentary time was wisely used in protecting them and their feelings from 100 potentially naughty words per year. The Nine Years War against the frogs might have been deemed slightly more important, and somewhat more likely to result in injury.\n\nUnless, maybe, those words were Heresy. In 17th Century Nottinghamshire norms of behaviour would have been governed by religion, hence Heresy might have caused enough offence to demand prosecutions.\n\nOr, of course, rightly in my opinion, had those words been french.\n\n## So what comes first, the behaviour or the Religion?\n\nSome time back in pre-history some apes decided to pair bond, to get married, rather than to shag everything and see what happened. Maybe it was a small troop, and when one couple decided that there should be no monkey business with Colin the rest were almost compelled to follow. The result was seen to be good.. The male ape knew which children were his and didn’t have to fight off suitors; troop society was considerably less violent which allowed a safer environment for nurturing the young.\n\nThe female could start complaining about the colour of the trees and nagging that shoes be invented such that she could imitate a millipede by collecting them.\n\nAnd thus Charles Darwin’s theory of sexual selection happened. Many orders of magnitude faster than mere evolution. The Apes began to adapt to the enviroment considerably more quickly than their competing troops, and eventually morphed into proto-humans.\n\nThey taught their children that monkey business behind the yet to be invented bike sheds was bad, that marriage was good. Maybe that the boogeyman would get them if they monkeyed around, that good things would happen if they didn’t. That the tree good would reward them.\n\nI doubt there is any human behaviour more closely linked to religion than marriage in it’s various worldly guises. But clearly the behaviour comes first, the religion then codifies the genetically complex but advantageous rules in a mere good versus bad structure. In a way that even a child can understand and be taught.\n\nColin on the other hand, not so much. He preferred subduing females, wasn’t interested in the time investment needed to nurture children and didn’t really care for marriage. Seeing other Apes monkeying around with his female Ape excited him. He wanted to continue being a monkey.\n\nDon’t be like Colin.\n\n## How did we get here?\n\nSo with spells being cast against entire swathes of the population, causing intense heretical offence and injury these days, one may wonder how we regressed several hundred years of advancement so quickly?\n\nOnly about 20 miles in distance and 300 years in time away from the Salem witch trials “The End of History..” was declared by Harvard alumni Francis Fukayama. Naughtily he omitted transgender people and women preferring instead to pick upon the last man. These were less enlightened times however, the sisterhood and the coven of cuckly Colins were less powerful so he escaped cancellation and instead became famous. Well, amongst politics geeks anyway.\n\nHe neglected to tell us that the triumph of Liberal Democracy would usher in a religious quest to determine which colour of Vagina was the correct one to replace the last man. Is a white vagina sufficient, or should it be mixed race or even… a male one? Whatever that is.\n\nObjectively, you see, Liberal Democracy was a panacea. Money and votes. The religious rules which once separated us from the Apes were not objectively important.\n\nThe previous 2000 years had seen the tree good morph into a set of rules or commandments. Following which was for the genetic good of society as whole.\n\nThese were then refined with the concept of Grace in the new testament. Namely that merely following the rules yourself was not enough, that you should also assume that others were trying to follow the rules before punishing them. This lead to an even less violent society and the Grace period.\n\nClearly something went badly wrong in Salem, and has now. Though it is somewhat ironic that the Graceless period likely started around the time that Francis was proclaiming his hubris as the end of history. Behaviour apparently was set in stone.\n\nBehaviour however was already changing.\n\n## Where are we really going?\n\nBike sheds and shoes had now been invented you see. A certain type of Ape valued them both above marriage. The boogeyman, it was taught, was now trying to destroy the trees, and had enslaved all previous generations of shoe collecting apes with his patriarchal rules.\n\nA new good had emerged, one that pronounced shoes and monkeying around to be the path of true happiness. Male Apes were all part of a secret plot to deny these poor slaves the infinte numbers of shoes they richly deserved.\n\nMarriage was slavery. Sexual selection and nurturing of the young… just got in the way\n\nWords had power, and power was personal. Power was to be used to replace the boogeyman’s rules and any who followed them. To which end three spells were constructed.\n\nWeak at first, though gaining in strength as more incanations from higher and higher were made, they presupposed malice. The boogeyman’s success over time immemorial was due to racism, sexism and homophobia. The family unit itself powered entirely by malice and had to be destroyed.\n\nThis secretly delighted Colin. By proclaiming his hatred for the boogeyman he could get close to his prey. He’d praise their shoes, use their spells and, when the time was right, overpower them.\n\n## How long does it take for cult like behaviour to become Religion?\n\nIf you accept the premise that 1965 was when the new boogeyman was created then just over 50 years seems like a reasonable estimate. What we see around us has all the hallmarks of a cult. Cults eventually become religions.\n\nDefined as:\n\n*noun*\n\n1.  In modern English, a **cult** is a [social group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group) that is defined by its unusual [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion), [spiritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality), or [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) beliefs, or by its [common interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Followership) in a particular [personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality), object, or [goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal). \n\nSo whether that personality, object or goal is St Greta of Doom Goblins, Political Correctness, No Fault Divorce, Human Child Sacrifice in the form of Abortion, Affirmative Action, Transgender bathrooms, the destruction of the family, the collection of shoes, cancel culture, fatherless families, the supposed pay gap, women in STEM or the endless quest for the correctly coloured vagina…. You will find the same type of Ape directing things from a position little different to a Priestess.\n\nThe original priestesses from the 1960s have all been diagnosed with various mental disorders, as have half of under 30 year olds of a certain type of Ape.\n\nOh, and Colin of course.\n\nDon’t believe me? Just try criticising their shoes.\n\n## How fast can sexual selection work?\n\nSome chap in Russia decided to breed foxes which are friendly towards humans. This was achieved after just 2 generations, though interestingly the foxes he bred also developed other traits which were attractive to humans. Brightly coloured and patterned coats for instance that don’t exist in the wild.\n\nFox generations are shorter than human ones , the latter generally be taken to be 20 years. Evolution is popularly assumed to be very slow, though it appears that sexual selection can be almost astonishingly fast. If feminists and other animals were bred to accentuate their hostility to human males, and the boogeyman of course, then one wonders what other traits would emerge?\n\nAnother experiment was Calhoun’s mouse utopia where luxury living space and unlimited food were provided with the expectation being that the mouse population would explode until overcrowding became an issue. Instead the mouse populations died out. Not due to hunger, disease or discomfort but because the male mouses lost interest in the females and refused to breed with them. The mouse society suffered a strangely genetic death. An excess of resources under say, Liberal Democracy, may not in the long run be a good thing.\n\nThere seems to be considerable evidence that the Social Epistasis Amplification Model (SEAM), basically the human equivalent of those mice, is happening amongst our own population. Sperm counts declining, general intelligence reducing, mutations in the form of mental illnesses increasing and birth rates on the slide too. To understand this effect you could read up on the Academic works of Woodley and Dutton… Or just watch the first few minutes of the film [Idiocacy](https://youtu.be/sP2tUW0HDHA).\n\nGiven that cults and religions can form over 50 or 60 years we could already be looking at 3rd generation feminists and other spiteful mutants.\n\nReligions and cults don’t start with a bang, indeed it can sometimes be difficult to discern where or when they did, nor do they die out quickly. Apes and monkeys are amusing precisely because they are not human, but have some human like behaviours.\n\nIn the same way as the previous religious order and establishment was overthrown by the relentless mockery of Monty Python and others, so too should the Doom Goblins and boogeyman fearing Priestesses suffer the same fate. But first it has to be formalised.\n\nThroughout genetic human history only about 40% of males have had children, as opposed to 70% of females. That the Doom Goblins and Priestesses are damaging society should by this point be clear, though they are also damaging their own reproductive health as increasingly wise blokes refuse to shag them.\n\nIt is rather amusing to look through the dating adverts for late 30s and older women whose body clocks are ticking and see a long list of things that they don’t want, colocated with childish wants such as “Where is my Prince?”. That they mainly appear to be fat, drunken feminist slobs with nothing to offer likely hasn’t ever occurred to them. So it would be a public service to inform them. Mock, not cock is the answer.\n\nMeanwhile cuckly Colin and his rapey chums are our responsibility. Claiming as they do to be the same sex. Any bloke who compromises his values for a low value simian should be mocked relentlessly for it. #CuckLogic should called out for ridicule.\n\nThose who are totally incapable of pair bonding are in many ways fundamentally less human, and certainly have no right to dictate social or economic poicy as they have less of a stake in the future. Yet men pay 70% of the tax and recieve practically no representation in return.\n\nFrancis Fukayama was right about one thing, votes and money does equal power. So use your power, particularly your economic power, by refusing to buy woke or feminist supporting products. Refuse to vote for cucks or feminists, though admittedly that doesn’t often leave anyone to vote for in most instances.\n\nMeanwhile you will almost certainly be called racist, sexist, misogynistic or homophobic. Though simply consider this to be the modern equivalent of an Ape flinging their poo at you. If you don’t emerge from a cultural battle which threatens civilisation as we know it with a few scars, then shame on you.\n\nBy their own actions and behaviour they will die out, though that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have some fun at their expense in the mean time. Indeed the sooner wokeism / feminism / globalism / ecomentalism is officially declared a religion, the sooner we can identify and distance ourselves from it’s adherents.\n", "timestamp": 1635293777, "digest": "rbeC3vY4sraCkwmYtXsahhTxBfef9lh9ya6uprnBfkE", "contributor": "0xD5EAbC1973b7d580D37ae256398eEF0977d05FA5"}

But let us play the horrible mind game where we pretend to be a fat fucking feminist intent upon subverting and destroying these principles to the disadvantage of men… Quite a problem!\n\nIt may surprise you to hear that there is already a separate legal system which tries a person, almost always a man, along feminist religious principles in complete secrecy. Enter the MARAC!\n\n### Multi Agency Risk Assessment Conference.\n\nThese were designed by fat fucking feminists in Cardiff back in 2003. Naturally they were only to be used in the most serious of cases, rape and DV initially, to protect those poor women and children who are so utterly oppressed by the Patriarchy or at risk from domestic or sexual violence.\n\nIndeed it appears to be loosely based upon a system designed to finger potential terrorists… A system so successful at such that about 3% of the entire male Muslim population of the UK is now on a terrorist watch list! Which is clearly nonsense. Though does also pose quite a problem for the virtue signalling fat fucking feminists constant claims that 99.9% of the Muslim population is peaceful.\n\nThey take 16 different agencies front loaded with graceless feminists in the guise of Women’s Aid, [Perfect Rapists](https://redpilluk.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/lets-talk-about-rape/) ( aka Social Workers) and the Women’s Support Unit. They are obliged to treat any allegation against a man as gospel ( believe the victim) and they are not allowed to disclose any part of this procedure to the subject of such.\n\nNever heard of them huh? Doesn’t affect me? Sounds reasonable? Then read on…\n\n###  If >3% of Muslims are considered potential terrorists by a similar system..\n\nThen what proportion of UK based males have been subject to a MARAC without their knowledge?\n\nLet’s take their own [figures](https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2007/04/18/risk-assessment-and-domestic-violence-the-multi-agency-marac-model-of-intervention/)… 20 every two weeks back in 2007 just a few years after their introduction. Though the number of MARACs has increased by 70% since 2010. Indeed there are now so many that mini-MARACs by phone alone are commonplace as they take up so much valuable Perfect Rapist time and resources..\n\nIf we exclude those too old or too young to be subject to such and take the last census’ figures for Cardiff’s population then well over 10,000 Welsh dudes in their capital have been subject to a MARAC, about 1 in 8.\n\nThe figures I have seen from another part of the UK make this sound like an underestimate. Indeed this is clearly an underestimate anyway as we didn’t exclude those who are single, gay or factor in that merely having children or being married / cohabiting will massively increase the odds of having been subject to a MARAC. Nor too the assumed prejudice from fat fucking feminists and the gender cleansing police in favour of ethnic minorities and the like.\n\nBasically if you are a stale white male with a normal relationship there is a pretty decent chance that you have been defamed without any knowledge of such.\n\nAny involvement with the police, family courts, have had a relationship end acrimoniously or upset any fat vengedful feminist at any time then more than likely you have…. In fact almost certainly have in many of those scenarios…\n\n### Surely safeguarding children and women is a laudable aim?\n\nOh you naive fool.\n\nWhat is laudable is that you assume these unlawful congregations of gossipping witches are designed to be used for good and right.. You clearly don’t understand feminism.\n\nAs these are used in cases of rape one would correctly suppose that the 5000+ victims of rape gangs in Skipton, Rotherham, Blackpool, Sheffield, Oxford, Halifax, Bradford, Ipswich, London, Telford, Preston, Derby, Torbay, Bristol, Banbury, Chesham, Birmingham, Barking, Blackburn, Rochdale, Leeds, Stockport, Aylesbury, Yeovil, Newcastle, Burton, Accrington, Ormskirk, Manchester, Keighley, Oldham, Peterborough, Dewsbury, Littlehampton, Middlesborough and Slough would have triggered MARACs.\n\nHowever they were used instead to defame the victims themselves… Note that all or most of the above will have separate Social Services departments..\n\nThe poor victims would be left reeling and confused as to why no government agency would hear their cries for help and justice, as they had already been labelled as racist drug abusing prostitues by our wonderful Perfect Rapists. Recall that 16 agencies or government departments are involved, basically all of them. Hence all avenues for help and safety were closed off by a mere edict from the Home Office.\n\nIf this can happen to schoolgirls being raped on an industrial scale then I’m sure we can all agree that being judged by a coven of blue haired mastodons who firmly believe that all men are rapists is always going to go swimmingly for you…\n\n### Okay… But how does this relate to the Principles of Justice?\n\nWell let’s remember that our little mental game is to attempt to subvert the principles of justice.. So let’s give the problem to an engineer…\n\n“A tricky problem.. Was a three pipe problem in fact..” He muses… “Centuries of common law and the strict adherence to open justice do take some…. ingenuity to subvert.” He says reaching for his pipe. “It will have to be extra-judicial, no point trying to do this through laws as that would involve public scrutiny, or not explicitly so anyway.” He continues.\n\n“So what have you come up with? Let’s take accountability first.”\n\n“Yes, let’s..” says the engineer with a smile, “That was the easiest part. To make it unaccountable we merely keep it secret. Our [Perfect Rapists](https://redpilluk.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/lets-talk-about-rape/) and anyone else trained by the state in feminist principles have been conditioned to always believe the victim, so we merely make that policy from the Home Office. We simply add a confidentiality clause to that, such that anyone subject to a MARAC could never find out without there being some breach of data privacy.”\n\n“Ok I get that…. Simple as you say…. What about Just Laws?”\n\n“Mere incrementalism old boy… Merely add clauses to make the law contradictory, as we did with hate speech, and let the judge decide which side of the law to choose.”\n\n“But what if the judges choose the wrong side? That doesn’t sound like a sound design, leaving things to chance almost.”\n\n“Oh I’ve thought about that and I’m quite proud of my design. I’d like to introduce you to the concept of safeguarding…”\n\n“Sounds fluffy!”\n\n“Yes it is…” he winks knowingly, “Very easy to sell such a.. fluffy as you put it.. term. If there were any media scrutiny. ” He stifles a laugh, “Then the response writes itself.. How could anyone be against safeguarding women or children? The concept and rule here is that anything relating to safeguarding has to be disclosed to the judge.”\n\n“But it will be challenged in court if that happens, that sounds like open justice…”\n\n“Oh no you miss the point. Victim confidentiality means that such things will merely be handed to the judge unquestioned, not raised in open court. No need for evidence old boy, merely accusations or hypotheticals.”\n\n“How on earth do you propose to do that? No lawyer would risk the entire legal system being subverted by secret evidence whispered into a judges ear!”\n\nThe engineer almost falls off his chair. Looks at you as though you were a petulant child, fills his pipe and condescends to explain…\n\n“No state barrister or solicitor on £2000 a day will want to win all of their cases you mean? Are you mad? Have you ever met one of them? You think they drive Skodas and shop in Aldi?? Quite the opposite, they will submit such idle gossip or else they will end up on the defence side, and lose all their cases. They will be told that they have a duty to safeguard and submit such errant nonsense, regardless of context. Most of them are male, and quite competitive. They like to win. Anyone who doesn’t… Well the council or police simply contract a different and more…. reliable type… The defence loses 99.9% of all cases in family courts but do you see family law solicitors advertising this fact?”.\n\n“Ok I get it… So basically what you propse is an entirely separate legal system where a chap’s guilt or innocence is decided long before a trial by…. well it’s effetively a different court. A feminist court. And that it’s conclusions are whispered to the judge outside of normal court proceedings such that there is no possibility of a defence? Surely the judges won’t buy this?”\n\n“They already have old boy!” The engineer smirks, “Blair saw to that, purging the judiciary of anyone considered ‘reactionary’.”\n\n“But what if all these agencies at a MARAC don’t reach the conclusion that a chap is a bad type? A bad apple?”\n\n“Oh that is simple… We just add more feminists. Barnados, NSPCC, even the RSPCA should his dog ever have had an accident. They’ll all verge on the side of safeguarding and caution, would rather raise suspicion and cover their own backs just in case he is a potential rapist… As they are convinced that all blokes are anyway.”\n\nThe engineer starts to look a little smug.\n\n“So this is basically just giving fat fucking feminists an active role in the judicial system by encouraging them to defame a bloke by whispering to a judge in ways which he will not even be aware of?”  You ponder this… The full horror dawning on you slowly…\n\n“Basically yes. Simple designs are always the best.”  His smugness becomes almost overwhelming..\n\n“So what about marketting, propagation? Also the last principle of dispute resolution?\n\n“Ah yes, they are taken care of.” He enthuses, lighting his pipe and contemplating his creation “Give anyone ‘raising a concern’ a day off work to sit in a room gossipping with other harpies should help, tea and endless cakes provided of course…. Our friends at the Home Office making such things policy and imposing them upon local authorities pretty much closes the loop. You are aware that gossipping is considered a pleasureable activity by certain gender groups are you not? As for dispute resolution, what disputes could there possibly be?\n\n“What if a chap appeals? Challenges the basis for this defamation?”\n\n“And how would he even know about it? You think his ex-wife, girlfriend, GP or state employee tells him about it? He wouldn’t know that his GP was prescribing him drugs such as Mirtazipine to mong him out due to secretly considering him a wife beater, he wouldn’t know anything about the process or details, there is in short nothing whatsoever to dispute. And don’t forget that I designed our [Perfect Rapists](https://redpilluk.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/lets-talk-about-rape/) to be immune from defamation. Whilst a chap might feel unfairly treated he would have no clue why.”\n\nYou both sit in silence whilst the engineer contentedly sucks on his pipe.\n\n“So you designed this along feminist lines, such that they could subvert the justice system…” you begin but the engineer interupts you..\n\n“I was merely given a problem to solve. And solve it I have, I think you will agree…”\n\n“But what if this is abused? Such as Rotherham, Telford etc. What if this extrajudicial system falls into the wrong hands, is used politically… I hear that increasing numbers of MARACs are held to investigate the supposedly far right. Even religious groups…”\n\n“My dear chap I can’t be held responsible for how people misuse my designs.” His smugness dented somewhat..\n\n“But is has been misused.” You insist, “What of the victims of Rotherham, how could they possibly seek justice against this state apparatus which destroyed their lives? Defamed them, denied them justice? The entire establishment, all state agencies and media acting in concert against them? What safety valve or recourse have you incorporated to ensure it can’t be misused or abused for political advantage?”\n\nThe engineer looks angry. “There was no requirement for one. I merely designed the system as instructed.”\n\n“What is to stop members of political parties leaking such things to media, confidential briefings and the like? Dubious allegations from embittered exes… Hang on….This is happening isn’t it?\n\nThe engineer looks worried, “No, no… That isn’t the purpose of this design… It is to protect women and children!”\n\n“And you’ve never met a feminist with a lefty political agenda then?! You don’t think it beyond them to use this and other spurious bollocks to political advantage? To smear their opponents? You don’t think that this resembles a massive spy network and defamation database? ”\n\nThe engineer is now staring out of the window, his pipe has gone out and he suddenly looks 15 years older.\n\n“Well that’s a potential problem I admit?” he murmurs…\n\n“Potential problem? Have you read the papers these days? How did the BBC know that Cliff Richard was going to be arrested? Even though he was entirely innocent they had time to hire a helicopter to film it, and that wasn’t even political. Have you not noticed that right of centre politicians are constantly having dubious allegations from their past brought up? Where the hell do you think these come from?\n\n“Well it could be anywhere really… Journalists have their own sources after all.”\n\n“And no one from the 16 agencies, charities and otherwise feminist stocked organisations is ever likely to tip the press off for political advantage or money are they? Meanwhile 95% of those in prison are male, I can’t imagine why! Do you realise that you’ve designed a political police force?”\n\nThe engineer squirms…. But doesn’t answer.\n\n“One further question…. What happens if this state apparatus is taken over by some group even more obnoxious or hideous than feminists? What happens if they merely measure a chap’s head and whisper to the judge that he is a Jew for instance? What if feminists are just useful idiots and you’ve designed and implemented a system that the Stasi would be proud of?”\n\n“Feminists assured me that they merely seek equality.” he mutters weakly, now visibly ashen faced…\n\n“So why do they need a system that completely undermines and destroys the justice system, holds a database or potentially useful political smears, targets their political opponents and ensures completely partial and unequal justice for half of the population? Hell next they’ll be making opposition to feminism illegal!”\n\n“Erm…. I also did some work for the EU via Tony Blair.” me mutters apologetically… “[You may be interested in section 2E](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009\\_2014/documents/libe/dv/11\\_revframework_statute\\_/11\\_revframework_statute_en.pdf)“.\n\nEdit: Brief talky talky on this post….

{"id": "-V9JUTXkEZil_mG8w1tGRBZevC_I9HsNs-OLn875O_k", "title": "Things One Needs To Know About Decentralized Leveraged Tokens", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hIqLDwCgvKA5CFavTXFmP.png?height=233&width=512)\n\nThere are several models of Decentralized Leveraged Tokens live on the market, including [Set Protocol](https://www.tokensets.com/), [Tracer](https://tracer.finance/) and [Phoenix Finance](http://phx.finance/). Each of them applies a very different approach to the tokenization of the leveraged position.\n\nSeveral months earlier, Iposted [my ideas on the decentralized solution on the Decentralized leveraged tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-defi-model-for-decentralized-leveraged-tokens-finnexus), and Phoenix Finance put these theories into practice weeks ago. The protocol is now live on Polygon, BSC, and Wanchain, with[ a united interface](http://app.phx.finance/). For those who want to learn more about this model, please check the details [here](https://docs.phx.finance/about/productpaper/).\n\n# What Are Leveraged Tokens?\n\n[Leveraged tokens](https://medium.com/coinmonks/leveraged-token-3f5257808b22) are derivatives giving holders stable leveraged exposure to cryptoassets. Token holders do not need to worry about actively managing a leveraged position, borrowing or liquidation.\n\nFixed leverages or leverage ranges are maintained by the rebalancing mechanism.\n\nFor example, the ETHBULL 3x leveraged token on Phoenix Finance — also known as 3x Long ETH token — is an ERC-20 token, with exposure corresponding to three times the return of ETH. For ETH goes up 1% in a day, ETHBULL 3x leveraged token will rise by 3%.\n\n# Differences Between Leveraged Tokens And Other Leveraged Instruments\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CllB661DlUZvG0fsdfwNo.png?height=1414&width=2000&size=large)\n\nThe biggest difference between leveraged tokens and margin trading/perpetuals is that leveraged tokens rebalance both periodically when reaching a certain threshold in order to maintain specific leverage.\n\nWhile differently, products like margin trading and perpetuals are constantly changing their leverages as to the price fluctuations, even if traders set the predetermined leverage when taking on a position.\n\nYou can check [this article](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-leverages-in-defi-borrowing-margin-trading-leveraged-tokens-and-options-finnexus#toc-leverages-in-defi) for more details about leverage in different DeFi products.\n\n# Things to Know Before Trading Phoenix Leveraged Tokens\n\n## An Extremely Easy to Use Leveraged Product\n\nPhoenix tokenizes decentralized leveraged products into the ERC-20 form. These tokens are fungible and interchangeable.\n\nA user can take a fixed 3x leveraged exposure to a certain underlying asset by simply buying and holding the tokens. The leveraged exposure is automatically granted. Actively managing a leveraged position is not a concern. If one wants to close it, all they need to do is to sell the tokens.\n\nFurthermore, the leveraged tokens **will rebalance themselves to make the leverage in a stable manner.** Users are not required to work on margins, liquidation, collateral, or funding rates. They are all embedded in the tokens’ contracts. This provides an extremely friendly way for users who intend to hold a constant and stable leverage exposure to a certain cryptoasset.\n\nCurrently, the Phoenix protocol is accessible through a joint interface that supports multiple blockchains.\n\n## A Product to Trade Rather Than Hold\n\nAfter being created by FTX exchange, though holding a constant position, **leveraged tokens are usually regarded as a kind of product to trade rather than hold for a long time**. They provide additional options for traders to gain more exposure and profit in a short term.\n\nThe main argument lies in the rebalancing mechanism, which keeps the leverage at a stable state. As introduced [here](https://docs.phx.finance/leveragedtokens/basics/), without rebalancing leverages, like in the margin trading, the actual leverage level will shift as to the underliers’ price movements. To keep the leverage stable, at every rebalancing occasion, each leveraged token reinvests profits, if making any, and sells off part of its position to deleverage to mitigate risks, if taking a loss. It works differently from margin trading or perpetual. Leveraged token holders may get confused when the financials perform differently from their expectations.\n\nFor long-term leveraged token holders, one is actually fighting against the possible disadvantages from the leverage rebalancing. Like when you are getting profits, the rebalancing will ‘inflate’ the real leverage by reinvesting, compared with margin trading, though the real intention is to stabilize it. If the market is moving unfavourably afterwards, you will be more financially damaged due to the ‘inflated’ risks. Well, of course, you may earn more in times of favourable market movements.\n\nIn short, leveraged tokens are easy and powerful instruments for short-term trading, but please pay more attention to the rebalancing’s interference when holding them for longer periods. And the longer periods one holds the tokens, the more unpredictable it will seem to be, due to the disturbance of multiple rebalances.\n\nPlease view the “Financial performance” section below to find out more on this topic.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s4lcaXbaGaWrHEnQoOXci.png?height=447&width=1305)\n\n## A product with 100% collateral\n\nUnlike synthetic assets, whose performances are mirroring those who are holding these underlying kinds, Phoenix decentralized leveraged tokens make sure that these tokens are 100% collateralized, by actually holding those positions. In other words, Phoenix decentralized leveraged tokens are asset-backed tokens.\n\nThis means that when Phoenix decentralized leveraged tokens are created, a series of transactions including borrowing and trading is executed. Lending pools are established to power the tokens’ leverages, and decentralized exchanges collaborate for transactions when buying, selling and rebalancing. These mechanisms make sure that the net value of the Phoenix leveraged tokens is always backed by real assets and debts.\n\nIn turn, this assures minimal counterparty risks when making transactions and financial insurance in tracking the leveraged performance.\n\n## Leveraged tokens rely on the underlying token’s liquidity on Dexes\n\nThough leveraged tokens are tokenized into ERC20 forms, the Phoenix protocol does not intentionally establish liquidity pools on Dexes. In other words, the transactions don’t rely on the leveraged tokens’ liquidity.\n\nWhen purchasing Phoenix leveraged tokens and taking leverages, the same amount of the leveraged tokens are minted, and when the Phoenix leveraged tokens are sold, they are redeemed for the designated assets. On both occasions, a series of transactions will be triggered, based on the underlying tokens’ liquidity.\n\nFor example, suppose there is no transaction cost or price slippage, and Alex buys 1 unit of ETHBULL (3x) token with USDC, when its net value is $100.\n\nAfter receiving $100 USDC, the contract is triggered to borrow 200 USDC from the pool. Then, the 300 USDC will be traded for ETH from decentralized exchanges. At the same time, the contract will create 1 unit of ETHBULL (3x) token. Therefore, the liquidity of the leveraged tokens depends on the underlying token’s pool (ETH/USDC in this case) on the designated decentralized exchange.\n\nThis mechanism fully utilizes the existing liquidity on DEXes, without needing to create other leveraged token pairs.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nSince the leverage needs to be restored at the time of rebalancing, higher volatility may cause unexpected difficulties for traders. Especially in occasions of multiple rebalances, the effects are compounded in re-leverages and de-leverages. The mathematical outcomes can be unexpected to common understandings.\n\nIn favorable trending markets with lower volatility, the performance for longer periods is more likely to exceed the return of margin trading, as the gains are compounded in rebalancing. However, in volatile markets, the same mechanism may harm the token’s long-term performance.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the leveraged tokens’ financial performances with examples. (Assume a daily rebalancing to 3x leverages)\n\nAssume that 3 users make $100 investment in ETH, ETH Bull 3x and ETH Bear 3x respectively at day 1. ETH price changes as follows in the next 30 days.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VATIJ9W_AEIb45vpf9vfL.png?height=471&width=1162)\n\nThese three portfolios have different financial performances. The calculation can be seen [on Sheet 1 here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Db7bkuFwt0Xmhmx3y2mBRx0vVteHvfWuh5tb0VnOvlc/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5fqV_qtTWKKzWNAc2BphE.png?height=715&width=1400)\n\nWe may notice that:\n\n* The volatility of ETH has been magnified by the leveraged tokens.\n* If we look closer at the daily performance, the leveraged tokens’ performance is more or less the same as the 3x leveraged expectations.\n* In the first 9 days, when ETH price is making a steady upward movement, the ETH bull token has an 82% gain, outperforming the +23% ETH price rise by actually more than 3 times. Meanwhile, ETH Bear 3x suffers a 49% loss, less than the 3 times the ETH rise. This is due to the de-leveraging mechanism — the gain is magnified by compounding and the loss is protected by deleveraging.\n* In volatile times between day 9 and day 20, the price of ETH rises from 3688 to 3699. However, both ETH bull and bear tokens fall in value, as proof of the idea that volatility is the enemy of leveraged tokens.\n* In the last 10 days, when the ETH price is making a steady downward movement, the ETH bear token is rising in value with leverage, while the ETH bull token value drops dramatically.\n* If we take the 30 days’ performance as a whole, ETH price drops by 5%. But the ETH bull token drops by 26% and the ETH bear token drops by 2%.\n\nIn other words, the long-term performance of the leveraged tokens may be more unpredictable due to the rebalancing mechanism.\n\nTherefore, investors of leveraged tokens over longer periods are encouraged to actively monitor their investments and to consider a strategy that mitigates the effects of rebalancing.\n\n**Let’s take another look by including the 3x margin trading in the comparison.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Y_WTZgFMLb36Z_B3DcuA.png?height=528&width=854)\n\nAs shown [on Sheet 2 here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Db7bkuFwt0Xmhmx3y2mBRx0vVteHvfWuh5tb0VnOvlc/edit?usp=sharing):\n\n* Both the leveraged tokens and margin trading have a clear effect of magnifying volatility by taking 3x leverages.\n* Leveraged bull tokens perform better than longing ETH in margin trading in the first 9 days in the trending market.\n* Leveraged bear tokens lose less than shorting ETH in margin trading in the first 9 days in the trending market.\n* From Day 20 to Day 30, leveraged bull tokens drop more dramatically than having a 3x ETH long margin, due to the higher leverages compounded from the previous gains.\n* From Day 20 to Day 30, leveraged bear tokens recover less than having a 3x ETH short margin, due to having less leverages by deleveraging in the previous rebalancing.\n* On Day 18, traders having a 3x ETH short margin are suffering from an 82% value drop. If the price continued to rise, they would be at great risk of getting liquidated. On the contrary, leveraged bear token holders are losing 57% in net value, and they would not get liquidated, even if the ETH continued to rise.\n* Margin trading is easier to predict as it always holds a 3x leveraged position against Day 1. Leveraged tokens are more difficult to predict as they always hold a 3x leveraged position against the previous day. In other words, the real-time leverage is adjusted periodically (daily in our example).\n\nTo mitigate the risks of unpredictability in rebalancing, Phoenix protocol applies a range for triggering the scheduled rebalancing. If the real leverage lies within 2.5 to 3.5, the rebalancing will not be activated, in order to lower the effect of auto-compounding.\n\n# Other risks\n\nThere may be other risks involved in the Leveraged Token Protocol. It is highly recommended to check on [the potential risks in these docs](https://docs.phx.finance/leveragedtokens/risks/) before making any transactions.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis article serves as an introduction of several main features in the design of leveraged token model live on the Phoenix Finance Platform, some of which may be different from the traditional leveraged tools. Please DYOR before making any transactions or investments with Phoenix leveraged tokens.", "timestamp": 1635295641, "digest": "viLSzsk4BaaxWQ4x9XTI4k_PIV8RIwh3SPW243LlDvc", "contributor": "0xD8e3e3eC5643e451a4A1Ca57704DFA6353898eBc"}

I see this phrase to mean that the contract itself is self-executing, i.e. it automates and/or ensures the execution of the promises. \\[2\\]\n\n### The classic vending machine example\n\nA great example of a smart contract—also from Nick Szabo in 1996—is a vending machine.\n\nHow a vending machine is a contract: if a person (party 1) puts money in (does X), the vending machine (party 2) will give potato chips (does Y).\n\nThe contract of the vending machine is not specified digitally, but more implicitly by a person’s understanding of the concept of the vending machine.\n\nThe mechanical system behind the vending machine automates the execution of the promises.\n\nYou may take note a difference here between a typical legal contract and the vending machine contract—instead of an agreement of terms upfront before the execution of promises, the vending machine presents a system of self-executing promises that will activate upon fulfillment of a condition, the condition being the input of money. This model of thinking will be helpful when extrapolating to blockchain.\n\n### Mental models for contracts\n\n*Normal idea of contract in our heads*: two people sign document, then go to work and don't break the contract (keep their promises).\n\n*New model for smart contract*: system of self-executing promises is exposed to public use; anyone can trigger the execution by providing proper inputs.\n\n## What is a smart contract in the context of blockchain?\n\nAt a high level, smart contracts on a blockchain are not much more than our established definition. In the case of a blockchain, the system that automates/ensures the execution of promises is code, and the promises are expressed/specified by the same code.\n\nSimilar to a vending machine, when you fulfill given conditions, i.e. provide money, you can then trigger the execution of said promises, i.e. blocks of code.\n\nWe can extrapolate this metaphor even further.\n\nWhen you insert money into a vending machine, you’re paying not only for the asset you might obtain as a result of execution, but for the service of execution as well. In other words, you pay for the chips themselves, as well as the machine itself for its convenience and its labor of swirling the little metal spiral to pop out your bag of chips. This is the same for smart contracts. You pay what's called a gas fee not only for 1) a possible asset you might obtain, but also to 2) trigger the execution of a smart contract, with the fee being roughly proportional to the computational resources expended to execute its code.\n\nWhen you put your money into a vending machine, you choose which item you want it to spit out. If you abstract away the bag of chips or candy bar, you're really choosing which function to run, that being the F2 function with your Fritos, or the E6 function with your Snickers. Like a vending machine, a smart contract specifies different functions, aka blocks of code, it can run, and when you use a smart contract, you specify which function you want it to run. \\[3\\]\n\n## How is that possible on a blockchain?\n\nWell, it's only possible on a blockchain that supports this capability.\n\nTake away any relation to money. Let's first just think about how there can be code execution on a blockchain.\n\nFirst, blockchain, if you don't have previous context, is just a software system that allows a network of computers to agree on arbitrary data without any central authority. You may hear this as a network being capable of \"decentralized consensus.\" \\[4\\]\n\nYou can think about a blockchain network as a bunch of computers updating each other on some data, and all the computers cooperate together through clever protocols to ensure that they all have the same data and updates all in the same order. You can think of these updates as pushing new data or editing data.\n\nWe can think of this data as the \"state\" of the network. In computer science, a state machine is just a system with some sort of state, that takes inputs and transitions to a new state in a consistent manner. It’s reasonable to think of a blockchain network as one big state machine, where the data is the state, and the updates are transitions to the states.\n\nNow imagine that one of these updates was pushing some new data, but that data was a block of code. Now everyone in the network has access to this code.\n\nImagine another update was pushing some new data, but this time the data was the output of that code. In this update, it would just include the instruction to get the output of the code, not the actual output itself. Given that everyone has the code, to make this update, they would be able to just run this code. Now you have code execution on the blockchain.\n\nImagine the code was unlimited in the kinds of things it could do. It could make updates, so it could push new data, edit data, push new code, and trigger the execution of other code. Imagine you could call this code from other software. Now you have a development ecosystem that can leverage code execution on this network of computers.\n\n## So is this how it works on real blockchains?\n\nWhat we've established so far is not far off from how smart contracts work on Ethereum.\n\nIf we combine this concept of code execution on a network of computers plus our idea of vending machines as smart contracts, we get Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nOn Ethereum, a smart contract specifies a set of functions, i.e. arbitrary blocks of code, that a user can trigger by providing some money and specifying which function to run. Just like a vending machine.\n\nHow does code receive money? When a contract is deployed, an account is created that is connected to that contract. Accounts are what store balances of ether, Ethereum’s native currency, for entities on the blockchain, and so smart contracts hold accounts that users can send ether to.\n\nBefore any code execution can happen, someone needs to write a contract, and put it on the blockchain, i.e. push data to the network of computers.\n\nThen when the code runs, it can change the state on the blockchain in a myriad of ways, such as updating data, adding new data, moving money from one account to another, allocating assets to accounts, etc. And instead of the state being totally arbitrary data, at its core it's a bunch of accounts with balances of ether.\n\nThis all happens through transactions. Transactions are not only their literal meaning of exchanging assets/services, but also they're arbitrary changes to the state. Sending money from my account to another account is a transaction. Inputting money to trigger a smart contract is another transaction.\n\nThrough this system of state, transactions, and code execution, you can see that this whole blockchain ecosystem really amounts to a bunch of glorified vending machines, that is, glorified vending machines that are powering the future of the web.\n\n…\n\n## Notes\n\n\\[1\\] [Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Markets, Nick Szabo, 1996.](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html)\n\n\\[2\\] Typically a contract would be legally binding, giving parties involved great confidence that the other would fulfill their promises, as otherwise the law would enforce the execution of some consequence. In a smart contract, a system is provided that automates this fulfillment of promises. It gives you 100% confidence the promises will be fulfilled.\n\n\\[3\\] Another similarity between vending machines and smart contracts: you don’t have to inspect the insides of a vending machine to use it or to trust that it’ll actually give you potato chips and not just eat up your one dollar bill.

Accounts are what store balances of ether, Ethereum’s native currency, for entities on the blockchain, and so smart contracts hold accounts that users can send ether to.\n\nBefore any code execution can happen, someone needs to write a contract, and put it on the blockchain, i.e. push data to the network of computers.\n\nThen when the code runs, it can change the state on the blockchain in a myriad of ways, such as updating data, adding new data, moving money from one account to another, allocating assets to accounts, etc. And instead of the state being totally arbitrary data, at its core it's a bunch of accounts with balances of ether.\n\nThis all happens through transactions. Transactions are not only their literal meaning of exchanging assets/services, but also they're arbitrary changes to the state. Sending money from my account to another account is a transaction. Inputting money to trigger a smart contract is another transaction.\n\nThrough this system of state, transactions, and code execution, you can see that this whole blockchain ecosystem really amounts to a bunch of glorified vending machines, that is, glorified vending machines that are powering the future of the web.\n\n…\n\n## Notes\n\n\\[1\\] [Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Markets, Nick Szabo, 1996.](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html)\n\n\\[2\\] Typically a contract would be legally binding, giving parties involved great confidence that the other would fulfill their promises, as otherwise the law would enforce the execution of some consequence. In a smart contract, a system is provided that automates this fulfillment of promises. It gives you 100% confidence the promises will be fulfilled.\n\n\\[3\\] Another similarity between vending machines and smart contracts: you don’t have to inspect the insides of a vending machine to use it or to trust that it’ll actually give you potato chips and not just eat up your one dollar bill. A smart contract is the same way. In most cases the end user should not have to know exactly what’s going on inside a smart contract to use it.\n\n\\[4\\] The actual word \"blockchain\" refers to a particular aspect of the original blockchain's (bitcoin) implementation. This can make things confusing when you try to connect the word to what it means without understanding the technical aspects behind it.

{"id": "DPli_d-9SwMf_tHJ9Ex1qJYMs5d6TMNoXvOs_M2oVXc", "title": "Natively User-Centric - How Web3 & The Blockchain Put Users First", "body": "## Competitive Advantage Is Changing\n\nCompetitive advantage is what every business strives for - it’s the only thing that separates a company from the army camped outside its gates loading catapults and sharpening swords. In today’s market dominated by big tech firms like Google, Facebook, and Netflix, two significant categories of competitive advantage are prominent.\n\nThe first competitive advantage comes in the form of closely guarded algorithms and code-bases, protected by layers of corporate policy, IT security, and legal frameworks. The second is the massive amount of data generated by users. The people working at these companies are brilliant and the products these people develop are, without a doubt, excellent. But the problem is that **the user-centricity discussed in marketing copy and job postings is secondary to the maintenance of competitive advantage and market dominance.**\n\nWeb3, however, **unlocks and lays bare much of that competitive advantage** and it does so **in service of the user**. Web3 companies are concerned with solvency and generating profits, but the openness inherent to the protocols of Web3 means innovation is unleashed and the organizations that best serve the user will win. Full stop.\n\n## Execution, Community, & Web3 User-Centricity\n\nThough innovation will remain important, a company’s true competitive advantage in Web3 will be primarily tied to two factors - execution and community building.\n\n### Execution Over Algorithms\n\nExecution is a team’s ability to consistently and quickly bring to life their value proposition and the promises they make to users and customers. Since the blockchain and smart contracts are a matter of [public record](https://etherscan.io), innovative concepts and code can be used, reused, reformatted, manipulated, and deconstructed. Pieces and parts can be extracted and incorporated.\n\nYou don’t have to guess how something was implemented, you can look at the smart contract, at the actual building blocks used to create the solution immutably coded into the blockchain.\n\nThis sits in direct opposition to the closely-guarded secrets protected by social web companies. Rather than commit significant resources to research and development, and then even more resources to protecting that innovation, teams can closely examine market leaders and see what is working and what is not. When innovation is accessible and there is an inherent bias toward execution, users win.\n\n### Community Values Over Value Extraction\n\nCommunity is a team’s ability to convert customers to users and users to partners. In the Web3 world, particularly as it relates to smart contracts, the blockchain, and [DAOs](https://mirror.xyz/0xA121F5f12fe3D5567A333EEef2dce45945C0ECCF/-_U8Yx4k22Pg3TnqIE1tzi6TRhGuJCWQt98qczjTRhE), a customer’s stake in the success of a company will transcend the transactional relationship of old.\n\nRather than “I give you X currency or data and you give me Y that accomplishes Z,” the relationship for successful companies will look more like “I give you X, you not only give me access to Y that accomplishes Z, but also provide me with access to those who build the product, a say in the development of the product, and the ability to reap rewards from the future success of the product.”\n\nWhen the interaction between a company and its customers shifts away from value extraction and toward shared value, users win again.\n\n#### User-Owned Data Over User-Generated Content\n\nWeb2 companies own your data. Unfortunately that statement doesn’t require much more nuance or context. The content, pictures, and videos you post on Web2 social media apps or the “likes” you give to movies and shows on your favorite streaming service are owned by the platform, not by you. This simple fact is an important artifact of Web2 and is one of the areas in which Web3 can innovate significantly.\n\nThe blockchain will enable the development of platforms and protocols that put you in sole control of your data, allowing you to determine who can access your data, when they can access your data, and what they can do with that data. Web3 companies will find innovative ways to broker this data and unlock value for users that was previously extracted by large companies.\n\nDecentralizing control of user-generated data - or rather centralizing each user’s data into their own control - disrupts the second pillar of Web2 competitive advantage.\n\n### Competition & Funding\n\nCertain protocols and companies will rise to prominence and become incumbent organizations that are difficult to unseat. There are already several examples, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), a provider of crypto wallets and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), the most popular NFT marketplace.\n\nThe availability of funding through fungible tokens, NFTs, and community building, however, enables smaller organizations to raise the capital to execute on a product roadmap. Coupled with the ability to examine and deconstruct the technical foundation that the incumbents are built upon, newer organizations and protocols are on a significantly more level playing field than if they were competing against Web2/social web companies.\n\n# Productive Stealing - How Rising Tides Raise All Ships\n\nIt is logical to believe that organizations building in the Web3 ecosystem are at a disadvantage compared to their Web2 counterparts because their innovation is exposed. There are several examples, however, of both the original projects and their iterations succeeding side-by-side. This rejection of the [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) is a fundamental shift from social web thinking. In Web3, through “productive stealing,” win-win is the default position.\n\n> The open ecosystem native to Web3 not only promotes competition and user-centricity, but also enables competitors to learn from one another and succeed together by improving solutions and increasing the size of the entire market.\n\nAs projects continue to build on one another’s success, the innovation curve ramps up significantly and user experience improves, activating a flywheel that increases the size of the market, which in turn enables more successful projects and more innovation.\n\n#### The Web3 Market Growth Flywheel\n\n1. Original builders create value for users\n2. New teams deconstruct and build on those original solutions and protocols\n3. Product and solution user experiences improve enabling existing Web3 users to unlock additional value\n4. Web3 onboarding improves which enables more net new users to enter the market unlocking additional funding and customers for both original and new teams.\n\n## Projects & Derivatives - Examples\n\n### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nThree prominent examples of decentralized finance projects and the productive copies of those projects, known as “forks” or “derivatives,” are below.\n\n* [Klima DAO](https://klimadao.medium.com/klima-dao-ecosystem-climbing-olympus-3f6b3944b4c5) built off [Olympus](https://www.olympusdao.finance/)\n* [Wonderland](https://www.wonderland.money/) built off [Olympus](https://www.olympusdao.finance/)\n* [Sushi](https://medium.com/sushiswap-org/the-sushiswap-project-8716c429cee1) built off the [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) protocol\n\nThe projects listed above all have market capitalizations in the millions or billions of USD at the time of publication.\n\n![The Olympus DAO App Dashboard](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qQEqz8C3N2xJ6uphmGpEL.png?height=936&width=1918)\n\n![The Wonderland App Dashboard](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-B_fqu6Jt5rXtpxO1SWZh.png?height=933&width=1921)\n\nFor DeFi projects, the origin of the protocol or code-base is essentially irrelevant. Again, “productive stealing” benefits the entire ecosystem and all that matters is whether a solution is creating value for its users.\n\n### NFTs, Art, & The Creative Commons License\n\nSeveral NFT projects have also open-sourced their artwork and made it part of the public domain using the Creative Commons or [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/). One of the most notable examples of such a project is [CryptToadz by Gremplin](https://cryptoadz.io/). Because CrypToadz uses the Creative Commons license, other artists are able to create and sell what are known as derivative projects using the CrypToadz as inspiration or as a base for their new work.\n\nIn this case, the true competitive advantage for CrypToadz by Gremplin is the **provenance** of the original collection. The fact that the origin of the project is traceable and provable on the blockchain means there is no doubt when a user is interacting with the original CrypToadz by Gremplin or a derivative work.\n\n![CrypToadz #4503](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qXzadYv-jWVqi87C-QrSO.png?height=286&width=286)\n\n#### A Note on Attribution\n\nNo blanket rule or standard has emerged, but the common pattern among successful projects engaging in productive stealing is to simply acknowledge the origins of the solution through a blog post or Twitter thread. That’s it. Just like you learned in school - cite your sources and you’re covered.\n\n# So, What Does It All Mean?\n\nAlthough the expression of competitive advantage is different in Web3 than in the social web, companies and teams will still have the ability to create a tremendous amount of value for traditional stakeholders.\n\nOne critical difference, however, is that since user-centricity is baked into the protocols and building blocks of Web3 itself, users are no longer simple consumers of a product or service, but start to look more like those traditional stakeholders.\n\n> **Users will continue to be consumers of products and services, of course, but they will also be community members, investors, and decision-makers.**\n\nWhat are your thoughts on competitive advantage, user-centric products, and how Web3 will change companies, competition, and our lives?

There are several examples, however, of both the original projects and their iterations succeeding side-by-side. This rejection of the [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) is a fundamental shift from social web thinking. In Web3, through “productive stealing,” win-win is the default position.\n\n> The open ecosystem native to Web3 not only promotes competition and user-centricity, but also enables competitors to learn from one another and succeed together by improving solutions and increasing the size of the entire market.\n\nAs projects continue to build on one another’s success, the innovation curve ramps up significantly and user experience improves, activating a flywheel that increases the size of the market, which in turn enables more successful projects and more innovation.\n\n#### The Web3 Market Growth Flywheel\n\n1. Original builders create value for users\n2. New teams deconstruct and build on those original solutions and protocols\n3. Product and solution user experiences improve enabling existing Web3 users to unlock additional value\n4. Web3 onboarding improves which enables more net new users to enter the market unlocking additional funding and customers for both original and new teams.\n\n## Projects & Derivatives - Examples\n\n### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nThree prominent examples of decentralized finance projects and the productive copies of those projects, known as “forks” or “derivatives,” are below.\n\n* [Klima DAO](https://klimadao.medium.com/klima-dao-ecosystem-climbing-olympus-3f6b3944b4c5) built off [Olympus](https://www.olympusdao.finance/)\n* [Wonderland](https://www.wonderland.money/) built off [Olympus](https://www.olympusdao.finance/)\n* [Sushi](https://medium.com/sushiswap-org/the-sushiswap-project-8716c429cee1) built off the [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) protocol\n\nThe projects listed above all have market capitalizations in the millions or billions of USD at the time of publication.\n\n![The Olympus DAO App Dashboard](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qQEqz8C3N2xJ6uphmGpEL.png?height=936&width=1918)\n\n![The Wonderland App Dashboard](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-B_fqu6Jt5rXtpxO1SWZh.png?height=933&width=1921)\n\nFor DeFi projects, the origin of the protocol or code-base is essentially irrelevant. Again, “productive stealing” benefits the entire ecosystem and all that matters is whether a solution is creating value for its users.\n\n### NFTs, Art, & The Creative Commons License\n\nSeveral NFT projects have also open-sourced their artwork and made it part of the public domain using the Creative Commons or [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/). One of the most notable examples of such a project is [CryptToadz by Gremplin](https://cryptoadz.io/). Because CrypToadz uses the Creative Commons license, other artists are able to create and sell what are known as derivative projects using the CrypToadz as inspiration or as a base for their new work.\n\nIn this case, the true competitive advantage for CrypToadz by Gremplin is the **provenance** of the original collection. The fact that the origin of the project is traceable and provable on the blockchain means there is no doubt when a user is interacting with the original CrypToadz by Gremplin or a derivative work.\n\n![CrypToadz #4503](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qXzadYv-jWVqi87C-QrSO.png?height=286&width=286)\n\n#### A Note on Attribution\n\nNo blanket rule or standard has emerged, but the common pattern among successful projects engaging in productive stealing is to simply acknowledge the origins of the solution through a blog post or Twitter thread. That’s it. Just like you learned in school - cite your sources and you’re covered.\n\n# So, What Does It All Mean?\n\nAlthough the expression of competitive advantage is different in Web3 than in the social web, companies and teams will still have the ability to create a tremendous amount of value for traditional stakeholders.\n\nOne critical difference, however, is that since user-centricity is baked into the protocols and building blocks of Web3 itself, users are no longer simple consumers of a product or service, but start to look more like those traditional stakeholders.\n\n> **Users will continue to be consumers of products and services, of course, but they will also be community members, investors, and decision-makers.**\n\nWhat are your thoughts on competitive advantage, user-centric products, and how Web3 will change companies, competition, and our lives?

{"id": "WX0KefAcge8Yjgq2wVNsoSvsiHfx34kRMk0vzrJK1HI", "title": "Know Your Labels, Know Your Food", "body": "![via Squarespace](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FX9TcQI6hmbubFGrVx4ioA.png)\n\nThe first step to taking control of your health is understanding what you are consuming. Being able to walk into a grocery store and make choices that you know are right for your body (and understanding why!) is powerful.\n\nBut where do you even start? Everything- from veggies, to burgers, to granola bars — screams at you from the shelves. Their labels convince you why THIS is “the next best organic superfood” or THAT is the “most natural, local snack”. Educating ourselves on what these labels *really* mean, makes the choices you’re presented a lot more manageable.\n\nI’m going to walk you through the most common food and nutrition labels you’re bound to see on your next supermarket trip. Through my research writing this I was shocked at how sneaky and withholding many of these labels can be. While some of these explanations get a little nerdy, I hope they can help you feel more informed as to where your food is coming from.\n\n## **MEATS & POULTRY**\n\n**“Cage Free”** : This label is most commonly seen on poultry and egg packaging. As expected, it means that the birds are not caged. However, this *does not* guarantee that the birds were raised outside as many of us, including myself, assume. Poultry that was raised indoors, in dirty, crowded environments, can still have this label on the packaging!\n\n**“Free range” & “Free roaming”** : This label is only defined by the USDA for use on poultry and eggs. As long as birds have *access* to the outdoors, this label is applicable. Unfortunately, this does not guarantee that the majority of the birds’ life was lived outdoors. On top of that, this label does not ensure that the poultry and eggs are cruelty or antibiotic free.\n\n**“GMO-free” & “Non-GMO”** : You can find this label on meat, poultry and produce. It ensures that the food was produced without being genetically engineered through the use of GMO’s.\n\n**“Grain-fed”** : The most widely produced beef in the United States is grain-fed. While it is not the natural or humane diet for the cattle, grain-fed beef is said to provide a more tender and juicy product for the consumer. Be warned, however, that the grain mixture fed to cattle can contain animal by-products and growth hormones, if not otherwise labeled.\n\n**“Grass-fed”** : Honoring the natural diet of cows, more and more farmers are opting to grass-feed their cattle. This means that throughout the cows life they are not given grain, animal by-products, synthetic hormones or antibiotics (except in the case of disease). This provides the consumer with a leaner meat, that is lower in fat and calories. However, as we have come to learn, the label doesn’t often tell the whole story. Meat labeled “grass-fed” can still be “grain-finished”, meaning that right before slaughter they are fattened up with a grain diet. If you’re looking for a truly and completely grass-fed meat, be sure to check for a “grass-finished” label as well.\n\n**“Heritage”** : Although I haven’t purchased meat products in almost 4 years, I don’t ever recall seeing this label. That might be because this one is pretty uncommon — it means that the meat you’re buying comes from a rare & oftentimes an endangered breed of livestock. Industrial agriculture is aimed on increasing efficiency of farming, by narrowing the range of tasks and roles involved in production which has dramatically reduced breed variety. Heritage meats come from livestock that was protected from industrial agriculture and raised by farmers differently. Heritage meats are praised for being richer in taste (although they’re much higher in fat).\n\n**“Hormone-free”** : The USDA prohibits the use of hormones in both pigs and poultry. So, if you ever see bacon labeled “hormone-free”, you’re being duped to pay extra! This label applies only to cow products, and may also be phrased as “no hormones administered” or “no added hormones”.\n\n**“Natural”** : USDA guidelines for labeling meat/poultry “natural” are pretty tight. These products can only undergo minimal processing, meaning the meat has not been fundamentally altered. “Natural” meat cannot contain artificial colors, artificial flavors, preservatives or other artificial ingredients.\n\n**“Non-irradiated”** : Did you know that meat and veggies are sometimes exposed to radiation energy to kill disease-causing bacteria? I didn’t. This label means that the food inside has not undergone this process. Currently, no thorough testing has been done to know if irradiated food is safe for human consumption, so I’m curious to see what future research tells us about this procedure.\n\n**“Pasture-raised”** : This is the one I would choose! “Pastured-raised” products come from animals that were raised on a pasture, able to move around freely, and carry out their natural behaviors. The livestock was provided a natural, grazing diet of grasses and other plants, rather than being grain fed (but always look for that “grain-finished” label!) In my opinion, this is the most humane way to produce meat. If you’re going to eat animals, at least eat ones that were happy, right?\n\n**“rBGH-free” & “rBST-free”** : While I’ve listed this under meat and poultry, this is actually one you’ll find on milk. Recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) or recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST) are genetically engineered growth hormones injected into cows to artificially increase their milk production. While it hasn’t been tested for safety, it is outlawed in the EU, Canada & other countries.\n\n**“Organic”** : For this label to apply to meat and poultry, farmers must meet a couple of standards. Outdoor access to pasture must be accessible to livestock, and the animals must be sustained on 100% organic feed (this doesn’t mean a grass diet though!). On top of that, antibiotic and hormone use is prohibited.\n\n## **PRODUCE**\n\n**“Bioengineered”** : There are 13 foods available throughout the world that are bioengineered. This process, of modifying the food’s genetic material through certain techniques not found in nature, makes the crops more resistant to insect damage and infections, requiring fewer pesticides. Interestingly, this process can even up the nutrient content of the food! These 13 foods, and any others derived from them, must be labeled as “bioengineered”. The 13 foods are: alfalfa, apples, canola, corn, cotton, eggplant, papaya, pineapple, potatoes, salmon, soybeans, squash, and sugar beets.\n\n**“Certified naturally grown”** : This label is a great alternative for farmers who may find it expensive or time-consuming to get/maintain the USDA “organic” label (more on that process later). Simply put, produce with this label has been grown using responsible soil techniques, without the use of synthetic pesticides, and without genetically engineered seeds.\n\n**“Conventional”** : I stay far away from anything labeled “conventional”. Grown through industrial agriculture practices, this produce is grown using synthetic chemicals and genetically modified organisms (GMO’s). Additionally, industrial agriculture uses a farming technique known as *monocropping*, which is… just the worst. But that’s for another post.\n\n**“Fair Trade”** : An important one! This means that the farmers and workers responsible for growing and packaging the product have been paid fair wages and worked in acceptable conditions.\n\n**“Local”** : In general, this means that the food was grown within 100 miles of where you’re purchasing it! However, some states/counties have a stricter definition, only labeling food “local” if it came directly from a farmer or farmer’s market. FYI- these foods may still contain GMO’s!\n\n**“Natural”** : While meat and poultry have standards surrounding this label, things get a bit sketchier with produce and other foods. There are currently *no standards in existence* for labeling produce “natural”. How is that acceptable? Your guess is as good as mine. Be sure to look for any other identifying labels, or even dive into the ingredient/nutrition sheet if you’re looking for more information on what you’re buying!\n\n**“Organic”**: You might remember I mentioned that this label is quite a process for farmers to obtain. On produce, this label ensures that the food was not treated with synthetic fertilizers or pesticides, and kept away from any sewage sludge. But in order for farmers to obtain this label, these practices must be upheld for 3 years *prior* to certification, and then continually throughout. So “organic” labeled produce is a pretty safe choice, at least in my opinion!\n\nYou’ve probably noticed that many foods other then produce are often labeled “organic”. It all comes down to the ingredients:\n\n* If a product sports a USDA “organic” seal, it means that 95%-100% of the ingredients are organic.\n* If a product is labeled as containing “organic ingredients” 75%-95% of the ingredients meet requirements.\n* “Organic” milk and dairy products are rBGH-free.\n\nI’m sure there are many other labels out there, for a range of groceries. I chose to focus on these for the simple fact that they are what I see the most! As research continues, I’m sure we’ll see adjusted guidelines, and even new labelling systems all together.\n\nIf you take nothing away from this post, at least remember that food labels such as these almost never tell the full story of what you’re buying! It’s important to do the research, and take time to decide what aspects of how your food is grown, harvested and packaged is important to you.\n\n\n---\n\n*hey, i’m emma!  \n often found: watering my plants, doing handstands or reading in fuzzy socks. \n RYT-200, certified holistic health coach, & reiki 1 practitioner. \n you can find me on instagram ([@emmbodiment](https://www.instagram.com/emmbodiment/)) or at [emmbodiment.com](https://emmbodiment.com)* ", "timestamp": 1635298417, "digest": "VF4Qnsp1vtgtpQlVzz56Tiqv4OzraQpo4lt6P-mDD4g", "contributor": "0x6661475Bbe8b5138A0f918167A6Fb20395daa27D"}

Every week, my fellow doodlers and I submit ten cartoons each and occasionally, the New Yorker publishes one. That leaves a lot of funny stuff that no one gets to see.\n\nAbout No Filter Toons:\nMy cartoonist coworker Matt Diffee had the brilliant idea to make a collection of the best of these rejects, called “The Rejection Collection.” It featured New Yorker cartoons that were too dirty, dark, gross, weird, shocking, controversial, offensive, and down right crass for the magazine.

Diffee has been trying to publish a new third volume of rejected New Yorker cartoons, but in this climate, publishers are so afraid of internet mob retribution that they rejected my rejected cartoons and the rejects of many other talented artists for being too controversial to see the light of day—even in a collection calling them out as too racy.\n\nLet’s skirt this censorship by the mob and get these cartoons out there for people to enjoy their dirty, offensive, nasty, definitely-not-politically-correct jokes. We live in an unfair world, so let’s laugh at it.\n\nI’m going to distribute these cartoons as a a series of collectible, ownable NFTs. I’ll release one every Toonsday (Tuesday) for a year.

{"id": "PUr0QKVA3D49_1T_JBwWTlEqBL6FNKC6ytARkHjHwbo", "title": "Natively User-Centric - How Web3 & The Blockchain Put Users First", "body": "## Competitive Advantage Is Changing\n\nCompetitive advantage is what every business strives for - it’s the only thing that separates a company from the army camped outside its gates loading catapults and sharpening swords. In today’s market dominated by big tech firms like Google, Facebook, and Netflix, two significant categories of competitive advantage are prominent.\n\nThe first competitive advantage comes in the form of closely guarded algorithms and code-bases, protected by layers of corporate policy, IT security, and legal frameworks. The second is the massive amount of data generated by users. The people working at these companies are brilliant and the products these people develop are, without a doubt, excellent. But the problem is that **the user-centricity discussed in marketing copy and job postings is secondary to the maintenance of competitive advantage and market dominance.**\n\nWeb3, however, **unlocks and lays bare much of that competitive advantage** and it does so **in service of the user**. Web3 companies are concerned with solvency and generating profits, but the openness inherent to the protocols of Web3 means innovation is unleashed and the organizations that best serve the user will win. Full stop.\n\n## Execution, Community, & Web3 User-Centricity\n\nThough innovation will remain important, a company’s true competitive advantage in Web3 will be primarily tied to two factors - execution and community building.\n\n### Execution Over Algorithms\n\nExecution is a team’s ability to consistently and quickly bring to life their value proposition and the promises they make to users and customers. Since the blockchain and smart contracts are a matter of [public record](https://etherscan.io), innovative concepts and code can be used, reused, reformatted, manipulated, and deconstructed. Pieces and parts can be extracted and incorporated.\n\nYou don’t have to guess how something was implemented, you can look at the smart contract, at the actual building blocks used to create the solution immutably coded into the blockchain.\n\nThis sits in direct opposition to the closely-guarded secrets protected by social web companies. Rather than commit significant resources to research and development, and then even more resources to protecting that innovation, teams can closely examine market leaders and see what is working and what is not. When innovation is accessible and there is an inherent bias toward execution, users win.\n\n### Community Values Over Value Extraction\n\nCommunity is a team’s ability to convert customers to users and users to partners. In the Web3 world, particularly as it relates to smart contracts, the blockchain, and [DAOs](https://mirror.xyz/0xA121F5f12fe3D5567A333EEef2dce45945C0ECCF/-_U8Yx4k22Pg3TnqIE1tzi6TRhGuJCWQt98qczjTRhE), a customer’s stake in the success of a company will transcend the transactional relationship of old.\n\nRather than “I give you X currency or data and you give me Y that accomplishes Z,” the relationship for successful companies will look more like “I give you X, you not only give me access to Y that accomplishes Z, but also provide me with access to those who build the product, a say in the development of the product, and the ability to reap rewards from the future success of the product.”\n\nWhen the interaction between a company and its customers shifts away from value extraction and toward shared value, users win again.\n\n#### User-Owned Data Over User-Generated Content\n\nWeb2 companies own your data. Unfortunately that statement doesn’t require much more nuance or context. The content, pictures, and videos you post on Web2 social media apps or the “likes” you give to movies and shows on your favorite streaming service are owned by the platform, not by you. This simple fact is an important artifact of Web2 and is one of the areas in which Web3 can innovate significantly.\n\nThe blockchain will enable the development of platforms and protocols that put you in sole control of your data, allowing you to determine who can access your data, when they can access your data, and what they can do with that data. Web3 companies will find innovative ways to broker this data and unlock value for users that was previously extracted by large companies.\n\nDecentralizing control of user-generated data - or rather centralizing each user’s data into their own control - disrupts the second pillar of Web2 competitive advantage.\n\n### Competition & Funding\n\nCertain protocols and companies will rise to prominence and become incumbent organizations that are difficult to unseat. There are already several examples, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), a provider of crypto wallets and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), the most popular NFT marketplace.\n\nThe availability of funding through fungible tokens, NFTs, and community building, however, enables smaller organizations to raise the capital to execute on a product roadmap. Coupled with the ability to examine and deconstruct the technical foundation that the incumbents are built upon, newer organizations and protocols are on a significantly more level playing field than if they were competing against Web2/social web companies.\n\n# Productive Stealing - How Rising Tides Raise All Ships\n\nIt is logical to believe that organizations building in the Web3 ecosystem are at a disadvantage compared to their Web2 counterparts because their innovation is exposed. There are several examples, however, of both the original projects and their iterations succeeding side-by-side. This rejection of the [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) is a fundamental shift from social web thinking. In Web3, through “productive stealing,” win-win is the default position.\n\n> The open ecosystem native to Web3 not only promotes competition and user-centricity, but also enables competitors to learn from one another and succeed together by improving solutions and increasing the size of the entire market.\n\nAs projects continue to build on one another’s success, the innovation curve ramps up significantly and user experience improves, activating a flywheel that increases the size of the market, which in turn enables more successful projects and more innovation.\n\n#### The Web3 Market Growth Flywheel\n\n1. Original builders create value for users\n2. New teams deconstruct and build on those original solutions and protocols\n3. Product and solution user experiences improve enabling existing Web3 users to unlock additional value\n4. Web3 onboarding improves which enables more net new users to enter the market unlocking additional funding and customers for both original and new teams.\n\n## Projects & Derivatives - Examples\n\n### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nThree prominent examples of decentralized finance projects and the productive copies of those projects, known as “forks” or “derivatives,” are below.\n\n* [Klima DAO](https://klimadao.medium.com/klima-dao-ecosystem-climbing-olympus-3f6b3944b4c5) built off [Olympus](https://www.olympusdao.finance/)\n* [Wonderland](https://www.wonderland.money/) built off [Olympus](https://www.olympusdao.finance/)\n* [Sushi](https://medium.com/sushiswap-org/the-sushiswap-project-8716c429cee1) built off the [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) protocol\n\nThe projects listed above all have market capitalizations in the millions or billions of USD at the time of publication.\n\n![The Olympus DAO App Dashboard](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qQEqz8C3N2xJ6uphmGpEL.png?height=936&width=1918)\n\n![The Wonderland App Dashboard](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-B_fqu6Jt5rXtpxO1SWZh.png?height=933&width=1921)\n\nFor DeFi projects, the origin of the protocol or code-base is essentially irrelevant. Again, “productive stealing” benefits the entire ecosystem and all that matters is whether a solution is creating value for its users.\n\n### NFTs, Art, & The Creative Commons License\n\nSeveral NFT projects have also open-sourced their artwork and made it part of the public domain using the Creative Commons or [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/). One of the most notable examples of such a project is [CryptToadz by Gremplin](https://cryptoadz.io/). Because CrypToadz uses the Creative Commons license, other artists are able to create and sell what are known as derivative projects using the CrypToadz as inspiration or as a base for their new work.\n\nIn this case, the true competitive advantage for CrypToadz by Gremplin is the **provenance** of the original collection. The fact that the origin of the project is traceable and provable on the blockchain means there is no doubt when a user is interacting with the original CrypToadz by Gremplin or a derivative work.\n\n![CrypToadz #4503](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qXzadYv-jWVqi87C-QrSO.png?height=286&width=286)\n\n#### A Note on Attribution\n\nNo blanket rule or standard has emerged, but the common pattern among successful projects engaging in productive stealing is to simply acknowledge the origins of the solution through a blog post or Twitter thread. That’s it. Just like you learned in school - cite your sources and you’re covered.\n\n# So, What Does It All Mean?\n\nAlthough the expression of competitive advantage is different in Web3 than in the social web, companies and teams will still have the ability to create a tremendous amount of value for traditional stakeholders.\n\nOne critical difference, however, is that since user-centricity is baked into the protocols and building blocks of Web3 itself, users are no longer simple consumers of a product or service, but start to look more like those traditional stakeholders.\n\n> **Users will continue to be consumers of products and services, of course, but they will also be community members, investors, and decision-makers.**\n\nWhat are your thoughts on competitive advantage, user-centric products, and how Web3 will change companies, competition, and our lives?

{"id": "3n449nMWKb-JkrV6L2NFMSB9l5STYhqFgdhteeVdx8Y", "title": "5 Ways Blockchain Will Improve Your Life in the Future", "body": "While most people only see blockchain as a system that enables cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, researchers, entrepreneurs and governments are working “behind the scenes”, leveraging blockchain technology to change the world. In just a few short years since the launch of Bitcoin, thousands of research papers have been written in a race to explore the uses and impacts of this exciting technology. With an array of emerging tech such as AI, VR and IoT going through the “hype cycle” on an evermore regular basis, one can be forgiven for failing to grasp the enormity of blockchain’s potential to shift the world order and revolutionize the way we live.\n\n**Trust in blockchain**\n\nThere is no need to understand the technical details of how blockchain works to see how the technology’s main feature can impact us. \n\nThe blockchain represents an evolution in the way information can be stored, accessed and used. Ledgers have been an integral part of everyday life even if we don’t necessarily see them. They confirm our identity, our ownership of assets, our status and our authority among other things (Berg, Davidson, Potts 2017). This data is managed in ledgers by organisations and individuals to coordinate, verify and validate transactions. As members of society, we need to trust in the ledgers and the organisations that control them and we do so thanks to government regulations and structures.\n\nThe most important feature of blockchain as represented in this article is its ability to provide trust regardless of the parties involved in a transaction and without the need for any intermediary, whether governmental or otherwise (Oh, Wallsten 2018). Its decentralised nature has the inbuilt ability to gain consensus which makes it almost impossible for data to be deleted or corrupted.\n\n**Institutional Cryptoeconomics**\n\nAlthough the term may seem academic, the underlying concepts of institutional cryptoeconomics are simple to fathom and provide the theory that supports the claim that blockchain will be a disruptive force in our world. Institutional cryptoeconomics is based on institutional economics, a school of economics made popular by Ronald Coase and Oliver Williamson in the last century. They posit that it is more than supply and demand that dictate the price of goods and services as there are inherent costs within each transaction of the supply chain. The two main transaction costs are information and trust.\n\nThese costs arise because actors engaging in a trade are by nature opportunistic and self-serving. They want to get the best price or value and will take advantage of any situation to obtain it. To keep these costs at a manageable level, we have built institutions and societal structures to minimise our need to trust the other party in a transaction. We use banks, escrow agents, brokers, auditors, lawyers and countless other systems to allow us to trade. We have set up these expensive centralized entities because we can’t inherently trust others - and despite their expense, these systems do reduce the transaction costs and the price of goods and services. \n\nBut what if all of a sudden, we had a new way to establish trust? A transaction method that didn’t need banks, lawyers, brokers or auditors? What would that mean for our way of life? Yes, it could mean a huge shift in the labour market and the end of many institutions and structures but what would it mean to our everyday lives? What would it actually look like when blockchain technology has matured and is part of our world?\n\n**1. A world without banks**\n\nAs can be seen from the interest in Bitcoin and its ilk, the idea of a world without banks is appealing to many. Banks have been a vital element in society ever since there was trade. They have allowed us to form our way of life and become a highly advanced civilization. Banks have not only enabled the supply of capital, they have enabled trust and facilitated local, national and international transactions through their systems of rules and regulations.\n\nDespite banks’ current importance in our world, they add a huge cost to our transactions. This means that blockchain’s ability to allow parties to transact without the need for trust or intermediaries will become an existential threat to financial institutions everywhere.\n\nNo more bank queues, no more ATMs, no more financial collapses or scandals. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is becoming the new way for people to borrow and lend money with dozens of apps and companies launching in the last year alone. It remains to be seen how central banks will continue to regulate economies as new methods of trade appear but many of them are already on the case and exploring their options.\n\n**2. Cheap, renewable energy**\n\nWith climate change policy and renewable energy production being issues of global importance, everyone will welcome the idea that all the energy we need can be produced in our own neighborhoods for a fraction of the cost of the current supply. Advancements in small scale renewable energy plants and energy storage solutions mean that more and more, homes, businesses and communities are producing their own electricity. Most people still depend on connection to the main grid to guarantee supply however this need could be eradicated with the implementation of smart local grids that are powered by blockchain technology. \n\nSmart contracts will create a localised energy marketplace where consumers can also be suppliers and only pay if they use more than they produce. The loss of dependence on a huge supply chain obviously means massive cost savings for household budgets and the environment.\n\n**3. Cheaper, fresher products and services**\n\nAs consumers in the global economy, we are usually the end of the line for extensive supply chains for all manner of goods and services. The more complex the supply chain, the higher the transaction costs, which are of course passed on to us, the consumer.\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](//:0)\n\nIn fact, new forms of organisations will form that can out-compete traditional business structures which necessarily have many layers of trust-enabling functions (Davidson et al, 2018). In “*Trustless architecture and the V-form organisation”, *Berg, Davidson and Potts (2020) describe a V-form organisation as an “outsourced, vertically integrated organisation tied together not by management and corporate hierarchy but by distributed ledger technology” (p7). Whereas there are currently cost savings for a business to vertically integrate, the trust provided by the blockchain allows non-related businesses to share the benefits without the need for additional hierarchies.\n\n**4. Less crime and corruption**\n\nWhen implemented well, blockchain technology will make it very difficult to get away with fraud, theft, embezzlement or corruption. It might be still possible to commit these crimes but with the greater transparency, traceability and trackability afforded by blockchains, it becomes pointless to try as it is a sure thing that you will be caught.\n\nThe higher level of security and safety again reduces the cost of transactions as each stage of a supply chain no longer needs to factor in losses from crime to their price. Furthermore, the need for security systems, guards, police and legal structures are drastically minimized. Not only a saving for consumers but to society as a whole.\n\n**5. Lower taxes!**\n\nYes, I’ve saved the best for last. The purpose of government is to organise our societies through creating and enforcing regulations. As the greatest providers of trust, governments also add huge costs to our lives. Even the most ardent anti-capitalist would find it hard to disagree with reducing the size of government if we had technology to replace it. Of course we will not stop needing some form of government but one can hardly refute the amount of money to be saved if we have no further need for a large proportion of the government services we have now.\n\nRegulations will still be needed but can be built into the code of smart contracts on a blockchain. This means that it is not possible to act in contradiction to the regulation. Without the need for policing, investigating and auditing among many other activities, and along with the assets and management involved with the coordination of it all, a decrease in costs of government would obviously lead to the reduction of taxes (Davidson et al, 2018).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo even though it might be a number of years before blockchain has matured and is part of our world in this way, the potential benefits are too compelling for them to be ignored. You can be assured that thousands more research papers are being written, countless entrepreneurs are exploring opportunities and even governments, at risk of total transformation, are investigating how they can take advantage of blockchain technology.\n\nBlockchain’s potential impact has been compared with the digital transformation that has occurred with the advent of the Internet. In the early years of the world wide web, the Internet was described as an “information superhighway”. I also like the road analogy for blockchain and think it could be referred to as a “transaction superhighway”. If you can picture our current societal structures as regular city streets with endless intersections and obstacles, you can see that the cost of moving goods from one place to another is slow and expensive. Although it would be a huge investment to build a superhighway and it would involve knocking down houses and reorganising other existing infrastructure, the benefits to be gained will be there forevermore.\n\n**References**\n\nAllen, DWE, Berg, C, Markey-Towler, B, Novak, M & Potts, J 2020, “Blockchain and the evolution of institutional technologies: Implications for innovation policy,” Research Policy, vol. 49, no. 1, p. 103865, viewed 16 April 2021, \\<https\\://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/science/article/pii/S0048733319301842>.\n\nBerg, A, Markey‐Towler, B & Novak, M 2018, “Blockchains = Less Government, More Market,” SSRN Electronic Journal.\n\nBerg, C, Davidson, S & Potts, J 2017, “The Blockchain Economy: A beginner’s guide to institutional cryptoeconomics,” Medium, viewed \\<https\\://medium.com/cryptoeconomics-australia/the-blockchain-economy-a-beginners-guide-to-institutional-cryptoeconomics-64bf2f2beec4>.\n\nBerg, C, Davidson, S & Potts, J 2018, “Ledgers,” papers.ssrn.com, viewed \\<https\\://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3157421>.\n\nBerg, C, Davidson, S & Potts, J 2019, “Blockchain Technology as Economic Infrastructure: Revisiting the Electronic Markets Hypothesis,” Frontiers in Blockchain, vol. 2, viewed 16 April 2021, \\<https\\://www\\.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2019.00022/full>.\n\nBerg, C, Davidson, S & Potts, J 2020, “Trustless Architecture and the V-Form Organisation,” SSRN Electronic Journal, viewed 28 March 2021, \\<https\\://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3612419>.\n\nBoucher, P 2017, How blockchain technology could change our lives, European Parliament, viewed \\<https\\://www\\.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2017/581948/EPRS_IDA(2017)581948\\_EN.pdf>.\n\nDavidson, S, Novak, M & Potts, J 2018, “The Cost of Trust: A Pilot Study,” SSRN Electronic Journal.\n\nDemir, M, Turetken, O & Mashatan, A 2020, “An Enterprise Transformation Guide for the Inevitable Blockchain Disruption,” Computer, vol. 53, no. 6, pp. 34–43, viewed 15 April 2021, \\<https\\://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/document/9107300>.\n\nDuy, PT, Hien, DTT, Hien, DH & Pham, V-H 2018, “A survey on opportunities and challenges of Blockchain technology adoption for revolutionary innovation,” Proceedings of the Ninth International Symposium on Information and Communication Technology - SoICT 2018.\n\nHeister, S & Yuthas, K 2020, “The blockchain and how it can influence conceptions of the self,” Technology in Society, vol. 60, p. 101218, viewed 16 April 2021, \\<https\\://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/science/article/pii/S0160791X19301745>.\n\nHo, S., Wallsten, S.

You had a busy day at work. You didn’t finish that project you wanted to have done last week. You got stuck in traffic on the way home. Someone took your parking spot. You didn’t have time to go grocery shopping, so you had to throw together something less-than-ideal for dinner. You have a pile of laundry to be folded on your bed. You’re still thinking about that project. You’re stressed about how much work stresses you out. You really need to shower. Suddenly your phone rings, and your friend wants to meet up for last minute drinks. With your mind piled high, you let out an exasperated sigh and respond, “I can’t tonight, I’m *so stressed out*.”\n\n…But are you?\n\nOr are you overwhelmed? Overtired? Spread too thin?\n\nThat’s more like it.\n\nAs a society, we have grown accustomed to calling a vast range of emotions “stress”. And to a degree, that’s fair. Stress can be defined as “a feeling of emotional or physical tension as a result of a challenge or demand.” So when you’re feeling burned out, exhausted or depleted… sure, that misalignment can all fall under the umbrella of “stress”.\n\nBut leaving it at that is an utter disservice to ourselves. Calling all of our uncomfortable feelings “stress” doesn’t help us figure out where they came from or what we need to do to move on from them. It just blankets our feelings, justifying them in a socially-acceptable (dare I say, socially *expected?*) context.\n\nGetting to the root of the misalignment you’re experiencing is key.\n\nEarlier this year, I was introduced to Dr. Susan David and her work. She wrote the book *[Emotional Agility](https://www.susandavid.com/about-the-book/)*, and it has really resonated with me. Dr. David’s work focuses on identifying the *individual feelings* you’re experiencing when you are “stressed out”. She says that doing so arms you with a better understanding of your internal state.\n\nThink about it like this; if someone approached you and said “I’m so overtired”, you would probably tell them to go take a nap. If they said “I’m feeling overextended”, you might suggest they start saying no or offload whatever work they can.\n\nBut if someone came up to you and said “I’m stressed” … for many I think the initial thought would probably be “Well aren’t we all? I don’t know what to tell you, that’s part of life.”\n\nWhen we’re feeling these uncomfortable emotions, it’s important to find a resolution. This allows our body to complete the Stress Response Cycle, and move forward.\n\nYes, you read that right. Stress isn’t a feeling, it’s a biological cycle, intrinsic in our bodies. When we’re faced with a perceived threat (emotional, physical, real or not), our bodies are thrown into fight, flight or freeze — which you may remember from middle school biology class.\n\nWay back, when humans were hunter-gatherers, this cycle allowed the body to react quickly to say, a bear charging. While you’re (hopefully) not at risk of being chased by a bear at the grocery store, you might find yourself in a heated disagreement with an overtired cashier about the price of mangos. Stress today is pervasive and constant, stemming from numerous sources. And everytime the Stress Response Cycle is triggered, it needs to complete.\n\nHow can we do this? By specifically naming what and why we’re feeling, and moving towards a resolution that is specific to the situation.\n\nAnxiety lives in my chest. I feel loneliness in my head, right between my eyebrows. When I’m overtired I feel it in my ankles, when I am overworked I feel in my shoulder blades. Boredom I feel in my throat, like a pill that got stuck on the way down.\n\nAll these pieces that can make up “stress” probably feel different in your body. Maybe your palms get sweaty, maybe your feet get cold. Whatever signal you notice first, I encourage you to *listen to it.* Don’t just let it sit idle in your body. Take a moment, turn inward, and follow it to its source. From there, I promise, you’ll feel more prepared to find a resolution. Science supports this, and exercise, mindfulness, and meditation have been proven to aid the body in physically completing the Stress Response Cycle.\n\nDon’t be intimidated by my choice of words here; mindfulness simply means doing something thoughtfully. For example, maybe for you, baking your favorite dessert centers you and makes a busy day melt away. By tracking the “stress” you’re feeling on your commute home to the source, being overworked, you know that spending time in the kitchen will truly help you relax.\n\nNow, I’m not trying to pretend that teaching ourselves to say “I’m sad” instead of “I’m stressed” will suddenly free us of all tension and pressure. Stress, in every form, is always going to be a part of life. To a degree, I think that’s a good thing! Discomfort can be an extremely motivating force, *when we feel equipped to handle it*. Which is exactly what getting honest and specific about our feelings can do.\n\n\n---\n\n*hey, i’m emma! \n often found: watering my plants, doing handstands or reading in fuzzy socks. \n RYT-200, certified holistic health coach, & reiki 1 practitioner. \n you can find me on instagram ([@emmbodiment](https://www.instagram.com/emmbodiment/)) or at [emmbodiment.com](https://emmbodiment.com/)*", "timestamp": 1635299398, "digest": "Ou805BD_vmJIkDyLp1enYb8KRxAytOVAxypOEVC_5m0", "contributor": "0x6661475Bbe8b5138A0f918167A6Fb20395daa27D"}

Before adding ANY supplements, herbs, or other remedies to your diet, it is *vitally important to consult a physician to make sure it is the right choice for your body and health.*\n\n**Forehead**\n\nThe forehead is directly connected to both your liver and your gallbladder. As I mentioned above, too much alcohol or excessive fat consumption can cause oily, red breakouts here.\n\nMinimizing rich foods and alcoholic beverages is the first step you can take. However, in more intense cases, *Milk Thistle* or *Burdock Root* can help support both your liver and gallbladder. *Milk Thistle* is an herb in the daisy and ragweed family, most easily consumed in oil or supplement form. *Burdock Root* comes from the Burdock vegetable, and is often ground into a powder or used as a tea! You can often find both of these at your local health food store or online.\n\n**Between the eyebrows**\n\nKnown as the “third eye”, this area is said to connect you to your spiritual being…. But also your stomach and liver! Poor digestion and toxic buildup in the digestion tract can lead to blemishes here.\n\nIf you suffer from aggressive breakouts in this area, you may want to consider trying an elimination diet to figure out if you have any food intolerances. However, for the occasional zit, a gentle cleansing smoothie may help. Additionally, reducing caffeine, sugar and alcohol is always a helpful choice.\n\n**Temples and brow line**\n\nThis area offers us a glimpse into the state of the kidneys. On top of that, if you’ve been feeling dehydrated (one too many tequilas?) you may also notice breakouts here.\n\nAn obvious remedy- drink more water! However, superfoods such as kale, spinach, and berries can help as well.\n\n**Under the eyes**\n\nWhile acne under the eyes is not very common, many experience puffiness and dark circles, myself included. This is your stomach, kidneys, and liver asking for a little TLC.\n\nAlcohol, caffeine and sugar are the main contributors. However, your midnight snacks have a big effect too! Substituting processed foods or dairy products for fruits or grains can help you wake up in the morning with much less puff. In general, any snacks or meals high in sodium are best to cut down on if you’re experiencing bloating, in the face or in the body! Sodium dries you out, and to counterbalance that your body retains water, which causes major puffiness.\n\n**Bridge of the nose & upper cheek bones**\n\nThese areas are said to be connected to the heart. Though this is another place zits don’t often pop up, internal imbalances may present themselves here as rashes or discoloration.\n\nThe key to heart health is switching unhealthy, saturated fats for healthy fats, loaded with omega fatty acids. This helps the body boost your HDL (*high-density lipoprotein*, the “good cholesterol” which takes excess cholesterol in your blood and brings it back to your liver for processing) and reduces your LDL (*low dentistry lipoprotein*, the “bad cholesterol” which can build up in your blood vessels and cause clots/blockages). So, try putting avocado on your toast instead of butter or opt for salmon over sausage, and I bet you’ll see a difference here.\n\n**Mid-cheek**\n\nI struggle with acne here every year as the weather warms and the allergens appear. That’s because this area of the face is strongly connected to your lungs and stomach.\n\nAllergens; whether seasonal or dietary can cause major breakouts. Notice when you see acne or hyperpigmentation here, and consider what you’ve been putting (or breathing) into your body. Not sure what it could be? A good place to start is by reducing wheat and dairy, and upping plenty of detoxifying green vegetables such as artichokes, beets, broccoli and arugula.\n\n**Lower cheek, tip of the nose & around the mouth**\n\nThis area gets bossed around by the liver and stomach. Wrinkles and breakouts here can be linked to toxic buildup in the body, often caused by food intolerances.\n\nThat may sound like an overwhelming problem to solve, but a simple way to start is working some cleansing vegetable juice into your routine. There are so many delicious recipes available out there, it’s easier than ever to make a blend you actually enjoy! But if you’re in need of something more convenient, any store bought juice that is low in added sugar should do the trick. From there, I encourage you to pay attention to what foods make you feel “…bleh” and experiment with removing those from your diet.\n\n**Jawline**\n\nIt’s more common for women to see breakouts here, as this area is triggered by hormonal stress. However men, with an excess of testosterone, may see acne here as well.\n\nLadies, when menstruating, be sure to include a lot of hydrating foods into your diet. Cucumber, watermelon, and celery are my personal favorites. This helps the body naturally flush out hormonal oils that can buildup in the skin. On top of that, lean proteins such as fish, tofu and beans can help reduce fat-intake, which helps reduce PMS symptoms.\n\nLittle changes can go a long way when it comes to skincare. Simply working spinach into your morning smoothie or opting for a side of almonds instead of fries are easy changes that can bring a real difference.\n\nAll of that aside, what will bring the most beautiful glow to your skin is *being kind to yourself*. While a bump or mark might not be your favorite thing to wake up too — don’t forget, it’s normal. It happens to *everyone*. You are not defined by your skin, or any other aspect of your body for that matter! Though it may feel like it sometimes, a little pimple doesn’t take away from the uniquely magnificent beauty you bring to this world.\n\n\n---\n\n*hey, i’m emma! \n often found: watering my plants, doing handstands or reading in fuzzy socks. \n RYT-200, certified holistic health coach, & reiki 1 practitioner. \n you can find me on instagram ([@emmbodiment](https://www.instagram.com/emmbodiment/)) or at [emmbodiment.com](https://emmbodiment.com/)*", "timestamp": 1635299924, "digest": "dixh5pwmws5IY-ZFBcETy--JoQ9OBjpNa7qZBPw96b0", "contributor": "0x6661475Bbe8b5138A0f918167A6Fb20395daa27D"}

{"id": "pEC0vwjS4IrDviJk9jAxut-XUczfkYshldcxVgLoKoo", "title": "NFTs: A Primer for Newbies - a.k.a. Equity Ownership of Anything, and a New Digital World", "body": "## Introduction\n\nThe world of crypto and NFTs are exploding [for the 4th](https://a16z.com/2020/05/15/the-crypto-price-innovation-cycle/) and 1st times, respectively. I wrote this primer on the history and technical basics of NFTs for anyone with little or no background on the topic. The space moves quickly, so treat this piece as a cultural relic - have a read if you are building a systems-level understanding and take that understanding forward to explore the latest stuff! 😇 \n\n## Definition of NFTs\n\nA non-fungible token, or \"NFT\", is a unique digital asset. Consider \"fungible\" assets, like bitcoin or a US Dollar: all bitcoins and US Dollars are non-unique and interchangeable. In contrast, an example of a non-fungible asset would be a unique, one-of-a-kind piece of art (2).\n\nNFTs can be used to register any digital assets on a blockchain. These assets could include, but are not limited to art, music, tickets, property, and more. What makes something an NFT is its encoding as part of the Ethereum blockchain. Most NFTs are today built on Ethereum, though some other blockchains implement their own versions of NFTs (1).\n\n## A Brief History of NFTs\n\n**2012-13 Colored Coins**\n\nOne of the earliest attempts to use a cryptocurrency to denote and verify real-world assets on the blockchain was Colored Coins. Colored Coins are equivalent to small denominations of bitcoin, as small as a single satoshi (the smallest unit of a bitcoin). Colored Coins were mentioned in a few blog posts and papers in 2012-13 by various authors including Yoni Assia, Meni Rosenfeld, Vitalik Buterin, and Lior Hakim. Colored Coins could be used to represent property, coupons, issue shares of a company, and act as digital collectibles or access tokens. However, there was one main limitation: the Colored Coins only represented a certain value if everyone agreed to their worth. Thus, they may be thought of as one of the first explorations of putting real-world assets onto distributed ledgers, but was far from foolproof.\n\n**2014-17 Counterparty, Spells of Genesis, Force of Will trading cards, and Rare Pepes**\n\nBetween 2014-16, Counterparty was founded as a peer-to-peer financial platform and distributed, open-source Internet protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, with use cases such as a trading card game. In 2016, popular trading card game, Force of Will, then the 4th largest trading card game (following behind Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Magic: The Gathering in North American sales), launched their cards on the Counterparty platform. This was another leap forward in putting assets on a blockchain. Around the same time, Counterparty users began creating a collection of memes, called \"[rare pepes](https://rare-pepe.com/)\", featuring a frog character. These memes were traded on Counterparty, built on the blockchain protocol, as well as on the Ethereum blockchain through a project named \"Peperium\", created in March 2017.\n\n**2017 CryptoPunks**\n\nIn June 2017, two individuals created a new NFT project on the Ethereum blockchain, \"[CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)\": a collection of 10,000 unique characters generated through random combinations of visual features (e.g., beard, sunglasses, skin tone, hairstyles, and other attributes). CryptoPunks were initially offered to anyone with an Ethereum wallet to claim for free, and quickly gave rise to a secondary marketplace where people bought and sold them for hundreds, then thousands, and now, millions of dollars. The most valuable CryptoPunk as of late summer 2021 was CryptoPunk #7523 which was auctioned by Sotheby's in July 2021 and sold for $11.75M at the ETH-to-USD exchange rate of the time.\n\n**2017 ERC271 and CryptoKitties**\n\n[CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/search?include=sale) is a virtual game that allows players to adopt, raise, and trade virtual cats, all on the blockchain. CryptoKitties took another big leap in making NFTs mainstream because they were all over the news as a \"digital cat\" or \"digital beanie babies\" that you can buy and trade with cryptocurrency. Some virtual cats sold for over $100,000.\n\nCryptoKitties were created by a Vancouver-based company called Axiom Zen and revealed at the ETH Waterloo Hackathon, the world's largest Ethereum hackathon. After the release of CryptoKitties, which coincided with the 2017 crypto bull market that saw bitcoin rise in value from $900 to $20,000 between December 2016 and December 2017. Axiom Zen spun out a company called [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), which raised $15M from a16z and Google Ventures (and much more since then), and remains today as one of the leading players in the NFT space, as the company partnering with the NBA to launch [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) collectible digital assets.\n\n**2018-19 Growing in the Background**\n\nThe NFT ecosystem continued to grow slowly, with marketplaces like OpenSea, SuperRare, Rarible, Nifty Gateway, and many more online platforms used to buy and sell NFTs.\n\nWeb3 wallets like Metamask made it easier to purchase and own NFTs.\n\nSome additional names from this era below courtesy of crypto newsletter [The Block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/).\n\n![Many of these players are present today; some have disappeared, and many more have entered!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tf4zc3LOGGNBlFZQQme-y.png?height=348&width=630)\n\n**2020-21 Explosion in the Consumer Mainstage**\n\nNFT assets grew from $40.9M in 2018 to $338M in 2020, with 150,000 total individuals participating in the NFT market, according to enthusiast-started market information site [Nonfungible.com](http://nonfungible.com), which also estimated the breakdown of NFT-related activities as follows: 25% metaverses, 24% art, 23% gaming, 13% sport, 11% collectibles, and 4% utility-based (6).\n\nIn September of 2021 alone, NFT asset sales totaled $2B in transaction volume.\n\nMany more notable projects were launched during this time, which I won't describe in detail, including: [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/home) (a profile picture & community project); [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/) (a simple drop of text files that catalyzed hundreds of projects building on top of the concept); and [RTFKT](https://rtfkt.com/) (a sneaker and metaverse brand).\n\nFor a more in-depth overview of the various categories of NFTs, I enjoyed this [Beginner's Guide to NFTs](https://www.notion.so/cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d), by Linda Xie of Scalar Capital.\n\n## Technical Background & Capabilities\n\nBefore I get to the business applications of NFTs, below is an overview of how the underlying blockchain technology works. Feel free to read, skim, or skip this section.\n\n**How Blockchains Work**\n\nNFTs historically, and most NFTs today, build upon the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain is a decentralized public ledger, similar to the Bitcoin blockchain. One of the important underlying mechanisms of the blockchain is the consensus algorithm, or the algorithm by which users are able to agree on the history of transactions and current state of a blockchain without reliance on a central authority (13).\n\nBitcoin was the first to solve this problem using a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system. Ethereum uses the same mechanism right now, though it is highly computationally intense and energy-inefficient, and Ethereum is soon transitioning to a more efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) method.\n\nIn order to maintain accuracy in a decentralized network, each time someone wants to make a transaction on a blockchain, other members of that blockchain ecosystem are asked to verify that transaction (more precisely, a group of transactions called a \"block\") as legitimate. One method is PoW, and relies on a consensus algorithm, where participating members (\"miners\") solve difficult math problems and publish the solutions with the goal of arriving at a consensus. These problems are computationally intensive and require real-world resources like computers and electricity. Miners are rewarded for arriving at the consensus solution and receive the currency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other currency of that Blockchain) generated in that block. This enables verification in a decentralized network because the only way to commit fraud would be to control enough total computing power that you can put forth your solution as the overwhelming consensus, implying that other users are misrepresenting the current state of the blockchain. Due to the magnitude of miners, PoW is expensive (in a real-world sense, due to high usage of electricity and computers) and controlling enough resources to outnumber enough other miners is expensively infeasible.\n\n**ERC-721 and NFT technologies**\n\nThe ERC-721 is an Ethereum Standard for NFTs, meaning that these NFTs are built on the Ethereum blockchain. The main feature of ERC-721 is that each Token is unique and can have a different value from other Tokens from the same Smart Contract. Smart contracts are programs that live and run on the blockchain and create and govern NFTs or decentralized apps. Mechanically, all NFTs have a `uint256` variable called `tokenId` and for any ERC-721 Contract, the pair `contract address`, `tokenId` must be globally unique. Then, a dApp can have a \"converter\" that uses the `tokenId` as input and outputs a range of media type, including an image, music, or more.\n\nThe ERC-721 standard is used widely for NFTs today and was originally proposed in January 2018 by William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs.\n\nAs NFTs have grown in popularity, some companies use private blockchains to power NFTs. In particular, Flow, operated by Dapper labs (and supporting NBA Top Shot) is devoted to NFT transactions and can be more efficient. (Though the very nature of private blockchains is somewhat counterculture to the original purpose of a decentralized network as a place where anyone can make transactions without oversight by any one institution).\n\n## Business Capabilities, and Why NFTs Represent a New Possibility Frontier in Crypto\n\nCryptocurrencies have always been traded, their value determined by supply and demand, as a currency. However, NFTs represent a difference in that the value of each token is not based on supply and demand for a commodity or currency, but rather, ownership (partial or fully) of an asset represented by each token.\n\n**NFTs in Collectibles**\n\nClearly, we have already seen the possibilities of NFTs as collectibles - from the $100,000+ CryptoKitties to $11M+ CryptoPunk to a Top Shot 2019-2020 LeBron James dunk moment, to of course, Beeple's art collection sold for $69M (7). At the high end, this market seems likely to continue for as long as the crypto nouveau-riche have their riches - driven by a powerful combination of the pursuit of social status and financial investing. In addition, some believe that players like NBA Top Shot and Autograph are bringing in the non-crypto audience as well.\n\n**NFTs in Art**\n\nArt can be thought of as a subset of collectibles, or at least at the intersection of the Venn Diagram between collectibles and art in its purest form - an expression and appreciation of human creativity. Art \"minted\" as NFTs means that the art has a digital representation on the Ethereum blockchain (\"minting\" is the act of adding representation for that artwork on the Ethereum public ledger) (9).\n\nPerhaps the significance of the NFT ecosystem for artwork is the ability to now buy and sell art - particularly digital art - with greater ease, confidence in its verification, and upside in its value thanks to the scarcity feature of NFTs and the thriving crypto wealth and ecosystem springing up around digital artwork.\n\nNFTs have a feature that enable the original artist to receive a percentage of sales every time the NFT is sold, or resold. This could mean that artists, for the first time, can get tangible value from their artwork as it trades hands.\n\nJust last week, [a friend of mine](https://twitter.com/_alexmaceda_) posted on Twitter that an anonymous collector had purchased ALL \\~two dozen of her paintings via NFT artwork marketplace, OpenSea. Without the NFT and crypto capital, it is hard to imagine where, to whom, or how she would have sold this artwork. However, now, her ability to earn income as an artist is significantly higher with an entire new world of crypto capital and digital patrons anywhere.\n\nEven more interesting is the intersection of traditional art and digital, programmatically generated art. Cryptopunks fall in this category as each Cryptopunk was generated algorithmically based on a set of traits; each trait had a certain number of variations and varying levels of rarity. More recently, in 2021, the creators of Cryptopunks created Meebits, using the same method, a custom generative algorithm.\n\n**NFTs in Gaming**\n\nCertain early pioneers of mobile games, such as Machine Zone CEO Leydon, believe NFTs have huge potential in gaming (8). As one illustration, games traditionally make significant revenue from in-game purchases (e.g., of weapons, character customizations, or other benefits). However, when someone stops logging into a game, the items they bought no longer have value. Imagine if players could then sell their items and make money, or bring their items across games into another game. Moreover, the players of a game were beholden the game creators - players had to follow game rules and received none of the value or revenues generated by the game. In a world of NFTs, a game in which players can buy NFTs used in the game (e.g., plots of land) means that suddenly, the players become owners and investors in the game.\n\n**NFTs as Access Tokens**\n\nAnother use case of NFTs is to give NFT-holders the ability to access certain experiences, products, or services - and transact that access. Imagine a celebrity wants to issue an NFT-based membership program to offer exclusive products, musical drops, or experiences to their fans. A fan could purchase an NFT access token and enjoy the offerings, as well as sell that NFT in the future when they no longer want to consume the offerings, or perhaps if the value of that artist's token has increased significantly and the fan wishes to sell the access token for a profit.\n\nFor example, one startup, Centerstage, is a digital events platform where seats are sold as NFTs. Users create online stadiums use the revenue from NFT seat sales to book artists to perform. NFT seat holders can then trade NFTs based on upcoming artists or hold onto their own seats and watch every show.\n\n**NFTs as Equity Ownership (in Music, Writing, and what's next?)**\n\nTo me, one of the most consequential implications of NFTs is the paradigm shift they have brought about - where anything digital can be owned, accrue financial meaning and value, and therefore become a new financial asset.\n\nAs an example, [Mirror.xyz](http://mirror.xyz) (where I have published this article!) is a platform where writers can offer pieces of writing as NFTs. You can actually buy (and trade, and display!) fractional ownership in a piece of writing to indicate support of the writer, agreement with the ideas, or for any other reason. Patrons who purchase an NFT associated with a particular piece of writing then display those NFTs on their profile. Similarly, [Royal.io](http://royal.io) is a music platform co-founded by DJ and early NFT enthusiast Justin Blau with serial entrepreneur JD Ross, where listeners can buy ownership in songs directly from artists and earn royalties alongside them. Thus, if a reader is a big fan of a certain piece of work or a creator, or a listener is a big fan of an artist, they now have a means of showcasing and supporting the work **not only for the benefit of the creator, but also for the social and financial gain of the patron.**\n\nIf the the prior generation of \"Patreon\"-style creator economy focused on giving fans a direct way of monetarily supporting creators, the new NFT economy represents a paradigm shift where anything can be turned into an asset and both user/fan/audience and creator can take part in the financial, equity ownership and financial appreciation of that asset.\n\n## Controversy & Criticism: The intangible nature of NFTs and The Climate Impact\n\n**NFTs don't actually come with rights to the artwork, just a digital representation**\n\nOne of the earliest experimenters with NFTs recently warned that spammers have been taking copies of famous artwork and selling them as NFTs (10). NFTs don't come with the artwork itself - even when the artwork is fully digital, the NFT doesn't have enough space to store the full details of an image; instead, an NFT typically points to an https URI address (uniform resource identifier, similar to a URL) or an IPFS address (powered by the InterPlanetary File System, a blockchain-based file storage provider) or includes a mathematical compression of the work (e.g., a checksum) to prove the work's identity.\n\n**NFTS are accused of being environmentally unethical**\n\nOne loud and growing criticism of NFTs are the environmental impacts. ArtStation, an online marketplace for digital artists, was met with fast backlash on Twitter hours after it announced plans to launch a platform for NFTs. Artists protested the \"ecological nightmare\" of NFTs and ArtStation scrapped its plans (11).\n\nSome argue that the greater the demand for NFTs, the greater the motivation for miners to continue their energy-intensive mining activities. The crypto world seems to believe that the upcoming move of Ethereum 2.0, using a PoS instead of PoW method, could be a solution to this problem. In addition, innovators are exploring solutions such as alternate blockchains or private chains which already use PoS methods, side chains that verify NFT transactions without using the main, expensive Ethereum chain, and interchain operability allowing interactions across NFTs built on any blockchain.\n\nIt will be interesting to see where, across all these options, NFT creators, collectors, and consumers end up over time.\n\n## A Few Conclusions: NFTs as Equity Ownership of Anything, and Ushering in the Digital New World\n\nNFTs have evolved gradually over the last many years and certainly exploded in the last 12 months. This was likely due to a combination of factors: the pandemic confining consumers much more so to digital experiences; the global macro environment, between financial heat-up in the stock markets and low interest rates, leading to significant capital seeking new assets to generate returns; the crypto ballooning in market size, from \\~$200B to $800B+ from 2019 to 2021 in bitcoin alone (14).\n\nRegardless of where the zealous interest and capital has come from, one thing is for sure: the popularity of NFTs has created a zeitgeist and permanent paradigm shift in business models. Namely:\n\n1. NFTs enable the creation of **equity ownership** in **anything**, while\n2. greatly reducing the friction and increasing the acceptance of valuing, owning, and trading digital assets.\n\nGiven the amount of interest and economy value the NFT economy has created, this paradigm is likely here to stay.\n\n\n---\n\nThis piece was originally written for my Stanford independent research project.

Equity Ownership of Anything, and a New Digital World", "body": "## Introduction\n\nThe world of crypto and NFTs are exploding [for the 4th](https://a16z.com/2020/05/15/the-crypto-price-innovation-cycle/) and 1st times, respectively. I wrote this primer on the history and technical basics of NFTs for anyone with little or no background on the topic. The space moves quickly, so treat this piece as a cultural relic - have a read if you are building a systems-level understanding and take that understanding forward to explore the latest stuff! 😇 \n\n## Definition of NFTs\n\nA non-fungible token, or \"NFT\", is a unique digital asset. Consider \"fungible\" assets, like bitcoin or a US Dollar: all bitcoins and US Dollars are non-unique and interchangeable. In contrast, an example of a non-fungible asset would be a unique, one-of-a-kind piece of art (2).\n\nNFTs can be used to register any digital assets on a blockchain. These assets could include, but are not limited to art, music, tickets, property, and more. What makes something an NFT is its encoding as part of the Ethereum blockchain. Most NFTs are today built on Ethereum, though some other blockchains implement their own versions of NFTs (1).\n\n## A Brief History of NFTs\n\n**2012-13 Colored Coins**\n\nOne of the earliest attempts to use a cryptocurrency to denote and verify real-world assets on the blockchain was Colored Coins. Colored Coins are equivalent to small denominations of bitcoin, as small as a single satoshi (the smallest unit of a bitcoin). Colored Coins were mentioned in a few blog posts and papers in 2012-13 by various authors including Yoni Assia, Meni Rosenfeld, Vitalik Buterin, and Lior Hakim. Colored Coins could be used to represent property, coupons, issue shares of a company, and act as digital collectibles or access tokens. However, there was one main limitation: the Colored Coins only represented a certain value if everyone agreed to their worth. Thus, they may be thought of as one of the first explorations of putting real-world assets onto distributed ledgers, but was far from foolproof.\n\n**2014-17 Counterparty, Spells of Genesis, Force of Will trading cards, and Rare Pepes**\n\nBetween 2014-16, Counterparty was founded as a peer-to-peer financial platform and distributed, open-source Internet protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, with use cases such as a trading card game. In 2016, popular trading card game, Force of Will, then the 4th largest trading card game (following behind Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Magic: The Gathering in North American sales), launched their cards on the Counterparty platform. This was another leap forward in putting assets on a blockchain. Around the same time, Counterparty users began creating a collection of memes, called \"[rare pepes](https://rare-pepe.com/)\", featuring a frog character. These memes were traded on Counterparty, built on the blockchain protocol, as well as on the Ethereum blockchain through a project named \"Peperium\", created in March 2017.\n\n**2017 CryptoPunks**\n\nIn June 2017, two individuals created a new NFT project on the Ethereum blockchain, \"[CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)\": a collection of 10,000 unique characters generated through random combinations of visual features (e.g., beard, sunglasses, skin tone, hairstyles, and other attributes). CryptoPunks were initially offered to anyone with an Ethereum wallet to claim for free, and quickly gave rise to a secondary marketplace where people bought and sold them for hundreds, then thousands, and now, millions of dollars. The most valuable CryptoPunk as of late summer 2021 was CryptoPunk #7523 which was auctioned by Sotheby's in July 2021 and sold for $11.75M at the ETH-to-USD exchange rate of the time.\n\n**2017 ERC271 and CryptoKitties**\n\n[CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/search?include=sale) is a virtual game that allows players to adopt, raise, and trade virtual cats, all on the blockchain. CryptoKitties took another big leap in making NFTs mainstream because they were all over the news as a \"digital cat\" or \"digital beanie babies\" that you can buy and trade with cryptocurrency. Some virtual cats sold for over $100,000.\n\nCryptoKitties were created by a Vancouver-based company called Axiom Zen and revealed at the ETH Waterloo Hackathon, the world's largest Ethereum hackathon. After the release of CryptoKitties, which coincided with the 2017 crypto bull market that saw bitcoin rise in value from $900 to $20,000 between December 2016 and December 2017. Axiom Zen spun out a company called [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), which raised $15M from a16z and Google Ventures (and much more since then), and remains today as one of the leading players in the NFT space, as the company partnering with the NBA to launch [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) collectible digital assets.\n\n**2018-19 Growing in the Background**\n\nThe NFT ecosystem continued to grow slowly, with marketplaces like OpenSea, SuperRare, Rarible, Nifty Gateway, and many more online platforms used to buy and sell NFTs.\n\nWeb3 wallets like Metamask made it easier to purchase and own NFTs.\n\nSome additional names from this era below courtesy of crypto newsletter [The Block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/).\n\n![Many of these players are present today; some have disappeared, and many more have entered!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tf4zc3LOGGNBlFZQQme-y.png?height=348&width=630)\n\n**2020-21 Explosion in the Consumer Mainstage**\n\nNFT assets grew from $40.9M in 2018 to $338M in 2020, with 150,000 total individuals participating in the NFT market, according to enthusiast-started market information site [Nonfungible.com](http://nonfungible.com), which also estimated the breakdown of NFT-related activities as follows: 25% metaverses, 24% art, 23% gaming, 13% sport, 11% collectibles, and 4% utility-based (6).\n\nIn September of 2021 alone, NFT asset sales totaled $2B in transaction volume.\n\nMany more notable projects were launched during this time, which I won't describe in detail, including: [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/home) (a profile picture & community project); [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/) (a simple drop of text files that catalyzed hundreds of projects building on top of the concept); and [RTFKT](https://rtfkt.com/) (a sneaker and metaverse brand).\n\nFor a more in-depth overview of the various categories of NFTs, I enjoyed this [Beginner's Guide to NFTs](https://www.notion.so/cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d), by Linda Xie of Scalar Capital.\n\n## Technical Background & Capabilities\n\nBefore I get to the business applications of NFTs, below is an overview of how the underlying blockchain technology works. Feel free to read, skim, or skip this section.\n\n**How Blockchains Work**\n\nNFTs historically, and most NFTs today, build upon the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain is a decentralized public ledger, similar to the Bitcoin blockchain. One of the important underlying mechanisms of the blockchain is the consensus algorithm, or the algorithm by which users are able to agree on the history of transactions and current state of a blockchain without reliance on a central authority (13).\n\nBitcoin was the first to solve this problem using a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system. Ethereum uses the same mechanism right now, though it is highly computationally intense and energy-inefficient, and Ethereum is soon transitioning to a more efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) method.\n\nIn order to maintain accuracy in a decentralized network, each time someone wants to make a transaction on a blockchain, other members of that blockchain ecosystem are asked to verify that transaction (more precisely, a group of transactions called a \"block\") as legitimate. One method is PoW, and relies on a consensus algorithm, where participating members (\"miners\") solve difficult math problems and publish the solutions with the goal of arriving at a consensus. These problems are computationally intensive and require real-world resources like computers and electricity. Miners are rewarded for arriving at the consensus solution and receive the currency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other currency of that Blockchain) generated in that block. This enables verification in a decentralized network because the only way to commit fraud would be to control enough total computing power that you can put forth your solution as the overwhelming consensus, implying that other users are misrepresenting the current state of the blockchain. Due to the magnitude of miners, PoW is expensive (in a real-world sense, due to high usage of electricity and computers) and controlling enough resources to outnumber enough other miners is expensively infeasible.\n\n**ERC-721 and NFT technologies**\n\nThe ERC-721 is an Ethereum Standard for NFTs, meaning that these NFTs are built on the Ethereum blockchain. The main feature of ERC-721 is that each Token is unique and can have a different value from other Tokens from the same Smart Contract. Smart contracts are programs that live and run on the blockchain and create and govern NFTs or decentralized apps. Mechanically, all NFTs have a `uint256` variable called `tokenId` and for any ERC-721 Contract, the pair `contract address`, `tokenId` must be globally unique. Then, a dApp can have a \"converter\" that uses the `tokenId` as input and outputs a range of media type, including an image, music, or more.\n\nThe ERC-721 standard is used widely for NFTs today and was originally proposed in January 2018 by William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs.\n\nAs NFTs have grown in popularity, some companies use private blockchains to power NFTs. In particular, Flow, operated by Dapper labs (and supporting NBA Top Shot) is devoted to NFT transactions and can be more efficient. (Though the very nature of private blockchains is somewhat counterculture to the original purpose of a decentralized network as a place where anyone can make transactions without oversight by any one institution).\n\n## Business Capabilities, and Why NFTs Represent a New Possibility Frontier in Crypto\n\nCryptocurrencies have always been traded, their value determined by supply and demand, as a currency. However, NFTs represent a difference in that the value of each token is not based on supply and demand for a commodity or currency, but rather, ownership (partial or fully) of an asset represented by each token.\n\n**NFTs in Collectibles**\n\nClearly, we have already seen the possibilities of NFTs as collectibles - from the $100,000+ CryptoKitties to $11M+ CryptoPunk to a Top Shot 2019-2020 LeBron James dunk moment, to of course, Beeple's art collection sold for $69M (7). At the high end, this market seems likely to continue for as long as the crypto nouveau-riche have their riches - driven by a powerful combination of the pursuit of social status and financial investing. In addition, some believe that players like NBA Top Shot and Autograph are bringing in the non-crypto audience as well.\n\n**NFTs in Art**\n\nArt can be thought of as a subset of collectibles, or at least at the intersection of the Venn Diagram between collectibles and art in its purest form - an expression and appreciation of human creativity. Art \"minted\" as NFTs means that the art has a digital representation on the Ethereum blockchain (\"minting\" is the act of adding representation for that artwork on the Ethereum public ledger) (9).\n\nPerhaps the significance of the NFT ecosystem for artwork is the ability to now buy and sell art - particularly digital art - with greater ease, confidence in its verification, and upside in its value thanks to the scarcity feature of NFTs and the thriving crypto wealth and ecosystem springing up around digital artwork.\n\nNFTs have a feature that enable the original artist to receive a percentage of sales every time the NFT is sold, or resold. This could mean that artists, for the first time, can get tangible value from their artwork as it trades hands.\n\nJust last week, [a friend of mine](https://twitter.com/_alexmaceda_) posted on Twitter that an anonymous collector had purchased ALL \\~two dozen of her paintings via NFT artwork marketplace, OpenSea. Without the NFT and crypto capital, it is hard to imagine where, to whom, or how she would have sold this artwork. However, now, her ability to earn income as an artist is significantly higher with an entire new world of crypto capital and digital patrons anywhere.\n\nEven more interesting is the intersection of traditional art and digital, programmatically generated art. Cryptopunks fall in this category as each Cryptopunk was generated algorithmically based on a set of traits; each trait had a certain number of variations and varying levels of rarity. More recently, in 2021, the creators of Cryptopunks created Meebits, using the same method, a custom generative algorithm.\n\n**NFTs in Gaming**\n\nCertain early pioneers of mobile games, such as Machine Zone CEO Leydon, believe NFTs have huge potential in gaming (8). As one illustration, games traditionally make significant revenue from in-game purchases (e.g., of weapons, character customizations, or other benefits). However, when someone stops logging into a game, the items they bought no longer have value. Imagine if players could then sell their items and make money, or bring their items across games into another game. Moreover, the players of a game were beholden the game creators - players had to follow game rules and received none of the value or revenues generated by the game. In a world of NFTs, a game in which players can buy NFTs used in the game (e.g., plots of land) means that suddenly, the players become owners and investors in the game.\n\n**NFTs as Access Tokens**\n\nAnother use case of NFTs is to give NFT-holders the ability to access certain experiences, products, or services - and transact that access. Imagine a celebrity wants to issue an NFT-based membership program to offer exclusive products, musical drops, or experiences to their fans. A fan could purchase an NFT access token and enjoy the offerings, as well as sell that NFT in the future when they no longer want to consume the offerings, or perhaps if the value of that artist's token has increased significantly and the fan wishes to sell the access token for a profit.\n\nFor example, one startup, Centerstage, is a digital events platform where seats are sold as NFTs. Users create online stadiums use the revenue from NFT seat sales to book artists to perform. NFT seat holders can then trade NFTs based on upcoming artists or hold onto their own seats and watch every show.\n\n**NFTs as Equity Ownership (in Music, Writing, and what's next?)**\n\nTo me, one of the most consequential implications of NFTs is the paradigm shift they have brought about - where anything digital can be owned, accrue financial meaning and value, and therefore become a new financial asset.\n\nAs an example, [Mirror.xyz](http://mirror.xyz) (where I have published this article!) is a platform where writers can offer pieces of writing as NFTs. You can actually buy (and trade, and display!) fractional ownership in a piece of writing to indicate support of the writer, agreement with the ideas, or for any other reason. Patrons who purchase an NFT associated with a particular piece of writing then display those NFTs on their profile. Similarly, [Royal.io](http://royal.io) is a music platform co-founded by DJ and early NFT enthusiast Justin Blau with serial entrepreneur JD Ross, where listeners can buy ownership in songs directly from artists and earn royalties alongside them. Thus, if a reader is a big fan of a certain piece of work or a creator, or a listener is a big fan of an artist, they now have a means of showcasing and supporting the work **not only for the benefit of the creator, but also for the social and financial gain of the patron.**\n\nIf the the prior generation of \"Patreon\"-style creator economy focused on giving fans a direct way of monetarily supporting creators, the new NFT economy represents a paradigm shift where anything can be turned into an asset and both user/fan/audience and creator can take part in the financial, equity ownership and financial appreciation of that asset.\n\n## Controversy & Criticism: The intangible nature of NFTs and The Climate Impact\n\n**NFTs don't actually come with rights to the artwork, just a digital representation**\n\nOne of the earliest experimenters with NFTs recently warned that spammers have been taking copies of famous artwork and selling them as NFTs (10). NFTs don't come with the artwork itself - even when the artwork is fully digital, the NFT doesn't have enough space to store the full details of an image; instead, an NFT typically points to an https URI address (uniform resource identifier, similar to a URL) or an IPFS address (powered by the InterPlanetary File System, a blockchain-based file storage provider) or includes a mathematical compression of the work (e.g., a checksum) to prove the work's identity.\n\n**NFTS are accused of being environmentally unethical**\n\nOne loud and growing criticism of NFTs are the environmental impacts. ArtStation, an online marketplace for digital artists, was met with fast backlash on Twitter hours after it announced plans to launch a platform for NFTs. Artists protested the \"ecological nightmare\" of NFTs and ArtStation scrapped its plans (11).\n\nSome argue that the greater the demand for NFTs, the greater the motivation for miners to continue their energy-intensive mining activities. The crypto world seems to believe that the upcoming move of Ethereum 2.0, using a PoS instead of PoW method, could be a solution to this problem. In addition, innovators are exploring solutions such as alternate blockchains or private chains which already use PoS methods, side chains that verify NFT transactions without using the main, expensive Ethereum chain, and interchain operability allowing interactions across NFTs built on any blockchain.\n\nIt will be interesting to see where, across all these options, NFT creators, collectors, and consumers end up over time.\n\n## A Few Conclusions: NFTs as Equity Ownership of Anything, and Ushering in the Digital New World\n\nNFTs have evolved gradually over the last many years and certainly exploded in the last 12 months.

These memes were traded on Counterparty, built on the blockchain protocol, as well as on the Ethereum blockchain through a project named \"Peperium\", created in March 2017.\n\n**2017 CryptoPunks**\n\nIn June 2017, two individuals created a new NFT project on the Ethereum blockchain, \"[CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)\": a collection of 10,000 unique characters generated through random combinations of visual features (e.g., beard, sunglasses, skin tone, hairstyles, and other attributes). CryptoPunks were initially offered to anyone with an Ethereum wallet to claim for free, and quickly gave rise to a secondary marketplace where people bought and sold them for hundreds, then thousands, and now, millions of dollars. The most valuable CryptoPunk as of late summer 2021 was CryptoPunk #7523 which was auctioned by Sotheby's in July 2021 and sold for $11.75M at the ETH-to-USD exchange rate of the time.\n\n**2017 ERC271 and CryptoKitties**\n\n[CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/search?include=sale) is a virtual game that allows players to adopt, raise, and trade virtual cats, all on the blockchain. CryptoKitties took another big leap in making NFTs mainstream because they were all over the news as a \"digital cat\" or \"digital beanie babies\" that you can buy and trade with cryptocurrency. Some virtual cats sold for over $100,000.\n\nCryptoKitties were created by a Vancouver-based company called Axiom Zen and revealed at the ETH Waterloo Hackathon, the world's largest Ethereum hackathon. After the release of CryptoKitties, which coincided with the 2017 crypto bull market that saw bitcoin rise in value from $900 to $20,000 between December 2016 and December 2017. Axiom Zen spun out a company called [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), which raised $15M from a16z and Google Ventures (and much more since then), and remains today as one of the leading players in the NFT space, as the company partnering with the NBA to launch [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) collectible digital assets.\n\n**2018-19 Growing in the Background**\n\nThe NFT ecosystem continued to grow slowly, with marketplaces like OpenSea, SuperRare, Rarible, Nifty Gateway, and many more online platforms used to buy and sell NFTs.\n\nWeb3 wallets like Metamask made it easier to purchase and own NFTs.\n\nSome additional names from this era below courtesy of crypto newsletter [The Block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/).\n\n![Many of these players are present today; some have disappeared, and many more have entered!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tf4zc3LOGGNBlFZQQme-y.png?height=348&width=630)\n\n**2020-21 Explosion in the Consumer Mainstage**\n\nNFT assets grew from $40.9M in 2018 to $338M in 2020, with 150,000 total individuals participating in the NFT market, according to enthusiast-started market information site [Nonfungible.com](http://nonfungible.com), which also estimated the breakdown of NFT-related activities as follows: 25% metaverses, 24% art, 23% gaming, 13% sport, 11% collectibles, and 4% utility-based (6).\n\nIn September of 2021 alone, NFT asset sales totaled $2B in transaction volume.\n\nMany more notable projects were launched during this time, which I won't describe in detail, including: [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/home) (a profile picture & community project); [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/) (a simple drop of text files that catalyzed hundreds of projects building on top of the concept); and [RTFKT](https://rtfkt.com/) (a sneaker and metaverse brand).\n\nFor a more in-depth overview of the various categories of NFTs, I enjoyed this [Beginner's Guide to NFTs](https://www.notion.so/cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d), by Linda Xie of Scalar Capital.\n\n## Technical Background & Capabilities\n\nBefore I get to the business applications of NFTs, below is an overview of how the underlying blockchain technology works. Feel free to read, skim, or skip this section.\n\n**How Blockchains Work**\n\nNFTs historically, and most NFTs today, build upon the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain is a decentralized public ledger, similar to the Bitcoin blockchain. One of the important underlying mechanisms of the blockchain is the consensus algorithm, or the algorithm by which users are able to agree on the history of transactions and current state of a blockchain without reliance on a central authority (13).\n\nBitcoin was the first to solve this problem using a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system. Ethereum uses the same mechanism right now, though it is highly computationally intense and energy-inefficient, and Ethereum is soon transitioning to a more efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) method.\n\nIn order to maintain accuracy in a decentralized network, each time someone wants to make a transaction on a blockchain, other members of that blockchain ecosystem are asked to verify that transaction (more precisely, a group of transactions called a \"block\") as legitimate. One method is PoW, and relies on a consensus algorithm, where participating members (\"miners\") solve difficult math problems and publish the solutions with the goal of arriving at a consensus. These problems are computationally intensive and require real-world resources like computers and electricity. Miners are rewarded for arriving at the consensus solution and receive the currency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other currency of that Blockchain) generated in that block. This enables verification in a decentralized network because the only way to commit fraud would be to control enough total computing power that you can put forth your solution as the overwhelming consensus, implying that other users are misrepresenting the current state of the blockchain. Due to the magnitude of miners, PoW is expensive (in a real-world sense, due to high usage of electricity and computers) and controlling enough resources to outnumber enough other miners is expensively infeasible.\n\n**ERC-721 and NFT technologies**\n\nThe ERC-721 is an Ethereum Standard for NFTs, meaning that these NFTs are built on the Ethereum blockchain. The main feature of ERC-721 is that each Token is unique and can have a different value from other Tokens from the same Smart Contract. Smart contracts are programs that live and run on the blockchain and create and govern NFTs or decentralized apps. Mechanically, all NFTs have a `uint256` variable called `tokenId` and for any ERC-721 Contract, the pair `contract address`, `tokenId` must be globally unique. Then, a dApp can have a \"converter\" that uses the `tokenId` as input and outputs a range of media type, including an image, music, or more.\n\nThe ERC-721 standard is used widely for NFTs today and was originally proposed in January 2018 by William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs.\n\nAs NFTs have grown in popularity, some companies use private blockchains to power NFTs. In particular, Flow, operated by Dapper labs (and supporting NBA Top Shot) is devoted to NFT transactions and can be more efficient. (Though the very nature of private blockchains is somewhat counterculture to the original purpose of a decentralized network as a place where anyone can make transactions without oversight by any one institution).\n\n## Business Capabilities, and Why NFTs Represent a New Possibility Frontier in Crypto\n\nCryptocurrencies have always been traded, their value determined by supply and demand, as a currency. However, NFTs represent a difference in that the value of each token is not based on supply and demand for a commodity or currency, but rather, ownership (partial or fully) of an asset represented by each token.\n\n**NFTs in Collectibles**\n\nClearly, we have already seen the possibilities of NFTs as collectibles - from the $100,000+ CryptoKitties to $11M+ CryptoPunk to a Top Shot 2019-2020 LeBron James dunk moment, to of course, Beeple's art collection sold for $69M (7). At the high end, this market seems likely to continue for as long as the crypto nouveau-riche have their riches - driven by a powerful combination of the pursuit of social status and financial investing. In addition, some believe that players like NBA Top Shot and Autograph are bringing in the non-crypto audience as well.\n\n**NFTs in Art**\n\nArt can be thought of as a subset of collectibles, or at least at the intersection of the Venn Diagram between collectibles and art in its purest form - an expression and appreciation of human creativity. Art \"minted\" as NFTs means that the art has a digital representation on the Ethereum blockchain (\"minting\" is the act of adding representation for that artwork on the Ethereum public ledger) (9).\n\nPerhaps the significance of the NFT ecosystem for artwork is the ability to now buy and sell art - particularly digital art - with greater ease, confidence in its verification, and upside in its value thanks to the scarcity feature of NFTs and the thriving crypto wealth and ecosystem springing up around digital artwork.\n\nNFTs have a feature that enable the original artist to receive a percentage of sales every time the NFT is sold, or resold. This could mean that artists, for the first time, can get tangible value from their artwork as it trades hands.\n\nJust last week, [a friend of mine](https://twitter.com/_alexmaceda_) posted on Twitter that an anonymous collector had purchased ALL \\~two dozen of her paintings via NFT artwork marketplace, OpenSea. Without the NFT and crypto capital, it is hard to imagine where, to whom, or how she would have sold this artwork. However, now, her ability to earn income as an artist is significantly higher with an entire new world of crypto capital and digital patrons anywhere.\n\nEven more interesting is the intersection of traditional art and digital, programmatically generated art. Cryptopunks fall in this category as each Cryptopunk was generated algorithmically based on a set of traits; each trait had a certain number of variations and varying levels of rarity. More recently, in 2021, the creators of Cryptopunks created Meebits, using the same method, a custom generative algorithm.\n\n**NFTs in Gaming**\n\nCertain early pioneers of mobile games, such as Machine Zone CEO Leydon, believe NFTs have huge potential in gaming (8). As one illustration, games traditionally make significant revenue from in-game purchases (e.g., of weapons, character customizations, or other benefits). However, when someone stops logging into a game, the items they bought no longer have value. Imagine if players could then sell their items and make money, or bring their items across games into another game. Moreover, the players of a game were beholden the game creators - players had to follow game rules and received none of the value or revenues generated by the game. In a world of NFTs, a game in which players can buy NFTs used in the game (e.g., plots of land) means that suddenly, the players become owners and investors in the game.\n\n**NFTs as Access Tokens**\n\nAnother use case of NFTs is to give NFT-holders the ability to access certain experiences, products, or services - and transact that access. Imagine a celebrity wants to issue an NFT-based membership program to offer exclusive products, musical drops, or experiences to their fans. A fan could purchase an NFT access token and enjoy the offerings, as well as sell that NFT in the future when they no longer want to consume the offerings, or perhaps if the value of that artist's token has increased significantly and the fan wishes to sell the access token for a profit.\n\nFor example, one startup, Centerstage, is a digital events platform where seats are sold as NFTs. Users create online stadiums use the revenue from NFT seat sales to book artists to perform. NFT seat holders can then trade NFTs based on upcoming artists or hold onto their own seats and watch every show.\n\n**NFTs as Equity Ownership (in Music, Writing, and what's next?)**\n\nTo me, one of the most consequential implications of NFTs is the paradigm shift they have brought about - where anything digital can be owned, accrue financial meaning and value, and therefore become a new financial asset.\n\nAs an example, [Mirror.xyz](http://mirror.xyz) (where I have published this article!) is a platform where writers can offer pieces of writing as NFTs. You can actually buy (and trade, and display!) fractional ownership in a piece of writing to indicate support of the writer, agreement with the ideas, or for any other reason. Patrons who purchase an NFT associated with a particular piece of writing then display those NFTs on their profile. Similarly, [Royal.io](http://royal.io) is a music platform co-founded by DJ and early NFT enthusiast Justin Blau with serial entrepreneur JD Ross, where listeners can buy ownership in songs directly from artists and earn royalties alongside them. Thus, if a reader is a big fan of a certain piece of work or a creator, or a listener is a big fan of an artist, they now have a means of showcasing and supporting the work **not only for the benefit of the creator, but also for the social and financial gain of the patron.**\n\nIf the the prior generation of \"Patreon\"-style creator economy focused on giving fans a direct way of monetarily supporting creators, the new NFT economy represents a paradigm shift where anything can be turned into an asset and both user/fan/audience and creator can take part in the financial, equity ownership and financial appreciation of that asset.\n\n## Controversy & Criticism: The intangible nature of NFTs and The Climate Impact\n\n**NFTs don't actually come with rights to the artwork, just a digital representation**\n\nOne of the earliest experimenters with NFTs recently warned that spammers have been taking copies of famous artwork and selling them as NFTs (10). NFTs don't come with the artwork itself - even when the artwork is fully digital, the NFT doesn't have enough space to store the full details of an image; instead, an NFT typically points to an https URI address (uniform resource identifier, similar to a URL) or an IPFS address (powered by the InterPlanetary File System, a blockchain-based file storage provider) or includes a mathematical compression of the work (e.g., a checksum) to prove the work's identity.\n\n**NFTS are accused of being environmentally unethical**\n\nOne loud and growing criticism of NFTs are the environmental impacts. ArtStation, an online marketplace for digital artists, was met with fast backlash on Twitter hours after it announced plans to launch a platform for NFTs. Artists protested the \"ecological nightmare\" of NFTs and ArtStation scrapped its plans (11).\n\nSome argue that the greater the demand for NFTs, the greater the motivation for miners to continue their energy-intensive mining activities. The crypto world seems to believe that the upcoming move of Ethereum 2.0, using a PoS instead of PoW method, could be a solution to this problem. In addition, innovators are exploring solutions such as alternate blockchains or private chains which already use PoS methods, side chains that verify NFT transactions without using the main, expensive Ethereum chain, and interchain operability allowing interactions across NFTs built on any blockchain.\n\nIt will be interesting to see where, across all these options, NFT creators, collectors, and consumers end up over time.\n\n## A Few Conclusions: NFTs as Equity Ownership of Anything, and Ushering in the Digital New World\n\nNFTs have evolved gradually over the last many years and certainly exploded in the last 12 months. This was likely due to a combination of factors: the pandemic confining consumers much more so to digital experiences; the global macro environment, between financial heat-up in the stock markets and low interest rates, leading to significant capital seeking new assets to generate returns; the crypto ballooning in market size, from \\~$200B to $800B+ from 2019 to 2021 in bitcoin alone (14).\n\nRegardless of where the zealous interest and capital has come from, one thing is for sure: the popularity of NFTs has created a zeitgeist and permanent paradigm shift in business models. Namely:\n\n1. NFTs enable the creation of **equity ownership** in **anything**, while\n2. greatly reducing the friction and increasing the acceptance of valuing, owning, and trading digital assets.\n\nGiven the amount of interest and economy value the NFT economy has created, this paradigm is likely here to stay.\n\n\n---\n\nThis piece was originally written for my Stanford independent research project.

{"id": "W5xxdHJsfF6b_3nZujEs-PSVV_-iXEi4C6_7Yati01g", "title": "How we build at Scout", "body": "### Introduction\n\nAt Scout, we build products that bring people together through the shared language of content. That may sound a bit vague, because it is! Our approach to building is unique in that we build multiple products in pursuit of our mission. \n\nWe believe social media has become more *media* than *social*. Our goal is to bring the social side back in the best way possible.\n\nSo far, we’ve publicly released four products:\n\n* [is.online](http://is.online) — avatar- and mobile-based live-streaming.\n* [onscout.com](http://onscout.com) — teaser for customizable 3D rooms with 165,000+ people on the waitlist.\n* [ideasby.ai](http://ideasby.ai) — content ideas generated by GPT-3.\n* [takeme.to](http://takeme.to) — one home for all your links.\n\nWith more on the way.\n\nBelow is an internal memo from August 2021 outlining the principles we use while building new products.\n\n### 1. We put shots on goal\n\nOur approach is unique in that we build multiple products in pursuit of our mission. **This allows us to put user demand ahead of what we think people *should* want.** This approach isn't often talked about, but the best startups pre- product-market fit employ this approach and it's one we've come to have a lot of conviction on.\n\nThis means we do not hesitate to change our fundamental thesis on how we bring people closer together through the shared language of content. While pre-Product-Market Fit, we recognize, embrace, and plan for the likelihood that our core thesis may be wrong.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that we are not a product studio. Building multiple products in line with our mission is only temporary; once we find the product that sticks, we'll dedicate our energy completely to that product.\n\n### 2. We start with existing human behavior\n\nFor any new product, changing human behavior is a near-death wish. We lean in to existing behaviors; we identify clear actions within our target audience, — generally 12-16 y/o based in the US and Canada — identify the underlying desire or goal they are seeking, and use that as the inspiration behind what we build.\n\nWe believe shepherding a niche behavior to be a key part of building a category-defining company. Airbnb, Lyft, Loom, Onlyfans, and many other category-defining companies are often misattributed with radically changing user behavior. In truth, we can point to clear existing behaviors before those platforms existed. Before Loom, a small group of people would open Quicktime, record their screens, upload that video to YouTube, make the video unlisted, and share the link. Loom made that existing behavior dramatically easier and faster — they became shepherds of what was once a niche behavior.\n\n### 3. We de-risk at every step\n\nAfter identifying an existing behavior, we seek to systematically de-risk at every stage of the build process. We do this through our *Idea Maze* — a system to take simple observations all the way to delightful products in a structured and risk-mitigating way. While de-risking isn't sexy, it's core to using our energy and capital effectively.\n\n1. `Observations` start with existing human behavior. A clear set of actions taken by a specific person.\n2. `Thesis` is our belief on why this behavior happens, where possible pain points are, what a potential solution may be, and why solving the pain point may be important for the world right now.\n3. `User interviews` are talking to users about their behavior, goals, and desires. We never ask if they think our ideas are good; only seek to understand where their desires and pain points may be.\n4. `Pre-Tweet` is our take on [Amazon's Press Release exercise](https://www.product-frameworks.com/Amazon-Product-Management.html). Before the first line of code is ever written, we write a simple Tweet thread as if today is launch day. This forces us to clearly explain the problem, the target user, and why our solution is better.\n5. `Core Product Value test` seeks to answer one question — *will users want this once it's built?* This may come in the form of a landing page, survey, or similar medium.\n6. `MVP build` is where the first line of code is written. We strip the product down to its absolute core without sacrificing delight within that scope of features.\n7. `Launch + Measure` is a Beta or public release paired with measuring how the product is received. A short list of Key Performance Indicators in addition to whether or not we, as a team, continue to use the product, guide us to understand whether or not we're onto something.\n8. `Iterate + Measure` is the last step of the maze. After launch, if we remain excited to use the product internally and/or see promising metrics post-launch, we double down on improving the product.\n\n### Sound interesting?

Our mission is to transform the way culture and public goods are funded, beginning with the arts. We are moving to web3 and invite you to join us as we build the [Artizen DAO](https://artizen.link/pitch-deck).\n\nArtizen helps communities come together and support the things they care about. We make it easy to crowdfund new grants, curate the awards, and earn NFTs from the winning projects — a positive-feedback cycle that powers sustained support for your field, community, or cause.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wh78apEs5zDx5xZeMcWIm.jpg?height=1185&width=1920&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n## The Problem\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4YP_U1sUzv-7_hQzrBcKT.jpg?height=838&width=2500)\n\nGrants are the lifeblood of the arts, but a [new model for grants is deeply needed](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/the-state-of-public-funding-for-the-arts-in-america/424056/). The current system is centered around institutions, not communities, and as a result is bureaucratic, inefficient, and does not align incentives between donors, grantmakers, artists and their fans.\n\n* **Donors**: few rewards, no voice in curation, no relationship with artists and little stake in their success.\n* **Grantmakers**: complex administration, overhead, challenges attracting and keeping donors.\n* **Artists**: insufficient funding sources, onerous application processes, weak ties to donors. Few grants go directly to artists, most go to nonprofit gatekeepers who can afford full-time grant writers.\n* **Fans**: excluded from the grant process entirely with no ability or incentive to donate to grants.\n\n## The Solution\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Bjad-DCei_4FB4_vo8q_H.jpg?height=802&width=2500)\n\nArtizen has developed a new model for grants that aligns the incentives of grantmakers, donors, fans and the artists they support. By combining crowdfunding, community curation, and NFT rewards, we can unlock new money, untapped network effects, and sustainable support for the artists in your community and every community around the world.\n\n* By giving donors a voice in where their money goes, we give fans a reason to become donors;\n* By eliminating bureaucracy, we give more money directly to artists, and simplify processes for both artists and grantmakers;\n* And by rewarding donors with NFTs, we give everyone a stake in the project’s success, attracting more donors and creating stronger ties between supporters and artists.\n\n## Artizen Grants Unite People\n\n![The Dance by Matisse](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S590-O_XWeO8WoW5-oULX.jpeg?height=997&width=1500)\n\nSince launching our MVP in 2021, Artizen has awarded nearly $500K to artists across more than 100 grants, grown to 12K+ members, and partnered with major companies and cultural institutions including Microsoft, HP, Unity Technologies, and the Cannes and Tribeca Film Festivals. These partners are excited to underwrite community grants because we give them a way to directly support causes they care about, while removing the complexities of running a grant themselves.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_8fyRkr5vVNpe3BixCRYi.jpg?height=1260&width=2410)\n\nIf you’re HP, or Academy Award Winner Viola Davis, and you want to encourage more Black visionaries to explore new technology, you can either create and run your own complicated grant, incubator, or mentorship program – or you can simply back an Artizen grant.\n\n## Artizen Curation Engine\n\nGroup decision-making is a challenge. How do you give a voice to donors without making it just another popularity contest? How can you give unknown artists an extra leg up? How can a grantmaker guarantee high standards for winning artists, and keep a grant aligned with its original mission? How do you create a positive, *[wagmi](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/art/nft-twitter-meanings-definitions)* culture and avoid a dynamic of ‘winners’ vs. ‘losers’? How do you balance the power of small donors against big donors?\n\nWe have been iterating on these difficult questions for over 100 grant cycles. The result is our Curation Engine, a selection system that balances and harmonizes these interests. Grantmakers select a jury of experts who review project submissions and curate 3-10 finalists. This guarantees that winning projects uphold the mission standards and mission of Artizen grants while allowing for thoughtful curation of projects that might not yet have large followings. [Quadratic voting](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html) balances small and large donor power while still incentivizing donation. And everybody wins: splitting prizes proportionally to upvotes avoids the disappointment and bad blood of winner-take-all contests.\n\n**Here’s how a grant works in practice**:\n\n* Artists submit project proposals;\n* Jury, selected by the grantmaker, chooses 3-10 finalists;\n* Community donates to buy upvotes;\n* Community votes for their favorite of the Finalists;\n* Project with the most upvotes wins the grant, but all Finalists receive funding in proportion to the number of votes they received;\n* Winning project mints an NFT Artifact to reward donors (more about this later).\n\n![Artizen Curation Engine](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZMRZDCSXjwYcQdEaX8zPa.jpg?height=1260&width=2410)\n\n## Community Curation Drives Growth\n\nWe’ve discovered something remarkable: community curation drives growth.  By giving donors a voice in selecting winners, artists have a reason to invite fans, and fans have a reason to become donors. The most successful Artizen grants grow rapidly because of this dynamic, and we are modeling the web3 version of Artizen on their success.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/idR26Y7n3QnguyQC8XbUX.jpg?height=908&width=2500)\n\n## NFT Rewards\n\nWe are building a new version of our platform on web3 for two reasons. The first is to use NFT rewards to ‘close the loop,’ connecting the value of the art to the donors who support it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H0CJWMuc8iMDHrGYku6rT.jpg?height=1260&width=2410)\n\nFor each grant cycle, donors will receive an NFT representing their support (a portion of an Artifact, described below).  Designed with the winning artist, it will combine the ideas of a [POAP](https://poap.xyz/) with NFT art – both a badge of support and a tangible asset that can appreciate in step with the growth of the artist’s career.  In addition, royalties from any trading of these tokens goes back into the Matching Fund to ‘pay forward’ into future grants. NFTs will also connect the success of individual grants to the health of the whole grant ecosystem through Artizen Artifacts.\n\n## Artifacts Power the Artizen DAO\n\nThe second reason we are moving to web3 is because we want Artizen to be owned by our community. Artizen Artifacts are NFTs that represent collective ownership of the platform, which will transition to a [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) (DAO). Artifact holders will be artists, donors, grantmakers, fans, and anyone else invested in building a brighter future for art, science, and culture.\n\nRoyalties from Artifact sales go back into the Matching Fund, which will provide ongoing support for all grants. Each grant cycle mints 3 new Artifacts, designed by the winning artist – one for the DAO, one for the artist, and one fractionalized as rewards to their donors. As the company transitions to distributed governance, the community can experiment with new structures and policies.\n\n![Artifact of van Gogh's Ear](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XXqUSUWJ_GT9L1MNosM2U.gif?height=450&width=800)\n\nThe collection begins with 5,001 objects from the history of art around the world, designed by [Nak Yong Choi](https://knocknak.com/) with sound by [Elliot Cole](https://www.elliotcole.com/). These 3D objects will be interoperable with [Jadu](https://opensea.io/collection/jadu-jetpack), [Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/), and elsewhere in the metaverse. And finally, this collection (and community) will grow as new grantwinning work is also memorialized in Artifacts.", "timestamp": 1635308252, "digest": "JG0qijxHRbh4a9I3xdwpsgWWno8lOKn1X2wGCeqXueI", "contributor": "0xfe5E90ba7cDAaDba443C0C27010eB1D51327EaFb"}

So I went down the rabbit hole for answers to what it is, why people are crazy about this \"text file\" NFT project, its success and how it changed the NFT space.\n\n## How it started\n\nIt all started with a [tweet](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1430529561729683458) from Dom Hofmann, the co-creator of vine, creator of Blitmap and Supdrive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_3D_EtdImLvnwZdCdHvt-.png?height=834&width=1186)\n\nLoot is a text-based NFT. It has 8,000 randomized adventure gear bags generated and stored on chain. Each loot bag contains total of 8 items. This is what a Loot bag looks like:\n\n![Loot Example Bags](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N70WaofHMSbWxn1vaVEcR.png?height=966&width=2558)\n\nLoot bags were free to mint with only the cost of gas. The #1 to #7777 bags were claimed within 4 hours of release and the rest of #7778 to #8000 are reserved for the contract deployer.\n\nOne of the main reasons why Loot attracted so much attention is because Dom has accumulated a large cult following from the success of his previous projects. So as soon as he released Loot, fans just aped in. At the moment of writing, the floor price of one Loot is around 5.1 ETH.\n\nBut the value of Loot doesn't stop at this text file. It's the Loot metaverse ecosystem the community has been building on the OG Loot.\n\n## Loot ecosystem\n\nSince the Loot release, derivative projects from the community continues to grow rapidly.\n\nIn just a few days, discussions took place in Discord channels emerged projects like: rarity explorers [0xinventory.app;](https://0xinventory.app/) floor trackers for different items: [robes](http://robes.market), [bookclub](http://bookclub.market), [weeb](http://weeb.market), [ancients](http://ancients.market), [hoods](http://hoods.market), [sacrednumber](http://sacrednumber.market), [demon-crwon](http://demon-crwon.herokuapp.com). A rather controversial project among the community is xLoot, which is an extension of Loot, free to mint from ID 8001 to 15777.\n\nDerived art projects like: [Abstract Loot](https://opensea.io/collection/abstract-loot), a generative art project which is a collection of generative animation based on the Loot metadatas. [Realms](https://opensea.io/collection/lootrealms), a procedurally generated realms map for all 8000 Loot Bags.\n\nWant some wearable gears? MetaFactory has released luxury apparel for your Loot Bags - [MetaLoot](https://loot.metafactory.ai/). A physical bag of apparel and accessories custom embroidered with the adventurer gear in your Loot Bag, Synthetic or OG Loot, plus a 3D metaverse wearable NFT.\n\nFor people who think they missed out on the OG Loot mint, there is a project called [Synthetic Loot Viewer](https://loot.stephancill.co.za/#/). Anyone with an ETH wallet address will generate a different Synth Loot base on that particular address, however it is not possible to mint yet.\n\n## What's next?\n\nThe simplicity of its text form, a strong community and governance, its fair-mint nature, the creator's direction of \"Feel free to use Loot in any way you want\" are what make the project so successful, and it changed how NFT can be used for all future projects.\n\nThe Loot ecosystem will continue to grow as the creative possibility is limitless.

Cosmos is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes Terra, Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and Osmosis.\n\nStargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users. Therefore, distribution of STARS has to be equitable, accessible, and cover a large surface area.\n\n## Token Release Schedule\n\nA fair initial distribution is pivotal in setting the future direction of a network. Paired with a thoughtful inflationary release schedule, a network can optimize its token distribution.\n\nThe distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance will be cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 2/3). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.\n\nFor some background on using token incentives to bootstrap new networks, check out this great [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?s=20) by Chris Dixon.\n\n![\"Thirding\" release schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TwRgLvwwmYuxQ8c4BqR3f.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nStargaze will start with an initial supply of 1 billion STARS. An additional 1 billion STARS will be issued the first year. With this \"thirding\" schedule, the issuance for the following year will be \\~667M STARS. This infinite sequence is a [geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series) which leads to a  fixed **asymptotic max supply of 4 billion STARS**.\n\n![Total supply formula](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4zhWsUYN9KbC12rOFyAZM.png?height=126&width=1284)\n\n![Issuance calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooIF-U44MYirt21oEg4LL.png?height=1542&width=1630)\n\nStargaze starts off decentralized on day one with a genesis supply that distributes the majority of the tokens to community members. The Foundation will hold a strategic reserve of tokens, and will drive adoption of the protocol by delegating to validators, onboarding creators, and providing grants for ecosystem development.\n\n![Community-focused genesis supply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZTtjhTqZNqm1rNESQq8j2.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter 5 years, the initial distribution is only 27.6% of the entire token supply. This issuance schedule allows Stargaze to grow and adapt its ownership to new creators, curators, validators, delegators, and other stakeholders.\n\n![Genesis supply vs. new issuance after 5 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k_VH9Rk86klZ7IXo2ZbKC.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nTokens for seed investors, validators, founders, and advisors are locked up for 1 year, and linearly vest after that for another 6 months - 1 year. This helps align values with the the development team and early stakeholders.\n\n## The Airdrop\n\nThe goal of the Stargaze airdrop is to reach the most active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem. Stakers and liquidity providers are more likely to be more active than just token holders. Therefore, Stargaze is doing its airdrop to a mix of network participants:\n\n* **ATOM stakers**\n* **OSMO stakers or liquidity providers**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Cosmos Hub**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Osmosis**\n* **Stargaze validator stakers on Regen Network**\n\nFor each role above, you will be able to claim **2,453 STARS**. Distributing a fixed amount is in the spirit of the original Uniswap airdrop, giving every user more or less an equal starting point. In order to claim your airdrop, you have to perform 4-5 actions on Stargaze when it launches. If you have used [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) or [Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/), you’re already familiar with performing tasks to claim tokens. Some claimable actions include bidding on NFTs, staking, and voting in governance.\n\nSome minimums were put in place to prevent dust accounts and those attempting to game airdrops:\n\n* **ATOM staker: 5 ATOM minimum staked**\n* **OSMO staker: 50 OSMO minimum staked**\n\nFurthermore, delegations to centralized exchange validators were excluded.\n\nFor example, if you’re an ATOM staker and OSMO LP, and meet the above minimums, then your airdrop reward is 4,906 STARS.\n\nOsmosis liquidity providers get the airdrop regardless if LP tokens are bonded or not.\n\nAirdrop claimable amounts start decaying 4 months after the launch of the NFT market. The decaying process linearly decreases the claimable amount for another 4 months.\n\n![Airdrop must be claimed to prevent decay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_QgqhG1LETOtyBdL0a7P.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAfter the airdrop claim period, unclaimed STARS are sent to the Community Pool.\n\nSnapshots were taken on Oct 11th, 2021 from Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and Regen Network.\n\n**Check your airdrop at: <https://stargaze.zone/airdrop>.**\n\nhttp://stargaze.zone/airdrop\n\n*Note: Airdrops won’t be claimable until after Phase 3 later in the year. Please see Phase 3 below.*\n\n## Reward Distribution\n\nNew token reward distribution will be optimized to facilitate the operations of the NFT market.\n\nThe initial breakdown per block will be:\n\n![Per block distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UzjJ1v4qZ-bF5zw1BY9kr.png?height=768&width=1024)\n\nAll chain parameters can be changed via governance vote. Everything suggested in this post are sensible defaults. We expect governance to adapt and change the protocol as it matures.\n\n### NFT Incentives\n\n45% of block rewards are set aside for NFT bidding and staking incentives. Token holders will be able to earn yield by bidding and staking on NFTs for certain periods of time. An upcoming post will outline this mechanic in detail.\n\nIf governance determines that NFT incentives are too high for achieving the desired effect of the protocol, they may direct these incentives towards the Community Pool where they can be spent later.\n\n### Staking Rewards\n\nAs per the course with proof-of-stake networks, validators (node operators) earn rewards for securing the network. They also accept delegations from token holders, and charge a commission of 5% or greater for providing the service.\n\nNearly 100 validators were selected to join mainnet after 3 testnets, 2 of which were incentivized. They will earn 35% of all block rewards.\n\n### Developer Rewards\n\nInitially, 15% of block rewards will go to fund the team that contributes to the development of Stargaze. Each account gets a specific weight set by governance. When a developer is no longer contributing, governance can choose to modify their weight or remove their allocation.\n\n### Community Pool\n\nThe Community Pool is the main DAO that operates the network. It is responsible for voting on parameter changes, software upgrades, community matters, and more. It will receive 5% of all block rewards.\n\n## Phased Launch\n\nSince Stargaze is a layer 1 blockchain with many moving parts, it will launch in phases.\n\n* **Phase 0: Chain launch with 0% inflation (Oct 29th)**\n* **Phase 1: Liquidity pools on [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/)**\n* **Phase 2: Governance proposal to enable inflation**\n* **Phase 3: Web app launch with first NFT drop**\n\nMore details about the liquidity pools will be forthcoming. Please follow us on social media (links below) for updates. They are planned for 2-3 weeks after Phase 0, and have to go through governance to be funded via the Community Pool.\n\nNew tokens won’t be issued until after Phase 2, when inflation kicks in. At this time you’ll be able to stake STARS at [stargaze.zone](http://stargaze.zone/) via [Keplr Wallet](http://keplr.app/).\n\nPhase 3 is expected to be completed before the end of the year. Airdrops will be claimable starting in this phase.\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTo follow along with Stargaze developments, check us out on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/StargazeZone>, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StargazeZone\n\n[https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE](https://discord.gg/QeJWCrE)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Why don’t I have an airdrop? I staked ATOM.**\n\nThe airdrop is only available to those that staked with non-centralized exchange validators. Staking with the following centralized exchanges ***do not*** qualify: Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Huobi, CoinOne, and OKEX.\n\n**I staked 0.1 ATOM, where is my airdrop?**\n\nYou must have staked at least 5 ATOM or 50 OSMOS to qualify.\n\n**I had my Osmosis LP tokens unbonded on Oct 11th. Do I still qualify?**\n\nYes.\n\n**What is the price of STARS?**\n\nThe token has no value until the network has launched and the token is trading on exchanges.\n\n**Where can I buy STARS?**\n\nSTARS will be available on decentralized exchanges in the Cosmos ecosystem such as [Osmosis](http://osmosis.zone/) and Gravity DEX (via [Emeris](http://osmosis.zone/)) a few weeks following launch.\n\nHappy Stargazing ✨🔭", "timestamp": 1635309227, "digest": "h9Bc7jODUrYB1Jw4mve3QEGVkBwBsyVebN6NP7tRl_Y", "contributor": "0x57a9Cb03cC8Ed919162d9024710ca9E886346299"}

{"id": "n33ZkA19ozLK_zDYLyXrl91pOQ8mc2JXUl_CM4iC4Ck", "title": "Why did the Soviet Union lose the Cold War?", "body": "The disintegration of the Soviet Union was not an inevitable event, but it was an inevitable event that the Soviet Union lost the Cold War. Like China, ancient Russia was a typical representative of the large population. The characteristic of this kind of country is its huge size. As long as it is united enough, it is almost impossible to lose in the overall war. This is a typical case whether it is the Soviet Union's hard resistance against the mustache or the Republic of China against Japan. Countries like China and Russia, as long as they are sufficiently united internally, it is impossible to defeat them by external forces. Even if it is as fragile as the Republic of China, it can survive the small Japan by relying on its size advantage.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vpWqSb-BB9WqJ_8zR5VvR.jpg?height=325&width=500)\n\nHowever, the characteristic of this kind of country is that its total resources are extremely large, and its international status may be high. However, most of the time, its ordinary people are not doing well because the per capita resources are not large. The situation in Russia is more special. Its per capita resources are in absolute value. However, due to the difficulty of development and traffic conditions, it is difficult to ensure that everyone can enjoy these resources. (For a counter example, look at the United States, where there are many people in the same place, but the superior climate and transportation conditions make the economic foundations of the United States and Russia very different.) In the era when Tsarist Russia was called the European gendarmerie, Tsarist Russia was still engaged in serfdom. When the First World War broke out, European countries had already entered civilized societies. Tsarist Russian soldiers were also called \"gray animals\", and there were a large number of bandits and blood relatives in the territory of revenge. As a country, no monarch in Europe dared to despise Tsarist Russia, but as a common people, living in Russia is very different from living in Western Europe. In the latter part of World War II, the Soviet Union counterattacked into the German mainland. After visiting the German homes, Soviet soldiers were puzzled from the bottom of their hearts-they already lived so extravagantly, why did they come to invade us?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WZpG33_nT8HNRaFyYOdmU.jpg?height=435&width=600)\n\nThe same is true for the Qing Dynasty. As a representative of China's humiliating dynasty, the Qing Dynasty was full of military virtues for most of the time. There are few rivals in Asian countries, and the Nepalese National People's Congress, which the British can't beat, is able to handle it. With an agricultural country, it can put an established force on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and win the war. This reflects the overall war power of a big country like China. After the Opium War and Maguan, Xin Chou, after all, there was a problem within the Qing Dynasty. If the Qing Dynasty were a Han dynasty, what had not been seen in modern China would be like that. But the people of the Qing Dynasty lived like slaves. When Macartney visited China, he was surprised by such a powerful country in the Qing Dynasty. How did the people live like this? I'm grateful even for some leftovers. This is the embarrassment of countries like China and Russia. In terms of material production, both countries are undoubtedly extremely rich. However, the population has greatly flattened these resources, making it difficult for the people of the two countries to lead a richer life even in the heyday. It is normal for the country to be strong and the people to be weak. The situation of the Soviet Union is even more special. Although the population density of the Soviet Union is much lower than that of China, its climate and traffic conditions are also far worse than China, and the degree of development is far less than that of China. Although Russia's territory is large, it is difficult to call it superior in natural conditions (otherwise it will not be so large for him to monopolize). Slavs have always been regarded by Europeans as aliens, mainly because of the poor living conditions.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zG3EdJ706BZidMC9URL4t.jpg?height=727&width=1024)\n\nIf you look at the Soviet Union as a nation-state, what he is good at is overall warfare, not a good life. The living standards of the Russians have never surpassed that of Western Europe, and the Soviet Union's performance is already at an extraordinary level. Therefore, what the Soviet Union can win is a hot war, not a cold war. Among all the methods of confrontation, the Soviet Union had to choose the worst path-the cold war. Not only must it engage in an arms race, it must be better than the standard of living. The biggest problem of the Soviet Union is that the adjustment is too high. The Soviet Union is a typical \"savior\" regime. It did not exist as a nation-state from the beginning. Trotsky’s soul has never left the Soviet Union. The Soviet official has always declared that he should be the arsenal of the world revolution, burning himself to save mankind. In the official declaration of the Soviet Union, the happiness of the Soviet people has never been the ultimate goal. Their ultimate goal is to sweep the world across the globe and realize the unity of mankind.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HOp2CFoI1Lhq5SB8lOMLF.jpg?height=608&width=550)\n\nThe slogan sounds passionate, but it costs money. Objectively speaking, based on the Soviet Union's technological and material levels, if they are properly deployed and only choose one of the arms race and the lives of the people to solve it, they can handle it. There is no problem. Let alone the ability of the arms race, everyone can see it. Under the Soviet Union’s military policy, the Warsaw Pact’s armament level has never been lowered by NATO. If the Soviet Union is willing to maintain such a posture, it can continue to forcefully engage in military confrontation with the United States, no problem. What if we don’t engage in military competitions and only engage in people’s lives? In fact, it is also possible, at least it will not be left too much by Europe and the United States. Cutting down more than half of the Soviet Union’s 5 million troops, cutting down 140,000 tanks and armored vehicles by two-thirds, withdrawing troops from all over the world, and stopping the amount of assistance provided to Asia, Africa and Latin America can save you. The resources are completely astronomical. According to Gorbachev's recollection, when he took over, the Soviet Union's military expenditures accounted for 40% of the finances and 20% of the total output value, which was even close to the level of a wartime country. One can imagine what a terrifying proportion. If it can be deployed reasonably, even if it is a planned economy, the living standards of the Soviet people can go up a lot. The Kosygin reforms and Andropov reforms proved that the planned economy of the Soviet Union has not reached the point of exhaustion, and the possibility of re-prosperity is very high with gradual reforms with reasonable measures. However, if you do both, you can't do it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yT8QJoj9Uh7FhUNJp1LmS.jpg?height=436&width=713)\n\nThe Cold War is such a struggle-you can't relax in the military, you can't fall behind in technology, and your people's living standards can't be poor, otherwise your social system will be backward! Therefore, the Soviet people's sense of gap is very strong. On the one hand, I am the first world country, the big brother of the proletariat, and the core of the world. The country’s rockets went up to the sky and the aircraft carrier was launched into the sea. The aircraft carrier nuclear submarine was rampant across the ocean, 60,000 tanks crushed Western Europe, and tens of thousands of nuclear bombs were the ballast of the world’s proletariat. However, right now you are struggling to buy some good toilet paper. The color TV will explode when you use it. No one will repair your sewer pipes. Your family of five is crowded in an old building of 60 square meters, sharing the bathroom and kitchen with others. At this time you will definitely think-why is all this? If liberating mankind is to live like me, what is the point of liberating mankind? Whenever I see imported goods from Japan and Western Europe, I feel that they do not need our liberation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/brRRoWRDQAfYx4boH1CT9.jpg?height=597&width=800)\n\nIn fact, every time I look back at the history of the Cold War, I feel impressed by the abundance of the Soviet Union's material resources. North Korea, Vietnam, Yemen, Angola and many other Asian, African and Latin American countries are all Soviet bloodletters, and Afghanistan is a super gold swallowing beast. However, under such circumstances, the Soviet Union can still maintain its armaments on the scale of terror, and under the conditions of such corruption of the Soviet Communist Party, the life of the common people is still passable, and I have to sigh that Big Brother has a solid foundation. The disintegration of the Soviet Union was a large-scale \"Long Yingtai\" carnival for the people of the Soviet Union. Although it was later proved that without the rise of a great power, the people of the Soviet Union did not gain the dignity of the petty people. But this was a hindsight. For the Soviets at the time, they definitely expected more changes than maintaining the status quo. Many people say that before the collapse of the Soviet Union, more than 70% of the Soviet people agreed to keep the Soviet Union. But what they didn't say was that the vast majority of them agreed to maintain a new Soviet Union, not a socialist Soviet Union. The Soviet Union regarded the Soviet people as the fuel of the world revolution.\n\nThe Cold War was a war of attrition. The Soviet Union used the power of a Soviet-Eastern bloc to fight consumption with the global market integrated with the three major industrial centers of the United States, Europe, and Japan. It was impossible for the Soviet Union to fight it. Not to mention the huge first-mover advantages and natural conditions of Europe and America, as well as the trauma of the Soviet Union's own war. The two sides are not on the same starting line. It is a miracle that they can last for 50 years. With the progress of globalization, in the early twentieth century, the kind of global labor and life-and-death class feelings became weaker and weaker. Soviet officials and people became less and less aware of why they were tightening this string. When the Soviet people saw the extravagant life in the United States, Europe and Japan, no one believed the Suslovs no matter how much they bothered to explain the superiority of socialism.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tiiiHjnr9OARWAefN701O.jpg?height=383&width=500)\n\nThe savior regime cannot be deconstructed. No matter how high the tune of the Soviet Communist Party is, and no matter how loud the slogan is, a Soviet joke can bring him back to its original form. \"We in the Soviet Union want to liberate mankind!\"-\"Your color TV explodes every day\", \"Soviet science and technology is No. 1 in the world!\"-\"Your car is not as powerful as a bicycle\", \"Soviet modernization is almost complete!\"-\"You Of the people can’t even eat fresh fruit.” The United States during the Cold War did not even need any excessive propaganda, as long as it showed its own way of life. Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Michael Jackson, Hilton Hotel, no matter how you call these things the sugar-coated cannonballs of capitalism, human nature just likes these things. When the people of the Sudong Group saw the scraps of American life, they would naturally ask: Why can't I have these?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Czp8mI0fVj-9cHGx8K7DE.jpg?height=960&width=640)\n\nThis kind of contrast is fatal to the savior's regime. Just like a Sanhe God who comes to teach you to make a fortune, you will instinctively laugh at him-you live this way, who do you teach to make a fortune? Mind your own business. From the moment the Soviet Union began to participate in the Cold War, he had already lost. In contrast, Chernobyl, the bureaucracy of the CPSU, the war in Afghanistan, etc., are all just diseases of mange. Therefore, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, we wisely engaged in the \"Three Represents\" and expressed our attitude-we will not accept the Soviet legal system. China is the China of the Chinese. The kind of things that let China be responsible for the Asian revolution. We will not do it. If you set the tuning gate to this, you can turn it anyway, because as a nation-state, there is no burden. Although the structure is far inferior to the Soviet Union, this was the only realistic choice for China, which was poor and weak at the time. If you didn't make up this determination at that time, you would lose everything if you were a little careless.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1LZHu7QjcSZm048Rr6J4D.jpg?height=267&width=500)\n\nThe negative representative is the United States. In 1991, the Soviet people killed the Soviet Union, but the death of the Soviet Union did not kill the United States. The United States failed to turn the corner after the Cold War-ideology was a dispensable thing for the old United States. Before the Cold War and even before the Second World War, the United States did not have a distinct ideological color and lived well. Ideology is the weapon that the United States used to resist the Soviet Union for the Cold War. It is a necessity of the Soviet Union, but not a necessity of the United States. As a result, the United States not only did not weaken its ideology after the Cold War, but further strengthened it as the foundation of the nation. Of course, this also has something to do with the rapid complication of American ethnicity after World War II. The United States really can't match the immigrants from so many countries for national identity, and can only use the ideological banner to make do with it. The ideology of the Soviet Union originated from Marx and Engels, and it was far stronger than the United States in terms of theoretical perfection and inheritance. The ideology of the United States is a mass of paste, and it comes from the French Rousseau Montesquieu group. But the United States is afraid to say that it has inherited the spirit of the Enlightenment. After more than a hundred years of animal slavery, how can it be said that all people are created equal? Who inherited your economic system? Adam Smith? After hundreds of years of evolution, the system and culture of the United States are innovative.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qAUneKFUmDHv0ExWwpEf7.jpg?height=552&width=828)\n\nTo put it simply, the United States is naturally far weaker in ideology than the Soviet Union. Others have the Internationale, the Communist Manifesto, the Paris Commune, and the Communist International. What do you have? Others have communist fighters who are willing to give their lives, what do you have? Wall Street stock trader? Who would you cite Marx? Give Adam Smith? People’s Communist International has comrades from dozens of countries to participate. What is your Communist International? WTO? After the end of the Cold War, the United States should no longer engage in ideology. A country with the separation of powers (the United States), several constitutional monarchies (UK and Japan), a semi-presidential country (French), several prime ministerial countries (Germany, Italy and Israel), and some federal presidency countries (Switzerland, etc.). The unity of Keynesianism and liberalism under the same banner makes itself a funny thing. The ideology of the United States has been a muddle from beginning to end. Its essence is a coalition of interests of a group of selfish social Darwinists, without even a supreme goal. The only slogan of the United States during the Cold War was to safeguard the free world and protect our way of life, one for the liberation of mankind, and the other for self-preservation. This situation is not a bit different from the Soviet Union.\n\nThe American ideology is based on the \"anti-communist\" issue. From beginning to end, he didn't explain what he wanted in the end. He only told you what he didn't want. OK, then the Soviet Union is disintegrated, and no one threatens your way of life. According to normal logic, the United States should discard this ideology. The results of it? During the Cold War, Americans chanted scriptures and thought that they had dragged the Soviet Union to death by chanting scriptures. After the end of the Cold War, the United States not only did not stop chanting, but became more and more confused. Not only did it seize its own \"freedom\", it also picked up the opposite \"democracy\". The good fellow Soviet Union fell, and he became the savior. NS! The establishment of the United States as a \"beacon nation\" has more negative effects than positive effects on the United States.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CFOa4Z4mFVohUNCn9oDsI.jpg?height=552&width=827)\n\nCountless immigrants from all over the world flock to the United States, but that is not because the United States is a beacon, but because of the average living standard of US$60,000. Although many of them said that it was because the United States is a lighthouse, then Liberia is the son of the United States, and its political system is exactly the same as the United States without any changes. Why haven't anyone gone to Liberia to look for a lighthouse? Whether the United States is a lighthouse or not, its appeal to immigrants will not change. If the United States is really poor any day, even if it is nuclear-powered searchlights, no one will take the initiative to go. However, the saviour that the United States has put on itself is the icing on the cake when the United States is strong. But when the United States showed a little fatigue, he was the first rock that the United States dropped after falling into a well. Why? Because the United States has always done imperialist things, but it has to build a savior's skin. The whole world laughed at Trump, but no one laughed at Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro is no weaker than Trump, but few people pay attention to him. This is not only because the US has greater influence than Brazil, but because Brazil has never said that it is the ultimate answer to the world's political system. Below the \"World's Best Political System\" plaque, is a picture of Trump. How funny is this scene?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_pO-J7tELwDtOokpDX4MF.jpg?height=321&width=557)\n\nLike the Soviet Union, the savior regime cannot be deconstructed. In Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, the U.S. military is only doing what it has been doing for hundreds of years, but it is because of the contrast of this layer that the U.S. behavior is so hypocritical and hateful. The rampant COVID-19 is the American version of the Soviet joke. All the methods used to mock the Soviet Union can now be applied to the United States: \"Our system is the most perfect\"-your new crown has infected 20 million people, \"our system has the ability to correct itself\"-\"your new crown is dead It’s more than 300,000.\", \"Our creativity is the strongest!\"-How about creating a new crematorium and burning the corpse first? The beacon of democracy, that's it?\n\nCompared with the confrontation between the two great saviors of the United States and the Soviet Union in the 20th century, the new Cold War in the 21st century will be very dull, because it is a naked battle for interests. From the perspective of style, there is no higher style than the US-Soviet style. However, this is determined by changes in objective material conditions. In the 21st century, it is no longer meaningful to mention international class struggle and global unity and communism. After the Soviet video, there are always some young people who are excited to say-the future world must be the world of red flags, and Internaxonel must be realized and so on.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fq3JBuQN2BjXaCieE32DB.jpg?height=500&width=700)\n\nIn fact, this statement is quite unconsidered. In the 21st century, international communist movement is already impossible. Upper decision decided by the economic background. In the 21st century, it is not Marx in itself to hold on to the 20th-century ideals. The most vigorous international communist movement in the 20th century was the beginning of the 20th century. Why was there a red tide around the world at that time? Because the servants who brought the British master's family did not dare to get married in order to serve the masters, the American factories closed down, and a large number of laid-off workers had no food and clothing. The plantation workers in Central America picked bananas like slaves every day. The Chinese farmers were in three mountains. People were lingering under the oppression. Everyone had different nationalities and different situations, but they were all the same poor people, all the same being exploited and bullied, so at that time they were able to sweep the world and create a new world together. However, what are the characteristics of the 21st century? It is the transfer of the main contradiction. Globalization has allowed industrial oppression to replace class oppression, and national contradiction has become the main class contradiction. Simply put, the main contradiction of the 21st century has changed from the previous bourgeois exploitation of the proletariat to the developed countries exploiting the developing countries. The essence is the same, but the form is quite different. A British driver may earn 500,000 yuan a year, and a Chinese driver may only earn 50,000 yuan a year. Is it because the former drives ten times better than the latter? No, it is because the former is in the upstream of the industrial chain in the UK, while the latter is in the lower reaches of the industrial chain in China. The capitalist who brought the British is not the enemy of the British driver, but his benefactor. Because British society did not exploit the surplus value of British drivers, but because capitalists exploited a large amount of wealth from developing countries, British drivers received far more money than they created value. If there are no legal restrictions, British capitalists can use one-fifth of the money to hire Chinese to replace British drivers. In this case, it is impossible for you to let British drivers have the same class feelings as Chinese drivers. The red necks of the United States, if they get the education level of the developing countries, they will never have the chance to open a pickup truck to eat steak in their entire life. But they were born in the United States and can enjoy the shadow of the exploiting class. For American capitalists, they are negative equity. American companies have long transferred their exploited positions abroad. This group of people has no value for being exploited. Their enemy is indeed not capitalists, but Chinese workers who charge lower prices than them. Similarly, taking the textile industry as an example, China’s textile workers are very hardworking, earning only a few thousand yuan a month. But the textile workers in Bangladesh and Vietnam worked harder, earning only a thousand yuan or even a few hundred yuan a month. Capital flowed from China to Bangladesh, Vietnam. The latter robbed the former of their jobs. The two groups really share feelings. NS? British bus drivers, American cattle red-necked, ordinary Chinese laborers, and Bangladeshi textile factory workers who work 18 hours a day. They are all proletariat, but do they have common class feelings?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tZWlRSkfzFW8Tndd5xuQw.jpg?height=727&width=1024)\n\nThe proletariat in the developing countries and the proletariat in the developed countries now have no class sentiments, which Lenin had anticipated long ago. Not to mention unity, even peaceful coexistence is difficult to achieve. The era of abandoning the national concept and the global proletarian unity is gone forever. The struggle between China and the United States today is still essentially a struggle between the exploited classes downstream of the industry and the exploiting classes upstream of the industry. The 21st century is a dull century. Without the grandeur of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, it seems to have become a national struggle. But in essence, it is still a struggle waged by the exploited for their right to development. From this point of view, although China has not inherited the Soviet legal system, it has inherited the Soviet spirit. It's not river water, it's the heroic blood that has been shed endlessly for two decades.", "timestamp": 1635312858, "digest": "FBoaQMEtii3q5BUat8B3pt1D9DxTnYyTvqsU1MKeJxk", "contributor": "0x6b2Ec857Db10438439B695c9cd68bB3DbE2D8DBd"}

Mientras más *trustless*, *permissionless* y *neutralmente creíble* sea un protocolo, mayor es su potencial de convertirse en una plataforma global y de absorber capital.\n\nLos protocolos que ofrecen una plataforma sobre la que construir se vuelven \\*densos. \\*Esta densidad hace que caigan a un punto más profundo en el Protocol Sink debido al peso colectivo de todas las personas y empresas que construyen sobre ellos.\n\nLa tesis del Protocol Sink sostiene que los protocolos [DeFi](https://medium.com/astec/introducci%C3%B3n-a-las-finanzas-descentralizadas-defi-80319218815f) de Web3 como Uniswap, Compound y MakerDAO sobrevivirán en el largo plazo a medida que ganan antifragilidad, lo que les permitirá romper los límites de escala que alcanzaron las aplicaciones de la Web2.\n\n## Los Protocolos en la Web2\n\nAlgunas señales tempranas de la tesis del Protocol Sink ya pueden observarse en las plataformas de la Web2 como YouTube, Twitter y Facebook. Casi todas las empresas tienen perfiles en ellas.\n\nPlataformas como el iOS Apple Store y el Android Store se encuentran en los niveles más profundos del Protocol Sink, debido a la enorme masa de las compañías que construyen sus productos sobre iOS y Android.\n\nGoogle, Amazon, Apple, Facebook o Twitter alcanzaron enormes valuaciones porque crearon plataformas para que otros construyeran sobre ellas. Dieron a empresas, individuos y todo tipo de organizaciones acceso libre para registrarse y usar sus servicios.\n\nAsí fue como se convirtieron en una infraestructura global utilizada por todo el mundo. Estas plataformas escalaron globalmente porque crearon productos con enorme utilidad mientras que mantuvieron una actitud de relativo *laissez-faire* sobre lo que los usuarios podían o no hacer en ellas.\n\nLa Web2 es una ilustración de los mismos resultados que predice la tesis del Protocol Sink. Plataformas globales, no rivales y no exclusivas como Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube o Medium lograron enorme adopción y crecimiento gracias a la densidad que alcanzaron por el contenido gratuito generado por los usuarios y su habilidad de escalar a la mayor audiencia posible.\n\nSin embargo, en última instancia son productos creados por empresas privadas. Y estas empresas responden a los reguladores de los estados nacionales.\n\nAl tratarse de empresas con fines de lucro, tienen un incentivo a extraer todo el beneficio posible de sus usuarios y generar ingresos por la venta de publicidad a anunciantes. La falta de alineamiento entre los tres actores pone un límite a la capacidad de escalar que tienen estas plataformas.\n\nTwitter, Facebook y YouTube son servicios globales gratuitos que generaron enorme valor para el mundo. Pero, al final del día son la propiedad privada de una empresa. Estos productos benefician a cierto grupo de gente sobre otros, y permiten la influencia y la coerción de la gente que los usa.\n\nNo importa cuánto valor provean esas compañías. Nunca será suficiente para llegar al fondo del Protocol Sink. Para llegar a la parte más profunda, no puedes ser una empresa con fines de lucro que responde a regulación gubernamental. Tienes que ser un protocolo global autorregulado que no necesite de un operador central. El protocolo debe ser soberano por sí mismo.\n\nEl protocolo tiene que ser parecido a los protocolos de la Web1: TCP/IP, HTTP y FTP. Estos son los protocolos más densos que existen y se encuentran en la parte más profunda del Protocol Sink. Casi no hablamos de ellos por lo invisibles que se han vuelto para nosotros.\n\nAdemás, a diferencia de los protocolos de la Web3, no podemos invertir en ellos. Tienen una neutralidad creíble perfecta. Los protocolos Web3, aplicaciones que existen en Ethereum, deben aspirar a alcanzar el mismo nivel de neutralidad creíble que los protocolos de la Web1.\n\n![Tim Berners-Lee y Vint Cerf, creadores del protocolo HTTP y TCP/IP.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*OE5c_NPWO6wmD8DsEi8chg@2x.jpeg)\n\n## La Predicción del Protocol Sink\n\nLa predicción central de la tesis del Protocol Sink es que, en el futuro, todo tipo de negocios y empresas construirán productos y servicios sobre protocolos *trustless*, *permissionless* (que no requieren de permiso para ser usados) y neutrales (que no benefician a ciertos usuarios sobre otros).\n\nLos protocolos criptoeconómicos están destinados a caer a una parte más profunda del Protocol Sink que las empresas centralizadas. Por ejemplo, empresas centralizadas como criptobancos (ej. Coinbase y Gemini) construirán sus negocios sobre protocolos descentralizados para dar valor a sus clientes.\n\nCualquier criptobanco puede mejorar sus productos y servicios dando a sus usuarios acceso a la [Tasa de Ahorro de Dai (DSR)](https://defirate.com/dai-savings-rate/). Con solo un clic, los usuarios con DAI en su cuenta pueden empezar a cobrar la rentabilidad que ofrece DSR.\n\nCoinbase y Gemini son competidores entre sí. Pero ninguno compite con el DSR. Esto permite al DSR escalar a cualquier institución financiera o individuo que quiera utilizarlo. Y el mismo modelo vale para cualquier protocolo o aplicación de Ethereum: Maker, Compound, PoolTogether, Augur…\n\n> *Los Bienes Públicos Globales (Global Public Goods, GPG) son los que están en el fondo del Protocol Sink.*\n\nSon protocolos completamente trustless, permissionless y neutrales que serán utilizados por empresas, bancos e individuos de todo el mundo. Los Bienes Públicos Globales no responden a (y ni siquiera reconocen) las regulaciones de los estados nacionales.\n\nComo el agua y el aire, el conocimiento y los protocolos de Internet son iguales en todo el mundo y no cambian según la regulación de cada jurisdicción. Son algo que todos pueden usar, sin importar donde vivan.\n\n## Sinks, Puntos de Atracción y Cuencas\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/510/0\\*22BSfVV4Yq1UGJL0)\n\nUn Sink es un lugar de convergencia. Un ambiente que define los bordes y límites de un sistema cerrado, que influye en la trayectoria y los resultados de todas las entidades que hay dentro.\n\nEl Sink fuerza a un conjunto de entes caóticos a ordenarse en un patrón con resultados predecibles. Con el tiempo, todo converge hacia esa situación estable, sin importar cuán caóticas eran las condiciones iniciales.\n\nSink puede traducirse como “Cuenca”. La cuenca del Mississippi es una de las más grandes del mundo. Cualquier gota de agua que caiga dentro de la región rosa del mapa terminará en el punto de convergencia de ese sistema: donde el río Mississippi se une con el Océano Atlántico.\n\n![El círculo rojo indica el punto de convergencia de la cuenca del Mississipi.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*qG3tAiMUWJFumOka)\n\nEthereum también es una cuenca. Las aplicaciones de Ethereum son los arroyos y ríos que vierten en ella. Los activos financieros y el capital son el agua que fluye. Hay un punto de atracción en el fondo del Protocol Sink que tira hacia abajo a las aplicaciones y los activos. Este punto de atracción es la demanda colectiva universal por Bienes Públicos Globales.\n\n![Este gráfico representa perfectamente el Protocol Sink. Las cosas convergen en Ethereum y caen hacia el punto de atracción. También ilustra que Ethereum no es una colección de aplicaciones separadas, sino una única red de aplicaciones interconectadas. Fuente: Paul Salisbury, Techemy Capital.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ZzrW2NHQOrowYdQq)\n\nLa demanda por plataformas globales con valor generado por los usuarios es ubicua y genera un incentivo perpetuo a construir aplicaciones en Ethereum.\n\nEthereum es el Sink para ‘coordinadores mínimamente extractivos’: una cuenca de Internet donde convergen aplicaciones financieras permissionless, trustless y neutrales. La innovación fundamental que trae Ethereum es que se trata de un sistema que ofrece seguridad y protección gratuita a aplicaciones que aspiren a convertirse en Bienes Públicos Globales.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*8a5HhfH80o0XJk_R)\n\n## El Protocol Sink\n\nLa revolución del blockchain está basada en el supuesto fundamental de que, cuando alcance su forma final, se habrá generado una variedad de Bienes Públicos Globales en el campo de las finanzas.\n\nLos Bienes Públicos Globales son la infraestructura más útil, escalable y persistente que existe, y las cualidades que hacen de un buen Bien Público Global son las mismas que hacen que un protocolo llegue a la parte más profunda del Protocol Sink.\n\nHay dos características centrales que predicen en qué lugar del Protocol Sink terminará un protocolo: la utilidad y la superficie de ataque.\n\n## **Utilidad**\n\nLa utilidad de un protocolo es el valor que brinda a sus usuarios, y que genera el incentivo para adoptar el protocolo. Mientras más útil sea un protocolo, más personas y empresas construirán sobre él. En el caso de protocolos con un criptoactivo nativo, la utilidad puede medirse por el valor de mercado de los tokens.\n\n**Mientras más utilidad tenga un protocolo, más profundo estará en el Protocol Sink.**\n\n## **Superficie de ataque**\n\nLa superficie de ataque de un protocolo se refiere a cuán resistente es frente a la coerción, la corrupción o la explotación.\n\nLos protocolos con gran superficie de ataque pueden ser coercionados o explotados para beneficiar a ciertos individuos sobre otros, lo que invalida su neutralidad creíble.\n\nLa reducción de la superficie de ataque reduce las maneras en las que un protocolo favorece a un conjunto de individuos sobre los demás. Si un protocolo tiene una superficie de ataque mínima, entonces es *trustless*, *permissionless* y creíblemente neutral.\n\n**Tener las cualidades de trustless, permissionless y neutralidad hace que el protocolo se vuelva más denso y alcance un lugar más profundo en el Protocol Sink.**\n\n> **Trustless**\n>\n> Cuando se usa el protocolo, ¿cuánta confianza deben depositar los usuarios en que los otros “harán lo correcto”?\n>\n> ¿Hay alguien que esté extrayendo algo de los usuarios contra su voluntad o conocimiento?\n>\n> **Si no es necesario que haya confianza, el protocolo estará en un lugar más profundo del Protocol Sink.**\n>\n> **Permissionless**\n>\n> \\- ¿Cualquiera puede usar el protocolo?\n>\n> \\- ¿Hay alguien que pueda restringir o censurar el uso del protocolo?\n>\n> \\- ¿Hay llaves de administrador que dan ciertos privilegios a determinados grupos de usuarios?\n>\n> **Si todos tienen igual acceso y nadie puede censurar a otros, el protocolo estará en un lugar más profundo del Protocol Sink.**\n>\n> **Neutralidad Creíble**\n>\n> \\- ¿El protocolo beneficia a algún usuario particular sobre otro?\n>\n> \\- ¿Alguna persona o entidad se beneficia desproporcionadamente del éxito del protocolo?\n>\n> **Si el protocolo es lo suficientemente equitativo, entonces estará en un lugar más profundo del Protocol Sink.**\n\n## Bienes Públicos Globales\n\nLos Bienes Públicos Globales son bienes públicos cuyos beneficios se extienden a todos los países y personas. Tienen la cualidad de ser antifrágiles: se vuelven mejores y más robustos a medida que más personas los usan. Mientras más consumido/usado sea un Bien Público Global, más fuerte se vuelve.\n\nLas ideas y el conocimiento son Bienes Públicos Globales; cuando compartes una idea, también retienes esa idea, y habilitas a otros a usarla y compartirla. Internet también es un Bien Público Global. Cuando usas Internet, no impides a otros utilizarla también, y mientras más gente use Internet más útil se vuelve para todos.\n\nTradicionalmente, el problema con los bienes públicos fue que pueden ser utilizados por personas que no están pagando su parte.\n\nEl alumbrado público es un bien público que requiere recursos para construirse y energía para su mantenimiento. Esto requiere que se carguen impuestos sobre sus usuarios. Los usuarios que no pagan su parte de los impuestos están poniendo una carga sobre la posibilidad del bien público para escalar y volverse más útil.\n\nEste es el motivo por el que el alumbrado público no es un Bien Público Global: un mayor uso no lo hace más escalable.\n\nLos Bienes Públicos Globales son bienes públicos inmunes al problema del *free-rider*. Tienen incorporado cierto mecanismo que hace que los usuarios tengan que realizar cierta contribución cada vez que los usan.\n\nNo puedes usar un Bien Público Global sin devolver cierta cantidad de valor, y ese valor es superior al mínimo para mantener al Bien Público Global en funcionamiento.\n\nEn lugar de “la tragedia de los comunes”, los Bienes Públicos Globales son “el festival de los comunes”, donde los comunes son el lugar donde podemos celebrar la utilidad compartida que nos dan estos bienes y que mejoran a medida que el festival crece.\n\n![Elinor Ostrom, Premio Nobel de Economía 2009, desarrolló el concepto de “tragedia de los comunes” para ilustrar la situación de sobreutilización que suele ocurrir en los bienes públicos.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*UYf29mLGjj48W6GfF9_Tww.jpeg)\n\n## Ethereum es un Protocolo para Bienes Públicos Globales\n\nLos parques nacionales son bienes públicos que reciben la protección de las leyes y regulaciones del gobierno de Estados Unidos. Sin esta protección, habrían sucumbido a la tragedia de los comunes o se habrían subdividido en parcelas de propiedad privada que no podría ser utilizada por el público en general.\n\nPara mantener el estatus de bienes públicos de los parques nacionales, el gobierno de Estados Unidos los protege con reglas y regulaciones. Pone restricciones al ingreso y uso para preservar la posibilidad de que los parques sean apreciados por cualquiera y también por las próximas generaciones. Sin esta protección, los parques nacionales no existirían. No tienen la antifragilidad necesaria para ser autosoberanos y autosostenibles. Necesitan ayuda externa.\n\nEl protocolo Estados Unidos protege y mantiene bienes públicos porque existe una creencia compartida de que algunas cosas deberían ser bienes públicos, pero que sin protección se deteriorarían o se convertirían en propiedad privada.\n\nEthereum sigue una lógica similar. Pero en lugar de ser bienes públicos locales como los parques nacionales, es una plataforma que provee un ambiente favorable para la construcción de aplicaciones que aspiren a ser Bienes Públicos Globales.\n\nUniswap, MakerDAO y Compound, como aplicaciones financieras, son mejores porque no están restringidas ni reguladas. Los préstamos colateralizados son más útiles cuando no están sujetos a las regulaciones de Wall Street. Prestar y pedir prestado es más eficiente cuando las reglas están incorporadas en el protocolo y no administradas desde un gobierno central.\n\nEthereum tiene la seguridad incorporada dentro del protocolo, lo que permite que las aplicaciones construidas sobre ella no tengan que preocuparse por esto. Es un protocolo para protocolos.\n\nGracias a la seguridad ofrecida por Ethereum, las aplicaciones pueden reemplazar las reglas y regulaciones de los estados nacionales por las propias reglas que los diseñadores de los protocolos consideraron óptimas para su aplicación particular.\n\nUniswap, Compound y MakerDAO obtienen su soberanía de Ethereum. Y las únicas reglas que Ethereum impone sobre ellos es que cumplan con las reglas del protocolo. De esta forma, Ethereum es un protocolo que permite la creación de aplicaciones de autosoberanía financiera.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*PfxcDpQnNbFkaY0g)\n\n## Ethereum Como Punto de Atracción de Bienes Públicos Globales\n\nEl futuro de Ethereum es un panorama de Bienes Públicos Globales antifrágiles. Actualmente, sólo hay unas pocas aplicaciones que están en el fondo del Protocol Sink, con sólo unos pocos cientos de millones de densidad.\n\nCon el tiempo, a medida que se acumule mayor masa en el fondo, la influencia del campo gravitacional se volverá más fuerte. Esta influencia empujará hacia abajo algunas cosas que hoy están más arriba en el Protocol Sink y las convertirá en Bienes Públicos Globales.\n\nLa creciente masa en el fondo del Protocol Sink ejerce una influencia gravitacional que se extiende más allá del ecosistema de Ethereum. Con el tiempo, más valor va a migrar a los Bienes Públicos Globales en el fondo del Protocol Sink.\n\n> “Muéstrame el incentivo y yo te mostraré el resultado”\n\nEsta famosa máxima de Charlie Munger ilustra el enorme potencial que tiene el ecosistema de Ethereum. Los Bienes Públicos Globales ofrecen incentivos demasiado fuertes como para ser obviados.\n\nEthereum es un paraíso del libre mercado donde la competencia es feroz para que las únicas cosas que sobrevivan al final sean Bienes Públicos Globales antifrágiles. Todo lo demás encontrará su lugar en sitios más elevados en el Protocol Sink.\n\nVeo con optimismo a la Web3 que nos traerá el Protocol Sink. Será 100 veces más útil que la Web2, pero con la misma equidad y neutralidad creíble que la Web1. Cuando esté entre nosotros, la humanidad realmente se parecerá a una única comunidad global.", "timestamp": 1635313714, "digest": "JBktThatIvMkkt9nGMkUgXZqZcHopBm-lcGLsFFrvZE", "contributor": "0xf12C67e80E309eaC0c4dc18Fb26e68F9672297E9"}

Los artistas se están moviendo hacia modelos de auto producción *\\[7\\]* en servicios como SoundCloud y Audius *\\[8\\]* y hacia modelos de auto distribución como Spotify.\n* Shutterstock alberga más de 330 millones de fotografías que pueden licenciarse y generar regalías. *\\[9\\]*\n* Más de mil millones de **nombres de dominio** son registrados todos los años. *\\[10\\]*\n* Subimos a Internet unas 1.800 millones de **imágenes** por día \\[11\\]. *Esto* *es* 657 mil millones de imágenes por año.\n* Generamos unos 200 mil millones de **tweets** por año *\\[12\\]*, algunos de los cuales consiguen decenas de millones de vistas y se vuelven piezas emblemáticas de historia o de la cultura popular. *\\[13\\]* En Internet, actualmente hay más de 600 millones de blogs.\n\nEsta lista sólo muestra la superficie del amplio espectro de los contenidos digitales. Pero no deberíamos pensar en los NFTs como en un contenido digital tokenizado en sí mismo. Un observador agudo ve a los NFTs como un instrumento que encapsula los derechos de propiedad intelectual de los activos que describe. \\[14\\]\n\nActualmente, no somos dueños de prácticamente nada en Internet: compramos licencias de libros de Amazon, alquilamos reproducciones de música de Apple Music y pagamos a una empresa de registros para pedir prestados dominios por un tiempo.\n\nIncluso cuando creamos nuestro propio contenido, los derechos con frecuencia son propiedad de la plataforma, el distribuidor o el sello discográfico. (En un caso famoso, a Taylor Swift se le prohibió tocar su propia música \\[15\\] tras haber cedido los derechos.)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*uPIfLjf468IFVIM-CWEQDA.jpeg)\n\nSi no podemos realmente ser dueños de contenido digital (o de darlo en licencia fácilmente) entonces seguramente nunca podremos revenderlo.\n\nLas blockchains y los NFTs cambiarán dramáticamente este estado de cosas.\n\nPrimero, **van a digitalizar los derechos a contenido digital bajo la forma de criptoactivos de blockchain**.\n\nSegundo, van a **permitir que los activos sean colocados en mercados secundarios**.\n\nEntonces, podemos ver a los NFTs como propiedad intelectual líquida (“IP líquido”) \\[18\\] para todas las formas de contenido digital. Un mercado de billones de dólares a punto de ser tokenizado.\n\nTokenizar IP supone que el creador atribuye derechos de propiedad intelectual real, ejecutables por la ley o por smart contracts, como parte del proceso de emisión. Esto trae ciertos problemas técnicos que deben resolverse, como elegir las jurisdicciones legales donde los derechos de propiedad serán ejecutados y conectar acuerdos legales con el proceso de emisión.\n\n## Los NFTs como una Clase de Activo Financiero\n\nSi los NFTs son IP líquida, entonces los tenedores eventualmente van a recibir los flujos de ingresos de esa propiedad. Este hecho hace que los tokens no fungibles sean un activo financiero.\n\nEn el futuro, comprar un NFT dará al dueño ciertos derechos relacionados con su contenido: el derecho a ser propietario y mantenerlo; el derecho a vender, licenciar, y prestar; así como el derecho a obtener regalías, el derecho a ceder el reuso (ej., “derechos de películas”) y demás.\n\nEse es el motivo por el que sacar una fotografía de la Mona Lisa no es lo mismo que ser el dueño de la obra maestra de Leonardo Da Vinci. No vas a poder cobrar entrada a los más de 10 millones de visitantes anuales que recibe el Louvre para ver la obra. \\[19\\] Un principio similar aplica a los objetos digitales y sus futuros cashflows.\n\nA medida que la propiedad intelectual inevitablemente se mueve a los blockchains como NFTs, billones de unidades de contenido digital se moverán a los mercados secundarios. Esto liberará un valor ilíquido tremendo y se convertirá en la categoría de activo más grande del blockchain.\n\nLa tokenización crea nuevas formas de trabajar con IP que no estaban previamente disponibles o que eran demasiado caras de poner en marcha. Por ejemplo, la tecnología de blockchain automatizará la trazabilidad del IP, el tracking del uso y la gestión de derechos. Usando estándares existentes y smart contracts, los NFTs pueden fraccionalizarse, tener co-propietarios y ser gobernados por múltiples usuarios o comunidades.\n\nEstas fracciones de tokens pueden tradearse, usarse en crowdfunding e incorporarse en otros esquemas financieros para gestionar el riesgo o destrabar incluso más valor. (Proyectos como OpenLaw están explorando en tecnología de regalías. \\[20\\])\n\nAunque la tokenización impactará la liquidez de la propiedad intelectual tradicional, otros casos de uso nativos digitales surgirán a medida que miramos hacia el futuro.\n\nImagina ser propietario de las regalías del nuevo album de Taylor Swift Folklore, o tradear un índice de tus artistas digitales favoritos como Frenetik Void \\[21\\] o Pak. \\[22\\] Imagina vender un modelo digital 3D que construiste o licenciar una fotografía que sacaste directamente desde tu móvil hacia un mercado global. Más exóticamente, imagina apoyar a tu blogger o influencer favorito comprando y siendo dueño de su blog post o Instagram Story.\n\nAunque el metaverso parece un lejano sueño digital, sus activos digitales ya están aquí y nuevos tipos de inversores se están dando cuenta. Sfermion de Andrew Steinwold es una firma nativa del metaverso que invierte en “activos digitales esotéricos” \\[23\\], esto es, NFTs de mundos virtuales, arte digital, y activos relacionados. Sospecho que esos activos no serán esotéricos por mucho tiempo más.\n\nEmpresas como Fortnite ya están midiendo los flujos de ingresos en miles de millones de dólares basados en objetos digitales dentro del juego, mientras que el NBA Top Shot de Dapper Labs acaba de llevar los coleccionables a la industria deportiva.\n\nLos NFTs están por volverse un nuevo y voluminoso tipo de activo financiero. Para capturar su valor, necesitamos lugares para vender, subastar, y tradear esos nuevos activos.\n\n## Referencias\n\n\\[1\\] NFTs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token>\n\n\\[2\\] Digital art <https://app.rarible.com/frenetik/created>\n\n\\[3\\] Collectibles <https://www.cryptokitties.co/>\n\n\\[4\\] In-game assets <https://www.cryptovoxels.com/wearables>\n\n\\[5\\] TurboSquid marketplace <https://blog.turbosquid.com/2016/03/10/real-time-portal-60k-3d-assets/>\n\n\\[6\\] Annual album volume <https://www.quora.com/How-many-albums-and-singles-are-released-a-year-worldwide>\n\n\\[7\\] Self-publication on SoundCloud <https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/digital-and-mobile/8551334/soundcloud-mobile-upload-artists-recordings>\n\n\\[8\\] Audius <https://audius.co/>\n\n\\[9\\] ShutterStock [https://shutterstock.com](https://shutterstock.com/)\n\n\\[10\\] Domain name registrations <https://www.quora.com/How-many-domains-name-are-registered>\n\n\\[11\\] Daily image uploads <https://www.dailydot.com/debug/mary-meeker-photo-report/>\n\n\\[12\\] Tweets per year <https://www.dsayce.com/social-media/tweets-day>\n\n\\[13\\] “Funding secured” <https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776?s=20>\n\n\\[14\\] NFTs as intellectual property rights <https://twitter.com/jbrukh/status/1296046387952594944?s=20>\n\n\\[15\\] Taylor Swift music rights <https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/entertainment/taylor-swift-scooter-braun/index.html>\n\n\\[16\\] The LAO <https://medium.com/openlawofficial/the-lao-a-for-profit-limited-liability-autonomous-organization-9eae89c9669c>\n\n\\[17\\] A global, digital jurisdiction <https://aragon.org/blog/aragon-network-on-a-path-towards-a-digital-jurisdiction-752ccf4b9d5c>\n\n\\[18\\] Mona Lisa at the Louvre <https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/arts/design/mona-lisa-louvre.html>\n\n\\[19\\] Liquid intellectual property <https://twitter.com/jbrukh/status/1296054022693167104?s=20>\n\n\\[20\\] “Modernizing art with blockchains” <https://medium.com/@OpenLawOfficial/modernizing-art-with-blockchains-6cba4694833d>\n\n\\[21\\] Frenetik Void <https://twitter.com/frenetikvoid?lang=en>\n\n\\[22\\] Murat Pak <https://twitter.com/muratpak>\n\n\\[23\\] Andrew Steinwold’s Sfermion <https://medium.com/@andrew_34383/sfermion-a-metaverse-native-investment-firm-6aace1733e61>\n\n\\[24\\] Rarible launched $RARI <https://www.coindesk.com/yield-farming-expands-from-finance-to-digital-collectibles-rarible-nfts>\n\n\\[25a\\] Balancer pool for $RARI <https://balancer.exchange/#/swap/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf>\n\n\\[25b\\] Uniswap pool for $RARI <https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf>\n\n\\[26\\] $RARI airdrop <https://app.rarible.com/rari>\n\n\\[27\\] Russian teams in blockchain <https://twitter.com/jbrukh/status/1297164790347988993?s=20>\n\n\\[28\\] “The 9 core value propositions of crypto networks” <https://blog.coinfund.io/what-we-look-for-the-9-core-value-propositions-of-crypto-networks-88b04d09d873>\n\n\\[29\\] “Community ownership as a blockchain adoption model” <https://blog.coinfund.io/community-ownership-as-a-blockchain-adoption-model-71a87f167de2>", "timestamp": 1635314189, "digest": "s4v2w61liPqfQyWdiKS1wlSLaTfxFBo4DVli7AYtY7U", "contributor": "0xf12C67e80E309eaC0c4dc18Fb26e68F9672297E9"}

To this day, we are consistently a top 15 DEX by volume.\n\nRealizing the difficulties in onboarding capital to a new blockchain, we launched liquidity pools that seamlessly let users move funds to BSC.** Nerve is now the central on- and off-ramp for moving assets between ETH and BSC.**\n\nThis trend of alternative L1 ecosystem's growth has continued to blossom — with Polygon, Solana, Terra, and now Avalanche. Similarly, a number of prominent Ethereum L2’s are coming to market, including Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nThe multi-chain world is already here. **However, capital flows from one chain to another are still heavily constrained by the existing cross-chain infrastructure.**\n\n## Where we’re headed\n\nSynapse is a cross-chain layer ♾️ protocol powering interoperability between blockchains. It consists of two core components:\n\n*   ***The Synapse Network*** — Cross-chain infrastructure powered by multi-party computation validators that collectively react to events on blockchains connected by the Synapse network\n*   ***The Synapse AMM*** — a cross-chain AMM supported by the network that prices and rebalances assets based on capital flow\n\nWith Synapse, cross-chain swaps can now be conducted in a **single** transaction, to & from **any chain connected **by the Synapse Network, in less than **3 minutes**.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*9p-xufy_uXgei9h3eSF1bw.png)\n\nCross-chain swap from Polygon to BSC in minutes\n\nThe evolution into Synapse will also change our existing token. Moving forward, the NRV token will become SYN at a token migration rate of 1 NRV = 2.5 SYN. The SYN token will remain an integral part of the Synapse protocol and ecosystem. Additionally, SYN will be a cross-chain token, available on all chains connected by the Synapse Network.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*TPC0-fsfdNcnLVdLdkDL_w.png)\n\nMore details to come this week, as we continue to build the layer ♾️ protocol of the multi-chain future.\n", "timestamp": 1635314959, "digest": "Y5v1Q21dGDMbRR3LdjehId0EcM4cxB5fkHrDnklj-s4", "contributor": "0x8f32844357f27d8C185255832B914dd7E3eCFB9a"}

倍，其對應的主要代幣在近一個月也漲了近 10 倍之多。這個遊戲，更在東南亞國家掀起一波狂熱，讓當地許多工作受疫情影響的人甚至能夠靠其維生，它就是 Axie Infinity。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*zQ9j0ThQuc2kDgmR5BrexQ.png)\n\nAxie Infinity Statistics src: <https://dappradar.com/ethereum/games/axie-infinity>\n\n## Axie Infinity 的背景\n\n## 公司簡介\n\nAxie Infinity 是由越南的區塊鏈發行商 Sky Mavis 所發行的遊戲。Sky Mavis 由越南工程師 *Trung Nguyen* 與 \\*Aleksander Leonard Larsen \\*和 *Jeffrey Zirlin* 於 2018 年共同創立。Axie Infinity 的創造，很大一部分是根基在 *Trung Nguyen* 對於 Dapper Labs 的知名遊戲 CryptoKitties 的迷戀。\n\n值得一提的是，*Trung Nguyen* 在 2012 年創辦的公司 Lozi (後 pivot 成 Loship) 一開始是一個分享美食的 social app，pivot 之後變成一個越南版的 Lalamove + Ubereats 的平台，在今年 2 月募到了 Series C，投資人包含 Skype 的共同創辦人 *Jaan Tallinn*。\n\n而在今年五月，Axie Infinity 還沒實質性迎來爆炸性成長之前，Sky Mavis 就完成了 Series A round 的 funding。這次 Series A 的投資人來頭個個不小，機構方面除了領投的 Libertus Capital 外，還包含了 500 Starups, Collab+Currency, Defi Alliance, CoinGecko Ventures, 以及遊戲開發商 Animoca Brands。個人投資人也包含 Mark Cuban, Alexis Ohanian 等科技業大佬。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*cL5ALjWhCVs5AG6tO6hCFQ.png)\n\nList of Sky Mavis series A investors\n\n## Tokenomics & Revenue Model\n\n在 Axie Infinity 中主要有兩種代幣：**SLP 和 AXS**。SLP 的供給量無上限，是玩家在遊戲中主要獲得的獎勵來源，而平衡方式是玩家需要付出一定數量的 SLP 以繁衍新的 Axie。另一個代幣 AXS 在 [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/axs/allocations-and-unlock) 中提到，一開始 (2020/11/4) 的 initial supply 是 59,985,000 個 AXS (約為最大供給的 22.22%)，而最大供給量為 270,000,000 個。分配的單位如下面左圖所示，且每個單位的解鎖方式和時間都不盡相同。\n\n其中 Play to Earn 的份額是玩家主要在遊戲中獲得 AXS 的方式，以目前來說只有在和玩家對戰獲勝夠多登上排行榜才能拿到。Staking Rewards 是官方還在規劃的項目， Q3 才會正式上線。Ecosystem Fund 則是為了促進 community 的緊密度而設立，沒有太多說明，猜測是類似 airdrop 的行銷活動。 Sky Mavis 擁有 21% 的份額為的是讓團隊和整體遊戲利益一致，而 20% 左右的分配在區塊鏈世界當中算蠻合理的。至於 Advisor 是一些和 Sky Mavis 有合作的團隊，像是 Binance, Hashed, Sandbox 等。Public Sale 和 Private Sale 則是較為單純的募資行為。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3104/1\\*88FoLXSd4vsOwKFsLOVeAA.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2960/1\\*Yd94wSbh6YtBpHRdJBnTtA.png)\n\nAxie Infinity 的 revenue model 則相當簡單粗暴，目前主要的收入來源只有兩個：每一次繁殖新的 Axie 需要付出 4 個 AXS，和市場上每一次交易都會收 4.25% 的交易手續費。\n\n## 遊戲內容\n\nAxie Infinity 的遊戲內容大方向上很簡單，主要的對戰可以想像成是一個 3 對 3 的 Pokemon Go ，除了對戰外，還包含主要的寵物 Axie 的養成以及繁殖，另外未來還會開放土地增加遊戲的豐富程度。每一隻 Axie 會有不同的技能和能力值。和大部分的卡牌遊戲相同，玩家所持有的 Axie 的強度對勝負有蠻大的影響，但在對戰的過程中玩家還是可以選擇不同的策略和打法來增加自己的勝率。\n\n## Axie 的特性\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*veyezWIj2a3X9RR2G2HRMg.png)\n\nAn Axie’s stats src: <https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-infinity-community-alpha-guide>\n\n一隻 Axie 主要有四種能力值，分別是 Health, Speed, Skill, Morale。\n\n根據官方的[講解](https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-infinity-community-alpha-guide)，我們可以理解 Health 指的就是血量多厚、Speed 決定對戰時兩隻 Axie 由誰先攻、Skill 決定了當 Axie 用上多張卡時造成的傷害多高，Morale 則是類似爆擊率的概念。而**這些 stats 主要會由 Axie 的 class 和 body parts 決定。**\n\nAxie 的 class 主要有 6 種 base class，分別為 Beast, Bug, Bird, Reptile, Plant, and Aquatic。而比較特別的是還有 3 種 secret class 是需要特別的組合才能繁殖出來。這三種 secret class 分別為 Dusk, Mech, and Dawn。繁衍這三個特殊品種的 recipes 如下：\n\n> Dusk Class: 33% chance when breeding a pure Reptile with a pure Aquatic.\n>\n> Mech Class: 33% chance when breeding a pure Bug with a pure Beast.\n>\n> Dawn Class: 33% chance when breeding a pure Plant with a pure Bird.\n\n下方左表呈現了所有 class 的 base stats 是多少，可以看出 secret class 創造出了不同的 stats combinations，也讓遊戲的豐富度增加。而就像 Pokemon 裡面不同屬性的 Pokemon 會互剋，如下方右表所示，不同 class 的 Axie 彼此之間也有類似的概念。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1830/1\\*doeNC1uMpQfS4TQb8hHT6Q.jpeg)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2088/1\\*G5B8HqkA4rIZ1JjYD9sW-w.png)\n\nbody parts 則分成了 eyes, ears, horn, mouth, back, and tail，每一個 body part 會根據其 class 依照下表的方式來提升 Axie 的 base stats，而 horns, mouths, backs, and tails 則對應著 Axie 能夠使用的技能卡。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PdN465PZl8g1WTPnvqfKRQ.png)\n\n## Breeding\n\n在遊戲當中，Breeding(繁殖）也是很重要的遊戲環節，玩家可以透過配對兩隻擁有的 Axie 繁殖新的 Axie。而要想完成繁衍的行為，需要兩種遊戲中的主要代幣： AXS 和 SLP\\*\\*。\\*\\* AXS 主要獲得方式是每一季排名前 300 名的玩家可以獲得豐厚的 AXS 獎勵，而 SLP 則是在遊戲的對戰、任務中可以獲得。對於新手玩家來說，SLP 相對是比較好搜集的代幣，AXS 則是多從市場購得。\n\n在繁殖的時候，固定需要消耗 4 個 AXS，而 SLP 則是根據 \\*\\*parent Axie 的 breed count 相加，根據下表的數據決定需要多少個。\\*\\*舉例來說，假設兩隻 breed count 為 0 的 Axie 想要繁殖，就需要 150+150=300 個 SLP (Smooth Love Potion LOL) 做為催化劑。繁殖完成後 Axie 會先以蛋的形式呈現，而其需要 5 天的時間才會成熟長成 Axie。在這過程中，其實玩家就可以將蛋到市場上去販售，價格在下面的段落會有更深入的研究。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3096/1\\*TeH9_PjsEepRnScCIPb2aw.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1784/1\\*tCXRXzoHEhZhZ7U_iVAKSQ.png)\n\n```\nBreeding出來的Axie stats的計算是這個遊戲當中相對較複雜的部分，可以使用Axie Simulator根據parent Axie來模擬出child Axie的屬性可能為何。\n```\n\n## 對戰\n\n目前來說，玩家獲得 SLP 的方法主要有兩個：**完成每日任務、進行對戰。**\n\n每日任務是相對比較簡單的部分，只要完成就可以獲得 50 個 SLP。而 Axie Infinity 中的對戰可分為兩種：PVE (player versus environment) 和 PVP (player versus player)。PVE 就是和電腦對戰，難度不會太高。在 PVE 模式當中打新的關卡可以獲得較多的 SLP，總的來說一天最多可以透過 PVE 模式獲得 100 個 SLP。而 PVP 只有獲勝時會獲得 SLP，因此在初期 Axie 的等級不夠高時較難在 PVP 的賽場獲得勝利，一般會建議新手先於 PVE 模式磨練，賺取每日最高可獲得的100個 SLP。\n\n在對戰模式中，每進行一次無論是 PVE 或 PVP 的對戰玩家都會消耗一點的能量 (energy)才能獲得經驗值或 SLP，能量並不像其他遊戲可以單純課金補充，而是根據玩家擁有的 Axie 來決定能量點數最多有多少，以及補充的速度有多快：\n\n> **3 to 9 Axies**: 20 Energy, regaining 5 Energy every 6 hours\n>\n> **10 to 19 Axies**: 40 Energy, regaining 5 Energy every 3 hours\n>\n> **20+ Axies:** 60 Energy, regaining 5 Energy every 2 hours\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*I5zcqhzEE6RiFqy-s1KtpA.jpeg)\n\nPVP src:<https://metahub.info/2021/234-intro-to-axie-infinity/>\n\n對戰時是採用 turn-based 的方式進行，每一輪玩家的 Axie 都會輪流攻擊一次，而攻擊的順序則是根據上面提到的 stats 來決定。基本上雙方攻擊的都會是對方擺在最前線的 Axie，但也有些 Axie 擁有先攻擊後排的特殊技能。在對戰開局時，雙方會拿到三點的對戰能量和六張技能卡，每使用一張技能卡需要耗費一點對戰能量，而對戰能量會在每一輪補回兩點。每一輪照順序攻擊對方直到其中一方三隻 Axie 都陣亡遊戲才結束。\n\n而較為有趣的是由於每隻 Axie 的 stats 和技能不同，會出現許多隊伍配置的方式。最基本的概念是需要有些 Axie 做為 Defender 來擋血，有些高輸出的 Axie 則是 Attacker 的角色放在後排攻擊對方。再加上屬性相剋的特性、技能組成，其實有很多很有趣的陣容配置正被玩家熱烈討論且持續發掘中。\n\n```\n在AxieZone可以看到過去幾個賽季表現較好的Axie class及陣容組成。\n```\n\n## 爆紅原因\n\n## Play-To-Earn\n\nPlay-To-Earn 是 Axie Infinity 當中非常重要的一個元素，也是在這幾個月使其爆紅的主要因素。\n\nPlay-To-Earn 是一種被自由經濟圍繞著的 business model，玩家在積極參與遊戲，帶給其他玩家和 developer 價值的過程中能夠獲得獎勵，且這樣的獎勵的「所有權」是真實屬於玩家，且可以在公開市場上交易的。在傳統的線上遊戲中，我們一樣能夠獲得遊戲世界中的代幣或是虛擬寶物，但是這樣的獎勵是充滿中心化色彩的，撇除遊戲公司時不時出現的回溯事件以及擁有所有竄改權不談，光是在傳統遊戲中和法幣的交換往往是單向的，時常需要借助 OTC 平台來完成雙向的溝通這點，就是致命傷。相對地，能夠將代幣所有權方便轉移的區塊鏈世界，無疑為這樣的 gaming 型態提供了完美的平台。\n\n回到 Axie Infinity 本身，前面提到在遊戲當中主要滿足 Play-To-Earn 條件的是 SLP token，以完成每日任務 (50 SLP) 以及 PVE (100SLP) 來計算，一個基本玩家一天最多約能賺 150 個 SLP (目前約 $37.5)，這個數字超過許多開發中國家的最低薪資。遊戲本身在初期每天需要花 3–4 小時經營帳號，後期只需要花 1–2 小時去打 PVP 賺取 SLP，這樣 ”globay pay” 的收入對於許多國家的人是非常優渥的。\n\n## Filipinos\n\n根據 [PlayerCounter](https://playercounter.com/axie-infinity/) 所做的統計，每日遊玩 Axie Infinity 的玩家來源最多的五個國家分別為 **Philippines, Venezuela, United States, Thailand, Brazil**。其中菲律賓佔了 daily active users 中的 **40.53%**。在菲律賓 Axie Infinity 盛行的程度甚至讓 BloomX (在菲律賓當地有取得執照的交易所)和 Binance P2P 都提供了直接換 Philippine Peso 的管道。\n\n根據 [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/philippines/minimum-wages) 的數據，2019 年菲律賓的最低日薪資約為 537 Philippine Peso($10.66)，而上述提到每日可以賺約 $37.5 的薪水，等於是超過三倍的日報酬，且上述提到完成每日賺取 150 SLP 所花費的時間大概是 2–4 小時，簡單推算就可以知道這樣的賺錢方式在當地是非常划算的。除此之外，在 2021 年的 4 月菲律賓當地的疫情又達到了一個高峰，許多菲律賓人受疫情衝擊失去了工作機會，Axie Infinity 無疑提供了這些人一個養活自己，甚至過得更好的機會。22 歲的早期玩家 John Aaron Ramos 甚至在自己的 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AaronWhoang/status/1388419487221882882?s=20) 上宣布他靠著 Axie 的收入已經買了兩套房子。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2956/1\\*KMFCgcLXrCkGBf-oimurwg.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/5760/1\\*bB7CODIJ4koTzIbTeGYu4g.png)\n\n## Scholarships\n\n看到這裡，對這個遊戲稍微有研究的人應該會有個疑問，Axie Infinity 現在的進場費用這麼貴(至少 $1000)，上述提到的那些玩家應該沒有資本去參與這個遊戲才對？這個疑問也引到了 \\*\\*Scholarhships \\*\\*這個主題。\n\nScholarships 是 Axie Infinity 中很特別的非官方機制，在這個世界中，許多玩家沒有進入的資本，或是還在猶豫是否要投入；相對地有許多早期玩家擁有非常多隻 Axie （在 2020 年中組建 3 隻 Axie 只要 $5…），但他們沒有這麼多時間經營這麼多隻 Axie 來賺取每日應得的 SLP。這樣的需求與供給下誕生了兩種角色：\n\nSponsor: 提供有三隻 Axie 的帳號，讓 Scholar 每日登入賺取 SLP\n\nScholar: 無需任何初期投入，每日花時間幫忙賺 SLP\n\n一般來說，Scholar 可以分到 60–70 % 的 SLP 作為獎勵，也就是 Sponsor 會保留 30–40% 的 SLP。以一天 150 SLP 的總收入來算，一個月 Scholar 約可以賺 2,700 — 3,150 個 SLP ($675 — $787.5)。Payout 的方式跟時間通常跟 Sponsor 的條約有關，一般來說是一個月付一次，方式可能是 SLP、USD，或是 PNP(Philippines Peso)。\n\n而這樣的合作方式可行的原因是，Axie Infinity 的 account 和 wallet 並不是在同個介面上，Sponsor 可以創好 wallet，綁定帳號之後只給 Scholar 帳號密碼，甚至是 QR Code 即可，這樣一來 Scholar 並沒有自動轉移 wallet 資產的權限。但這樣的合作方式仍有兩個主要的風險：\n\n1. Sponsor 反悔不付錢\n2. Scholar 貪心接了好幾個 Sponsor 的案子，導致帳號被 banned。（遊戲規定同一個裝置 24 小時之內只能玩一個帳號，不允許多重帳號）\n\n即使如此，現在網路上仍有許多非官方社群來媒合 Sponsor 和 Scholar，或是有些 Twitter、Discord 群本身就是一個 Sponsor 所創立來管理 Scholar 的平台。整體來說這樣的經濟是有風險，但有效率的。\n\n## 還能加入嗎\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*-HyvypnLyTBGJok6LSAA-Q.png)\n\nAxie Infinity marketplace 2021/07/17\n\n我預想有些受眾和我一開始一樣，看到這個遊戲想的問題只有一個：\n\n> 所以在遊戲爆紅過後的現在，還能加入嗎？\n\n我的答案是可以，但風險不小。以下會進行一些簡單的試算。\n\n## 賺取 SLP\n\n想要加入 Axie Infinity，玩家必須先擁有三隻 Axie，一般來說都是從 marketplace 透過綁定 Ronin Wallet (可透過 Metamask 轉錢進去) 來購買 Axie。截至寫文章的今天(2021/07/17)為止，在市場上最便宜的 Axie 的價格大約是 0.18 ETH 左右，買三隻會花我們 0.54ETH ($1020)，先不管錢包的各種 gas fee 的話，這大概就是我們的初期成本。而剛剛提到，一天賺取 150 SLP 的情況下我們可以獲得約 $37.5 的日收入，簡單相除可以得到，大約 27.2 天可以回本。\n\n而這樣的假設有兩個問題，第一個是三隻都買最便宜的 Axie，我們不一定能每天都賺到 150 個 SLP，假設因為 Axie 品質較差我們一天只能賺 100 SLP 的話，就會需要 40.8 天才能回本。第二個問題是 SLP 的價格是浮動的，我們並不能保證當我們想要 cash out SLP 時還會是現在使用的 $0.25/SLP 這個價格，去做空 Perpetual 來鎖住價格的意義也不大，因為 SLP 現在的資金費率年化後大概是 -515%，這個扣血幅度會讓長期做空鎖住價格這件事變得不值得。\n\n## 繁殖型玩家\n\n這樣的玩法主要是盡量生出最多蛋到市場上販售。一般來說 Axie 除非品種很純，否則繁衍到 breed count (3/7) 就會停止，因為在這個級距開始，要付出的 SLP 是上一個級距的 2 倍。試算先去市場上買兩顆蛋 (約 0.3 ETH)，耐心等待五天孵化後成為 Axie 再讓他們繁衍三次，這樣的損益為何：\n\nCost：(0.15+0.15) \\* 1890(蛋) + (300+600+900) \\* 0.25(SLP) + (4+4+4) \\* 19(AXS) = $1,245\n\nRevenue: (0.15+0.15+0.15) \\* 1890(蛋) + (0.18 + 0.18) \\* 1890(Axie) = $1,530.9\n\nProfit: $1,530.9-$1,245 = $285.9\n\n## 其他想法\n\n可以發現，上述試算的損益聽起來不錯，但都是充滿了各種不確定性，遊戲中的這些代幣很大一部分的需求都是來自於新的投資者的加入所帶動，從網路上的討論和本文的分析大概也可以推敲出，有一定比例的玩家是為了其背後能夠賺錢這件事而參與進行投機，這樣的玩家組成很有可能在遊戲開始往下走時造成一連串的逃跑潮導致價格崩跌，這都是進入這個遊戲之前需要考慮清楚的。如果很想參與這個遊戲熱度的紅利，但又不想投入太多初期資本，也許單純投資 SLP、AXS，或是加入名聲好的 Scholar Program 也是不錯的方式。\n\n而其實遊戲本身的對戰也做得相當有意思，這個遊戲絕對不是只有投機的成分，在許多論壇也都可以看到 Axie Infinity 有著一個很強的 community 認真在討論不同的戰略以及對於遊戲未來發展的想法。\n\n我認為如果 Axie Infinity 並沒有這麼吸引你，但又想參與一些自己有興趣、同樣符合 Play-To-Earn ，在未來有機會能夠複製這樣模式爆紅的遊戲，其實有一個網站就叫 [Play-To-Earn](https://www.playtoearn.online/best-play-to-earn-games-with-nfts-or-crypto/)，上面有列出其他符合這樣性質的遊戲。去參與一些玩了開心，在未來又有很好的機會發展起來的遊戲，我認為才是現在做來勝率最高的事。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2aqBC3yxupgztdxUQjdVbg.png)\n\nSome other Play-To-Earn games\n\n## 結語\n\nAxie Infinity 是一個很有趣的項目，探討它爆紅的原因時，我們必須要綜觀全局：除了了解它的代幣經濟，Play-To-Earn 帶給玩家的獎勵，以及背後的 strong comunnity 外，更需要被看見的是東南亞的經濟、民族性，疫情對世界造成的影響，以及人們價值觀的轉變。\n\n而觀察這一年多來區塊鏈世界出現的風口，其實很多都是從傳統世界中已經存在的主題模仿、優化，而後隨著價值觀轉變而出現。去中心化金融其實就是最基本的資金供需，但在傳統世界我們因為信用問題必須透過中心化的媒介；NFT 其實就是將人們搜集卡牌、藝術品的行為搬移到鏈上；而像 Axie Infinity 這種 Play-To-Earn 型態的遊戲，讓我想到小時候在玩線上遊戲時，先儲值點數進去讓角色變強，打到虛寶之後再在遊戲裡面出售或是拿到外部的 OTC 交易所換成法幣。這樣的映射關係讓這些項目的成功都是有跡可循的，相信無論市場牛熊，能夠接受新知並持續思考的人都會在這個世界獲得優渥的報酬。\n\n## References\n\n[Axie Infinity Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/)\n\n[Axie Infinity Alpha Guide](https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-infinity-community-alpha-guide)\n\n[Axie Breeding Guide](https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-breeding-guide)\n\n[For Filipinos, Axie Infinity Is More Than a Crypto Game](https://www.coindesk.com/for-filipinos-axie-infinity-is-more-than-a-crypto-game)\n\n[Axie Zone Statistics](https://axie.zone/pvp-statistics)\n\n[Axie Infinity | DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/ethereum/games/axie-infinity)", "timestamp": 1635315027, "digest": "877Bidc11o_PRZA21tCWrvRllFQBts17SLvlkXOOXYc", "contributor": "0xadd7ed40860AaaA046d274BDAeE4D5d8F7adA955"}

的供給量無上限，是玩家在遊戲中主要獲得的獎勵來源，而平衡方式是玩家需要付出一定數量的 SLP 以繁衍新的 Axie。另一個代幣 AXS 在 [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/axs/allocations-and-unlock) 中提到，一開始 (2020/11/4) 的 initial supply 是 59,985,000 個 AXS (約為最大供給的 22.22%)，而最大供給量為 270,000,000 個。分配的單位如下面左圖所示，且每個單位的解鎖方式和時間都不盡相同。\n\n其中 Play to Earn 的份額是玩家主要在遊戲中獲得 AXS 的方式，以目前來說只有在和玩家對戰獲勝夠多登上排行榜才能拿到。Staking Rewards 是官方還在規劃的項目， Q3 才會正式上線。Ecosystem Fund 則是為了促進 community 的緊密度而設立，沒有太多說明，猜測是類似 airdrop 的行銷活動。 Sky Mavis 擁有 21% 的份額為的是讓團隊和整體遊戲利益一致，而 20% 左右的分配在區塊鏈世界當中算蠻合理的。至於 Advisor 是一些和 Sky Mavis 有合作的團隊，像是 Binance, Hashed, Sandbox 等。Public Sale 和 Private Sale 則是較為單純的募資行為。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3104/1\\*88FoLXSd4vsOwKFsLOVeAA.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2960/1\\*Yd94wSbh6YtBpHRdJBnTtA.png)\n\nAxie Infinity 的 revenue model 則相當簡單粗暴，目前主要的收入來源只有兩個：每一次繁殖新的 Axie 需要付出 4 個 AXS，和市場上每一次交易都會收 4.25% 的交易手續費。\n\n## 遊戲內容\n\nAxie Infinity 的遊戲內容大方向上很簡單，主要的對戰可以想像成是一個 3 對 3 的 Pokemon Go ，除了對戰外，還包含主要的寵物 Axie 的養成以及繁殖，另外未來還會開放土地增加遊戲的豐富程度。每一隻 Axie 會有不同的技能和能力值。和大部分的卡牌遊戲相同，玩家所持有的 Axie 的強度對勝負有蠻大的影響，但在對戰的過程中玩家還是可以選擇不同的策略和打法來增加自己的勝率。\n\n## Axie 的特性\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*veyezWIj2a3X9RR2G2HRMg.png)\n\nAn Axie’s stats src: <https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-infinity-community-alpha-guide>\n\n一隻 Axie 主要有四種能力值，分別是 Health, Speed, Skill, Morale。\n\n根據官方的[講解](https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-infinity-community-alpha-guide)，我們可以理解 Health 指的就是血量多厚、Speed 決定對戰時兩隻 Axie 由誰先攻、Skill 決定了當 Axie 用上多張卡時造成的傷害多高，Morale 則是類似爆擊率的概念。而**這些 stats 主要會由 Axie 的 class 和 body parts 決定。**\n\nAxie 的 class 主要有 6 種 base class，分別為 Beast, Bug, Bird, Reptile, Plant, and Aquatic。而比較特別的是還有 3 種 secret class 是需要特別的組合才能繁殖出來。這三種 secret class 分別為 Dusk, Mech, and Dawn。繁衍這三個特殊品種的 recipes 如下：\n\n> Dusk Class: 33% chance when breeding a pure Reptile with a pure Aquatic.\n>\n> Mech Class: 33% chance when breeding a pure Bug with a pure Beast.\n>\n> Dawn Class: 33% chance when breeding a pure Plant with a pure Bird.\n\n下方左表呈現了所有 class 的 base stats 是多少，可以看出 secret class 創造出了不同的 stats combinations，也讓遊戲的豐富度增加。而就像 Pokemon 裡面不同屬性的 Pokemon 會互剋，如下方右表所示，不同 class 的 Axie 彼此之間也有類似的概念。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1830/1\\*doeNC1uMpQfS4TQb8hHT6Q.jpeg)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2088/1\\*G5B8HqkA4rIZ1JjYD9sW-w.png)\n\nbody parts 則分成了 eyes, ears, horn, mouth, back, and tail，每一個 body part 會根據其 class 依照下表的方式來提升 Axie 的 base stats，而 horns, mouths, backs, and tails 則對應著 Axie 能夠使用的技能卡。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PdN465PZl8g1WTPnvqfKRQ.png)\n\n## Breeding\n\n在遊戲當中，Breeding(繁殖）也是很重要的遊戲環節，玩家可以透過配對兩隻擁有的 Axie 繁殖新的 Axie。而要想完成繁衍的行為，需要兩種遊戲中的主要代幣： AXS 和 SLP**。** AXS 主要獲得方式是每一季排名前 300 名的玩家可以獲得豐厚的 AXS 獎勵，而 SLP 則是在遊戲的對戰、任務中可以獲得。對於新手玩家來說，SLP 相對是比較好搜集的代幣，AXS 則是多從市場購得。\n\n在繁殖的時候，固定需要消耗 4 個 AXS，而 SLP 則是根據 **parent Axie 的 breed count 相加，根據下表的數據決定需要多少個。**舉例來說，假設兩隻 breed count 為 0 的 Axie 想要繁殖，就需要 150+150=300 個 SLP (Smooth Love Potion LOL) 做為催化劑。繁殖完成後 Axie 會先以蛋的形式呈現，而其需要 5 天的時間才會成熟長成 Axie。在這過程中，其實玩家就可以將蛋到市場上去販售，價格在下面的段落會有更深入的研究。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3096/1\\*TeH9\\_PjsEepRnScCIPb2aw.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1784/1\\*tCXRXzoHEhZhZ7U_iVAKSQ.png)\n\n    Breeding出來的Axie stats的計算是這個遊戲當中相對較複雜的部分，可以使用Axie Simulator根據parent Axie來模擬出child Axie的屬性可能為何。\n\n## 對戰\n\n目前來說，玩家獲得 SLP 的方法主要有兩個：**完成每日任務、進行對戰。**\n\n每日任務是相對比較簡單的部分，只要完成就可以獲得 50 個 SLP。而 Axie Infinity 中的對戰可分為兩種：PVE (player versus environment) 和 PVP (player versus player)。PVE 就是和電腦對戰，難度不會太高。在 PVE 模式當中打新的關卡可以獲得較多的 SLP，總的來說一天最多可以透過 PVE 模式獲得 100 個 SLP。而 PVP 只有獲勝時會獲得 SLP，因此在初期 Axie 的等級不夠高時較難在 PVP 的賽場獲得勝利，一般會建議新手先於 PVE 模式磨練，賺取每日最高可獲得的100個 SLP。\n\n在對戰模式中，每進行一次無論是 PVE 或 PVP 的對戰玩家都會消耗一點的能量 (energy)才能獲得經驗值或 SLP，能量並不像其他遊戲可以單純課金補充，而是根據玩家擁有的 Axie 來決定能量點數最多有多少，以及補充的速度有多快：\n\n> **3 to 9 Axies**: 20 Energy, regaining 5 Energy every 6 hours\n>\n> **10 to 19 Axies**: 40 Energy, regaining 5 Energy every 3 hours\n>\n> **20+ Axies:** 60 Energy, regaining 5 Energy every 2 hours\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*I5zcqhzEE6RiFqy-s1KtpA.jpeg)\n\nPVP src:<https://metahub.info/2021/234-intro-to-axie-infinity/>\n\n對戰時是採用 turn-based 的方式進行，每一輪玩家的 Axie 都會輪流攻擊一次，而攻擊的順序則是根據上面提到的 stats 來決定。基本上雙方攻擊的都會是對方擺在最前線的 Axie，但也有些 Axie 擁有先攻擊後排的特殊技能。在對戰開局時，雙方會拿到三點的對戰能量和六張技能卡，每使用一張技能卡需要耗費一點對戰能量，而對戰能量會在每一輪補回兩點。每一輪照順序攻擊對方直到其中一方三隻 Axie 都陣亡遊戲才結束。\n\n而較為有趣的是由於每隻 Axie 的 stats 和技能不同，會出現許多隊伍配置的方式。最基本的概念是需要有些 Axie 做為 Defender 來擋血，有些高輸出的 Axie 則是 Attacker 的角色放在後排攻擊對方。再加上屬性相剋的特性、技能組成，其實有很多很有趣的陣容配置正被玩家熱烈討論且持續發掘中。\n\n    在AxieZone可以看到過去幾個賽季表現較好的Axie class及陣容組成。\n\n## 爆紅原因\n\n## Play-To-Earn\n\nPlay-To-Earn 是 Axie Infinity 當中非常重要的一個元素，也是在這幾個月使其爆紅的主要因素。\n\nPlay-To-Earn 是一種被自由經濟圍繞著的 business model，玩家在積極參與遊戲，帶給其他玩家和 developer 價值的過程中能夠獲得獎勵，且這樣的獎勵的「所有權」是真實屬於玩家，且可以在公開市場上交易的。在傳統的線上遊戲中，我們一樣能夠獲得遊戲世界中的代幣或是虛擬寶物，但是這樣的獎勵是充滿中心化色彩的，撇除遊戲公司時不時出現的回溯事件以及擁有所有竄改權不談，光是在傳統遊戲中和法幣的交換往往是單向的，時常需要借助 OTC 平台來完成雙向的溝通這點，就是致命傷。相對地，能夠將代幣所有權方便轉移的區塊鏈世界，無疑為這樣的 gaming 型態提供了完美的平台。\n\n回到 Axie Infinity 本身，前面提到在遊戲當中主要滿足 Play-To-Earn 條件的是 SLP token，以完成每日任務 (50 SLP) 以及 PVE (100SLP) 來計算，一個基本玩家一天最多約能賺 150 個 SLP (目前約 $37.5)，這個數字超過許多開發中國家的最低薪資。遊戲本身在初期每天需要花 3–4 小時經營帳號，後期只需要花 1–2 小時去打 PVP 賺取 SLP，這樣 ”globay pay” 的收入對於許多國家的人是非常優渥的。\n\n## Filipinos\n\n根據 [PlayerCounter](https://playercounter.com/axie-infinity/) 所做的統計，每日遊玩 Axie Infinity 的玩家來源最多的五個國家分別為 **Philippines, Venezuela, United States, Thailand, Brazil**。其中菲律賓佔了 daily active users 中的 **40.53%**。在菲律賓 Axie Infinity 盛行的程度甚至讓 BloomX (在菲律賓當地有取得執照的交易所)和 Binance P2P 都提供了直接換 Philippine Peso 的管道。\n\n根據 [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/philippines/minimum-wages) 的數據，2019 年菲律賓的最低日薪資約為 537 Philippine Peso($10.66)，而上述提到每日可以賺約 $37.5 的薪水，等於是超過三倍的日報酬，且上述提到完成每日賺取 150 SLP 所花費的時間大概是 2–4 小時，簡單推算就可以知道這樣的賺錢方式在當地是非常划算的。除此之外，在 2021 年的 4 月菲律賓當地的疫情又達到了一個高峰，許多菲律賓人受疫情衝擊失去了工作機會，Axie Infinity 無疑提供了這些人一個養活自己，甚至過得更好的機會。22 歲的早期玩家 John Aaron Ramos 甚至在自己的 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AaronWhoang/status/1388419487221882882?s=20) 上宣布他靠著 Axie 的收入已經買了兩套房子。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2956/1\\*KMFCgcLXrCkGBf-oimurwg.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/5760/1\\*bB7CODIJ4koTzIbTeGYu4g.png)\n\n## Scholarships\n\n看到這裡，對這個遊戲稍微有研究的人應該會有個疑問，Axie Infinity 現在的進場費用這麼貴(至少 $1000)，上述提到的那些玩家應該沒有資本去參與這個遊戲才對？這個疑問也引到了 **Scholarhships **這個主題。\n\nScholarships 是 Axie Infinity 中很特別的非官方機制，在這個世界中，許多玩家沒有進入的資本，或是還在猶豫是否要投入；相對地有許多早期玩家擁有非常多隻 Axie （在 2020 年中組建 3 隻 Axie 只要 $5…），但他們沒有這麼多時間經營這麼多隻 Axie 來賺取每日應得的 SLP。這樣的需求與供給下誕生了兩種角色：\n\nSponsor: 提供有三隻 Axie 的帳號，讓 Scholar 每日登入賺取 SLP\n\nScholar: 無需任何初期投入，每日花時間幫忙賺 SLP\n\n一般來說，Scholar 可以分到 60–70 % 的 SLP 作為獎勵，也就是 Sponsor 會保留 30–40% 的 SLP。以一天 150 SLP 的總收入來算，一個月 Scholar 約可以賺 2,700 — 3,150 個 SLP ($675 — $787.5)。Payout 的方式跟時間通常跟 Sponsor 的條約有關，一般來說是一個月付一次，方式可能是 SLP、USD，或是 PNP(Philippines Peso)。\n\n而這樣的合作方式可行的原因是，Axie Infinity 的 account 和 wallet 並不是在同個介面上，Sponsor 可以創好 wallet，綁定帳號之後只給 Scholar 帳號密碼，甚至是 QR Code 即可，這樣一來 Scholar 並沒有自動轉移 wallet 資產的權限。但這樣的合作方式仍有兩個主要的風險：\n\n1.  Sponsor 反悔不付錢\n2.  Scholar 貪心接了好幾個 Sponsor 的案子，導致帳號被 banned。（遊戲規定同一個裝置 24 小時之內只能玩一個帳號，不允許多重帳號）\n\n即使如此，現在網路上仍有許多非官方社群來媒合 Sponsor 和 Scholar，或是有些 Twitter、Discord 群本身就是一個 Sponsor 所創立來管理 Scholar 的平台。整體來說這樣的經濟是有風險，但有效率的。\n\n## 還能加入嗎\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*-HyvypnLyTBGJok6LSAA-Q.png)\n\nAxie Infinity marketplace 2021/07/17\n\n我預想有些受眾和我一開始一樣，看到這個遊戲想的問題只有一個：\n\n> 所以在遊戲爆紅過後的現在，還能加入嗎？\n\n我的答案是可以，但風險不小。以下會進行一些簡單的試算。\n\n## 賺取 SLP\n\n想要加入 Axie Infinity，玩家必須先擁有三隻 Axie，一般來說都是從 marketplace 透過綁定 Ronin Wallet (可透過 Metamask 轉錢進去) 來購買 Axie。截至寫文章的今天(2021/07/17)為止，在市場上最便宜的 Axie 的價格大約是 0.18 ETH 左右，買三隻會花我們 0.54ETH ($1020)，先不管錢包的各種 gas fee 的話，這大概就是我們的初期成本。而剛剛提到，一天賺取 150 SLP 的情況下我們可以獲得約 $37.5 的日收入，簡單相除可以得到，大約 27.2 天可以回本。\n\n而這樣的假設有兩個問題，第一個是三隻都買最便宜的 Axie，我們不一定能每天都賺到 150 個 SLP，假設因為 Axie 品質較差我們一天只能賺 100 SLP 的話，就會需要 40.8 天才能回本。第二個問題是 SLP 的價格是浮動的，我們並不能保證當我們想要 cash out SLP 時還會是現在使用的 $0.25/SLP 這個價格，去做空 Perpetual 來鎖住價格的意義也不大，因為 SLP 現在的資金費率年化後大概是 -515%，這個扣血幅度會讓長期做空鎖住價格這件事變得不值得。\n\n## 繁殖型玩家\n\n這樣的玩法主要是盡量生出最多蛋到市場上販售。一般來說 Axie 除非品種很純，否則繁衍到 breed count (3/7) 就會停止，因為在這個級距開始，要付出的 SLP 是上一個級距的 2 倍。試算先去市場上買兩顆蛋 (約 0.3 ETH)，耐心等待五天孵化後成為 Axie 再讓他們繁衍三次，這樣的損益為何：\n\nCost：(0.15+0.15) \\* 1890(蛋) + (300+600+900) \\* 0.25(SLP) + (4+4+4) \\* 19(AXS) = $1,245\n\nRevenue: (0.15+0.15+0.15) \\* 1890(蛋) + (0.18 + 0.18) \\* 1890(Axie) = $1,530.9\n\nProfit: $1,530.9-$1,245 = $285.9\n\n## 其他想法\n\n可以發現，上述試算的損益聽起來不錯，但都是充滿了各種不確定性，遊戲中的這些代幣很大一部分的需求都是來自於新的投資者的加入所帶動，從網路上的討論和本文的分析大概也可以推敲出，有一定比例的玩家是為了其背後能夠賺錢這件事而參與進行投機，這樣的玩家組成很有可能在遊戲開始往下走時造成一連串的逃跑潮導致價格崩跌，這都是進入這個遊戲之前需要考慮清楚的。如果很想參與這個遊戲熱度的紅利，但又不想投入太多初期資本，也許單純投資 SLP、AXS，或是加入名聲好的 Scholar Program 也是不錯的方式。\n\n而其實遊戲本身的對戰也做得相當有意思，這個遊戲絕對不是只有投機的成分，在許多論壇也都可以看到 Axie Infinity 有著一個很強的 community 認真在討論不同的戰略以及對於遊戲未來發展的想法。\n\n我認為如果 Axie Infinity 並沒有這麼吸引你，但又想參與一些自己有興趣、同樣符合 Play-To-Earn ，在未來有機會能夠複製這樣模式爆紅的遊戲，其實有一個網站就叫 [Play-To-Earn](https://www.playtoearn.online/best-play-to-earn-games-with-nfts-or-crypto/)，上面有列出其他符合這樣性質的遊戲。去參與一些玩了開心，在未來又有很好的機會發展起來的遊戲，我認為才是現在做來勝率最高的事。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2aqBC3yxupgztdxUQjdVbg.png)\n\nSome other Play-To-Earn games\n\n## 結語\n\nAxie Infinity 是一個很有趣的項目，探討它爆紅的原因時，我們必須要綜觀全局：除了了解它的代幣經濟，Play-To-Earn 帶給玩家的獎勵，以及背後的 strong comunnity 外，更需要被看見的是東南亞的經濟、民族性，疫情對世界造成的影響，以及人們價值觀的轉變。\n\n而觀察這一年多來區塊鏈世界出現的風口，其實很多都是從傳統世界中已經存在的主題模仿、優化，而後隨著價值觀轉變而出現。去中心化金融其實就是最基本的資金供需，但在傳統世界我們因為信用問題必須透過中心化的媒介；NFT 其實就是將人們搜集卡牌、藝術品的行為搬移到鏈上；而像 Axie Infinity 這種 Play-To-Earn 型態的遊戲，讓我想到小時候在玩線上遊戲時，先儲值點數進去讓角色變強，打到虛寶之後再在遊戲裡面出售或是拿到外部的 OTC 交易所換成法幣。這樣的映射關係讓這些項目的成功都是有跡可循的，相信無論市場牛熊，能夠接受新知並持續思考的人都會在這個世界獲得優渥的報酬。\n\n## References\n\n[Axie Infinity Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/)\n\n[Axie Infinity Alpha Guide](https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-infinity-community-alpha-guide)\n\n[Axie Breeding Guide](https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-breeding-guide)\n\n[For Filipinos, Axie Infinity Is More Than a Crypto Game](https://www.coindesk.com/for-filipinos-axie-infinity-is-more-than-a-crypto-game)\n\n[Axie Zone Statistics](https://axie.zone/pvp-statistics)\n\n[Axie Infinity | DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/ethereum/games/axie-infinity)\n", "timestamp": 1635314998, "digest": "AsP8RSycuzRKPzj-Z9SRJ8KeeSXJx7gx-7gQOkvUyVk", "contributor": "0xadd7ed40860AaaA046d274BDAeE4D5d8F7adA955"}
{"id": "bjVFmRfYKBvn6BCWhbWyUTB3A8sr_FTlheOnDgCZkno", "title": "How to Mint a Witch", "body": "If you've never minted an NFT before, it can be a daunting process! We've put together a guide to help you navigate through the different steps you'll need to follow.\n\n## Preparing a Wallet\n\nTo mint an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain, you'll need both Ether (ETH) and a wallet that can hold your NFT.\n\nThe easiest way to do both at the same time is to download [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/), an iOS app that allows you to create a wallet and add up to $500 a week using Apple Pay. If that amount works for you, you can go straight to Minting.\n\nHowever, if you need more than $500, follow these next steps.\n\n### Creating a Wallet\n\nFirst, create an Ethereum wallet that you can use to conduct your transactions and hold your NFTs. A few options that we support are Metamask, WalletConnect (which works for Rainbow and many other wallets), and Coinbase Wallet (which is different from a Coinbase.com account).\n\nYour Ethereum wallet will have a public address on the Ethereum network, which is where you can send and receive tokens like Ether and NFTs.\n\n### Buying Ether\n\nThe easiest way to buy Ether, the currency used on Ethereum, is to use a crypto exchange.\n\nWe recommend Coinbase for beginners. Note that this [Coinbase.com](http://Coinbase.com) account is *different* from a Coinbase Wallet account—it is an account for Coinbase's exchange, which allows you to trade currencies like USD for cryptocurrencies like Ether.\n\n1. Create an account and buy some Ether.\n   1. Make sure that you have *more* Ether than you need for the cost of the mint—each Ethereum transaction requires \"gas,\" the network fees that go into processing blockchain transactions. Gas fees vary by the type of transaction and depending on the level of activity in the Ethereum network, but minting an NFT can cost as much as $150 in gas when there's high traffic. For example, the witches cost 0.07 ETH each to mint, so you may want to have 0.1 ETH per witch on hand.\n2. Once you've bought your Ether, transfer it by sending it to the address of the wallet you just created earlier. Now you're ready to mint an NFT!\n\n# Minting\n\nWhen you \"mint\" an NFT, you're interacting with a smart contract on the blockchain and making a transaction to create a new token under that contract, which you will then own. For Crypto Coven, you can either mint through our website (beginner-friendly) or directly through Etherscan (more advanced).\n\n### Website (Beginner-Friendly)\n\nThe easiest way to mint a witch is through the [Crypto Coven website](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/), since we'll handle a lot of the complexity for you.\n\n1. You'll need to connect your wallet to our website using the \"Connect Wallet\" button—a modal will open, and you'll need to choose the wallet type you created earlier.\n   1. If you created a [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) wallet (or any other WalletConnect-enabled wallet), click the WalletConnect option. You'll see a QR code you need to scan. In Rainbow, you'll want to press the \"Discover\" button on the upper-right corner of the main screen, then the QR scanner icon on the upper-right corner of the next screen. Once you're there, scan the code on your screen, and you should be connected to our website.\n2. Once your wallet is connected, select the number of witches you'd like to mint, with a max of three. Then click \"Mint,\" and you should see an overview of the transaction you're about to create in your wallet, with the option to confirm it.\n3. In most cases, the transaction should take a few moments and then complete. Hooray, you've just minted your first NFT!\n\nIf gas is surging or the contract hits the total limit of witches to mint, there is a possibility that your transaction will fail, which means that you will lose some or even all of the gas you paid. The reason that this scenario can happen is that *any* transaction on Ethereum requires gas to execute—you always have to pay for the computations you're enacting on the network. [Here](https://info.etherscan.com/reason-for-failed-transaction/) are some common reasons transactions can fail.\n\n### Etherscan (Advanced)\n\nIf you'd like to interact directly with the smart contract, you can mint witches on Etherscan. Etherscan only supports Metamask or WalletConnect, so Coinbase Wallet will not work for this method.\n\n1. Go to our smart contract in Etherscan. \\[INCLUDE LINK ONCE DEPLOYED\\] It should have a green checkmark on the \"Contract\" tab to indicate that the source code is deployed and verified.\n2. You can click on the \"Read Contract\" button to check if the sale is active.\n   1. If you're participating in the public sale, make sure that `isPublicSaleActive` is set to `true` before you attempt to mint a witch—otherwise, your transaction will be reverted, and you may lose gas.\n   2. If you're participating in the community sale, you will need to have already added your wallet address to the list in order to mint a witch. Make sure that `isCommunitySaleActive` is set to `true` before you attempt to mint a witch. Otherwise, your transaction will be reverted, and you may lose gas.\n3. Now head over to the \"Write Contract\" view. Here, you'll need to connect your wallet to Etherscan by clicking the \"Connect to web3\" button. Once you're connected, you can start creating transactions under the smart contract.\n4. Now it's time to do the minting!\n   1. If you're participating in the public sale, head to the function that just says `mint`. The price per witch in the public sale is 0.07 ETH, so multiply that by the number of witches you want to mint (up to three). Enter that total in the `payableAmount` field, along with the number of witches you want in the `numberOfTokens` field.\n   2. If you're participating in the community sale, you'll need to go to the function named `mintCommunitySale` instead.\n      1. The community sale price per witch is 0.05 ETH. Multiply that by the number of witches you want to mint (up to three) and enter that total in the `payableAmount` field.\n      2. Enter the number of witches you want in the `numberOfTokens` field.\n      3. The last field you'll need is your proof, which is how we verify that your address is on our list for this sale. The way you can retrieve your proof is to find your wallet address at a URL we’ll link when it’s ready and copy the proof associated with your address. Paste it into the `merkleProof` field in Etherscan. Here's how it should look:\n\n         ```\n         [\"0xe970...52d9\",\"0xe970...52d9\",\"0xe970...52d9\",\"0xe970...52d9\",\"0xe970...52d9\"]\n         ```\n5. In most cases, the transaction should take a few moments and then complete. Hooray, you've just minted your first NFT!\n\n# Viewing Your Witch\n\nYou won't be able to see your witch immediately after minting! Once a day, we reveal all witches minted in the past day, so you'll see a placeholder in your wallet until the next reveal. Once that's happened, you should be able to view your witch in your wallet or marketplaces like OpenSea and Zora!", "timestamp": 1635315473, "digest": "V1zX1gDrzVDCVvFo8VtCpggqx2-fcHSjetF0LNTFBLI", "contributor": "0x4537611D7972550f23A04F1A6f4D20ec8e83722F"}

{"id": "KNUBEuE_Ul0kyrMnuyzEACwH1g0qHDUl0omIhhnAUyc", "title": "How to Mint a Witch", "body": "If you've never minted an NFT before, it can be a daunting process! We've put together a guide to help you navigate through the different steps you'll need to follow.\n\n## Preparing a Wallet\n\nTo mint an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain, you'll need both Ether (ETH) and a wallet that can hold your NFT.\n\nThe easiest way to do both at the same time is to download [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/), an iOS app that allows you to create a wallet and add up to $500 a week using Apple Pay. If that amount works for you, you can go straight to Minting.\n\nHowever, if you need more than $500, follow these next steps.\n\n### Creating a Wallet\n\nFirst, create an Ethereum wallet that you can use to conduct your transactions and hold your NFTs. A few options that we support are Metamask, WalletConnect (which works for Rainbow and many other wallets), and Coinbase Wallet (which is different from a Coinbase.com account).\n\nYour Ethereum wallet will have a public address on the Ethereum network, which is where you can send and receive tokens like Ether and NFTs.\n\n### Buying Ether\n\nThe easiest way to buy Ether, the currency used on Ethereum, is to use a crypto exchange.\n\nWe recommend Coinbase for beginners. Note that this [Coinbase.com](http://Coinbase.com) account is *different* from a Coinbase Wallet account—it is an account for Coinbase's exchange, which allows you to trade currencies like USD for cryptocurrencies like Ether.\n\n1. Create an account and buy some Ether.\n   1. Make sure that you have *more* Ether than you need for the cost of the mint—each Ethereum transaction requires \"gas,\" the network fees that go into processing blockchain transactions. Gas fees vary by the type of transaction and depending on the level of activity in the Ethereum network, but minting an NFT can cost as much as $150 in gas when there's high traffic. For example, the witches cost 0.07 ETH each to mint, so you may want to have 0.1 ETH per witch on hand.\n2. Once you've bought your Ether, transfer it by sending it to the address of the wallet you just created earlier. Now you're ready to mint an NFT!\n\n# Minting\n\nWhen you \"mint\" an NFT, you're interacting with a smart contract on the blockchain and making a transaction to create a new token under that contract, which you will then own. For Crypto Coven, you can either mint through our website (beginner-friendly) or directly through Etherscan (more advanced).\n\n### Website (Beginner-Friendly)\n\nThe easiest way to mint a witch is through the [Crypto Coven website](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/), since we'll handle a lot of the complexity for you.\n\n1. You'll need to connect your wallet to our website using the \"Connect Wallet\" button—a modal will open, and you'll need to choose the wallet type you created earlier.\n   1. If you created a [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) wallet (or any other WalletConnect-enabled wallet), click the WalletConnect option. You'll see a QR code you need to scan. In Rainbow, you'll want to press the \"Discover\" button on the upper-right corner of the main screen, then the QR scanner icon on the upper-right corner of the next screen. Once you're there, scan the code on your screen, and you should be connected to our website.\n2. Once your wallet is connected, select the number of witches you'd like to mint, with a max of three. Then click \"Mint,\" and you should see an overview of the transaction you're about to create in your wallet, with the option to confirm it.\n3. In most cases, the transaction should take a few moments and then complete. Hooray, you've just minted your first NFT!\n\nIf gas is surging or the contract hits the total limit of witches to mint, there is a possibility that your transaction will fail, which means that you will lose some or even all of the gas you paid. The reason that this scenario can happen is that *any* transaction on Ethereum requires gas to execute—you always have to pay for the computations you're enacting on the network. [Here](https://info.etherscan.com/reason-for-failed-transaction/) are some common reasons transactions can fail.\n\n### Etherscan (Advanced)\n\nIf you'd like to interact directly with the smart contract, you can mint witches on Etherscan. Etherscan only supports Metamask or WalletConnect, so Coinbase Wallet will not work for this method.\n\n1. Go to our smart contract in Etherscan. \\[INCLUDE LINK ONCE DEPLOYED\\] It should have a green checkmark on the \"Contract\" tab to indicate that the source code is deployed and verified.\n2. You can click on the \"Read Contract\" button to check if the sale is active.\n   1. If you're participating in the public sale, make sure that `isPublicSaleActive` is set to `true` before you attempt to mint a witch—otherwise, your transaction will be reverted, and you may lose gas.\n   2. If you're participating in the community sale, you will need to have already added your wallet address to the list in order to mint a witch. Make sure that `isCommunitySaleActive` is set to `true` before you attempt to mint a witch. Otherwise, your transaction will be reverted, and you may lose gas.\n3. Now head over to the \"Write Contract\" view. Here, you'll need to connect your wallet to Etherscan by clicking the \"Connect to web3\" button. Once you're connected, you can start creating transactions under the smart contract.\n4. Now it's time to do the minting!\n   1. If you're participating in the public sale, head to the function that just says `mint`. The price per witch in the public sale is 0.07 ETH, so multiply that by the number of witches you want to mint (up to three). Enter that total in the `payableAmount` field, along with the number of witches you want in the `numberOfTokens` field.\n   2. If you're participating in the community sale, you'll need to go to the function named `mintCommunitySale` instead.\n      1. The community sale price per witch is 0.05 ETH. Multiply that by the number of witches you want to mint (up to three) and enter that total in the `payableAmount` field.\n      2. Enter the number of witches you want in the `numberOfTokens` field.\n      3. The last field you'll need is your proof, which is how we verify that your address is on our list for this sale. You can retrieve your proof by finding your wallet address at a URL we’ll link when it’s ready. Copy the proof associated with your address and paste it into the `merkleProof` field in Etherscan. It should look like a list of hashes:\n\n         ```\n         [\"0xe970...52d9\",\"0xe970...52d9\",\"0xe970...52d9\",\"0xe970...52d9\"]\n         ```\n5. In most cases, the transaction should take a few moments and then complete. Hooray, you've just minted your first NFT!\n\n# Viewing Your Witch\n\nYou won't be able to see your witch immediately after minting! Once a day, we reveal all witches minted in the past day, so you'll see a placeholder in your wallet until the next reveal. Once that's happened, you should be able to view your witch in your wallet or marketplaces like OpenSea and Zora!", "timestamp": 1635315580, "digest": "V1zX1gDrzVDCVvFo8VtCpggqx2-fcHSjetF0LNTFBLI", "contributor": "0x4537611D7972550f23A04F1A6f4D20ec8e83722F"}

While I’m happily married, the dream had been about my wife decided to break up with me (before our marriage, with our son already being with us - which did not make any sense, but you would not look for sense in a dream).\n\nWhile I’m not a person to put big importance on dreams, if you think about it as your brain sorting out thoughts and running simulations of different scenarios, then you might see such bad dream as an opportunity to see where your priorities actually are. While the dream was not scary, it left me with such image in my mind and I could let it to affect how I feel, like if I lived through that. (as you can imagine, the feeling was not a pleasant one)\n\nWhile it might sound awful to some, it is actually a great exercise to calibrate your focus. In this particular case, it left me with regret that before the break up in the dream, I did not do enough, and did not really enjoy the time together, and that now it’s too late. And this feeling is a powerful engine to change oneself and start focusing on present. People with near death experience often describe it as a similar moment - when you clearly see what the priorities are and what is not important.\n\nI hope I won’t get anywhere close to a near death experience in the future, but I’ll be grateful for every such dream, which will remind me what is important.

It works so well.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lcDMRWd1lvlT0zHZfphwa.png?height=508&width=970)\n\nThe design idea of Layer2 can be described as follows: a transaction on L2 can be proven to be fully compliant with L1's transaction rules but does not need to be actually executed in L1.\n\nOptimist promises that its transactions comply with L1 rules by mortgating assets on L1. If it violates the rules, it may be discovered and take away the collateral.\n\nZK proves that its transactions comply with L1's rules by means of mathematical proof. L1 can verify its legitimacy after receiving the proof file sent by ZK.\n\nOn L1, the user sends a transaction and the Ethereum miner node validates and packages it in block. Transactions made by users on L2 are verified by Layer2's operational node and then uploaded (up) to L1. However, L1's Ethereum miner node does not verify the original transaction, but only packages the transaction data and proof file, which is called CallData.\n\nThe L2 operating node that performs rollup is required to pay GAS to L1, and this gas must use ETH (unless discussed with the pool).\n\nWhen using L2 to send transactions, users also have to pay for gas, but in what coin? In essence, it depends on the operation node of L2. The rollup node even does not charge gas fees from users, and then adds ETH as gas by itself during rollup. I think the Layer2 project will most likely issue a coin eventually, at least as gas fees for executing transactions on its own system instead of using ETH as gas.\n\nThe operational nodes of L2 can be one or open multiple nodes, which then use some sort of consensus mechanism to coordinate who performs rollup.\n\n \n\nThe cooperation mechanism of L2 and L1 is especially like the cooperation mode of To C and To B. L2 is responsible for the end user and provides the user with all the services that L1 can provide, including security, while L2 certifies to L1 that the services it provides are compliant with L1's rules.\n\nWill the Etherum slowly become To B chain, and away from C end users?\n\nTo B or To C, let's leave out a good question for now.To B or To C, let's not consider good or bad.\n\nI think it might.\n\nThe core reason is the low transaction cost of users in L2. The cost of L1's original users entering L2 is relatively high, but they can directly develop new users in L2. L2 operators deposit assets and services in L2 at a time and sell them to new users. New users may never leave L2. You can imagine that the vast majority of users will not put the currency to the exchange such as Binan and Huobi, but directly charge money into the exchange, buy the currency, and then sell the currency to withdraw the money.\n\nThe composability of L2's ecological products is a disadvantage compared with L1's. But the virtual machine compatibility will make the contract on L1 almost seamless migration to L2, so you see the ecology of Arbitrum is almost instant prosperity, the prosperity of BSC also proved that EVM compatibility for developers is too friendly. EVM compatibility makes it easy for L2 to have the same product ecology as L1, thus addressing the composability disadvantage.\n\nAnother question, what if the rollup node of L2 is the miner node of Ethereum L1?", "timestamp": 1635318072, "digest": "gKg150g1rNDbIcNsje3HdFuuK5ZaaEDdScF-OuYL7OE", "contributor": "0x197080355Eccf1a87f713151f123CaEDEc77E141"}

The Future Scouts provide a window into a bold new world. Let’s go exploring.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qX7g2PrO2mQZgvIRIFSiA.png?height=845&width=2433)\n\n*Imagine a conversation where youth, parents, educators and elders come together as peers to discuss how to prepare youth for living their most fulfilling future.*\n\nThat’s where Future Scouts steps in.\n\nFuture Scouts is a next-generation youth service organization on a mission to prepare and equip learners of all ages with the skills, literacies and tools to survive and thrive in the 21st century.\n\nThe world is experiencing a vast shift. New technologies are transforming both the analog and digital worlds, impacting all vocations and occupations…all ecosystems, industry and economies. This revolution challenges society’s fundamental ideas about what it means to balance life, work and play.\n\nThe youth of the Gen ‘Zzzs who are coming of age in the 21st century need to learn very different skills than those taught to students in the 20th century. Yet for the most part, these skills aren’t taught in traditional educational environments. There is a growing disconnect between existing education systems and emerging job markets. Many of today’s youth will work in new job types that do not yet exist. Youth today are unequipped to navigate these shifting paradigm, and are caught between the old and the new, left to fend for themselves in the digital, urban and social wildernesses of the 21st century.\n\n## We refer to skills that equip youth to face uncertainty and unknowns as ‘**21st Century Survival Skills.**’\n\nThe term refers to a broad set of literacies, competencies and character traits that are considered to be critically important in today’s quickly changing world, and more importantly — in the worlds of tomorrow.\n\n**At Future Scouts, we empower learners of all ages to learn and develop mastery of 21st Century Survival Skills through a hands-on, interdisciplinary approach that brings creativity and curiosity to the learning process.**\n\nBy some predictions, *one in three of today’s students is predicted to find themselves doing jobs that don’t yet exist.* Already in the US, there are millions of jobs going unfilled because employers can’t find workers who are qualified. Meanwhile traditional Scouting organizations’ membership has been plummeting (more on that in another post). How can educators and adult mentors effectively prepare youth for these emerging opportunities?\n\nWe live in a complex, connected, evolving world that demands new skills, and we must help the future generation learn to think, communicate and solve problems in novel, unimagined ways.\n\nIt is not enough to teach these skills at different times or in separate settings, nor to teach them at all — what it takes is recognizing that learning is a lifelong process.\n\n**We must empower learners…not teach to the test (*or the algorithms*). We must help students cultivate critical thinking, creativity, computational literacy, ingenuity and flexibility. We must help them function comfortably in constantly evolving environments and be prepared to thrive and prosper in the 21st century.**\n\nFuture Scouts is a next-generation youth service organization leading internationally in preparing learners with the skills, literacies and tools to succeed in all of the challenges of the 21st century. We do this by providing technology, services, and curriculum that integrate 21st century skills, systems thinking, sensemaking, collaboration and more into a holistic learning experience for learners of all ages.\n\nThrough our online and offline activities, after school, camp, workshops, home school programs, and special events, we have provided enriching, unique learning opportunities for youth in grades K-12 and beyond.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ass-oGoqWVdrBL8uqaCKiw.png)\n\nSoon we will be inviting thousands of students actively to engage each week via the Future Scouts App and Handbook. We’re building a thriving, involved community of learners, mentors, parents, and professionals that are actively co-creating and world building the Future Scouts.\n\nOur ultimate goal is for Future Scouts to be a leading international movement for 21st Century, self-directed, lifelong learners.\n\nWe aim to transform traditional learning environments and bridge the learning gap for learners of all ages. We want to help those in need of opportunities and additional support to prepare them for success in all pursuits in their life, work and play.\n\nWe envision Future Scouts will lead communities in helping learners of all ages to learn and develop the knowledge and skills required to create their preferred futures.\n\nIf you believe, as we do, that learning is about opening doors to new ideas and experiences, get in touch. We’d love your help in building a truly collaborative, self-directed learning future for scouting.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*n8aX_aSM__kowiCHlvMiBg.png)\n\n*We invite you to get involved and RSVP to one of our orientation events.*\n\n* Facebook: <https://www.facebook.com/futurescouts.cc>\n* Instagram: <https://instagram.com/futurescouts>\n* Twitter: <https://twitter.com/futurescouts>\n* Medium: [https://gazette.futurescouts.cc](https://gazette.futurescouts.cc/)\n* LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/company/future-scouts>\n* Web: [https://futurescouts.cc](https://futurescouts.cc/)\n\n*Contact one of our Phyle leaders or contact us through the website, and follow us on the Socials to keep up to date.*", "timestamp": 1635318094, "digest": "6dxIBA7Ajk-uBFgAMka1IEUYy_Xk74laltvZei4tIB8", "contributor": "0x2d3547e5D3c5d188Edf9C4E0BA71F11b1B3d45dD"}

The world’s first DECENTralized independent label; the DECENT choice for artists. We are creating efficiency and fairness in the historically inequitable music industry by putting artists and fans on the same team.\n\nOur NFT platform allows artists to mint and auction NFTs collateralized by royalty revenues. By tying investors’ ROI to artists’ royalty growth rates, Decent creates a synergistic flywheel between fans, investors, and musicians, incentivizing fans to market on behalf of artists. Just as streaming platforms democratized audiences, we aim to democratize ownership with Decent.\n\n## Music as Work-to-Rent\n\nTo date, middlemen and intermediaries have controlled music's funding, promotion, and data channels.  Monopolistic control over distribution and capital has enabled these middlemen to rate-limit industry success and normalize extractive pricing, resulting in artists earning only \\~12% of the value that they create.  More draconian still, “making it” as an artist generally entails relinquishing 80% - 90% of their master rights.  Taken together, these statistics highlight music to be the only industry in which participants are expected to mortgage their future only to mortgage their present.\n\n## Why Decent?\n\n**With Decent, artists will always retain 100% of the master rights to their music.**  We aim to mitigate the music industry’s feudal paradigm of work-to-rent and replace it with an economic system predicated on the integrity of strictly-enforced property rights.  A system that rewards artists’ creativity and determination, treating each copyright as the cornerstone of a vibrant career rather than a time card.\n\nUsing our smart contracts and royalty vaults, artists can raise money for future projects, cultivate an invested fanbase, and maintain ownership of their intellectual property (IP). Artists determine what percentage of their royalty revenues they would like to make investable for fans and for how long, making the funding process flexible and customizable. To raise capital, artists will auction royalty-backed NFTs priced in accordance with the artists’ incumbent popularity and the duration of the contract.\n\nBy supporting an artist’s auction, participants will build out portfolios of their favorite artists, effectively joining their team. Fans-turned-teammates will have access to exclusive opportunities to participate in the creative journey like never before and can even be rewarded with airdrops when their artist communities succeed.\n\nCutting out the traditional record label “middleman” unlocks previously gate-kept value for both the artist and fan, who take up a symbiotic relationship driven by financial and emotional interests. With Decent, artists will have access to all the resources of a traditional label (funding, marketing, distribution, community) without having to surrender large portions of their IP. And when they succeed, the fans who supported them from the beginning will be the beneficiaries, not a third party corporation.\n\nAs Decent artists develop with help from their newfound teammates, the entire Decent community will reap the benefits.  Decent’s marketplace fees will be split between the Decent Treasury and Community Rewards Matching Pools to provide the users with ownership over the platform.\n\n## Roadmap: What’s Next?\n\nJoin Decent to accelerate artists’ careers and reinvent one of the world’s most antiquated economic structures. **Artists:** receive capital and a team to accelerate your career - your fans want to bet on you and contribute to your journey. **Fans:** build your own label and receive exposure to the exciting, new asset class of music royalties while supporting the creation of art you care about.\n\nSign up for our waitlist [here](https://69tdcraihqg.typeform.com/to/Xkh00RVd).\n\n[decent.xyz](https://decent.xyz)", "timestamp": 1635318681, "digest": "qsvUuJOGdjj_o49zqtIaSx8wh-92usgJMkkomv-LHNs", "contributor": "0x673Fc290d919684A1B1E46AA69152f7b56FBADD8"}

Pua**\n\n2021 年 5 月至 6 月之间，中国密集出台政策，限制加密数字货币的交易且禁止加密数字货币矿场的运营。\n\n那么中国彻底禁止挖矿后，如今的挖矿产业到底怎样了？\n\n5 月 25 日，内蒙古发改委发布《关于坚决打击惩戒虚拟货币「挖矿」行为八项措施（征求意见稿）》，大力限制内蒙古矿场的运营。\n\n6 月 9 日，青海省工业和信息化厅下发《关于对虚拟货币「挖矿」项目开展清理整顿工作的通知》，要求青海省各地区有关虚拟货币「挖矿」行为开展清理整顿。\n\n根据《四川省发展和改革委员会、四川省能源局关于清理关停虚拟货币「挖矿」项目的通知》文件显示，2021 年 6 月 20 日之前需要停止四川内所有矿场的运营。\n\n出于风险等因素，中国一直以来都限制虚拟货币在境内交易，但今年之前并未限制虚拟货币挖矿产业，中国曾是比特币等加密货币的挖矿产业主要聚集地。根据英国剑桥大学的数据显示，中国一度占据比特币 65.08% 的算力。但此次监管力度之大，很多业内人士都称其为「前所未见」。此次的打击也导致了比特币全网的算力下跌。BTC.com 的数据显示，2021 年 7 月 13 日，比特币全网平均算力 97.21EH/s，相比历史最高点 197.61EH/s(5 月 13 日) 已跌去近 51%。\n\n事实上，在矿工关闭在中国的业务之后，比特币网络的哈希率（用于衡量挖矿活动的计算指标）已经从 7 月份的低点逐渐恢复。根据数据分析网站 Y Chart 的数据，截至 10 月 14 日，比特币网络的哈希率已从 7 月的低点 61 EH/s 上涨约 117% 至每秒 135.48 EH/s。\n\n![中国清退虚拟货币挖矿后，比特币矿业现状如何？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/0a75e9c26ea178fc79c7365255f80aa5.jpg-article)*过往 3 年间比特币挖矿哈希率，来源：Blockchain 网站*\n\n中国全面禁止挖矿产业之后，美国在此领域取代中国成为了挖矿产业聚集地，且业内人士认为此趋势不会很快停止。Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance （CCAF）的数据显示，自中国全面禁止挖矿产业之后，主要来自美国的矿工已经逐渐接管了比特币的全球采矿业务。截至 9 月底，美国占全球算力的 35.4%，是 4 月底的 16.8% 的两倍多，2020 年 9 月的四倍多。\n\n![中国清退虚拟货币挖矿后，比特币矿业现状如何？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/2a59f73e0e5b810621d811077a0b3a15.jpg-article)*比特币挖矿产业分布比例，来源：CambridgeCentre for Alternative

Finance*\n\n挖矿公司 Bit Digital 的首席执行官 CEO Bryan Bullett 在接受 CoinDesk 采访时表示：由于对此产业没有限制，预计美国将继续在份额方面发挥领导作用。没有人愿意在需要面对生存风险的地区开展业务。\n\n与此同时，中国的挖矿比例实际上已经从 2019 年 9 月占全球比特币挖矿算力总量 75.53% 的高位降至零。根据 CCAF 的资料显示，哈萨克斯坦和俄罗斯现在紧随美国之后，如今的算力份额分别为 18.1% 和 11.23%，而此前两国的算力份额在 4 月份分别为 8.2% 和 6.8%。\n\n### 美国\n\n对于矿工来说，越低的电费则越有吸引力。美国各州的电费都不一样。德克萨斯州的平均商业电费为 8.09 美分 / 千瓦时（比全国平均水平低 30%）。德克萨斯州的平均住宅电费为 11.75 美分 / 千瓦时（比全国平均水平低 15%）。根据 Global Petrol Price 的资料显示，世界平均电费为 13.6 美分 / 千瓦时。德克萨斯州的商业电费相比于世界平均水平低了 40.5%。\n\n可再生能源也逐渐成为美国重要的电力来源之一。根据 EIA （美国能源信息署）的资料显示，水力发电占据华盛顿州 24% 的发电来源；纽约州则是 23%。此外美国有许多州都有核电来源，核电占据美国能源结构的 20%。德克萨斯州的可再生能源份额也随着时间的推移不断增长。截至 2019 年，其 20% 的电力来自风能。\n\n挖矿产业始终被诟病其能源问题。而为了解决此问题，许多矿场都采用可再生能源来挖矿。美国拥有着丰富的可再生能源，吸引了大量矿场。\n\n2021 年 5 月 14 日，马斯克发推特表示因比特币能耗问题，特斯拉将停止接受比特币。而一旦挖矿在能源方面更具有持续性，就会重新接受比特币支付。在美国利用可再生能源挖矿，除了巨大的盈利空间之外也能减少温室气体排放。\n\n![中国清退虚拟货币挖矿后，比特币矿业现状如何？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/85369ea07866aff74715d5fa9af6de27.jpg-article)*特斯拉停止接受比特币的推特*\n\n有人将挖矿视为处理废弃物的手段。例如在德克萨斯州的油田开采中，伴随物天然气大多被排放出大气。而将矿机设置在附近吸收天然气燃烧所产生的能源除了能够减少天然气此温室气体排放之外，也能够为石油开采商赚钱。美国纽约的一家天然气电厂，就采购了 7000 台比特币矿机，以消耗过剩的发电量。\n\n![中国清退虚拟货币挖矿后，比特币矿业现状如何？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/70dd3e3b5f16f3cdcac1626a860531d3.jpg-article)*天然气电厂内的比特币矿机，来源：BlockPitch*\n\n01

区块链整理*\n\n### 政策上给予倾斜的哈萨克斯坦\n\n目前，哈萨克斯坦在全球比特币挖矿市场的份额仅次于美国，占所有加密货币挖矿的 18.1%。然而根据 IEA （国际能源署）的资料显示：煤炭燃料约占发电量的 70%，其次是天然气为 20%，其余则是新能源发电。哈萨克斯坦因其廉价的电费而吸引了许多矿工前往挖矿，但根据其能源结构来看，越多的挖矿活动则意味着更多的二氧化碳排放。\n\n哈萨克斯坦在政策方面对于加密货币和挖矿产业给予倾斜。哈萨克斯坦于 2020 年通过法律，承认比特币为数字资产，允许在境内与与其他商品一样进行交易。法律也允许在合规的前提下在哈萨克斯坦境内建立加密货币交易所。\n\n![中国清退虚拟货币挖矿后，比特币矿业现状如何？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/e897c99feb8e9f1e88b2652d6e746b71.jpg-article)*表 2 哈萨克斯坦在加密货币方面的相关政策，资料来源：01 区块链整理*\n\n阿斯塔纳国际金融中心（AIFC，哈萨克斯坦建立的金融中心）专门建立了 IT 园区，在这里落户的矿场除了每年流水 1% 的「使用费」，无需缴纳任何税款。但随着越来越多的矿场选择在哈萨克斯坦落户，该国有意修改其税法，计划从 2022 年起按照每千瓦时 1 腾格（0.00232 美元）的价格收取数字挖矿税。\n\n此外，哈萨克斯坦数字发展部正在与 AIFC 以及区块链协会起草加密货币行业和区块链技术法规，规范化本国的区块链法规。\n\n哈萨克斯坦对于加密货币的支持立场坚定不移，且积极建设相关政策规范化以及推出利好加密货币的政策都使得大量矿场入驻哈萨克斯坦境内。\n\n### 俄罗斯\n\n散热始终是矿场需要解决的问题之一。多台矿机一旦运行会发出巨大的热量，如果没有一个行之有效的散热手段，那么这些价格昂贵的设备寿命就只有不到一个月而已。此外，一台矿机可能会发出 100 分贝的噪音，多台矿机共同运作的话，发出的噪音污染可想而知。因此矿场鲜少设置在城市中，多数在郊外地区。\n\n矿场多数具有远离居民居住区，具备强大通风、降温设备等特点。寒冷且人烟稀少的西伯利亚则符合了以上的特点。\n\n许多矿场设置在山谷里或者河流旁，用特定地形的低温来降低矿机的温度。而在全球范围内，更受大型加密货币挖矿公司青睐的是高纬度地区。整个北半球，年平均气温最低的地方莫过于俄远东的西伯利亚地区了。\n\n![中国清退虚拟货币挖矿后，比特币矿业现状如何？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/0b37ccc224e8c133b3fc991989889877.jpg-article)*西伯利亚每个月平均温度与降雨量，来源：HikersBay 网站*\n\n此外，丰富的能源供应也是一个原因。附近的布拉茨克市蕴含丰富的水能资源。俄罗斯最大的水电站之一布拉茨克水电站和相对下游的乌斯季伊利姆斯克水电站就设置在附近，都有极为庞大的规模和电力产能。\n\n![中国清退虚拟货币挖矿后，比特币矿业现状如何？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/0b37ccc224e8c133b3fc991989889877.jpg-article)*布拉茨克水电站*\n\n矿场需要消耗大量的电力，而临近的水电站正好能提供它所需的电。BitRiver （一家比特币挖矿公司）就在附近设有自己的矿场。\n\n该城市此前是一个重工业城市。此前有着许多的铝厂。BitRiver 与铝厂背后的公司达成了合作，租下了大量的旧厂房用作摆放矿机。并且与水电站签订相关协议，从 En+ Group （俄罗斯一家能源公司）获得近 100 兆瓦的廉价电力，这使他们能够大规模地推进挖矿工作。\n\n而实际上 100 兆瓦的电量只是布拉茨克水电厂产能的九牛一毛，该电厂能产生超过 22.5 太瓦的电力。而全球比特币挖矿活动每年消耗的电力为 110 太瓦，所以理论上来讲，如果布拉茨克水电站的电力全部投入到比特币挖矿这一活动当中，挖出全世界 20.45% 的新增比特币也不成问题。\n\n此外，俄罗斯也在法律上承认加密货币的地位。2020 年 7 月 22 日，俄罗斯下议院通过法案，赋予加密货币合法地位，但禁止其作为支付手段。俄罗斯国家金融委员会主席 Anatoly Aksakov 称，加密货币在俄罗斯的地位已获得法律定义。\n\n相对于如今许多国家对加密货币处于暧昧的状态，俄罗斯明确了其态度。俄罗斯对于加密货币产业采取了宽松且务实的政策。有的矿场担心监管或是合法问题，而矿场在俄罗斯省去了法律上的风险，这吸引了许多矿场的入驻。\n\n免责声明：作为区块链信息平台，本站所发布文章仅代表作者个人观点，与链闻 ChainNews

Standard Team prepared lots of revenue generation opportunities for You degen farmers 🚜and I will try to present them all here. But first, let's get You prepared for the Standard DEX experience.\n\nStandard Protocol is launching MVP products — Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and MeterUSD Stablecoin on Shiden Network. The DEX will operate as a market maker to ensure a capital-efficient liquidation process and stability of our stablecoin MeterUSD ($USM).\n\n**What would You need to fully experience the DEX functions and what’s in store for You degen farmers? **🚜🧑‍🌾\n\nAs **Standard DEX** will operate on Shiden Network You will need Standard **#STND** tokens, Shiden **#SDN** tokens, and some Stablecoins (**#USDT**, **#USDC**, **#BUSD**) — all those have to be on **Shiden Network Metamask Account.**\n\n**Here is how to get prepared, add Shiden Network to Metamask and bridge tokens to Shiden Network**\n\n## 1. Adding Shiden Network to Metamask\n\nBefore You will start bridging **#STND** tokens to Shiden Network and sending Your **#SDN** and Stablecoins to Metamask, You need to add Shiden Network to Metamask Networks.\n\n*   To do so, please Click on your Metamask wallet network drop-down menu, and select “custom RPC”, then fill in Shiden Network details as below.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1176/1\\*\\_a8aTAdlpZJWDIlCdCKVvw.jpeg)\n\n## 2. Adding tokens to Shiden Network Metamask\n\nOnce the Shiden Network is set up, we can import the **#STND** token on Shiden Network.\n\n*   Click **“Import tokens”** on the bottom of Metamask, go to **“Custom token”**, and enter **#STND** contract address:\\\n    👉 Shiden STND contract address:** 0x722377A047e89CA735f09Eb7CccAb780943c4CB4**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Oe-82TUe5fghETff.png)\n\n*   You can also add other tokens which You will eventually use on Standard DEX. Here is the list of [**tokens deployed on Shiden by Anyswap**](https://anyswap.medium.com/anyswap-integrates-with-shiden-network-beb6c3a7bf42)** **with their Shiden Network contract addresses:\n\n1.  **ETH:0x765277eebeca2e31912c9946eae1021199b39c61**\n2.  **USDC:0xfa9343c3897324496a05fc75abed6bac29f8a40f**\n3.  **USDT:0x818ec0a7fe18ff94269904fced6ae3dae6d6dc0b**\n4.  **DAI:0xefaeee334f0fd1712f9a8cc375f427d9cdd40d73**\n5.  **WBTC:0x922d641a426dcffaef11680e5358f34d97d112e1**\n6.  **BNB:0x332730a4f6e03d9c55829435f10360e13cfa41ff**\n7.  **BUSD:0x65e66a61d0a8f1e686c2d6083ad611a10d84d97a**\n\nTo add those tokens just simply repeat above procedure with new adresses\n\n## 3. Crossing assets from Ethereum to Shiden Network\n\n**To cross-chain #STND from ethereum erc20 to Shiden #STND, You need to use the router provided by Anyswap and have STND tokens on the Metamask wallet.**\n\n*   Go to the Anyswap router page — <https://anyswap.exchange/#/router> and connect the Metamask wallet on the ethereum network.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*55MV7Tnc5nAf\\_2KVmiN4ew.png)\n\n*   Click on the token selection drop-down menu on the ethereum network section, and select **STND** from the list, or simply type **STND** in the search name section.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*55vlr0ORpYzD4GhyOvZuDQ.png)\n\n*   Enter the #**STND** amount You want to send via the router.\n\n***\\*If You are using the router for the first time, You will have to hit the “Approve” button first and confirm the transaction in Metamask. Please keep in mind that each transaction needs some eth for fees.***\n\n***\\*Please read carefully all Infos at the bottom about minimum and maximum transfer amounts and tx fees.***\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*EOk6GKbcFJC7NGrik8srPg.png)\n\n*   After You approve the **#STND** token spend in Metamask You are able to do Swap with the router. Click **“swap”** and confirm tx in Metamask.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*SFq9Rm4zO8SQvN9IUt0IQQ.png)\n\n*   After the transaction is completed — (You can check with Metamask or explorer — ***\\*Please keep in mind that the estimated Time of cross-chain Arrival is around 10–30 min.)***\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/710/1\\*A_RByMyWaLjQQsvFqJiO1A.png)\n\nYour STND will be available on Shiden Network Metamask wallet account. Just switch networks from ethereum to Shiden. Now You are ready to use #**STND** on Standard DEX on Shiden Network.\n\n**To cross other assets like #USDC, #USDT, #WBTC, etc. which You will eventually use on Standard DEX for liquidity provision and LP farming, You need to use Anyswap bridge — **[**https://anyswap.exchange/#/bridge**](https://anyswap.exchange/#/bridge)\n\n*   To use the Anyswap bridge, connect with Metamask on the ethereum network. Select token You want to bridge on the ethereum side, select Shiden Network in the lower section as destination network and confirm the transaction with Metamask.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*8\\_7u81KsvjD0vfTzwaAUkw.png)\n\nAfter confirmation in Metamask, You can track Your bridge progress with the provided link in the pop-up.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/702/1\\*dFovv5033s8SjOiOt5G9cA.png)\n\n**After the transaction is confirmed on Anyswap bridge, change the network in Metamask to Shiden and Your assets are ready to use on Standard DEX**\n\n## 4.

画像を入手した経緯\n\n私（倉田幸暢）は、正規の手続きに従って、[国立公文書館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%AC%E6%96%87%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8)に対して、これらの２つの地図のデジタルデータ（画像ファイル）の利用申請を提出し、下記の手数料等を支払って、2021年4月にこれらの２つの地図の画像ファイルを入手しました。\n\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（中判特殊撮影）の料金 : 4コマ × 543円/コマ ＝ 2,172円\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（高精細特殊撮影）の料金 : 32コマ × 3,300円/コマ ＝ 105,600円\n* 上記撮影データのDVDＲへの書込みの料金 : DVDＲ 2枚 × 543円/枚 ＝ 1,086円\n* 梱包・送料 : 1件 × 520円/件 ＝ 520円\n* 手数料等合計金額 : 109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1巻と第2巻の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\n私は、16枚に分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪の地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\n私は、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、この画像ファイルを、パブリックドメインとして公開します。\n\n*

デジタルカメラ撮影（中判特殊撮影）の料金 : 4コマ × 543円/コマ ＝ 2,172円\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（高精細特殊撮影）の料金 : 32コマ × 3,300円/コマ ＝ 105,600円\n* 上記撮影データのDVDＲへの書込みの料金 : DVDＲ 2枚 × 543円/枚 ＝ 1,086円\n* 梱包・送料 : 1件 × 520円/件 ＝ 520円\n* 手数料等合計金額 : 109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1巻と第2巻の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\n私は、16枚に分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪の地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\n私は、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、この画像ファイルを、パブリックドメインとして公開します。\n\n*

ウィキペディア（『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』 日本語版）: [山門三塔坂本惣絵図 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)\n* ウィキペディア（『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』 英語版）: [Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanmon-Sant%C5%8D_Sakamoto_S%C5%8Dezu)\n\n## 画像を入手した経緯\n\n私（倉田幸暢）は、正規の手続きに従って、[国立公文書館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%AC%E6%96%87%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8)に対して、これらの２つの古地図のデジタルデータ（画像ファイル）の利用申請を提出し、下記の手数料等を支払って、2021年4月にこれらの２つの古地図の画像ファイルを入手しました。\n\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（中判特殊撮影）の料金 : 4コマ × 543円/コマ ＝ 2,172円\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（高精細特殊撮影）の料金 : 32コマ × 3,300円/コマ ＝ 105,600円\n* 上記撮影データのDVDＲへの書込みの料金 : DVDＲ 2枚 × 543円/枚 ＝ 1,086円\n* 梱包・送料 : 1件 × 520円/件 ＝ 520円\n* 手数料等合計金額 : 109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1巻と第2巻の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの古地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の古地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\n私は、16枚ずつに分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪と第2鋪の古地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\n私は、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、これらの古地図の画像ファイルを、パブリックドメインとして公開しました。\n\n*

「惣」とは、「すべて」という意味です。\n* 「[絵図](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)」という言葉は、[明治時代](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%98%8E%E6%B2%BB)以前に、現在で言うところの「地図」の意味で使われていた言葉です。\n\n### 史料として\n\n[比叡山](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1)[延暦寺](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA)は、「[古都京都の文化財（京都市、宇治市、大津市）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%A4%E9%83%BD%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E3%81%AE%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E8%B2%A1)」を構成する17の寺社のひとつとして、[ユネスコ](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E9%9A%9B%E9%80%A3%E5%90%88%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E6%A9%9F%E9%96%A2)の[世界遺産](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E9%81%BA%E7%94%A3)に登録されています \\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[6\\]。また、比叡山延暦寺は、国宝である[根本中堂](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA%E6%A0%B9%E6%9C%AC%E4%B8%AD%E5%A0%82)をはじめとして、複数の国宝や数多くの重要文化財を保有しています。このように、比叡山延暦寺は歴史的文化的に重要な場所であり、かつては現存しているよりも遥かに多くの文化財や史料を保有していました。\n\nしかし、比叡山延暦寺の文化財や史料は、[1571年の延暦寺焼打ち（元亀の法難）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))で被害を受け、その多くが失われました。そのため、かつての延暦寺の境内に存在した寺社の様子を伝える史料は数少ないです。\n\n『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、比叡山延暦寺の境内や坂本地区の寺社を描いた現存する古絵図の中では、もっとも詳細なものであるとされており、[1571年](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))以前に存在した可能性のある寺社も描かれています \\[7\\]。そのため、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、かつての比叡山延暦寺に存在した寺社の様子を知るための貴重な史料です。\n\n###

画像を入手した経緯\n\nぼくは、正規の手続きに従って、[国立公文書館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%AC%E6%96%87%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8)に対して、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』の第1鋪と第2鋪の２つの古地図のデジタルデータ（画像ファイル）の利用申請を提出し、下記の手数料等を支払って、2021年4月にこれらの２つの古地図の画像ファイルを入手しました。\n\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（中判特殊撮影）の料金 : 4コマ × 543円/コマ ＝ 2,172円\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（高精細特殊撮影）の料金 : 32コマ × 3,300円/コマ ＝ 105,600円\n* 上記撮影データのDVDＲへの書込みの料金 : DVDＲ 2枚 × 543円/枚 ＝ 1,086円\n* 梱包・送料 : 1件 × 520円/件 ＝ 520円\n* 手数料等合計金額 : 109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1鋪と第2鋪の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの古地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の古地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\nぼくは、16枚ずつに分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪と第2鋪の古地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\nぼくは、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、これらの古地図の画像ファイルを、ウィキメディア・コモンズで、パブリックドメインとして公開しました。\n\n*

\\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[6\\]。また、比叡山延暦寺は、国宝である[根本中堂](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA%E6%A0%B9%E6%9C%AC%E4%B8%AD%E5%A0%82)をはじめとして、複数の国宝や数多くの重要文化財を保有しています。このように、比叡山延暦寺は歴史的文化的に重要な場所であり、かつては現存しているよりも遥かに多くの文化財や史料を保有していました。\n\nしかし、比叡山延暦寺の文化財や史料は、[1571年の延暦寺焼打ち（元亀の法難）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))で被害を受け、その多くが失われました。そのため、かつての延暦寺の境内に存在した寺社の様子を伝える史料は数少ないです。\n\n『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、比叡山延暦寺の境内や坂本地区の寺社を描いた現存する古絵図の中では、もっとも詳細なものであるとされており、[1571年](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))以前に存在した可能性のある寺社も描かれています

画像を入手した経緯\n\nぼくは、正規の手続きに従って、[国立公文書館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%AC%E6%96%87%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8)に対して、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』の第1鋪と第2鋪の２つの古地図のデジタルデータ（画像ファイル）の利用申請を提出し、下記の手数料等を支払って、2021年4月にこれらの２つの古地図の画像ファイルを入手しました。\n\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（中判特殊撮影）の料金 : 4コマ × 543円/コマ ＝ 2,172円\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（高精細特殊撮影）の料金 : 32コマ × 3,300円/コマ ＝ 105,600円\n* 上記撮影データのDVDＲへの書込みの料金 : DVDＲ 2枚 × 543円/枚 ＝ 1,086円\n* 梱包・送料 : 1件 × 520円/件 ＝ 520円\n* 手数料等合計金額 : 109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1鋪と第2鋪の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの古地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の古地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\nぼくは、16枚ずつに分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪と第2鋪の古地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\nぼくは、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、これらの古地図の画像ファイルを、ウィキメディア・コモンズのウェブサイトで、パブリックドメインとして公開しました。\n\n*

「[坂本](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC_(%E5%A4%A7%E6%B4%A5%E5%B8%82))」とは、[比叡山](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1)の東麓にある[坂本地区](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC_(%E5%A4%A7%E6%B4%A5%E5%B8%82))（現在の[滋賀県](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%BB%8B%E8%B3%80%E7%9C%8C)[大津市](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A7%E6%B4%A5%E5%B8%82)[坂本](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC_(%E5%A4%A7%E6%B4%A5%E5%B8%82))）のことです。\n* 「惣」とは、「すべて」という意味です。\n* 「[絵図](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)」という言葉は、[明治時代](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%98%8E%E6%B2%BB)以前に、現在で言うところの「地図」の意味で使われていた言葉です。\n\n### 史料として\n\n[比叡山](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1)[延暦寺](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA)は、「[古都京都の文化財（京都市、宇治市、大津市）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%A4%E9%83%BD%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E3%81%AE%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E8%B2%A1)」を構成する17の寺社のひとつとして、[ユネスコ](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E9%9A%9B%E9%80%A3%E5%90%88%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E6%A9%9F%E9%96%A2)の[世界遺産](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E9%81%BA%E7%94%A3)に登録されています \\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[6\\]。また、比叡山延暦寺は、国宝である[根本中堂](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA%E6%A0%B9%E6%9C%AC%E4%B8%AD%E5%A0%82)をはじめとして、複数の国宝や数多くの重要文化財を保有しています。このように、比叡山延暦寺は歴史的文化的に重要な場所であり、かつては現存しているよりも遥かに多くの文化財や史料を保有していました。\n\nしかし、比叡山延暦寺の文化財や史料は、[1571年の延暦寺焼打ち（元亀の法難）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))で被害を受け、その多くが失われました。そのため、かつての延暦寺の境内に存在した寺社の様子を伝える史料は数少ないです。\n\n『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、比叡山延暦寺の境内や坂本地区の寺社を描いた現存する古絵図の中では、もっとも詳細なものであるとされており、[1571年](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))以前に存在した可能性のある寺社も描かれています \\[7\\]。そのため、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、かつての比叡山延暦寺に存在した寺社の様子を知るための貴重な史料です。\n\n###

画像を入手した経緯\n\nぼくは、正規の手続きに従って、[国立公文書館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%AC%E6%96%87%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8)に対して、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』の第1鋪と第2鋪の２つの古地図のデジタルデータ（画像ファイル）の利用申請を提出し、下記の手数料等を支払って、2021年4月にこれらの２つの古地図の画像ファイルを入手しました。\n\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（中判特殊撮影）の料金 : 4コマ × 543円/コマ ＝ 2,172円\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（高精細特殊撮影）の料金 : 32コマ × 3,300円/コマ ＝ 105,600円\n* 上記撮影データのDVDＲへの書込みの料金 : DVDＲ 2枚 × 543円/枚 ＝ 1,086円\n* 梱包・送料 : 1件 × 520円/件 ＝ 520円\n* 手数料等合計金額 : 109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1鋪と第2鋪の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの古地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の古地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\nぼくは、16枚ずつに分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪と第2鋪の古地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\nぼくは、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、これらの古地図の画像ファイルを、ウィキメディア・コモンズのウェブサイトで、パブリックドメインとして公開しました。\n\n*

That’s it.\n\nUnder the hood, however, there are thousands of messages being sent every day containing everything from links to incredible content, useful resources, new projects being launched, courses to be taken, events to attend and so much much more.\n\nHowever, while Discord is a fantastic place to hang out and chat, it isn’t great for recalling the information you may have missed or seen the popular/most engaging conversations of that day.\n\nSo, that’s why we’ll be building out a Shiny front-end! While we plan to build this openly inside Discord we can say that there will be a custom Graph & Information Directory with the tooling needed to grab and index information shared in Discord and discovered online in real-time.\n\nTo accompany this, there will be a searchable member directory (pseudonymity allowed obviously) to help members connect and collaborate with others more easily. Some parts of the front end will be accessible to all while the majority of it will only be accessible to members.\n\n## Launch the $SHINY Token\n\nAs a community, we are proud to be part of the second cohort to go through the [Seed Club](https://seedclub.xyz/) accelerator to launch the $SHINY token.\n\nWe’re firm believers that communities and cooperatives with aligned incentives and governance structures will be the key to unlocking the true potential Web3 offers.\n\nAs of today, $SHINY token holders are able to vote on key decisions via Snapshot and access unique spaces and channels within the Discord. Soon the token will be the key (alongside Shiny Magpie NFTs) to unlocking the community as a whole.\n\nVery shortly members will be able to get $SHINY for participating, attending events, completing bounties, or building epic shit within the community.\n\nWe have A LOT more planned for the future as well!\n\n## Launch the Shiny DAO\n\nOne core ethos at the front of every decision made so far is that SOSC will be a community-owned project.\n\nTransitioning to being a DAO is something we are already in the process of and will look to solidify this over the coming months.\n\nWe believe that DAOs have incredible potential to raise & deploy capital, build products and services and create value for the world faster than most traditional businesses and we want to be part of that.\n\nThroughout Season 1 we’ll put the remaining infrastructure and compliance in place to transition SOSC to being a DAO under the guidance of Awisemaninotion.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dj-iuzFpZHb94A0EpXu1V.png?height=2048&width=2732)\n\n## Content\n\nThe internet lights up with new Shiny Objects each and every day but as mentioned above if you aren’t on Discord when something is being discussed then chances are you may miss it completely.\n\nSo, it’s time to start producing some content around the huge amount of chatter going on.\n\nLast week we launched the Shiny Podcast, a private feed available for members only as a way to catch up with what's been going on over the previous week. Members are also able to attend the recording live.\n\nTo accompany the podcast, the weekly Shiny Newsletter Digest will be resumed, packed full of links and notes from the week before.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mmlQXWowcONkW8IR24BfJ.png?height=2048&width=2732)\n\n## Switch Memberships\n\nUp to this point access has always been gated and the entirety of the Club has only been available to members with memberships only being open sporadically.\n\nIn Season 1 we’ll be moving membership to always-on meaning you’ll be able to apply and join the Discord in a limited capacity at any time. There will also be ways to contribute even if you’re not a full member.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5K5XcAp0M5yoydtUqr3aO.png?height=2048&width=2732)\n\nAdditionally, we’ll be building some new infrastructure to further support fiat and crypto on-ramps.\n\nThat’s it!\n\nIf you’re interested in joining us, look out for announcements coming soon on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShinyObjectSC).\n\nLFG.\n\np.s. if you’re interested in contributing to the Club we’re always looking for incredible people. Please apply here.\n\np.p.s. ", "timestamp": 1635325962, "digest": "pJVikHhCgwiAOw0RT2v9osToBzRWj12obcaSroXeG54", "contributor": "0x54681ac94D4e3C8F58F54B576B654DC2D1950ae0"}

画像を入手した経緯\n\nぼくは、正規の手続きに従って、[国立公文書館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%AC%E6%96%87%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8)に対して、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』の第1鋪と第2鋪の２つの古地図のデジタルデータ（画像ファイル）の利用申請を提出し、下記の手数料等を支払って、2021年4月にこれらの２つの古地図の画像ファイルを入手しました。\n\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（中判特殊撮影）の料金 : 4コマ × 543円/コマ ＝ 2,172円\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（高精細特殊撮影）の料金 : 32コマ × 3,300円/コマ ＝ 105,600円\n* 上記撮影データのDVDＲへの書込みの料金 : DVDＲ 2枚 × 543円/枚 ＝ 1,086円\n* 梱包・送料 : 1件 × 520円/件 ＝ 520円\n* 手数料等合計金額 : 109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1鋪と第2鋪の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの古地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の古地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\nぼくは、16枚ずつに分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪と第2鋪の古地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\nぼくは、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、これらの古地図の画像ファイルを、ウィキメディア・コモンズのウェブサイトで、パブリックドメインとして公開しました。\n\n*

{"id": "g_wbV4SUK8TKV00IESfyKyxkVQc1fAlUqeANf_DaJi0", "title": "Welcome to Decent", "body": "Hello world! We are Decent. The world’s first DECENTralized independent label; the DECENT choice for artists. We are creating efficiency and fairness in the historically inequitable music industry by putting artists and fans on the same team.\n\nOur NFT platform allows artists to mint and auction NFTs collateralized by royalty revenues. By tying investors’ ROI to artists’ royalty growth rates, Decent creates a synergistic flywheel between fans, investors, and musicians, incentivizing fans to market on behalf of artists. Just as streaming platforms democratized audiences, we aim to democratize ownership with Decent.\n\n## Music as Work-to-Rent\n\nTo date, middlemen and intermediaries have controlled music's funding, promotion, and data channels.  Monopolistic control over distribution and capital has enabled these middlemen to rate-limit industry success and normalize extractive pricing, resulting in artists earning only \\~12% of the value that they create.  More draconian still, “making it” as an artist generally entails relinquishing 80% - 90% of their master rights.  Taken together, these statistics highlight music to be the only industry in which participants are expected to mortgage their future only to mortgage their present.\n\n## Why Decent?\n\n**With Decent, artists will always retain 100% of the master rights to their music.**  We aim to mitigate the music industry’s feudal paradigm of work-to-rent and replace it with an economic system predicated on the integrity of strictly-enforced property rights.  A system that rewards artists’ creativity and determination, treating each copyright as the cornerstone of a vibrant career rather than a time card.\n\nUsing our smart contracts and royalty vaults, artists can raise money for future projects, cultivate an invested fanbase, and maintain ownership of their intellectual property (IP). Artists determine what percentage of their royalty revenues they would like to make investable for fans and for how long, making the funding process flexible and customizable. To raise capital, artists will auction royalty-backed NFTs priced in accordance with the artists’ incumbent popularity and the duration of the contract.\n\nBy supporting an artist’s auction, participants will build out portfolios of their favorite artists, effectively joining their team. Fans-turned-teammates will have access to exclusive opportunities to participate in the creative journey like never before and can even be rewarded with airdrops when their artist communities succeed.\n\nCutting out the traditional record label “middleman” unlocks previously gate-kept value for both the artist and fan, who take up a symbiotic relationship driven by financial and emotional interests. With Decent, artists will have access to all the resources of a traditional label (funding, marketing, distribution, community) without having to surrender large portions of their IP. And when they succeed, the fans who supported them from the beginning will be the beneficiaries, not a third party corporation.\n\nAs Decent artists develop with help from their newfound teammates, the entire Decent community will reap the benefits.  Decent’s marketplace fees will be split between the Decent Treasury and Community Rewards Matching Pools to provide the users with ownership over the platform.\n\n## Roadmap: What’s Next?\n\nJoin Decent to accelerate artists’ careers and reinvent one of the world’s most antiquated economic structures. **Artists:** receive capital and a team to accelerate your career - your fans want to bet on you and contribute to your journey. **Fans:** build your own label and receive exposure to the exciting, new asset class of music royalties while supporting the creation of art you care about.\n\nSign up for our waitlist [here](https://69tdcraihqg.typeform.com/to/Xkh00RVd).\n\n[Website](https://decent.xyz).\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/decentdotxyz).", "timestamp": 1635324153, "digest": "qsvUuJOGdjj_o49zqtIaSx8wh-92usgJMkkomv-LHNs", "contributor": "0x673Fc290d919684A1B1E46AA69152f7b56FBADD8"}

年以来，区块链世界最令人瞩目的变化是：以太坊受可扩展性限制已经无力维系一家独大的局面，各种新公链和 Layer2 网络不断涌现，其中一些已经获取了大量使用，并承载巨量的加密资产，同时也令越来越多的人相信，区块链世界的未来格局不是一链打遍天下（One Chain Fit All），而是由众多区块链组成的互联网络（Internet of Blockchain）。\n\n![章鱼网络刘毅：为什么我们不是区块链互联网枢纽极简主义者](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/2443b69b612d52a987189743248cee71\\_SzcJHNL.png-article)\n\n说到区块链互联网，Cosmos 及其创始人的贡献就无法忽视。2015 年，Jae Kwon 和他的合作者创造了 Tendermint，一种基于 PoS 的 BFT 共识协议，使得任何人都可以快速创建区块链。那时的他们就已经预见到：随着大量特定目的的区块链不断涌现，它们必定互联成网，支持资产和数据自由流动，形成去中心化的下一代互联网（Web3.0）基础设施。\n\n在 Cosmos 的区块链互联网蓝图中，有一类特殊的区块链，它们的功能是作为互操作枢纽（习惯上称为跨链枢纽）连接尽可能多的区块链，因此被称为 Hub。Cosmos Hub 是第一个此类区块链，IRIS Hub 是第二个。相对于 Hub，其他用途的区块链被称之为 Zone。\n\n![章鱼网络刘毅：为什么我们不是区块链互联网枢纽极简主义者](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/66430007a6d15102a1d876d1db773c47\\_h30fT1h.png-article)\n\nCosmos 的设计者们沿袭了互联网架构设计的 [端到端原则](https://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/endtoend.pdf)（End to End Arguments），即：网络的很多功能，例如加密、压缩、校验、应答、重传等，需要有处于网络边缘的应用系统的知识和协助下才能完成，因此在通讯网络中实现它们没有意义。\n\n端到端原则的区块链互联网版本被称为枢纽极简主义，是 Comos 网络架构的设计哲学。即 Hub 的功能应该尽量少，由此带来三个好处：一是 Hub 代码简化，安全性可靠性更高；二是 Hub 可以把有限的交易处理能力（单位是 tps）专门用于处理跨链交易，实现高效且低成本的跨链；三是避免 Hub 和 Zone 功能重叠，由于 Hub 是生态的核心，如果 Hub 和 Zone 竞争，势必抑制 Zone 的创新。\n\n![章鱼网络刘毅：为什么我们不是区块链互联网枢纽极简主义者](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/40136aedadbf53419cd136f81e98cd91\\_0KC5d0c.png-article)\n\n2020 年，有人提出应该在 Cosmos Hub 上部署 AMM DEX，作为基础 DeFi 服务提供给整个生态。这一提议明显违背了枢纽极简主义原则，引发了激烈的争论。争论的结果是实用主义占了上风。经过 1 年的开发和测试，Gravity DEX 在 2021 年中上线。但是，Cosmos 社区并未放弃枢纽极简主义，只把 Gravity DEX 视为特例。但问题是：那么为什么存在 Gravity DEX 这样的特例？也许更一般化的问题是：枢纽极简主义是否存在边界？\n\n![章鱼网络刘毅：为什么我们不是区块链互联网枢纽极简主义者](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/0f14f9e177df5204bfdb8297471afb3a.png-article)\n\n只需看看真实区块链世界的互联拓扑图，就能很容易地发现：以太坊处于轮辐型网络的轴心，跟所有重要的区块链都有桥接。对于每一条公链、layer2 或者特定目的区块链，跨链互操作的第一需求都是连接以太坊。而所有区块链连接以太坊的动机，不是因为以太坊最「精简」，而恰恰是因为以太坊最「胖」，容纳了最多的应用层协议、最多的加密资产和最多的用户。以太坊已经成为区块链互联网「事实上的枢纽」，也是最胖的枢纽。\n\n![章鱼网络刘毅：为什么我们不是区块链互联网枢纽极简主义者](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/231656e996575882b66c901de985f7ce_ifMFokC.png-article)\n\nPolkadot 一向与 Cosmos 并称为跨链双雄。虽然没有采用相同的术语，但 Polkadot 同样奉行枢纽极简主义。作为枢纽的 Polkadot Relay，没有应用层业务，也不能部署智能合约。而且，Polkadot 正致力于把除了共享安全以外的基础功能，包括 DOT 发行、链上治理等，都转移到「系统平行链」上，比 Cosmos Hub 的极简更加激进。\n\n极简的 Polkadot Relay 意味着包括 DeFi 等去中心化应用只能由平行链承载。Polkadot 的 DeFi 生态发展依赖于平行链间的可组合性。可是实现平行链间互操作面临两个障碍：一是 Polkadot 网络内的跨链协议 XCMP 上线日期未定。没有 XCMP，平行链事实上是孤立的链，既不能与其他平行链互操作，也无法通过公共跨链桥与以太坊等其他公链实现互联互通。\n\n二是插槽拍卖机制引发的不确定性，源平行链在考虑与目标平行链进行协议组合时需要额外考虑以下因素：目标平行链当前插槽租期还有多久？能否在到期之前再次赢得拍卖？一旦对方不能成功续期，平行链降级为平行线程，其活性将大幅下降，很可能造成协议组合失败。\n\n![章鱼网络刘毅：为什么我们不是区块链互联网枢纽极简主义者](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/fa28e2d5ffa756f59564420e9218219c_hXvnHV5.png-article)\n\n章鱼网络是继 Cosmos 和 Polkadot 之后的第三个值得注意的多链网络协议，其设计目标是安全高效地启动并运行大量独立区块链形态的 Web3.0 应用——应用链。三个多链网络协议的核心区别在于子链（Zone/Parachain/Appchain）获得安全性的方式。在 Cosmos 网络中，Zone 是独立的 Tendermint 共识区块链，由自己的 PoS 提供安全保障。Polkadot 是异构分片区块链，平行链并不是独立共识的区块链，而是分片，由中继链保障他们具有相同等级的安全性。\n\n章鱼网络的应用链是类似于 Cosmos Zone 的独立共识区块链，但是所有应用链的 PoS 都被委托给章鱼中继，使用章鱼网络的原生通证 OCT 作为排他性的抵押品。应用链通过调节向抵押了 OCT 的验证节点提供的出块奖励数量，可以自主决定自身的安全等级。章鱼网络的跨链枢纽不是一条独立的 layer1 公链，而是一组运行在 Near Protocol 上的智能合约。在我们深入讨论 Octopus Network 设计逻辑之前，需要先谈谈 DeFi 和非金融类 Web3.0 应用的关系。\n\n每个 Web3.0 应用都是一个由加密通证协调的去中心化市场协议。包括协议开发者、投资者、验证人（矿工）、服务提供者和社区宣传者在内的多种参与者为市场的建立与繁荣做出贡献，并获得通证奖励。加密通证要身处于加密资产市场上才能具有价格，才能完成资本形成和再投入过程。例如验证人通过出售加密通证，获得法币，支付验证节点的 IT 成本和人工成本。因此，Web3.0 应用的发展离不开 DeFi 的支持。\n\n应用链的核心优势就是专注于特定的应用场景，达到用户体验最优。它不可能也不应该试图自建 DeFi 协议生态，而是应该使用业已存在的、内容丰富的、快速创新的、拥有良好流动性的已有 DeFi 设施。这就好像无论是工厂、游乐场还是养殖场，都不会自建金融市场，而是会在现有的市场发行股票和债券。\n\n![章鱼网络刘毅：为什么我们不是区块链互联网枢纽极简主义者](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/8743533166955e859a6dc1068c0c28ae_YyfqWNe.png-article)\n\n章鱼网络的基础协议可以看成是去中心化的孵化器。每隔一段时间，章鱼网络将启动得到社区最多支持的应用链，并支持应用链进行 Skyward IDO。为了帮助应用链项目获得更多资金，并且与应用链社区建立起了经济纽带，章鱼网络将直接向应用链 IDO 投资者空投 OCT 通证。前 10 条应用链每条获得 20 万个 OCT 的空投，第 11-100 条应用链 OS-IDO 分别获得 10 万个 OCT 空投。Skyward IDO 结束后，应用链项目会在 Ref.finance 建立交易池，并注入初始流动性，并根据需要为流动性提供者提供激励。\n\n可见所有章鱼网络应用链从诞生的第一天起，就会跟 NEAR 区块链上的 DeFi 建立紧密的共生关系。而且在章鱼网络中，应用链和 NEAR 平台的 DeFi 协议之间互操作需求，比应用链之间的互操作要重要得多。在过去几个月间，Skyward 平台上进行了几个引人注目的 IDO。Ref.finance IDO 的参与者数量接近 2000，Octopus Network 的 IDO 参与者接近 4000，而最近的 Paras IDO 的参与者数量超过了 4000。这并不意味着 Paras 比 Octopus 或者 Octopus 比 Ref.finance 更有价值。而是每个有价值认可的 IDO 都在扩大 Skyward 的用户基础，帮助后续协议完成更成功的 IDO。\n\nOCT 在 Ref 的交易池的 TVL 达到 7 百万美元。想象一下，Octopus Network 未来将连接数百条应用链，产生数以千计的 FT 和数以百万计的 NFT，这些资产都将进入 Ref.finance 以及其他 NEAR 平台的 DeFi 协议，或进行交易，或充当抵押品。所谓生态系统，精髓就是局部的发展会推动整体的繁荣。\n\nVitalik 在 [今年的 EthCC 会议上说](https://forkast.news/vitalik-buterin-defi-ethereum-social-media-ethcc/)：以太坊生态不能总是创造 token，其功能是交易其他 token。金融系统的作用是在为社会生产高效地配置资本。如果资本不能流入生产部门创造效用，那么金融系统除了输出泡沫将别无他用。应用链是一个个去中心化的生产型数字经济体。他们与 DeFi 协议的关系就如同是实体经济和金融系统的关系。在 NEAR 平台上，在 Ocotpus Network 的协调下，DeFi 和非金融类 Web3.0 应用将产生前所未有的良性互动。\n\n![章鱼网络刘毅：为什么我们不是区块链互联网枢纽极简主义者](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/e50bd1acbfc951ae8ce28dcc0a4bdb80\\_so371K3.png-article)\n\n世界上只有一个互联网。即便经过了数十年的发展，互联网的内涵仍然在快速变化。对于这样的单例的实物，归纳法通常效果不佳。端到端原则也不是互联网的先验原则，而应该看作是对互联网架构的反思。正如发表于 1981 年的经典论文《系统设计中的端到端原则》所述：「本论文所讨论的关于功能放置的原则已被使用多年，然而却未必清晰的认识和确定。」 而且「端到端原则」这个习惯性的翻译很成问题。其实它不是某种原则（principle），而是论证（argument），且有足够多的 [反例](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y-7ecEziSI) 和 [反思](https://www.chainnews.com/articles/nms.lcs.mit.edu/6829-papers/bravenewworld.pdf)。\n\n所谓的「区块链互联网」，更多是一种隐喻，而非定义。这一隐喻帮助很多人建立起了对多链网络的直观印象。但是「区块链互联网是互联网」，或者「多链网络是通信网络」，这样的断言并不可靠。没有演绎的基础，枢纽极简主义适用于多链网络就不是逻辑推论，而仅仅是一种类比。\n\n加密圈子里越来越多的人，包括 [Cosmos 的研究者](https://blog.cosmos.network/the-cosmos-hub-is-a-port-city-5b7f2d28debf)，[将加密网络与城市相类比](https://a16z.com/2018/07/26/cryptonetworks-cities-analogies/)。成功大都市的形态，都不是自上而下设计的结果，而是历史演进的产物。交通便利、水源丰富的地方逐渐发展出集市，演变成商贸中心城市，最终极少数商贸中心城市发展成金融中心，服务于广大的区域和众多的产业。在现实世界中，所有金融中心都是交通中心，所有交通中心都是商贸中心。\n\n新公链要在未来的区块链互联网中占据一席之地，关键是要发展成金融中心，聚集大量 DeFi 协议和加密资产。在 Cosmos 和 Polkadot 两个多链网络中，聚集了最多资源支持和社区共识的枢纽，Cosmos Hub 和 Polkadot Relay，放弃了成为金融中心的前景，只能将此重任寄托于 Terra、Osmosis、Acala、Moonbeam、Astar 等生态项目。\n\nNEAR Protocol 提供了接近 Web2.0 的用户体验，同时具备坚实的去中心化基础。它正在聚集整个生态系统的资源和共识，快速崛起为区块链世界金融中心。鉴于 NEAR Protocol 具备基于分片的几乎无上限的扩容潜力，能够容纳比以太坊 layer1 多成百上千倍加密协议和加密资产，成为最胖的区块链互联网枢纽。而 Octopus Network 正在成为围绕 NEAR 的卫星城市带，是非金融类 Web3.0 应用的最佳栖息地。\n\n免责声明：作为区块链信息平台，本站所发布文章仅代表作者个人观点，与链闻 ChainNews 立场无关。文章内的信息、意见等均仅供参考，并非作为或被视为实际投资建议。\n", "timestamp": 1635328086, "digest": "mEOu0sVsAzT7Rf2rXRHppWY2lwkjkTbNVCnICAMr9cY", "contributor":

Members are also able to attend the recording live.\n\nTo accompany the podcast, the weekly Shiny Newsletter Digest will be resumed, packed full of links and notes from the week before.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mmlQXWowcONkW8IR24BfJ.png?height=2048&width=2732)\n\n## Switch Memberships\n\nUp to this point access has always been gated and the entirety of the Club has only been available to members with memberships only being open sporadically.\n\nIn Season 1 we’ll be moving membership to always-on meaning you’ll be able to apply and join the Discord in a limited capacity at any time. There will also be ways to contribute even if you’re not a full member.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5K5XcAp0M5yoydtUqr3aO.png?height=2048&width=2732)\n\nAdditionally, we’ll be building some new infrastructure to further support fiat and crypto on-ramps.\n\nThat’s it!\n\nIf you’re interested in joining us, look out for announcements coming soon on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShinyObjectSC).\n\nLFG.\n\np.s. membership applications opening soon.", "timestamp": 1635328582, "digest": "pJVikHhCgwiAOw0RT2v9osToBzRWj12obcaSroXeG54", "contributor": "0x54681ac94D4e3C8F58F54B576B654DC2D1950ae0"}

史料として\n\n[比叡山](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1)[延暦寺](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA)は、「[古都京都の文化財（京都市、宇治市、大津市）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%A4%E9%83%BD%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E3%81%AE%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E8%B2%A1)」を構成する17の寺社のひとつとして、[ユネスコ](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E9%9A%9B%E9%80%A3%E5%90%88%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E6%A9%9F%E9%96%A2)の[世界遺産](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E9%81%BA%E7%94%A3)に登録されています \\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[6\\]。また、比叡山延暦寺は、国宝である[根本中堂](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA%E6%A0%B9%E6%9C%AC%E4%B8%AD%E5%A0%82)をはじめとして、複数の国宝や数多くの重要文化財を保有しています。このように、比叡山延暦寺は歴史的文化的に重要な場所であり、かつては現存しているよりも遥かに多くの文化財や史料を保有していました。\n\nしかし、比叡山延暦寺の文化財や史料は、[1571年の延暦寺焼打ち（元亀の法難）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))で被害を受け、その多くが失われました。そのため、かつての延暦寺の境内に存在した寺社の様子を伝える史料は数少ないです。\n\n『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、比叡山延暦寺の境内や坂本地区の寺社を描いた現存する古絵図の中では、もっとも詳細なものであるとされており、[1571年](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))以前に存在した可能性のある寺社も描かれています \\[7\\]。そのため、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、かつての比叡山延暦寺に存在した寺社の様子を知るための貴重な史料です。\n\n### 所蔵場所\n\n『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、現在は[国立公文書館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%AC%E6%96%87%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8)に所蔵されています。（かつては[内閣文庫](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%86%85%E9%96%A3%E6%96%87%E5%BA%AB)に所蔵されていました。）\n\n###

画像を入手した経緯\n\nぼくは、正規の手続きに従って、[国立公文書館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%AC%E6%96%87%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8)に対して、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』の第1鋪と第2鋪の２つの古地図のデジタルデータ（画像ファイル）の利用申請を提出し、下記の手数料等を支払って、2021年4月にこれらの２つの古地図の画像ファイルを入手しました。\n\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（中判特殊撮影）の料金 : 4コマ × 543円/コマ ＝ 2,172円\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（高精細特殊撮影）の料金 : 32コマ × 3,300円/コマ ＝ 105,600円\n* 上記撮影データのDVDＲへの書込みの料金 : DVDＲ 2枚 × 543円/枚 ＝ 1,086円\n* 梱包・送料 : 1件 × 520円/件 ＝ 520円\n* 手数料等合計金額 : 109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1鋪と第2鋪の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの古地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の古地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\nぼくは、16枚ずつに分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪と第2鋪の古地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\nぼくは、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、これらの古地図の画像ファイルを、ウィキメディア・コモンズのウェブサイトで、パブリックドメインとして公開しました。\n\n*

This allows for any scheme of loot composability and shifts the balance of value towards single Loot Items themselves\n* Rarity (only applicable to Loot Items) is made up of 7 classes (UNCOMMON, COMMON, RARE, EPIC, LEGENDARY, MYTHIC, RELIC), dictates what attributes a particular Item will exhibit, and is derived from the original container seed\n\n### Minting Loot Containers\n\nIn pLOOT there are Loot Containers and Loot Items, the latter is what can be valuable (e.g. based on their rarity, or usefulness in a particular application or game) but can only be obtained by minting the former; in other words, you will need to generate and claim (mint) Loot Containers (there are 8 classes of them, with different properties), in order to mint Loot Items.\n\n**Minting containers is a two-step process:**\n\n* First, you request a ContainerGenesis event, in exchange for that container class mint floor price; besides reserving the container for yourself, this will initiate a Chainlink VRF request that will eventually seed (usually within a few blocks) and permanently associate your container with a truly random genesis seed\n* Second, and only after the Chainlink VRF oracle will have fulfilled the randomness, the container is ready to be claimed and any Loot Items inside it unveiled (and minted in the same tx); initially these will be owned by the container itself\n\nSpeaking of ownership: in pLOOT, every Loot Item is ownable (and per above, initially belonging to the container that minted it) which makes for programmable Loot Containers (able to host any Loot Item combination), from which owners can freely deposit (items that they now own, e.g. because they acquired them on the market) and withdraw them (if they were transferred inside the container). \n\nFollows a visual guide showcasing all these features:", "timestamp": 1635332937, "digest": "P65d889f1Y5JYrybe0VU8Dq0Gb2cpN09MuqCzvViLBs", "contributor": "0x08F55ce05312d79B7525AB70BfF689ee48b2b53C"}

Pro sebe i pro vás, jsem si rád osvěžil tuhle problematiku. Téma je to rozsáhlé a proto si hned ze startu, vysvětlíme mechaniku yield farmingu a jeho rizika. Na **[youtube kanále](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1uzKebERLIyxzJexq0bCA)**\\*\\* \\*\\*se brzy objeví první projekt, který se mi líbí z bezpečnostních a rizikových důvodů běžící na Ethereu.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*U11_fQ2Z7UdOBgQs)\n\n## Jak rizikový je yield farming?\n\nAčkoli yield farming nabízí uživatelům možnost maximalizovat své odměny, tyto strategie obvykle zahrnují **vysoká** rizika. Schválně je toto téma jako první v tomhle článku.\n\nRizikovost strategií yield farmingu však závisí na několika faktorech, jako jsou např:\n\n> *Počet kryptoměn a protokolů DeFi.Samotná aktivitaPoužité kryptoměny (stablecoiny jsou považovány za nejméně rizikové možnosti)Chytré kontrakty platforem DeFiPoplatky za používání protokolůPověst projektůVaše znalosti o DeFi, kryptoměnách a skutečných protokolech a aktivitách, které ve své strategii používáte.*\n\nNa základě výše uvedeného nejbezpečnější strategie yield farmingu zahrnují pouze několik stablecoinů investovaných v průběhu 1–2 aktivit na jednom renomovaném protokolu DeFi, který obsahuje auditované smart kontrakty.\n\nNaopak pokud budete používat mnoho nestálých kryptoměn s menší tržní kapitalizací k vytváření výnosů napříč více relativně novými DeFi protokoly s neauditovanými chytrými kontrakty, budete čelit jednoznačně vyšším rizikům.\n\nZásadní je zmínit rizika spojená s kompozitností DeFi. Jednou z hlavních výhod decentralizovaných finančních aplikací je, že je lze snadno integrovat. Představte si každý protokol jako kostku Lega, která je postavena na ostatních.\n\nTo jim sice umožňuje bezproblémově spolupracovat, ale mnoho protokolů DeFi se při svém fungování do značné míry spoléhá na další decentralizované finanční služby. Z tohoto důvodu, pokud se u jednoho hlavního protokolu vyskytne významný problém, pravděpodobně ovlivní i několik dalších platforem DeFi.\n\n> *V důsledku toho musíte kromě skutečných protokolů zahrnutých do vašich strategií hospodaření s výnosy znát a důvěřovat také všem ostatním platformám DeFi, na které se spoléhají.*\n\n## Co je to yield farming?\n\nZjednodušeně řečeno se pod pojmem yield farming rozumí činnost v oboru kryptoměn decentralizovaných financí, kdy na základě určitých kritérii používáte svoje prostředky k tomu, aby jste získali další.\n\n> *I když to zní skvěle, není to tak snadné, jak se na první pohled může zdát. Naopak, yield farming je jedním z nejsložitějších způsobů, jak vydělávat krypto v decentralizovaném finančním prostoru.*\n\nYield farming, někdy označované jako liquidity mining, zahrnuje přesouvání vašich prostředků napříč několika protokoly DeFi, kde vkládáte, půjčujete ostatním a můžete si i půjčovat stablecoiny proti vašim drženým digitálním aktivům, abyste je reinvestovali a maximalizovali své výnosy.\n\nVětšina strategií yield farmingu (a také těch nejvýnosnějších) je poměrně složitá a zahrnuje zvýšená rizika pro farmáře (více o tom později).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*W61Pdd5_XkPPX0Nd)\n\nPřesto existují i jednoduché strategie yield farmingu, které zahrnují pouze dodávání likvidity do poolu protokolu DeFi, aby se usnadnilo efektivní obchodování na platformě, a zároveň se za to získává kombinace transakčních poplatků a odměn za tokeny.\n\n## Jak funguje yield farming?\n\nNyní, když jsme probrali základy yield farmingu se podiváme na to, jak oblíbená činnost DeFi, která vydělává na kryptoměnách, funguje v praxi.\n\nProtože je naše téma dost složité, podíváme se v této části postupně na nejdůležitější součásti a procesy související s yield farmingem.\n\n## DeFi půjčky a staking\n\nPro začátek je důležité prozkoumat půjčování a staking kryptoměn prostřednictvím protokolů DeFi.\n\nPro rekapitulaci: DeFi označuje soubor finančních produktů a služeb, které uživatelům umožňují půjčovat si finanční prostředky, vydělávat peníze a obchodovat s aktivy decentralizovaným, otevřeným, demokratickým a bezoprávněným způsobem. Jednoduše řečeno, DeFi nabízí uživatelům decentralizované alternativy finančních řešení, které lze nalézt v tradičním finančním odvětví u poskytovatelů, jako jsou banky, makléři a pojišťovny.\n\nJednou z nejdůležitějších součástí decentralizovaných financí jsou smart kontrakty, digitální dohody mezi stranami, které automaticky vynucují a vykonávají předem dohodnutá pravidla.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1356/0\\*s0KfwG8LCz9iq631)\n\nV případě protokolů DeFi umožňují smart kontrakty fungovat neúvěrovým způsobem, což znamená, že služby nedrží vaše finanční prostředky vaším jménem. Namísto ukládání mincí do centralizovaných peněženek, abyste mohli řešení používat, musíte připojit kompatibilní peněženku a poslat peníze do smart kontraktu. Tímto způsobem máte plnou kontrolu nad soukromými klíči své peněženky, aniž by měl poskytovatel služby přístup k vašim prostředkům.\n\n**Nyní** se podívejme na kryptopeněžní půjčky a staking, dvě široce oblíbené aktivity v DeFi, které jsou často zahrnuty do strategií yield farmingu.\n\n> ***Staking*** *je postup, při kterém si na určitou dobu uzamknete své tokeny v peněžence, abyste podpořili konkrétní blockchainovou síť nebo protokol DeFi. U blockchainů založených na konsensuálním mechanismu Proof-of-Stake (PoS) a jeho variantách je od validátorů vyžadováno, aby k validaci bloků a ověřování transakcí stakovali nativní tokeny. Výměnou za zabezpečení sítě získávají zainteresované strany odměny za staking.*\n\nPokud jde o DeFi, mnoho protokolů implementovalo staking jako mechanismus odměňování poskytovatelů likvidity (LP) za přispění tokenů pro obchodní pár (např. USDC/ETH) do poolu. To sice nezahrnuje žádnou validaci bloků, ale podporujete tím ekosystém řešení DeFi (usnadňujete rozšířené výměny tokenů poskytováním likvidity) a získáváte za to odměny. Mnoho výnosových farmářských strategií zahrnuje tento typ stakingu, který generuje pasivní příjem.\n\nNa druhou stranu protokoly DeFi pro půjčování umožňují dlužníkům přístup k dodatečnému kapitálu (obvykle ve stablecoinech) tím, že použijí své kryptoměny jako kolaterál (např. uloží ETH jako kolaterál, aby si mohli **půjčit** DAI nebo USDT). Zároveň mohou věřitelé generovat pasivní příjem tím, že ukládají stablecoiny do poolu a po jejich mincích získávají úroky (a umožňují ostatním uživatelům, aby si je půjčili).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*WoA7RbJvng4dJuUg)\n\nVzhledem k tomu, že půjčování kryptoměn je u protokolů DeFi overcolateralizováno (např. po držbě ETH v hodnotě 100 USD si můžete půjčit pouze 60 USD DAI), jsou prostředky věřitelů chráněny proti neplatícím dlužníkům nebo selhání.\n\nPokud jde o yield farming, mnoho uživatelů využívá půjčovací pooly, aby získali dodatečné výnosy ze svých tokenů, nebo si půjčují stablecoiny proti svým drženým kryptopenězům, aby je reinvestovali prostřednictvím řešení DeFi.\n\n## Automatizovaní tvůrci trhu (AMM), liquidity pools a tokeny LP\n\nZatímco staking a půjčování kryptopeněz jsou v rámci yield farmingu druhotnými aktivitami, tyto strategie se obvykle soustředí kolem protokolů automatizovaných tvůrců trhu (AMM) a liquidity poolů.\n\nStručně řečeno, AMM jsou nadstavbové decentralizované burzy (DEX), které poskytují životaschopné řešení problémů s likviditou DEX. Za tímto účelem protokoly umožňují uživatelům vytvářet pooly likvidity pro konkrétní obchodní páry (např. USDC/RAY).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*UFmHAufAfG2ty5AiJ_wMbA.png)\n\nDo těchto poolů přispívají poskytovatelé likvidity (LP) oběma tokeny daného páru v poměru 50/50 na základě aktuálního směnného kurzu mezi oběmi mincemi (např. 1 ETH a 1700 USDT). Výměnou za poskytování likvidity dostávají LP(liquidity providers) poplatky za obchodování poolu úměrné jejich podílu.\n\nA co je nejdůležitější, poté, co vloží kryptoměny do poolu, obdrží poskytovatelé likvidity tokeny LP. Tokeny LP, automaticky generované platformou, představují podíl uživatele v poolu (např. pokud vlastníte 10% podíl v poolu USDT/ETH, obdržíte 10% tokenů LP USDT/ETH). Aby si poskytovatelé likvidity mohli digitální aktiva vložená do poolu vybrat, mohou své tokeny LP kdykoli vyplatit.\n\n> *Díky tokenům LP nemusí AMM držet kryptoměny, které poskytovatelé likvidity dodali do poolů, což jim umožňuje fungovat na neúvěrovém, decentralizovaném základě.*\n\nProtože tokeny LP nejsou uzamčeny, mohou poskytovatelé likvidity využívat tytéž tokeny vícekrát, přestože je již použili k dodání mincí do poolu. Zjednodušeně řečeno to znamená, že své tokeny LP můžete přesouvat v rámci více protokolů DeFi a stakovat je, používat pro správu, půjčovat je ostatním a půjčovat si finanční prostředky. V podstatě jsou tokeny LP jako akcie a můžete s nimi dělat spoustu věcí a nebude to mít vliv na likviditu, kterou představují.\n\nJak vidíte, otevírá se tím řada příležitostí pro pěstitele výnosů, jak využít své LP tokeny k maximalizaci svých výnosů s DeFi.\n\n## Odměny za yield farming\n\nVětšina protokolů DeFi vypočítává odměny za yield farming ročně.\n\n**Je důležité si uvědomit, že ačkoli jsou sazby DeFi přepočítávány na roční bázi, jedná se výhradně o odhady založené na statistikách a údajích fondu nebo protokolu.**\n\nKromě toho se sazby yield farmingu poměrně často mění (často denně), což znamená, že musíte **pravidelně** sledovat své strategie a příslušné platformy, abyste měli aktuální informace o výkonnosti svých mincí.\n\n> K výpočtu odměn za yield farming protokoly DeFi běžně využívají dvě metriky: Roční procentní sazba nákladů (APR) a roční procentní výnos (APY). Rozdíl mezi nimi spočívá v tom, že APY zohledňuje složené úročení, zatímco APR nikoli. Jednoduše řečeno, složené úročení se týká praxe reinvestování zisků za účelem zvýšení výnosů.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0\\*K5ofVR9_OENJzyF0)\n\nJelikož už by článek byl příliš dlouhý, **APY vs APR** si zaslouží vlastní **článek**, nechť si to zvládneme vysvětlit detailně. Je dobré brát zřetel na to, že v protokolech DeFi se mohou oba pojmy (APY, APR) používat zaměnitelně.\n\nPokud jde o odměny, je důležité zmínit, že (životaschopné) strategie yield farmingu jsou obvykle nejvýnosnější, když je využívá méně lidí. Poté, co stejnou příležitost identifikuje více uživatelů, bude tato taktika pravděpodobně poskytovat nižší výnosy než dříve v důsledku zvýšeného využívání. To je důvod, proč většina uživatelů odmítá sdílet své strategie s ostatními, aby si udrželi svou ziskovost.\n\nJiž dříve jsme se zmínili, že yield farming se obvykle soustředí na AMM, kde mohou uživatelé výměnou za dodání likvidity získat LP tokeny, které mohou použít na jiné činnosti, aby maximalizovali své výnosy.\n\n> *Jedním z důvodů, proč se tato činnost stala tak populární, jsou nativní tokeny protokolů DeFi, které projekty obvykle rozdělují poskytovatelům likvidity jako pobídku.*\n\nAby však LP mohli tyto tokeny získat, musí přispět pár mincemi a také zastakovat své tokeny LP do samostatného poolu. Uzamčení jejich LP tokenů na určitou dobu zaručuje protokolu, že neodebere likviditu z poolu, dokud doba uzamčení neskončí.\n\nYield farmáři využili této příležitosti a “obhospodařují” tokeny DeFi projektů tím, že stakují své tokeny LP. Tímto způsobem mohou získat jak podíl na transakčních poplatcích v poolu, tak odměny v kryptoměnách protokolu DeFi.\n\n## Impermanent loss\n\nZ hlediska rizik spojených s hospodařením s výnosy je důležité hovořit také o nestálých ztrátách(impermanent loss). Téměř výhradně u AMM dochází k impermanentní ztrátě, když poměr cen páru tokenů zažije výraznou změnu poté, co poskytovatel likvidity uloží mince do poolu.\n\nNapříklad zatímco jste do poolu DAI/ETH uložili 2 500 DAI a 1 ETH (v celkové hodnotě 5 000 DAI), abyste dodali likviditu, směnný kurz obou tokenů se po měsíci změnil na 5 000 DAI/ETH.\n\nV takovém případě nastoupí arbitráže, které přidají DAI do poolu a odstraní ETH, aby dosáhly zisku.\n\nVýsledkem je, že při odkupu tokenů LP si vyberete 0,5 ETH a 2 500 DAI. I když mají vaše tokeny stejnou hodnotu (5 000 DAI), mohli jste dosáhnout lepších výnosů, kdybyste si ponechali svůj 1 ETH a 2 500 DAI (které by po měsíci měly hodnotu 7 500 DAI s 50% návratností investic).\n\nKvůli nestálé ztrátě však vaše původně uložené mince generovaly nulový výnos.\n\nTo znamená, že jste během tohoto období stále inkasovali obchodní poplatky z poolu, což může v mnoha případech eliminovat dopady impermanentní ztráty. Je to také skvělý způsob, jak toto riziko zmírnit stakingem LP tokenů, abyste získali odměny za mince DeFi.\n\nTo znamená, že ačkoli musíte počítat s impermanentní ztrátou, nebezpečnou se stává pouze tehdy, když dochází k velkým změnám ceny páru tokenů a vaše výnosy z obchodních poplatků a dalších činností spojených s farmařením výnosů jsou nižší než to, co byste mohli vydělat prostým držením mince.\n\n## Trh: Ethereum vs zbytek\n\nYield farming je možné provozovat na mnoho chainech v kryptoprostoru, od Etherea, po BSC, přes Solanu na Avalanche atd.

Téma je to rozsáhlé a proto si hned ze startu, vysvětlíme mechaniku yield farmingu a jeho rizika. Na **[youtube kanále](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1uzKebERLIyxzJexq0bCA)**\\*\\* \\*\\*se brzy objeví první projekt, který se mi líbí z bezpečnostních a rizikových důvodů běžící na Ethereu.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*U11_fQ2Z7UdOBgQs)\n\n## Jak rizikový je yield farming?\n\nAčkoli yield farming nabízí uživatelům možnost maximalizovat své odměny, tyto strategie obvykle zahrnují **vysoká** rizika. Schválně je toto téma jako první v tomhle článku.\n\nRizikovost strategií yield farmingu však závisí na několika faktorech, jako jsou např:\n\n> *Počet kryptoměn a protokolů DeFi.Samotná aktivitaPoužité kryptoměny (stablecoiny jsou považovány za nejméně rizikové možnosti)Chytré kontrakty platforem DeFiPoplatky za používání protokolůPověst projektůVaše znalosti o DeFi, kryptoměnách a skutečných protokolech a aktivitách, které ve své strategii používáte.*\n\nNa základě výše uvedeného nejbezpečnější strategie yield farmingu zahrnují pouze několik stablecoinů investovaných v průběhu 1–2 aktivit na jednom renomovaném protokolu DeFi, který obsahuje auditované smart kontrakty.\n\nNaopak pokud budete používat mnoho nestálých kryptoměn s menší tržní kapitalizací k vytváření výnosů napříč více relativně novými DeFi protokoly s neauditovanými chytrými kontrakty, budete čelit jednoznačně vyšším rizikům.\n\nZásadní je zmínit rizika spojená s kompozitností DeFi. Jednou z hlavních výhod decentralizovaných finančních aplikací je, že je lze snadno integrovat. Představte si každý protokol jako kostku Lega, která je postavena na ostatních.\n\nTo jim sice umožňuje bezproblémově spolupracovat, ale mnoho protokolů DeFi se při svém fungování do značné míry spoléhá na další decentralizované finanční služby. Z tohoto důvodu, pokud se u jednoho hlavního protokolu vyskytne významný problém, pravděpodobně ovlivní i několik dalších platforem DeFi.\n\n> *V důsledku toho musíte kromě skutečných protokolů zahrnutých do vašich strategií hospodaření s výnosy znát a důvěřovat také všem ostatním platformám DeFi, na které se spoléhají.*\n\n## Co je to yield farming?\n\nZjednodušeně řečeno se pod pojmem yield farming rozumí činnost v oboru kryptoměn decentralizovaných financí, kdy na základě určitých kritérii používáte svoje prostředky k tomu, aby jste získali další.\n\n> *I když to zní skvěle, není to tak snadné, jak se na první pohled může zdát. Naopak, yield farming je jedním z nejsložitějších způsobů, jak vydělávat krypto v decentralizovaném finančním prostoru.*\n\nYield farming, někdy označované jako liquidity mining, zahrnuje přesouvání vašich prostředků napříč několika protokoly DeFi, kde vkládáte, půjčujete ostatním a můžete si i půjčovat stablecoiny proti vašim drženým digitálním aktivům, abyste je reinvestovali a maximalizovali své výnosy.\n\nVětšina strategií yield farmingu (a také těch nejvýnosnějších) je poměrně složitá a zahrnuje zvýšená rizika pro farmáře (více o tom později).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*W61Pdd5_XkPPX0Nd)\n\nPřesto existují i jednoduché strategie yield farmingu, které zahrnují pouze dodávání likvidity do poolu protokolu DeFi, aby se usnadnilo efektivní obchodování na platformě, a zároveň se za to získává kombinace transakčních poplatků a odměn za tokeny.\n\n## Jak funguje yield farming?\n\nNyní, když jsme probrali základy yield farmingu se podiváme na to, jak oblíbená činnost DeFi, která vydělává na kryptoměnách, funguje v praxi.\n\nProtože je naše téma dost složité, podíváme se v této části postupně na nejdůležitější součásti a procesy související s yield farmingem.\n\n## DeFi půjčky a staking\n\nPro začátek je důležité prozkoumat půjčování a staking kryptoměn prostřednictvím protokolů DeFi.\n\nPro rekapitulaci: DeFi označuje soubor finančních produktů a služeb, které uživatelům umožňují půjčovat si finanční prostředky, vydělávat peníze a obchodovat s aktivy decentralizovaným, otevřeným, demokratickým a bezoprávněným způsobem. Jednoduše řečeno, DeFi nabízí uživatelům decentralizované alternativy finančních řešení, které lze nalézt v tradičním finančním odvětví u poskytovatelů, jako jsou banky, makléři a pojišťovny.\n\nJednou z nejdůležitějších součástí decentralizovaných financí jsou smart kontrakty, digitální dohody mezi stranami, které automaticky vynucují a vykonávají předem dohodnutá pravidla.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1356/0\\*s0KfwG8LCz9iq631)\n\nV případě protokolů DeFi umožňují smart kontrakty fungovat neúvěrovým způsobem, což znamená, že služby nedrží vaše finanční prostředky vaším jménem. Namísto ukládání mincí do centralizovaných peněženek, abyste mohli řešení používat, musíte připojit kompatibilní peněženku a poslat peníze do smart kontraktu. Tímto způsobem máte plnou kontrolu nad soukromými klíči své peněženky, aniž by měl poskytovatel služby přístup k vašim prostředkům.\n\n**Nyní** se podívejme na kryptopeněžní půjčky a staking, dvě široce oblíbené aktivity v DeFi, které jsou často zahrnuty do strategií yield farmingu.\n\n> ***Staking*** *je postup, při kterém si na určitou dobu uzamknete své tokeny v peněžence, abyste podpořili konkrétní blockchainovou síť nebo protokol DeFi. U blockchainů založených na konsensuálním mechanismu Proof-of-Stake (PoS) a jeho variantách je od validátorů vyžadováno, aby k validaci bloků a ověřování transakcí stakovali nativní tokeny. Výměnou za zabezpečení sítě získávají zainteresované strany odměny za staking.*\n\nPokud jde o DeFi, mnoho protokolů implementovalo staking jako mechanismus odměňování poskytovatelů likvidity (LP) za přispění tokenů pro obchodní pár (např. USDC/ETH) do poolu. To sice nezahrnuje žádnou validaci bloků, ale podporujete tím ekosystém řešení DeFi (usnadňujete rozšířené výměny tokenů poskytováním likvidity) a získáváte za to odměny. Mnoho výnosových farmářských strategií zahrnuje tento typ stakingu, který generuje pasivní příjem.\n\nNa druhou stranu protokoly DeFi pro půjčování umožňují dlužníkům přístup k dodatečnému kapitálu (obvykle ve stablecoinech) tím, že použijí své kryptoměny jako kolaterál (např. uloží ETH jako kolaterál, aby si mohli **půjčit** DAI nebo USDT). Zároveň mohou věřitelé generovat pasivní příjem tím, že ukládají stablecoiny do poolu a po jejich mincích získávají úroky (a umožňují ostatním uživatelům, aby si je půjčili).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*WoA7RbJvng4dJuUg)\n\nVzhledem k tomu, že půjčování kryptoměn je u protokolů DeFi overcolateralizováno (např. po držbě ETH v hodnotě 100 USD si můžete půjčit pouze 60 USD DAI), jsou prostředky věřitelů chráněny proti neplatícím dlužníkům nebo selhání.\n\nPokud jde o yield farming, mnoho uživatelů využívá půjčovací pooly, aby získali dodatečné výnosy ze svých tokenů, nebo si půjčují stablecoiny proti svým drženým kryptopenězům, aby je reinvestovali prostřednictvím řešení DeFi.\n\n## Automatizovaní tvůrci trhu (AMM), liquidity pools a tokeny LP\n\nZatímco staking a půjčování kryptopeněz jsou v rámci yield farmingu druhotnými aktivitami, tyto strategie se obvykle soustředí kolem protokolů automatizovaných tvůrců trhu (AMM) a liquidity poolů.\n\nStručně řečeno, AMM jsou nadstavbové decentralizované burzy (DEX), které poskytují životaschopné řešení problémů s likviditou DEX. Za tímto účelem protokoly umožňují uživatelům vytvářet pooly likvidity pro konkrétní obchodní páry (např. USDC/RAY).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*UFmHAufAfG2ty5AiJ_wMbA.png)\n\nDo těchto poolů přispívají poskytovatelé likvidity (LP) oběma tokeny daného páru v poměru 50/50 na základě aktuálního směnného kurzu mezi oběmi mincemi (např. 1 ETH a 1700 USDT). Výměnou za poskytování likvidity dostávají LP(liquidity providers) poplatky za obchodování poolu úměrné jejich podílu.\n\nA co je nejdůležitější, poté, co vloží kryptoměny do poolu, obdrží poskytovatelé likvidity tokeny LP. Tokeny LP, automaticky generované platformou, představují podíl uživatele v poolu (např. pokud vlastníte 10% podíl v poolu USDT/ETH, obdržíte 10% tokenů LP USDT/ETH). Aby si poskytovatelé likvidity mohli digitální aktiva vložená do poolu vybrat, mohou své tokeny LP kdykoli vyplatit.\n\n> *Díky tokenům LP nemusí AMM držet kryptoměny, které poskytovatelé likvidity dodali do poolů, což jim umožňuje fungovat na neúvěrovém, decentralizovaném základě.*\n\nProtože tokeny LP nejsou uzamčeny, mohou poskytovatelé likvidity využívat tytéž tokeny vícekrát, přestože je již použili k dodání mincí do poolu. Zjednodušeně řečeno to znamená, že své tokeny LP můžete přesouvat v rámci více protokolů DeFi a stakovat je, používat pro správu, půjčovat je ostatním a půjčovat si finanční prostředky. V podstatě jsou tokeny LP jako akcie a můžete s nimi dělat spoustu věcí a nebude to mít vliv na likviditu, kterou představují.\n\nJak vidíte, otevírá se tím řada příležitostí pro pěstitele výnosů, jak využít své LP tokeny k maximalizaci svých výnosů s DeFi.\n\n## Odměny za yield farming\n\nVětšina protokolů DeFi vypočítává odměny za yield farming ročně.\n\n**Je důležité si uvědomit, že ačkoli jsou sazby DeFi přepočítávány na roční bázi, jedná se výhradně o odhady založené na statistikách a údajích fondu nebo protokolu.**\n\nKromě toho se sazby yield farmingu poměrně často mění (často denně), což znamená, že musíte **pravidelně** sledovat své strategie a příslušné platformy, abyste měli aktuální informace o výkonnosti svých mincí.\n\n> K výpočtu odměn za yield farming protokoly DeFi běžně využívají dvě metriky: Roční procentní sazba nákladů (APR) a roční procentní výnos (APY). Rozdíl mezi nimi spočívá v tom, že APY zohledňuje složené úročení, zatímco APR nikoli. Jednoduše řečeno, složené úročení se týká praxe reinvestování zisků za účelem zvýšení výnosů.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0\\*K5ofVR9_OENJzyF0)\n\nJelikož už by článek byl příliš dlouhý, **APY vs APR** si zaslouží vlastní **článek**, nechť si to zvládneme vysvětlit detailně. Je dobré brát zřetel na to, že v protokolech DeFi se mohou oba pojmy (APY, APR) používat zaměnitelně.\n\nPokud jde o odměny, je důležité zmínit, že (životaschopné) strategie yield farmingu jsou obvykle nejvýnosnější, když je využívá méně lidí. Poté, co stejnou příležitost identifikuje více uživatelů, bude tato taktika pravděpodobně poskytovat nižší výnosy než dříve v důsledku zvýšeného využívání. To je důvod, proč většina uživatelů odmítá sdílet své strategie s ostatními, aby si udrželi svou ziskovost.\n\nJiž dříve jsme se zmínili, že yield farming se obvykle soustředí na AMM, kde mohou uživatelé výměnou za dodání likvidity získat LP tokeny, které mohou použít na jiné činnosti, aby maximalizovali své výnosy.\n\n> *Jedním z důvodů, proč se tato činnost stala tak populární, jsou nativní tokeny protokolů DeFi, které projekty obvykle rozdělují poskytovatelům likvidity jako pobídku.*\n\nAby však LP mohli tyto tokeny získat, musí přispět pár mincemi a také zastakovat své tokeny LP do samostatného poolu. Uzamčení jejich LP tokenů na určitou dobu zaručuje protokolu, že neodebere likviditu z poolu, dokud doba uzamčení neskončí.\n\nYield farmáři využili této příležitosti a “obhospodařují” tokeny DeFi projektů tím, že stakují své tokeny LP. Tímto způsobem mohou získat jak podíl na transakčních poplatcích v poolu, tak odměny v kryptoměnách protokolu DeFi.\n\n## Impermanent loss\n\nZ hlediska rizik spojených s hospodařením s výnosy je důležité hovořit také o nestálých ztrátách(impermanent loss). Téměř výhradně u AMM dochází k impermanentní ztrátě, když poměr cen páru tokenů zažije výraznou změnu poté, co poskytovatel likvidity uloží mince do poolu.\n\nNapříklad zatímco jste do poolu DAI/ETH uložili 2 500 DAI a 1 ETH (v celkové hodnotě 5 000 DAI), abyste dodali likviditu, směnný kurz obou tokenů se po měsíci změnil na 5 000 DAI/ETH.\n\nV takovém případě nastoupí arbitráže, které přidají DAI do poolu a odstraní ETH, aby dosáhly zisku.\n\nVýsledkem je, že při odkupu tokenů LP si vyberete 0,5 ETH a 2 500 DAI. I když mají vaše tokeny stejnou hodnotu (5 000 DAI), mohli jste dosáhnout lepších výnosů, kdybyste si ponechali svůj 1 ETH a 2 500 DAI (které by po měsíci měly hodnotu 7 500 DAI s 50% návratností investic).\n\nKvůli nestálé ztrátě však vaše původně uložené mince generovaly nulový výnos.\n\nTo znamená, že jste během tohoto období stále inkasovali obchodní poplatky z poolu, což může v mnoha případech eliminovat dopady impermanentní ztráty. Je to také skvělý způsob, jak toto riziko zmírnit stakingem LP tokenů, abyste získali odměny za mince DeFi.\n\nTo znamená, že ačkoli musíte počítat s impermanentní ztrátou, nebezpečnou se stává pouze tehdy, když dochází k velkým změnám ceny páru tokenů a vaše výnosy z obchodních poplatků a dalších činností spojených s farmařením výnosů jsou nižší než to, co byste mohli vydělat prostým držením mince.\n\n## Trh: Ethereum vs zbytek\n\nYield farming je možné provozovat na mnoho chainech v kryptoprostoru, od Etherea, po BSC, přes Solanu na Avalanche atd.

{"id": "knlu5qgaC6YbV9s4D-eafaXK-WHUwudJX5FThYp3OnE", "title": "Astar Network[DOT] and its dApp staking — unique solution for developers?", "body": "You have probably heard about **Astar Network** (previously Plasm) since they are one of the very pioneers in the Polkadot ecosystem. After two years of focus on bringing Ethereum Layer 2 technology to the Polkadot, the team’s ambitions have grown. Layer 2 is now just one piece in their whole innovative and creative plan. At the present time, **dApp staking** is finally running live on [Shiden](https://portal.astar.network/#/store/discover-dapps) mainnet with Astar joining the first batch of Polkadot auctions. So let’s have a look at how it works and how can SDN holders and developers utilize **dApp staking** to gain passive income from the network.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*vowiiO8V_JiILH8x.png)\n\n## What is Astar Network?\n\nAstar Network is a multichain decentralized application hub on Polkadot, supporting EVM, WebAssembly and various layer 2 scaling solutions. Astar will serve as a bridge between the “old” EVM/Solidity world and “new” WASM/Rust world that brings faster and more secure smart contracts. So let’s talk about the two most important features — **X-VM** (Cross Virtual Machine) and **dApp Staking**.\n\n## X-VM (Cross Virtual Machine)\n\nWe believe that WebAssembly is the future of smart contracts (and dr. Gavin Wood [believes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/polkadot-gavin-wood-webassembly-future-180000200.html) this as well :-) but we also have to support the EVM until we arrive there. Many of the already existing or upcoming projects are created in Solidity because of its ease of use for the development. However, many new applications in the Polkadot ecosystem will use [Ink!](https://medium.com/block-journal/introducing-substrate-smart-contracts-with-ink-d486289e2b59) because Polkadot supports WebAssembly by definition. Under these circumstances, a platform that supports both Ethereum Virtual Machine and WebAssembly can be a true game changer.\n\nAnd this is where the Astar Network comes in! Not only it does support both virtual machines but it also makes them interoperable, which is one of Polkadot’s goals in general. In the future, smart contracts written in Solidity on EVM can communicate seamlessly with smart contracts written in ink! on WebAssembly and vice versa.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*wf7Y2pyErtTy-OR2.png)\n\n## To the core: dApp staking\n\nDApp staking is the most innovative feature that is currently offered solely by Astar Network (Shiden on Kusama) in the entire ecosystem. We believe this will be a huge differentiator for developers looking to build dApps on Polkadot because all smart contract developers on the Astar Network can now get passive income for building their dApps.\n\nSmart contract platforms are mostly about network effects, but in general there are very few financial incentives for early developers to deploy their applications on another blockchain. I mean, why would if they barely get paid on the platform they are building on? Bringing a completely different paradigm is Astar’s main mission and it will change the rules, forever.\n\nAstar natively supports financial incentives for developers to create dApps (basic income for all developers aka **dApp staking**). In short, developers can earn [ASTR](https://docs.astar.network/learn/token-economics/token-allocation) tokens while creating products based on their performance and the decentralized voting system.\n\nSmart contract development is a costly endeavor — you have to pay the salaries, operations and even gas fees on the underlying platform. Developers are the most significant contributors to the ecosystem. However, creating a dApp is a risky business and developers have to pay all the costs unless they want to get involved with the big VC funds (which has its disadvantages as well).\n\nDevelopers in the Astar and Shiden networks will be met with a completely different approach. For example, if Shiden token supply is worth $500 million, $50 million will be given out annually to the dApp operators. And another $20 million a year will be distributed to all developers in the ecosystem based on their contributions. The reason developers choose Astar and Shiden is simple. They can earn tokens and develop their products at the same time! Blockchain and cryptography are all about incentives. We think **dApp staking** is a simple but powerful incentive. How would you otherwise make blockchains interoperable? Motivation is the answer.\n\n## How exactly dApp staking works?\n\nTo make it easier to understand dApp staking, let’s use a small illustration\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1034/0\\*YcuIZACEBVh7kaF_.jpeg)\n\nEach smart contract on Astar/Shiden can assign an administrator known as an operator. Instead of the traditional staking to validators, users can choose to nominate their SDN tokens to these operators. These users are also known as nominators.\n\nBy every block, half of the block rewards are used for staking dApps. This reward is further divided 4:1 between operators and nominators, i.e., 50% of the block reward goes to validators, 40% to operators, and 10% to nominators.\n\nOn other blockchains like Ethereum, developers have to use completely different methods to gain money in order to start building. There are certain grant programs, token issuance, fundraising, etc. to make money, but Astar tries to decentralize this and by having some nominations on your dApp, you can start making money from the day 1. As your dApp’s popularity grows, more community members will nominate you, and that means you’ll get a larger percentage of the block reward!\n\nWe’ve got to think of the operators too! The 10% reward is quite substantial and can serve as an alternative to validator staking or loans on other DeFi platforms. Let’s make some math together to truly understand the mechanics.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1380/0\\*11E_PNFX2KGmqvcg.jpeg)\n\n## Example\n\nIn this example we are using an SDN token, but the same logic can be used for ASTA tokens as well.\n\nSuppose SDN is worth $10. With a total supply of 70 million SDNs, this gives Shiden a market capitalization of 700 million.\n\nWe have 10% inflation per year so this means that after 1 year of blockchain operation (assuming the price doesn’t change) we would have created $70 million worth of SDN tokens.\n\nThe block rewards are split between validators, dApps and nominators in a 5:4:1 ratio, corresponding to 35 million, 28 million and 8 million respectively.\n\nIf you manage to maintain an average of 1% of all nominations, you will receive $280k at the end of 1 year. 280K should be more than enough to cover basic expenses of any project. It is a unique and elegant version of basic income in the crypto space for operators and developers.\n\nBut there’s something even better… what if you could sell your operator position? You can! Imagine being an operator on a dApp that holds an average of 10% of all nominations, that’s $280k in recurring revenue per year (at SDN = $10)! Just like in a traditional business, you can sell this operator position if you prefer to pay upfront as opposed to being distributed over time, i.e. leaving the company.\n\nGuessing what is the fair value of SDN is definitely not up to us, because our focus goes elsewhere, but the main principle is hopefully explained. Why we believe in the potential of dApps staking is quite clear. By supporting dApp developers natively on the Polkadot we will create a snowball effect of more and more developers coming to create more awesome dApps for the whole community.\n\n## DApp staking is live on Shiden mainnet!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1120/0\\*mHHVb2RWUzlvK9X1.png)\n\nIn the section [“store”](https://portal.astar.network/#/store/discover-dapps) we can already see dApps being available!\n\nDApp staking can be a valuable difference in a comparison to the rest of the smart contract platforms. It goes hand in hand with token circulation, developer revenue and opening interoperability doors to the crypto world and beyond. Simply said, network effect of this idea is just enormous, it only depends how many developers are going to use this feature and that’s what we are looking forward to finding out.\n\nWe can already see that plenty of tokens are staked and many developers supported on the platform [Astar.network](https://portal.astar.network/#/store/discover-dapps).\n\n## Few words to finalize with Astar roadmap\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*A76kw8s4Q1AhfWTx.png)\n\nAfter all, we are not alone in cryptospace and there will always be a plenty of competing blockchain platforms. I can’t personally imagine a space where there are thousands of cryptocurrencies that can’t work together.

Na první konferenci to byl docela nářez, to musím uznat. Je možné, že jsi ode mě četl i **[článek](https://medium.com/gweicz/d%C5%AFraz-na-decentralizaci-20721e936b04)**, kde se snažím dbát na důležitost decentralizace v krypto světě, i mimo něj.\n\n## ETHBrno\n\nRád bych se k něčemu doznal. Mé počátky v kryptu nesahají nějak extra daleko, je to defakto rok a půl, co jsem pořádně zabřednul do krypta. Mám v plánu v tom pokračovat, to je jasný. Co se týče ETHBrno, je to moje první konference o kryptoměnách, na které jsem kdy byl a první konference, kterou jsem pořádal. Ve finále musím uznat, že je to pro mě obrovská čest. Mnohdy jsem se na internetu setkával s pohnutkami na ethereovou komunitu, neustálé narážky, či toxické btc maxíky a upřímně jsem nevěděl, kde pravda leží. Ovšem když jsem z mnoha úhlů mohl vidět, jaká je atmosféra na ethbrno, nestačil jsem se divit, jak skvělá komunita lidí existuje okolo Etherea a vším s tímto projektem spojeným.\n\nVe finále jsem zjistil, že nejde ani tak o to, jestli je to okolo Etherea nebo jinýho krypto projektu. Došlo mi, že pouze stačí respektovat cizí pohled na věc a to je vše, opravdu vše co je potřeba udělat. Vést debaty, argumentovat, nebo sdílet svůj názor je cílem komunikace mezi lidmi a jsem příjemně potěšen, že tohle přesně na konferenci probíhalo. Velké poděkování patří všem, kteří na konferenci dorazili a těším se na další setkání a ročníky.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*hhcGtQu01O7zXRKM8F7vbA.jpeg)\n\nCo tady ten obrázek dělá?

Chybí mi totiž na českém youtube víc obsahu o defi, daos, nfts apod. Píšu různé články, jak v angličtině tak v češtině pro různorodé projekty v krypto světě. V případě zájmu se neváhej ozvat! Rád prozkoumávám nové projekty a zkouším nové věci, proto když se dozvíš o něčem zajímavým, pokud mě to zaujme také, rád o tom udělám nějakej obsah nebo navážu spolupráci.\n\nKam směřuje můj youtube kanál, nebo tenhle medium blog, si netroufám odhadnout, vím ale, že moje hodnoty zůstávají stejné.

Téma je to rozsáhlé a proto si hned ze startu, vysvětlíme mechaniku yield farmingu a jeho rizika. Na **[youtube kanále](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1uzKebERLIyxzJexq0bCA)**\\*\\* \\*\\*se brzy objeví první projekt, který se mi líbí z bezpečnostních a rizikových důvodů běžící na Ethereu.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*U11_fQ2Z7UdOBgQs)\n\n## Jak rizikový je yield farming?\n\nAčkoli yield farming nabízí uživatelům možnost maximalizovat své odměny, tyto strategie obvykle zahrnují **vysoká** rizika. Schválně je toto téma jako první v tomhle článku.\n\nRizikovost strategií yield farmingu však závisí na několika faktorech, jako jsou např:\n\n> *Počet kryptoměn a protokolů DeFi.Samotná aktivitaPoužité kryptoměny (stablecoiny jsou považovány za nejméně rizikové možnosti)Chytré kontrakty platforem DeFiPoplatky za používání protokolůPověst projektůVaše znalosti o DeFi, kryptoměnách a skutečných protokolech a aktivitách, které ve své strategii používáte.*\n\nNa základě výše uvedeného nejbezpečnější strategie yield farmingu zahrnují pouze několik stablecoinů investovaných v průběhu 1–2 aktivit na jednom renomovaném protokolu DeFi, který obsahuje auditované smart kontrakty.\n\nNaopak pokud budete používat mnoho nestálých kryptoměn s menší tržní kapitalizací k vytváření výnosů napříč více relativně novými DeFi protokoly s neauditovanými chytrými kontrakty, budete čelit jednoznačně vyšším rizikům.\n\nZásadní je zmínit rizika spojená s kompozitností DeFi. Jednou z hlavních výhod decentralizovaných finančních aplikací je, že je lze snadno integrovat. Představte si každý protokol jako kostku Lega, která je postavena na ostatních.\n\nTo jim sice umožňuje bezproblémově spolupracovat, ale mnoho protokolů DeFi se při svém fungování do značné míry spoléhá na další decentralizované finanční služby. Z tohoto důvodu, pokud se u jednoho hlavního protokolu vyskytne významný problém, pravděpodobně ovlivní i několik dalších platforem DeFi.\n\n> *V důsledku toho musíte kromě skutečných protokolů zahrnutých do vašich strategií hospodaření s výnosy znát a důvěřovat také všem ostatním platformám DeFi, na které se spoléhají.*\n\n## Co je to yield farming?\n\nZjednodušeně řečeno se pod pojmem yield farming rozumí činnost v oboru kryptoměn decentralizovaných financí, kdy na základě určitých kritérii používáte svoje prostředky k tomu, aby jste získali další.\n\n> *I když to zní skvěle, není to tak snadné, jak se na první pohled může zdát. Naopak, yield farming je jedním z nejsložitějších způsobů, jak vydělávat krypto v decentralizovaném finančním prostoru.*\n\nYield farming, někdy označované jako liquidity mining, zahrnuje přesouvání vašich prostředků napříč několika protokoly DeFi, kde vkládáte, půjčujete ostatním a můžete si i půjčovat stablecoiny proti vašim drženým digitálním aktivům, abyste je reinvestovali a maximalizovali své výnosy.\n\nVětšina strategií yield farmingu (a také těch nejvýnosnějších) je poměrně složitá a zahrnuje zvýšená rizika pro farmáře (více o tom později).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*W61Pdd5_XkPPX0Nd)\n\nPřesto existují i jednoduché strategie yield farmingu, které zahrnují pouze dodávání likvidity do poolu protokolu DeFi, aby se usnadnilo efektivní obchodování na platformě, a zároveň se za to získává kombinace transakčních poplatků a odměn za tokeny.\n\n## Jak funguje yield farming?\n\nNyní, když jsme probrali základy yield farmingu se podiváme na to, jak oblíbená činnost DeFi, která vydělává na kryptoměnách, funguje v praxi.\n\nProtože je naše téma dost složité, podíváme se v této části postupně na nejdůležitější součásti a procesy související s yield farmingem.\n\n## DeFi půjčky a staking\n\nPro začátek je důležité prozkoumat půjčování a staking kryptoměn prostřednictvím protokolů DeFi.\n\nPro rekapitulaci: DeFi označuje soubor finančních produktů a služeb, které uživatelům umožňují půjčovat si finanční prostředky, vydělávat peníze a obchodovat s aktivy decentralizovaným, otevřeným, demokratickým a bezoprávněným způsobem. Jednoduše řečeno, DeFi nabízí uživatelům decentralizované alternativy finančních řešení, které lze nalézt v tradičním finančním odvětví u poskytovatelů, jako jsou banky, makléři a pojišťovny.\n\nJednou z nejdůležitějších součástí decentralizovaných financí jsou smart kontrakty, digitální dohody mezi stranami, které automaticky vynucují a vykonávají předem dohodnutá pravidla.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1356/0\\*s0KfwG8LCz9iq631)\n\nV případě protokolů DeFi umožňují smart kontrakty fungovat neúvěrovým způsobem, což znamená, že služby nedrží vaše finanční prostředky vaším jménem. Namísto ukládání mincí do centralizovaných peněženek, abyste mohli řešení používat, musíte připojit kompatibilní peněženku a poslat peníze do smart kontraktu. Tímto způsobem máte plnou kontrolu nad soukromými klíči své peněženky, aniž by měl poskytovatel služby přístup k vašim prostředkům.\n\n**Nyní** se podívejme na kryptopeněžní půjčky a staking, dvě široce oblíbené aktivity v DeFi, které jsou často zahrnuty do strategií yield farmingu.\n\n> ***Staking*** *je postup, při kterém si na určitou dobu uzamknete své tokeny v peněžence, abyste podpořili konkrétní blockchainovou síť nebo protokol DeFi. U blockchainů založených na konsensuálním mechanismu Proof-of-Stake (PoS) a jeho variantách je od validátorů vyžadováno, aby k validaci bloků a ověřování transakcí stakovali nativní tokeny. Výměnou za zabezpečení sítě získávají zainteresované strany odměny za staking.*\n\nPokud jde o DeFi, mnoho protokolů implementovalo staking jako mechanismus odměňování poskytovatelů likvidity (LP) za přispění tokenů pro obchodní pár (např. USDC/ETH) do poolu. To sice nezahrnuje žádnou validaci bloků, ale podporujete tím ekosystém řešení DeFi (usnadňujete rozšířené výměny tokenů poskytováním likvidity) a získáváte za to odměny. Mnoho výnosových farmářských strategií zahrnuje tento typ stakingu, který generuje pasivní příjem.\n\nNa druhou stranu protokoly DeFi pro půjčování umožňují dlužníkům přístup k dodatečnému kapitálu (obvykle ve stablecoinech) tím, že použijí své kryptoměny jako kolaterál (např. uloží ETH jako kolaterál, aby si mohli **půjčit** DAI nebo USDT). Zároveň mohou věřitelé generovat pasivní příjem tím, že ukládají stablecoiny do poolu a po jejich mincích získávají úroky (a umožňují ostatním uživatelům, aby si je půjčili).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*WoA7RbJvng4dJuUg)\n\nVzhledem k tomu, že půjčování kryptoměn je u protokolů DeFi overcolateralizováno (např. po držbě ETH v hodnotě 100 USD si můžete půjčit pouze 60 USD DAI), jsou prostředky věřitelů chráněny proti neplatícím dlužníkům nebo selhání.\n\nPokud jde o yield farming, mnoho uživatelů využívá půjčovací pooly, aby získali dodatečné výnosy ze svých tokenů, nebo si půjčují stablecoiny proti svým drženým kryptopenězům, aby je reinvestovali prostřednictvím řešení DeFi.\n\n## Automatizovaní tvůrci trhu (AMM), liquidity pools a tokeny LP\n\nZatímco staking a půjčování kryptopeněz jsou v rámci yield farmingu druhotnými aktivitami, tyto strategie se obvykle soustředí kolem protokolů automatizovaných tvůrců trhu (AMM) a liquidity poolů.\n\nStručně řečeno, AMM jsou nadstavbové decentralizované burzy (DEX), které poskytují životaschopné řešení problémů s likviditou DEX. Za tímto účelem protokoly umožňují uživatelům vytvářet pooly likvidity pro konkrétní obchodní páry (např. USDC/RAY).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*UFmHAufAfG2ty5AiJ_wMbA.png)\n\nDo těchto poolů přispívají poskytovatelé likvidity (LP) oběma tokeny daného páru v poměru 50/50 na základě aktuálního směnného kurzu mezi oběmi mincemi (např. 1 ETH a 1700 USDT). Výměnou za poskytování likvidity dostávají LP(liquidity providers) poplatky za obchodování poolu úměrné jejich podílu.\n\nA co je nejdůležitější, poté, co vloží kryptoměny do poolu, obdrží poskytovatelé likvidity tokeny LP. Tokeny LP, automaticky generované platformou, představují podíl uživatele v poolu (např. pokud vlastníte 10% podíl v poolu USDT/ETH, obdržíte 10% tokenů LP USDT/ETH). Aby si poskytovatelé likvidity mohli digitální aktiva vložená do poolu vybrat, mohou své tokeny LP kdykoli vyplatit.\n\n> *Díky tokenům LP nemusí AMM držet kryptoměny, které poskytovatelé likvidity dodali do poolů, což jim umožňuje fungovat na neúvěrovém, decentralizovaném základě.*\n\nProtože tokeny LP nejsou uzamčeny, mohou poskytovatelé likvidity využívat tytéž tokeny vícekrát, přestože je již použili k dodání mincí do poolu. Zjednodušeně řečeno to znamená, že své tokeny LP můžete přesouvat v rámci více protokolů DeFi a stakovat je, používat pro správu, půjčovat je ostatním a půjčovat si finanční prostředky. V podstatě jsou tokeny LP jako akcie a můžete s nimi dělat spoustu věcí a nebude to mít vliv na likviditu, kterou představují.\n\nJak vidíte, otevírá se tím řada příležitostí pro pěstitele výnosů, jak využít své LP tokeny k maximalizaci svých výnosů s DeFi.\n\n## Odměny za yield farming\n\nVětšina protokolů DeFi vypočítává odměny za yield farming ročně.\n\n**Je důležité si uvědomit, že ačkoli jsou sazby DeFi přepočítávány na roční bázi, jedná se výhradně o odhady založené na statistikách a údajích fondu nebo protokolu.**\n\nKromě toho se sazby yield farmingu poměrně často mění (často denně), což znamená, že musíte **pravidelně** sledovat své strategie a příslušné platformy, abyste měli aktuální informace o výkonnosti svých mincí.\n\n> K výpočtu odměn za yield farming protokoly DeFi běžně využívají dvě metriky: Roční procentní sazba nákladů (APR) a roční procentní výnos (APY). Rozdíl mezi nimi spočívá v tom, že APY zohledňuje složené úročení, zatímco APR nikoli. Jednoduše řečeno, složené úročení se týká praxe reinvestování zisků za účelem zvýšení výnosů.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0\\*K5ofVR9_OENJzyF0)\n\nJelikož už by článek byl příliš dlouhý, **APY vs APR** si zaslouží vlastní **článek**, nechť si to zvládneme vysvětlit detailně. Je dobré brát zřetel na to, že v protokolech DeFi se mohou oba pojmy (APY, APR) používat zaměnitelně.\n\nPokud jde o odměny, je důležité zmínit, že (životaschopné) strategie yield farmingu jsou obvykle nejvýnosnější, když je využívá méně lidí. Poté, co stejnou příležitost identifikuje více uživatelů, bude tato taktika pravděpodobně poskytovat nižší výnosy než dříve v důsledku zvýšeného využívání. To je důvod, proč většina uživatelů odmítá sdílet své strategie s ostatními, aby si udrželi svou ziskovost.\n\nJiž dříve jsme se zmínili, že yield farming se obvykle soustředí na AMM, kde mohou uživatelé výměnou za dodání likvidity získat LP tokeny, které mohou použít na jiné činnosti, aby maximalizovali své výnosy.\n\n> *Jedním z důvodů, proč se tato činnost stala tak populární, jsou nativní tokeny protokolů DeFi, které projekty obvykle rozdělují poskytovatelům likvidity jako pobídku.*\n\nAby však LP mohli tyto tokeny získat, musí přispět pár mincemi a také zastakovat své tokeny LP do samostatného poolu. Uzamčení jejich LP tokenů na určitou dobu zaručuje protokolu, že neodebere likviditu z poolu, dokud doba uzamčení neskončí.\n\nYield farmáři využili této příležitosti a “obhospodařují” tokeny DeFi projektů tím, že stakují své tokeny LP. Tímto způsobem mohou získat jak podíl na transakčních poplatcích v poolu, tak odměny v kryptoměnách protokolu DeFi.\n\n## Impermanent loss\n\nZ hlediska rizik spojených s hospodařením s výnosy je důležité hovořit také o nestálých ztrátách(impermanent loss). Téměř výhradně u AMM dochází k impermanentní ztrátě, když poměr cen páru tokenů zažije výraznou změnu poté, co poskytovatel likvidity uloží mince do poolu.\n\nNapříklad zatímco jste do poolu DAI/ETH uložili 2 500 DAI a 1 ETH (v celkové hodnotě 5 000 DAI), abyste dodali likviditu, směnný kurz obou tokenů se po měsíci změnil na 5 000 DAI/ETH.\n\nV takovém případě nastoupí arbitráže, které přidají DAI do poolu a odstraní ETH, aby dosáhly zisku.\n\nVýsledkem je, že při odkupu tokenů LP si vyberete 0,5 ETH a 2 500 DAI. I když mají vaše tokeny stejnou hodnotu (5 000 DAI), mohli jste dosáhnout lepších výnosů, kdybyste si ponechali svůj 1 ETH a 2 500 DAI (které by po měsíci měly hodnotu 7 500 DAI s 50% návratností investic).\n\nKvůli nestálé ztrátě však vaše původně uložené mince generovaly nulový výnos.\n\nTo znamená, že jste během tohoto období stále inkasovali obchodní poplatky z poolu, což může v mnoha případech eliminovat dopady impermanentní ztráty. Je to také skvělý způsob, jak toto riziko zmírnit stakingem LP tokenů, abyste získali odměny za mince DeFi.\n\nTo znamená, že ačkoli musíte počítat s impermanentní ztrátou, nebezpečnou se stává pouze tehdy, když dochází k velkým změnám ceny páru tokenů a vaše výnosy z obchodních poplatků a dalších činností spojených s farmařením výnosů jsou nižší než to, co byste mohli vydělat prostým držením mince.\n\n## Trh: Ethereum vs zbytek\n\nYield farming je možné provozovat na mnoho chainech v kryptoprostoru, od Etherea, po BSC, přes Solanu na Avalanche atd. Ale poskytují tyhle alternativy opravdu tu míru zabezpečení kterou žádáme? Souvisí to dost s preferencemi jedince a proto si na tuhle otázku musí každý odpovědět sám.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*EBa93HOBMYkDyTlw)\n\nNyní už víte, co je yield farming, jak funguje a jaká jsou jeho rizika. Který blockchain pro provozování defi si vyberete, je už na vás.\n\nJá zde, na tomhle medium blogu a svým **[youtube kanále](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1uzKebERLIyxzJexq0bCA)** budu postupně vydávat možnosti DeFi a yield farmingu, které používám \\*\\*já. \\*\\*Pokud o to máte zájem, dejte mi nějakou zpětnou vazbu. Odběr, clap tady na mediu, nebo DM.\n\n## Yield farming: shrnutí\n\nSe spuštěním AMM a nativních tokenů projektů DeFi se yield farming stal jednou z nejoblíbenějších aktivit v odvětví decentralizovaných financí.\n\nA to z vynikajícího důvodu.\n\nVyužitím komplexních strategií napříč několika DeFi protokoly mohou farmáři zvýšit své výnosy a generovat tak (potenciálně) skvělý pasivní příjem.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*AbTE6EJ5tx3gEtyj)\n\nPokud však chcete zvýšit své zisky, znamená to také, že musíte více riskovat. A na základě několika faktorů patří yield farming mezi nejrizikovější strategie, jak vydělávat na kryptoměnách v prostoru DeFi právě teď.\n\nZ tohoto důvodu je zásadní, abyste si sami prověřili protokoly zapojené do vaší strategie a investovali jen tolik, kolik si můžete dovolit ztratit, abyste zajistili bezpečnost svých prostředků.", "timestamp": 1635334180, "digest": "gA5CBHSoSTeObuOb2u8o73cQV3yyJtfE2Z9DtglevRY", "contributor": "0x7E4aAB4C7b58104a9eAcEdd7C7EC6b297c844BBB"}

Ron Wyden, the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, which may be unveiled as soon as Wednesday. The plan is meant to impose taxes on tradable assets like stocks held by about 700 billionaires to fund an expansion of healthcare, childcare, and renew President Joe Biden's beefed-up child tax credit.\n\nWyden fired back at Musk on Tuesday evening. \"The people who are clearly trying to be tricky are people who are trying to find a way to not pay taxes,\" he told reporters.\n\nDemocrats say they are moving to tilt the economic scales of wealth away from the richest people and toward the middle class after years of growing inequality. Billionaires often pay lower tax rates compared with everyone else because they build up their wealth from the increasing value of their stock shares. Those aren't subject to capital-gains taxes until they are sold.\n\nA new analysis conducted by the economist Gabriel Zucman for [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/10/26/billioniare-tax-dems-biden/) indicated that Musk could face up to $50 billion in taxes in the first five-year stretch of the tax's implementation.\n\nMusk's wealth soared on Monday.

The climate measures in particular need to be settled before Biden heads to Scotland for the UN climate summit this weekend, so other nations will see our commitment to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden met with key Democrats to work out spending and tax provisions. Yet every senate Republican and at least two senate Democrats continue to assert that Biden’s agenda is too costly.\n\nToo costly? Really? Compare the Biden’s social and climate package’s current *compromise* tab of $2tn (spread out over the next 10 years) with:\n\n## The $1.9 trillion Trump Republican tax cut that went mostly to the wealthy and large corporations.\n\nAmericans were promised that its benefits would “trickle down” to average workers. They didn’t. Corporations used them to finance more stock buybacks. The wealthy used them to buy more shares of stock (and shares of private-equity and hedge funds).\n\nThe Trump Republican tax cut should be repealed to pay for Biden’s social and climate package. There is no good reason to retain it. But no senate Republican will vote for its repeal, nor will Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema – making it a political non-starter in a chamber where Democrats have just half the votes.\n\n## The $2.1 trillion that America’s 750 billionaires have raked in just since the start of the pandemic.\n\nYou might think that at least a portion of this windfall should help pay for Biden’s agenda since much of it has been the result of monopoly power (for example, Amazon’s dominance over e-commerce during the pandemic).\n\nOregon Senator Ron Wyden, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, is proposing a “Billionaires Income Tax,” to be paid by the roughly 750 Americans with $1bn in assets or $100m in income for three consecutive years. It would be a yearly tax on the increasing value of their assets – such as stocks and bonds – regardless of when they sell. They could still write off losses every year. Interestingly, neither Sinema nor West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, the other holdout, has voiced opposition to Wyden’s proposal.\n\n## The nearly $8 trillion we’ll be spending on the military over the next 10 years.\n\nThe United States already spends more on our military than the next 10 biggest military spenders in the world *combined*.\n\nLast week, the Senate Appropriations Committee unveiled a nearly $726bn budget for the Defense Department in 2022. That was about $20bn more than Biden requested. Some $14bn in other funds are set aside for the Pentagon in separate military construction and energy appropriations bills, bringing the total budget to about $740 billion. Over ten years, that comes close to $8tn.\n\nTalk about bloat and waste: That military budget includes 85 F-35 fighters costing a total of $1.5tn*.* The F-35 is so plagued with problems that the current chairman of House Armed Service Committee calls [it](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/23/house-768-billion-defense-bill-514085) a “rathole,” and the Pentagon’s own official who’s [responsible for the acquisition of weapons systems](https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/35-fighter-plan-acquisition-malpractice-pentagon-official/story?id=15530008) says spending more on it is “acquisition malpractice.”\n\nBut you don’t hear about this in the media because Democrats routinely join Republicans to vote for the military budget – it’s truly bipartisan bloat -- and the media tends to report only on controversies.\n\nConsidering these three gigantic pots of money, how is it possible for anyone to argue that America cannot afford to spend what’s needed for childcare, education, paid leave, or to reduce climate change?\n\nThe short answer: it’s not possible. Biden’s plan is easily affordable by the richest nation in the world.\n\n* Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of [Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few](https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Capitalism-Many-Not-Few/dp/0345806220) and [The Common Good](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052552049X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0).

With the world's eyes on the crucial UN climate summit, the Guardian will bring you the facts, negotiations, news and science. For years, climate experts have stressed that Guardian reporting - independent, rigorous, persistent and open to all - is a critical tool to confront the climate crisis, which is intensifying around the world. Leaders, influenced by powerful lobbies, are now set to make decisions that will determine our future.\n\nWe have no shareholders and no billionaire owner. Just the determination and passion to deliver high-impact reporting for the world, always free from commercial and political influence. Reporting like this is vital for democracy, for fairness and to demand better from the powerful. And we provide all this for free, for everyone, regardless of their ability to pay for it.\n\nAs such, tens of millions have placed their trust in us for the last 200 years, turning to us in moments of crisis, uncertainty, solidarity and hope. With more than 1.5 million supporters in 180 countries, our model for open access journalism is better sustained, meaning we can reach more people. This helps everyone keep track of global events like the climate summit, understand their impact on people and communities, and become inspired to take meaningful action.\n\nWe take this emergency seriously as a news organisation: two years ago, we pledged to prioritise the climate crisis, and we've published some 6,000 pieces of environmental journalism since. We set ambitious targets to green our business, and have turned away from fossil fuel investments and advertising as a result. [We are on track to meet our goals,](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/25/the-guardians-climate-pledge?INTCMP=climate_pledge_epic_link) including that of transparency, where we will continue to update you on our progress.\n\nBut to keep working as we do - as an open, fiercely independent news organisation that focuses on the climate - we need your help. Every contribution, however big or small, counts. **Support us today from just $1. If you can, please consider supporting us with a regular amount each month.

Joe Manchin said Tuesday that the controversial IRS bank reporting proposal will not be included in the final draft of President Biden’s massive social spending bill.\n\nManchin’s comments came during an Economic Club of Washington, D.C. event, two days after he met with the president in Delaware.\n\n“I said, ‘Do you understand how messed up that is to think that Uncle Sam’s going to be watching,’” the West Virginian senator [said ](https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/infrastructure-bill)of what he told Biden.\n\n“I told him…this cannot happen, this is screwed up.”\n\nStaffers at the meeting were reportedly looking at each other back and forth, Manchin said, before revealing Biden said, “I think Joe’s right on that.”\n\n“So I think this one’s gonna be gone,” Manchin added.\n\nThe proposal in question, which has largely been criticized by Republicans who say it is an invasion of privacy, would require banks to provide data to the Internal Revenue Service on accounts with gross annual inflows and outflows at $10,000 or more.\n\nOriginally, that threshold was set at $600, prompting massive criticism from lawmakers, states and private banks.\n\nLate last month, [Nebraska state Treasurer John Murante](https://nypost.com/2021/09/30/nebraska-opposes-irs-snooping-in-bidens-3-5t-spending-plan/) said his state is leading the charge in objecting to the proposal that would compel banks to report ​private ​customers’ account​s with at least $600 of transactions to the IRS​.​\n\nSen. Joe Manchin believes the IRS bank reporting proposal will be eliminated from President Joe Biden’s social spending bill.\n\nGetty Images\n\n“My message is really simple. The people of Nebraska entrusted me to protect the privacy of these accounts and I am not going to comply with this. If the Biden administration sues me, we will take it all the way to the Supreme Court. We are going to fight every step of the way,” Murante told [​Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/irs-spending-bill-spying-bank-accounts-taxes-yellen).\n\nLast week, the [threshold was bumped to $10,000.](https://nypost.com/2021/10/20/dems-raise-proposed-irs-bank-reporting-threshold-from-600-to-10k/) The proposal allows for exemptions from the inflow and outflows including income from W2 wages and federal programs like Social Security.\n\n## SEE ALSO\n\n### ‘Don’t touch me’: Kyrsten Sinema badgered again over Biden spending bill\n\nStill, [banks are asking the White House](https://nypost.com/2021/10/26/banks-financial-firms-ask-white-house-to-drop-irs-reporting-rule/) to drop the proposal. On Wednesday, nearly 100 banks and financial industry organizations wrote to Biden asking him to ditch the rule, citing a “reasonable right to privacy.”\n\n“…our members, and the American people, believe that they have a reasonable right to privacy and this overly broad proposal to report gross annual inflows and outflows from nearly every account is disconnected from its purported narrow purpose of focusing government scrutiny on Americans with actual income above $400,000,” the letter read.\n\nManchin[ later clarified to a Bloomberg](https://twitter.com/elwasson/status/1453021874154360833) News reporter that he opposes the proposal, no matter what the threshold is. \n\n“No one should be in anyone’s bank account,” Manchin said. \n\nOn Monday, [Biden said his talk with Manchin](https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/biden-hopes-for-spending-deal-by-thursday/) “went well” and there are “a few more things to work out,” but that he wants to reach a deal before he departs for Rome to participate in G20 meetings.\n\nThe meeting comes amid ongoing negotiations between moderate and progressive democrats over the hotly debated budget reconciliation package. For weeks, progressives backed by Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed for a $3.5 trillion package while moderates, including Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) vowed to vote against that price tag. \n\nSen. Joe Manchin discusses the bipartisan infrastructure bill with David Rubenstein, chairman of the Economic Club of Washington, in Washington DC on October 26, 2021.\n\nEPA\n\nManchin has indicated his support for a $1.5 trillion price tag, less than half of the initial proposal. While progressives have still argued for $3.5 trillion, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) calling it a compromise, Pelosi and Biden have conceded that the bill’s final form will most likely not be $3.5 trillion. \n\nDuring Tuesday’s event, Manchin [was also pressed](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/578443-manchin-backs-raising-debt-ceiling-with-reconciliation-if-gop-balks) on raising the debt ceiling, another budgetary crisis Democrats are facing in the coming weeks. \n\nThe West Virginian senator started by noting the debt ceiling could be raised through the 14th Amendment.\n\nNebraska state Treasurer John Murante threatens to take the IRS bank reporting proposal to the Supreme Court.\n\nnebraska.gov\n\n“The debt limit should be the 14th Amendment. The president has the right to make that decision. We have the right to override if we think he went too far. That to me is the simplest,” Manchin said.\n\nHe continued saying that if his party is unable to get Republicans on board, then Republicans must use reconciliation to raise it without GOP support.\n\nDemocrats have been hesitant to use reconciliation for raising the debt ceiling as they are using it to pass the massive social spending bill, however, a second reconciliation bill would not affect the first.\n\nAmid the Democratic back and forth, [a MotherJones report revealed l](https://nypost.com/2021/10/20/manchin-considering-leaving-democratic-party-report/)ast week that Manchin was allegedly considering leaving the Democratic party to leverage his position in negotiations.\n\nShortly after the report emerged, the senator was pressed by reporters on the Hill off camera on its allegations. While initially he did not deny the claims and said he had “no control” over the rumors, Manchin called the report “bulls–t.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Manchin said he is asked about switching parties “every day” and joked that his life “would be much easier” if he switched.\n\n“\\[But is that the purpose of being involved in public service?” He asked. “You think that having a D, or an I, or an R is going to change who I am?”\n\n“I don’t think the R’s would be any more happier with me than the D’s right now…I don’t know where in the hell I belong,” Manchin continued.\n\nFILED UNDER\n\n* [budgets](https://nypost.com/tag/budgets/)\n* [debt ceiling](https://nypost.com/tag/debt-ceiling/)\n* [government spending](https://nypost.com/tag/government-spending/)\n* [irs](https://nypost.com/tag/irs/)\n* [joe biden](https://nypost.com/tag/joe-biden/)\n* [joe manchin](https://nypost.com/tag/joe-manchin/)\n* [10/26/21](https://nypost.com/2021/10/26/)", "timestamp": 1635336874, "digest": "nnsgZcqE7T6iamMDrkF5MilPmyiNUZK4ar55oUjzlx8", "contributor": "0x3017c2993dc4534D7e4297d49c9264B1d4c07bFC"}

In fact, the way Haugen obtained the documents is similar to the way billions of people around the world use Facebook every day. She simply browsed the company’s internal social network and took photos with her phone, according to her legal team.\n\nThe documents help illustrate the role the company played in helping fuel the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, the power wielded by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the ripple effect of the social media network on countries around the world.

Her revelations have created a firestorm. And Facebook is reportedly considering a name change.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW\nWho is Frances Haugen?\nHow did Haugen take the documents?\nWhy would she want to take documents in the first place?\nDid everyone at Facebook have access to these documents?\nWhy did Facebook allow such easy access to its documents?\nWhat about Google?\nShow all questions\nWho is Frances Haugen?\nReturn to menu\nHaugen is a 37-year-old computer science and Harvard Business School graduate who has had a successful career as a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and employee. She co-founded a popular dating app called Hinge, and then worked at some of the best known companies in tech, including Google and Pinterest.\n\nFormer Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen is greeted by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) before testifying at a Senate subcommittee hearing Oct. 5. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\nShe took a job at Facebook in 2019, a couple of years after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, hoping she could help change the company from within, The Post has reported. Earlier this year, she leaked confidential documents to the Wall Street Journal, which published a series of revelatory articles that showed a disparity between the company’s internal research and its public statements on the societal impact of its products. Haugen has filed a whistleblower complaint with the SEC. Should the agency bring a civil enforcement action, Haugen, under the Dodd-Frank Act, could receive between 10 and 30 percent of any fines or judgments Facebook is forced to pay.\n\nTop moments from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen's Senate testimony\n\nHow did Haugen take the documents?\nReturn to menu\nHaugen, working remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic, accessed the documents from the company’s internal social network and took pictures of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat’s right, Facebook employees use a version of Facebook as a work tool. Called Workplace, it is almost identical to the public version of Facebook. The social media organization also sells Workplace as a tool to outside companies. It’s a competitor to Slack, another corporate communication tool.\n\nInternal Facebook posts often contain confidential information. Documents reviewed by The Washington Post show Facebook employees commenting on internal documents the same way everyone else comments on their friends’ baby photos. Rather than download the documents or take screenshots, which would have been more likely to arouse suspicion, she apparently took photos with her phone.\n\nWhy would she want to take documents in the first place?\nReturn to menu\nHaugen, according to her friend Leslie Fine, felt that her work to identify and rectify the social network’s problems wasn’t going anywhere. Rather than just quit, she decided to gather documents and release them publicly, hoping that public pressure would force Facebook to change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said on “60 Minutes” that she wanted to show that Facebook cares about profits more than public safety. One of Facebook’s mottos is that it doesn’t “build services to make money.” Rather, it makes money “to build better services.”\n\nWhistleblower Frances Haugen: Facebook puts ‘profits before people’\n\nDid everyone at Facebook have access to these documents?\nReturn to menu\nAccording to Haugen’s legal team, most, if not all, of the documents Haugen took were available to a large swath of Facebook employees. Haugen worked on the civic integrity team, responsible for misinformation. However, even if she were not on that team, she probably would have had access to the same documents, according to her legal team. According to one former Facebook employee, the company has begun to limit document access.\n\nWhy did Facebook allow such easy access to its documents?\nReturn to menu\nFacebook, from its early days as a raucous Silicon Valley start-up, has had a culture of openness, at least within the boundaries of its sprawling corporate campuses. Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg made a decision to trust his employees with corporate secrets, a two-way pact that allowed employees to offer input in weekly companywide Q & As, but also came with severe penalties for anyone who betrayed that trust, according to former Facebook employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private matters. “The reality is, we have an open culture,” Zuckerberg said on a conference call with analysts Monday.\n\nFacebook's corporate headquarters campus in Menlo Park, Calif. (Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images)\nThis radical transparency isn’t common at every tech company. Most similar to Facebook is Google, based just down the road, which saw many of its executives and employees move to Facebook roughly a decade ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis strategy has a few benefits. It allows input from employees across the organization — not just in their individual groups. It helps people move around the company into different roles, which keeps employees interested in work and allows them to find the roles that best suit them. The transparency also makes employees feel like they’re truly part of the company, not just a meaningless cog in the machine. With the privilege of knowing sensitive information at Facebook came the threat that if any employee was caught leaking, they’d be fired.\n\n“Since earlier this year, we have been talking about the right model of information sharing for the company, balancing openness with sharing relevant information and maintaining focus. This is a work in progress and we are committed to an open culture for the company,\" said Facebook spokeswoman Dani Lever.\n\nWhat about Google?\nReturn to menu\nGoogle has its own internal search engine called Moma. Google employees can enter search criteria into Moma and they’ll see a list of results that look similar to the results of a Google search. But instead of ads for auto insurance and links to Wikipedia, they see the titles of corporate documents, some of which are secret or attorney-client privilege.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUp until a couple of years ago, the company did not prohibit making their Google docs (yes, that’s what all Google employees use) accessible to all employees at the company, according to current and former employees. That meant nearly anyone at Google could, with minimal effort, read about the company’s secretive plans and even offer input, in the form of comments, to employees working on them.\n\nThat openness has faded, say current and former Google employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. While confidential documents still appear in Moma search results, it’s far less likely that they will allow access by all employees at the company. That change came after a wave of employee revolt at the company, following allegations of sexual misconduct at the executive level.\n\nGoogle declined to comment.\n\nAre all tech companies so open with their internal documents?\nReturn to menu\nNo. Take Apple, for example. Most employees there are kept completely in the dark about what’s going on around them. It operates on a model more akin to the way the government handles national secrets, keeping the information hidden from all except those with the proper security clearances. Many Apple employees keep their work secret even from their spouses.\n\nThat harks back to an earlier time, when Apple was surprising customers and software developers with new hardware products like the iPod, iMac and iPhone. The late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was a great showman who would unveil the company’s new products onstage with his cult of personality. Those powerful performances would have been impossible if everyone knew what was coming.\n\nThe late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was a great showman who would unveil the company’s new products onstage with his cult of personality. (Ian Waldie/Getty Images)\nApple employs a powerful “global security” team, staffed by former law enforcement officials, whose job it is to curtail leaks. Apple even threatens its employees with jail time (presumably under criminal statutes that protect trade secrets), should they leak about product updates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe secrecy, though, has an added benefit. It’s less likely that an Apple employee would abscond with a trove of documents as vast as the one Haugen took from Facebook.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWas it legal for Haugen to take these documents and provide them to journalists, lawmakers and regulators?\nReturn to menu\nHaugen’s attorneys say it was. While it’s always possible Facebook will challenge that assertion, there are several federal whistleblower laws that give employees of private companies the ability to reveal information about their employer if it’s in the process of uncovering some wrongdoing, according to legal experts. The best known of those laws is the federal False Claims Act, which was passed to stop government contractors from ripping off taxpayers. Under the law, whistleblowers can file lawsuits on behalf of the government and collect a reward of up to 30 percent of what the government recovers.\n\nRepublican Sens. Cynthia M. Lummis (Wyo.), Rick Scott (Fla.), Dan Sullivan (Alaska) and Ted Cruz (Tex.) at the Oct. 5 hearing. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\nThe SEC whistleblower law was passed as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a response to the 2008 financial crisis. Under the law, whistleblowers could get up to 30 percent of whatever the wrongdoer is forced to pay. The SEC doesn’t disclose the details of its whistleblower cases, but it announces the dollar amounts that whistleblowers receive. In September, an unnamed SEC whistleblower received $110 million for their efforts.\n\n5 of the most famous federal whistleblowers\n\nWhistleblower protections supersede nondisclosure agreements, effectively allowing employees to pass along information companies might consider “confidential,” so long as the information they’re sharing is pertinent to their allegations and is related in a legal way.\n\nWill this cause more whistleblowers at tech companies to come forward?\nReturn to menu\nWe don’t know. Haugen’s legal team says it has received inquiries from other potential whistleblowers, and another filed an anonymous SEC complaint last week, which was first reported in The Washington Post. The nature of whistleblowing is that it is confidential, at least in the beginning. If tech employees are rushing to whistleblower lawyers, hoping for big payouts, it’s all happening in secret at this point.\n\nMore coverage: Facebook under fire\nThe Facebook Papers are a set of internal documents that were provided to Congress in redacted form by Frances Haugen’s legal counsel. The redacted versions were reviewed by a consortium of news organizations, including The Washington Post.\n\nThe trove of documents show how Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has, at times, contradicted, downplayed or failed to disclose company findings on the impact of its products and platforms.\n\nThe documents also provided new details of the social media platform’s role in fomenting the storming of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nFacebook engineers gave extra value to emoji reactions, including ‘angry,’ pushing more emotional and provocative content into users’ news feeds.\n\nRead more from The Post’s investigation:\n\nKey takeaways from the Facebook Papers\n\nHow Facebook neglected the rest of the world, fueling hate speech and violence in India\n\nHow Facebook shapes your feed\n\nShow more\n\n49 Comments\n\nGift Article\nMORE ABOUT FACEBOOK\nHAND CURATED\n\nYou’ve decided to quit Facebook.

The entire collection was minted in less than 35 minutes and soon after the price of the Shiba Inu-themed tokens started surging.\n\nThe popularity of Shiba Inu’s NFTs has been surging along with the price of the cryptocurrency itself. According to data from [CryptoCompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/shib/overview/USDT), the price of Shiba Inu’s token has moved up over 600% in the last three months over a retail trading frenzy that was bolstered by the cryptocurrency’s massive circulating supply being confronted with significant token burns.\n\nThe cryptocurrency’s [trading volume has surged to rival that of Ethereum](https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2021/10/shiba-inu-shib-trading-volume-briefly-surpasses-that-of-ethereum-eth/) after a supporter asked Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who has been a vocal supporter of rival meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin ($DOGE) how much SHIB Musk was holding.\n\nNigeria launches digital currency eNaira\n\nMusk replied with one word, “none,” leading to a significant crash in the price of the cryptocurrency, which at one point was down more than 10%. Musk was then asked about another meme-inspired cryptocurrency, Floki Inu, to which he replied he only bought BTC, ETH, and DOGE.\n\nSome token pools on Shiba Inu’s ShibaSwap exchange also implemented a burning system to destroy tokens and permanently remove them from circulation. According to available data, [SHIB whales have been influencing the cryptocurrency’s price](https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2021/10/shiba-inu-price-rises-nearly-20-as-shib-whales-keep-accumulating/), as when whale transactions above $100,000 occur, prices rise.\n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\n*The views and opinions expressed by the author, or any people mentioned in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.

One of the main drivers behind the surge of this metric is blockchain-based games.*\n\n*Propelled by the P2E narrative, the number of unique active wallets connected to blockchain games reached 754,000 in Q3. This amount represents 49% of the whole industry’s usage.”*\n\nThe blockchain-based game Axie Infinity is a big reason why interest in P2E games has skyrocketed, according to DappRadar.\n\n*“The case can be made for Axie Infinity as the true catalyzer of the play-to-earn revolution. Since moving to the Ronin sidechain, the game has reached impressive levels. During Q3, Axie became the most traded collection ever, surpassing blue-chip NFT collections like CryptoPunks and NBA Top Shot.*\n\n*At the time of writing, Axie has generated over $2.5 billion in trading volume.

The mother, Gloria Y Williams, 36, was charged with felony injury to a child by omission, failure to provide medical care and failure to provide adequate supervision, authorities said.\n\nThe Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences in Houston, which conducts all autopsies in the county, listed the child’s primary cause of death as homicidal violence with multiple blunt force injuries.\n\n* **What is the background to this?** One of the surviving siblings, a 15-year-old, called the sheriff’s department on Sunday and told authorities that his nine-year-old brother had died a year ago and the body was in the apartment, according to the law enforcement agency.\n* **How did the other children survive?** Their apartment did not have any power and a neighbor had helped the children by charging a cellphone and buying them food, police said. It appeared that the surviving children were “fending for each other”, with the oldest sibling caring for the younger two.\n\n## These Trump fans were at the Capitol on 6 January.

It has been clear that the climate crisis would intensify the extremes between wet and dry seasons, but many wonder whether this weather whiplash is a preview of catastrophes to come.\n\nSteven Ostoja, the director of the US Department of Agriculture’s California Climate Hub, said that even though climate scientists expected shifts of this intensity, it was nonetheless startling to witness. “All of a sudden it’s just like, my God. I have never seen it rain this hard outside of being in the Belizean rainforest,” he said.\n\n* **How bad was the drought?** Days before the storm, the state’s capital of Sacramento, where Ostoja is based, set a record of more than 200 days without measurable rain.\n* **Is the rain good news?** It has brought some gains, adding a few percentage points to the volume of water in lakes and reservoirs and extinguishing wildfires that have been ravaging the state.\n* **Should we be concerned?** The state is widening its weather extremes, experiencing stronger storms interspersed with intense dry spells. Historic droughts are being followed by the wettest years on record. So, yes.\n\n## In other news…\n\nPrince Andrew denies assaulting Virginia Giuffre when she was under 18.

With young people spending an increasing amount of time at home, the umbrella association of statutory accident insurers in Germany last year called for more playgrounds that teach children to develop “risk competence”.\n\n## Climate check: The dirty dozen – meet the US’s top climate villains\n\nFew are household names, yet these 12 enablers and profiteers have an unimaginable sway over the fate of humanity.

{"id": "YvJyzkc17klE0K-R3RTOTF4vpA6RxwZIxK554UaicGg", "title": "A fear grows in Trumpworld: Have we gone too conspiratorial?", "body": "For months, conspiracies about the 2020 election being stolen from Donald Trump have fueled Republican efforts nationwide to rewrite election laws. But now, some GOP operatives and Trump World luminaries are worried that the truly wild conspiracists may be mucking it all up.\n\nHogan Gidley, one of Donald Trump’s top lieutenants, took a subtle dig at some Trump allies and put some distance between their efforts and his group’s work on election reform. Other Republicans have expressed fears that talk of “audits,” machine rigging and foreign plots will depress voter turnout and discourage some people from seeking office.\n\n“People are going to do whatever they want, and I can’t answer for any of those other groups,” said Gidley when asked about misinformation and efforts by Mike Lindell and others to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n“But as it relates to election integrity and voter protection, it is vital that we help states get these simple, popular security mechanisms in place to ensure honesty for the 2022 midterms,” added Gidley, who is heading the Center for Election Integrity at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute. “I want to make sure that the data we gather and the information we share is built on solid ground as opposed to sinking sand.”\n\nThe comments illustrate the growing fissures erupting within Republican circles over how the party should address the last election. It’s a fissure that’s been caused mainly by Trump, who has been intent on continuously re-litigating the 2020 outcome with increasingly outlandish conspiracies that other Republicans echo. [Gidley himself has pushed misleading arguments](https://twitter.com/JHoganGidley/status/1343937062668480513) about some of the 2020 election outcomes, [including on the day](https://twitter.com/JHoganGidley/status/1346897969505841155) of the Jan. 6 Capitol riots.\n\nWhen asked for comment, Lindell — who has led a national crusade to push false claims of fraud and voting machine hacking, and is being sued for defamation by voting machine manufacturer Dominion for $1.3 billion — said in a text message that he would be bringing his “voter fraud” case to the Supreme Court on Nov. 23 at 9 a.m.\n\nThe results of it all are evident in new polling which reveals just how intensely Trump voters distrust election security.\n\nA POLITICO/Morning Consult poll released Wednesday shows that 77 percent of Democrats, 49 percent of independents and 28 percent of Republican voters trust the election system a lot or some. Just 9 percent of Republicans say they trust the election system a lot.\n\nAmong self-identified 2020 Trump voters, just 22 percent said they believed the 2020 elections were free and fair; while 72 percent said they probably or definitely were not. They were slightly more optimistic about the 2022 elections, with 38 percent saying they believed that they would be free and fair. But 51 percent still said they believed they would not be. Asked if they would vote for a candidate who believed that the 2020 elections should be investigated, 75 percent of 2020 Trump voters said yes, while only 11 percent said no.\n\nThe numbers demonstrate the vast skepticism and distrust Trump voters have of elections and the potential challenges Republicans could have convincing voters their ballots count.\n\n\"When my fellow Republicans are focused on the wrong things, when they’re focused on conspiracies about secret algorithms on voting machines, and they’re focused on ideas there is a group of ballots printed in China snuck in the back door of the board of elections — all those things are easily disproven,\" said Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who is running for re-election next May. “But a focus on those things distracts from what I consider the real concerns about election integrity.”\n\nThe Morning Consult polI offers some measure of relief for Republicans worried that voters won’t turn out amid talk of vast election conspiracies. A full 92 percent of self-identified Republican voters said that they planned to vote in the 2022 elections, with just 4 percent saying they did not plan to. By contrast, just 70 percent of self-identified Democrats said they planned to vote, and 29 percent said they did not plan to.\n\nNevertheless, in recent weeks, some prominent Republicans have begun warning in increasingly sharp terms that so much talk of fraud and the 2020 election could depress turnout.\n\n“I'm of the view that the best thing that President Trump could do to help us win majorities in 2022 is talk about the future,” Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), said on Meet the Press. “\\[B\\]etter off to talk about the future than to focus on the past in every election.”\n\nRepublican Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, meanwhile, said “re-litigating 2020 is a recipe for disaster in 2022.”\n\n“The election is passed, it’s been certified, the states made decisions on the integrity of each of their elections and made improvements where it need be. It’s about the future, it’s not about the last election, and that — those kind of comments are not constructive,” he said on Meet the Press.\n\nNeither Blunt nor Hutchinson are running for re-election in 2022. And their warnings seem likely to be drowned out by Trump’s routine statements calling for more investigations into an election that has been routinely certified as accurate and secure. In a recent statement, Trump threatened that voters will not show up at the polls unless election laws are changed. And in an interview for a new book by David Drucker, \"In Trump's Shadow: The Battle for 2024 and the Future of the GOP,\" Trump admitted that his focus on 2020 could be an “asset” or a “problem” for the GOP.\n\nSuch proclamations have set off a scramble among Republicans worried voters might not show up. Notably, last week Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) tweeted, \"I recently conducted a poll on Georgia's elections and if my constituents felt their votes would count during a teletown hall. Sadly, 4% said they won't even vote due to voter fraud. This is WRONG. Legal votes by Rs are just as important as stopping illegal ones.\"\n\nAnd in interviews, Republicans have called on the ex-president to stop talking about 2020 and start focusing on 2022, instead.\n\n“When people don’t trust elections they don’t participate, bottom line,” said LaRose.\n\nContractors examine and recount Maricopa County ballots case in the 2020 general election on May 6, 2021. | Matt York, Pool/AP Photo\n\nIn GOP primary races across the country, however, candidates have openly called for additional “audits” of the 2020 presidential vote, despite its continuous verification. [Josh Mandel, a Republican Senate candidate in Ohio, has called for “audits”](https://twitter.com/JoshMandelOhio/status/1441136152325599232?s=20) in all 50 states. And Trump endorsed candidate for Arizona governor, Kari Lake, has campaigned on her claim the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nThey’ve also fed the movement among elected Republicans to pass voter restriction laws in their statehouses. According to an October tally by the progressive-minded [Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-october-2021), “at least 19 states enacted 33 laws that make it harder for Americans to vote” in 2021.\n\nOn both sides of the aisle, this has led to an urgency to passing voting reform. According to the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, over three quarters of American voters (78 percent) think working to ensure integrity in U.S. elections should be a priority or Congress. That cuts across party lines, with 79 percent of Democratic voters, 70 percent of independent voters and 83 percent of Republican voters agreeing.\n\nThe [POLITICO/Morning Consult](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017c-be88-d8e1-a57c-fffd2c870000) poll was conducted Oct. 22-24, surveying 1,999 registered voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nLast week, Democrats once again failed to push through voting rights legislation after Senate Republicans filibustered the Freedom to Vote Act and despite efforts by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to compromise with Republicans on the bill. The bill would have established Election Day as a national holiday, set standards for voter identification laws, expanded the ability to vote by mail and curbed partisan gerrymandering.\n\nGidley’s group, the Center for Election Integrity, is among the conservative groups working on election reforms with legislators, business and advocacy groups at the state level to try and address issues and concerns around voting procedures. The center has published a list of the “The Top 25 Common-Sense State Election Integrity Reforms” that includes verified voter identification, uniform ballot counting procedures and mail-in ballot reforms.\n\nThere are cases of bipartisan work on the issue. Earlier this year Kentucky passed bipartisan legislation that expanded early voting and set in place new voting measures that passed in the Republican supermajority legislature and was signed by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear.\n\nRepublican Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, who testified before the Senate on Tuesday and said misinformation is the most serious threat facing the election system, credited his success working with a Democratic governor by making sure their messaging was in lock-step.\n\n“Having both sides at the table meant that his concerns on access, and my concerns on security were all addressed,” Adams said. “That’s the biggest mistake Republicans are making in state legislatures and Democrats are making in Congress. When you do this on a one party basis, the other side thinks you’re trying to cheat them, and you can’t make policy that way.”\n\n* FILED UNDER:\n* [ROY BLUNT](https://www.politico.com/news/roy-blunt),\n* [DONALD TRUMP](https://www.politico.com/news/donald-trump),\n* [DONALD TRUMP 2020](https://www.politico.com/news/trump-2020-presidential-election),\n* [VOTING](https://www.politico.com/news/voting),\n* [AUDIT](https://www.politico.com/news/audit),\n* [ELECTION FRAUD](https://www.politico.com/news/election-fraud),\n* [CONSPIRACY THEORIES](https://www.politico.com/news/conspiracy-theories),\n* [2020 ELECTIONS](https://www.politico.com/news/2020-elections),\n* [2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/2020-democratic-presidential-candidates-list/),\n* [MIKE LINDELL](https://www.politico.com/tag/mike-lindell),\n* [MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE](https://www.politico.com/tag/marjorie-taylor-greene)", "timestamp": 1635338545, "digest": "LEITAlTPR-E2ZN5s_yi_4_dZBaFbQaY1OG6fyszl0v0", "contributor": "0x15b7224118C75406C38Dee327A0a4C8390EfF138"}

She considered how to leave “without this ending badly”, she writes, and apologised and left.\n\n* **What happened after?** Abedin writes that she stayed friendly with the senator and soon “buried the incident”, which she wanted to forget, succeeding in erasing it from her mind “entirely”.\n* **Who was the senator?** Abedin does not name the senator or his party or give any other clues as to his identity.\n* **Why is this coming out now?** Abedin’s memory of her experience on the unnamed senator’s couch, she writes, was triggered when she read about Christine Blasey Ford “being accused of ‘conveniently’ remembering” her alleged assault by Kavanaugh.\n\n## Pair arrested over death of child found in Texas apartment with siblings\n\nThree children were found apparently abandoned in an apartment in Houston along with a body believed to be their brother, which had been in the unit with them for a year, police said. Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA woman and her boyfriend have been [arrested and charged](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/26/death-of-abandoned-child-found-in-texas-apartment-ruled-homicide) over the death of a nine-year-old child whose skeletal remains were found at a Houston apartment along with three surviving siblings who appeared to have been abandoned.\n\nBryan W Coulter, the 32-year-old boyfriend of the dead child’s mother, was charged on Tuesday with murder. The mother, Gloria Y Williams, 36, was charged with felony injury to a child by omission, failure to provide medical care and failure to provide adequate supervision, authorities said.\n\nThe Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences in Houston, which conducts all autopsies in the county, listed the child’s primary cause of death as homicidal violence with multiple blunt force injuries.\n\n* **What is the background to this?** One of the surviving siblings, a 15-year-old, called the sheriff’s department on Sunday and told authorities that his nine-year-old brother had died a year ago and the body was in the apartment, according to the law enforcement agency.\n* **How did the other children survive?** Their apartment did not have any power and a neighbor had helped the children by charging a cellphone and buying them food, police said. It appeared that the surviving children were “fending for each other”, with the oldest sibling caring for the younger two.\n\n## These Trump fans were at the Capitol on 6 January.

He is running for congress in Pennsylvania and is one of the more sophisticated candidates, having appeared on Fox News and met Trump.\n* In New York, **Tina Forte** is running an extremely long-shot bid to unseat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

He was also at the Capitol on 6 January, and has been called an “insurrectionist” by the Democratic congressional campaign committee.\n* In New Hampshire, **Jason Riddle** is running for the state’s second congressional district, despite [pleading guilty](https://www.unionleader.com/news/crime/second-jan-6-nh-insurrection-defendant-says-he-will-plead-guilty/article_8fac5b6b-bf51-515a-8b21-d2611bb6ae8a.html) in September to five charges arising from him entering the Capitol during the riot. Once in the Capitol, Riddle took – and drank from – a bottle of wine he found in a lawmaker’s office.\n\n## Weather whiplash: California’s historic downpour interrupts historic drought\n\nRecent storms raised Lake Oroville more than 16ft, according to the California Department of Water Resources.

It has been clear that the climate crisis would intensify the extremes between wet and dry seasons, but many wonder whether this weather whiplash is a preview of catastrophes to come.\n\nSteven Ostoja, the director of the US Department of Agriculture’s California Climate Hub, said that even though climate scientists expected shifts of this intensity, it was nonetheless startling to witness. “All of a sudden it’s just like, my God. I have never seen it rain this hard outside of being in the Belizean rainforest,” he said.\n\n* **How bad was the drought?** Days before the storm, the state’s capital of Sacramento, where Ostoja is based, set a record of more than 200 days without measurable rain.\n* **Is the rain good news?** It has brought some gains, adding a few percentage points to the volume of water in lakes and reservoirs and extinguishing wildfires that have been ravaging the state.\n* **Should we be concerned?** The state is widening its weather extremes, experiencing stronger storms interspersed with intense dry spells. Historic droughts are being followed by the wettest years on record. So, yes.\n\n## In other news…", "timestamp": 1635338644, "digest": "AjaEyw_28RMN-4B72H8BCkEkoRNFyoG79dg6cOAkqHE", "contributor": "0x6140E4c4b50f53D4a2621DF028b75Ce94f88De5b"}

Minutes after Pakistan won the match, hundreds of people in Kashmir danced in the streets, lit firecrackers and chanted \"Long live Pakistan\" while seeking the end of India's rule over the disputed region.\n\nThe celebrations came as India's powerful home minister, Amit Shah, was visiting the region for the first time since New Delhi in 2019 stripped Kashmir of its semi-autonomy, scrapped its statehood and removed inherited protections on land and jobs, further fueling tensions in the region.\n\nArticle continues after sponsor message\n\n### WORLD\n\n### With The Taliban's Rise, India Sees A Renewed Threat In Kashmir\n\n[Love of cricket](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/05/17/997486644/indias-major-cricket-tournament-got-suspended-should-it-have-even-happened), a legacy of Britain's long colonial role of South Asia, is one of the few things that unites Pakistan and India despite their long history of animosity that has fueled three wars since the subcontinent's partition in 1947, including two over control of Kashmir, which is divided between the two nuclear-armed rivals.\n\nThe fracas over Sunday's match shows how easily passions can be inflamed in predominantly Muslim Kashmir, where anti-India sentiment runs deep.

Buterin、 Juan Benet、Dominic Williams ，分别为以太坊、协议实验室、DFINITY 创始人**\n\n10 月 26 日，在第七届万向区块链全球峰会的一场圆桌论坛上，以太坊创始人 Vitalik Buterin、协议实验室创始人 Juan Benet 及 DFINITY 创始人 Dominic Williams 关于公链技术创新展开了深入探讨。以下为整理后的文字内容。\n\n\n***\n\n邓超（主持人）：女士们、先生们，各位下午好！同时想跟线上的各位嘉宾说一声早上好、晚上好！\n\nHashkey 是在新加坡和香港的投资机构，是亚洲最大也是最大的投资机构之一，是在区块链领域全球最活跃的投资机构之一，现在在世界各地一共有 200 多个被投企业。\n\n非常荣幸可以担任本次圆桌讨论的主持人，讨论公链技术。现在热烈欢迎本次圆桌的嘉宾：Vitalik Buterin、Dominic Williams、Juan Benet。\n\n由于大家都知道的原因，各位嘉宾没办法亲自到场，可是可以通过虚拟的方式、线上的方式互联，而且也可以与来自世界不同地方、不同大陆的人齐聚一堂讨论区块链。\n\n我相信今天各位嘉宾无需做任何过度介绍，就我所知 Vitalik 从未缺席过万向区块链国际周，对他来说这已经是第七次了，Dominic Williams 是第三次，Juan Benet 应该是第二次。\n\n这场圆桌是备受期待、万众瞩目的圆桌，也是国际周的高光时刻，不仅仅因为今天的圆桌嘉宾是区块链界最重要的基础设施及生态系统的创始人。同时因为我们始终期待渴望听到各位的真知灼见。\n\n今天我作为主持人，我将会问出有关于区块链技术相关的问题，包括区块链的应用及生态系统相关的问题。\n\n话不多说，正式开始今天的圆桌讨论。\n\n**今天我想问出的第一个问题问各位所有嘉宾，从去年的上海区块链国际周以来，各位觉得您个人看到的最令人激动的区块链领域进展是什么？请 Vitalik Buterin、Juan Benet、Dominic Williams 分享。**\n\n\\*\\*Vitalik Buterin：\\*\\*首先，从以太坊社区的角度来说，在过去一年间看到的最大进展像 PoS 及扩容方面所取得的进展，这些事情在去年的时候不过只是处于理论阶段，只是有几个测试网，但现在已经变成了正式上线的主网，并且他们正在做出大量的努力，能和现在的主链进行融合、合并，而且很快也会进入到测试阶段。\n\n哪怕在此之前，PoS 可以在链上运行节点，可以参与到生态系统中。扩容方面已经出现了一些 Rollup 项目，并且这些项目已经正式上线了，已经有一些网络，大家可以参与网络，可以对网络进行存款、取现。\n\n当然，这当中还有很多有待于完成、解决的问题，但在这些领域方面出现了长足的进展，从理论变成了真真切切的证据，表明已经存在了一些网络，并且网络正式可以为众人所应用了。\n\n总体来说，区块链在零知识证明方面出现了大量进展，并且今年的技术总是比去年要好，现在已经在讨论用零知识证明进行安全证明，对于虚拟机验证进行安全证明，这也是区块链技术在过去一年间所取得的重要进展。\n\n看到很多技术进步，生态系统方面也有很多不同的应用在出现，趋势是好的，但同时意味着需要技术方面的进步更好地满足应用的需求。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：非常感谢 Vitalik，Juan Benet。**\n\n\\*\\*Juan Benet：\\*\\*对我们来说，有关于 Filecoin 刚刚才一周年，在一年半之前刚刚庆祝了主网上线一周年，并且现在达到了 12 个 AI 字节（音），这样的数字非常大，数据存储力比所有的 Web3.0 要多，并且已经可以和那些中心化存储有一较之力了，这是很大的进步，也是 IPFS 总体的规模。\n\n除此之外，数字的应用也出现了长足的进展，这一点令人兴奋。我非常同意 Vitalik 所说的有关于零知识证明、加密证明、加密协同如雨后春笋一般涌现。在过去几年间，看到了协议进步、技术进步，整个协议可以变成完全的隐私，并且可以验证，使得我们有很多工具、很多机会能真正实现让用户所控制的系统。\n\n最有意思的是通用型、可验证、扩容的计算和零知识证明，这也是编程语言方面、技术方面最重要的进展，非常高兴看到这一点。\n\n最后想要指出 NFT 的出现非常重要，在社会、经济、文化上都具有很大的重要性，因为它代表大规模互联网原生财产所有权的出现。NFT 最开始是从艺术领域诞生，后续延伸到各个领域，已经影响到现实世界的资产，如具体的土地及物理世界的房产，这代表大的洪流的起始，在未来十年间，会出现长足的巨大发展，现在看到的就是它的演化（过程）。\n\n\\*\\*Dominic Williams：\\*\\*我非常同意刚刚 Vitalik 和 Juan 所指出的，对我来说最令我兴奋的进展是互联网计算机今年 5 月完成了创世阶段，对区块链来说有根本性的意义，因为互联网计算机可以实现愿景、使命，或者「世界计算机」。最开始大概在 6、7 年前被提出，而区块链可以作为技术栈，区块链能够允许你构建一切使用智能合约的软件构建各种各样的应用，而且在过程中不需要依赖于企业的云应用、云服务（比如说 AWS）。\n\n今天各位可以用互联网计算机打造社交媒体、服务系统，有关于互联网计算机的与众不同之处在于它的速度非常快，并且非常高效，领域能力可以实现线性扩容的。随着网络中节点数量增加，可以实现线性扩容，理论上就可以在互联网计算机中打造类似于 Facebook 的应用，但你是用智能合约进行打造。\n\n互联网计算机一直在推动变化，而区块链不过只是技术栈的一部分，在当今各种 DApp 完全可以运行在云上，比如说你有中心化的云服务、私人专用的服务器都可以运行，当你遇到互联网计算机应用的话，就会有一些由智能合约所提供服务的网站内容。比如说在互联网计算机中有一些聊天服务，这在几年之前是完全不可想象的，意味着区块链将会成为未来技术栈，这将是根本性的变化。\n\n这一点有一部分是可以从加密技术本身发展来获得的，比如说 Dfinity 基金会拥有全世界最大的由加密专家、互联网计算机相关的专家所组成的团队，对于机密技术有深入的研究，将之前被束之高阁的加密技术用到了实际的应用中，打造为了专业目的所使用的互联网计算机。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：非常感谢各位从技术、应用的角度提供的分享和观察。**\n\n接下来想要就技术再问一些问题，首先请 Vitalik 回答，今天上午我听到了您的主旨演讲，从社区的角度来说有很多讨论，对以太坊 2.0 版本也提出了很多期待。社区讨论有关以太坊的可扩展性、状态大小、二层解决方案，您今天上午的时候也提到了 Rollup，并且今年上半年也提到了其他状态相关的解决方案。\n\n**我的问题在于您可否和我们分享一下从以太坊 1.0 到以太坊 2.0 的过渡，现在到底处于怎样的具体阶段？**\n\n\\*\\*Vitalik Buterin：\\*\\*当然没有问题，我们并不应该使用以太坊 2.0 这样的术语，因为最开始当我们提出以太坊 2.0 术语的时候大家会有期待它会代表以太坊 1.0 根本上的变化，相当于从一条链转到了另外一条链个但现在就路线图来说，更多是渐进式、增量式的发展，虽然会看到一系列不同的变化，但每个变化代表的只是对于其中一个或多个方面进行变化。\n\n从应用的角度来说，并没有看到太多的变化，比如是应用并不需要做任何迁移、额外的部署，从而将它的应用从 PoW 链迁移到 PoS 链，以太坊自己就变成了 PoS 链，所有的应用也会直接迁移到 PoS 链上。\n\n我其实并不觉得它代表一系列单独的升级，我觉得更多更重要的一点在于向 PoS 链进行转变，有两个阶段：\n\n\\*\\*阶段一：\\*\\*推出 PoS 的信标链，信标链已经在去年正式推出，现在信标链已经稳定运行连续 11 个月的时间了，几天后很快会有信标链第一次的硬分叉。\n\n\\*\\*阶段二：\\*\\*合并，合并代表着将现有的以太坊生态系统以及基于以太坊所有的应用离开 PoS 链，转到 PoW 链上，这是自动化的过程，只是代表着另外一种形式的硬分叉，而且过程硬分叉是自动化的。\n\n这其实是终极目标了，过去几个月在合并方面取得了进展，之前举办了研讨会，所有的开发人员、研究人员齐聚一堂讨论到底如何进行合并，将会在未来几个月出更多的测试网为合并做出来，合并方面取得很多进展。\n\n所谓的以太坊 2.0 中有一点很重要，那就是分片。总体来说，路线图有独立的社区推出的 Rollup 项目，这些 Rollup 是能够实现第一步的扩容，比如说对于单一的 Rollup 可以实现 10 倍的扩容，对于更多更加先进的数据压缩技术的 Rollup 扩容能力将会进一步增加。\n\n除此之外，还有以太坊的数据分片，数据分片预计在 1-2 年之后出现，数据分片也可以进一步实现可扩展性，正处于早期阶段，但有团队正在方面努力。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：接下来的问题给到 Dominic Williams，Dfinity 建立了互联网计算机，最近刚刚发布。你能否跟我们分享一下超级计算机跟 Web2 计算机有什么不一样的？**\n\n\\*\\*Dominic Williams：\\*\\*首先，互联网计算机是区块链，可以在区块链上建立服务及使用智能合约，智能合约是非常新型的软件，它有它自己的优势。\n\n智能合约在去中心化网络上进行运行，他们都是互联网软件，可以通过它来创建系统及服务，就跟你创建软件是一样的，所以智能合约也可以自动执行。\n\n我们相信，由于智能合约的天然优势，所以所有人类社会系统都会过智能合约被重建，在区块链上进行运行。在设计互联网计算机的时候，就考虑到了区块链的架构，区块链就可以作为整个技术栈。\n\n它跟传统区块链不一样的地方在于可以通过互联网计算机智能合约来给用户提供可以互动的网页和内容，由此更大化地满足客户需要。比如说你可以在网络上获得充分的去中心化，同时也可以在网络上使用代币化的战略。\n\n我们认为，区块链就是新型的互联网，互联网计算机就是被设计来跟 Web3.0 结合，更好地通过区块链、智能合约来提供更高性能的服务及内容。\n\n在接下来的几个月里将会有智能合约在互联网计算机上激活，那时候大家就可以看出来它是多么激动人心。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：主要是为 Web3 用户所搭建的，接下来问问 Juan Benet。**\n\nProtocol Labs、IBFS 在分布式存储方面非常领先，吸引了很多开发者及用户，当然现在还是有进入的障碍，比如说如果要存储的话可能会有一些成本。你觉得如何帮助用户、开发者更好地减少障碍呢？\n\n\\*\\*Juan Benet：\\*\\*从今年年初开始，你可以更方便地进行存储，而且它的存储成本非常低，在一些情况下你可以进行完全免费的信息及数据存储。\n\n一方面，我们要让人们了解到它的好处。另一方面，需要让开发者、用户了解如何使用这样的工具获得收益，现在有许多工具可以为开发者所用。\n\n所以在过去的六个月，看到有许多开发者已经开始使用工具，同时在链上有许多 NFT 也开始部署。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：你刚刚提到了 NFT，接下来的另一个问题是关于应用的。知道在过去的一年间，DeFi 跟 NFT 经历了非常大的发展，对你们来说如何看待 DeFi 和 NFT 的兴起，你觉得它们在朝着正确的方向进展吗？你们会给 DeFi、NFT 团队什么样的建议？**\n\n\\*\\*Juan Benet：\\*\\*我觉得 NFT 非常棒，是非常好的使用区块链技术的例子，可以在不同的社区之间进行跨越，这也就是为什么越来越多的人开始关注 NFT。\n\n你可以通过 NFT 把它应用到不同的场景，比如说画展、博物馆等等。同时也可以把它部署到更大的空间、更大的世界上。我觉得，唯一的希望就是解决这个问题，人们在持有 NFT 希望可以使用 NFT，也可以在数字空间里更好地进行互动。许多对象都会更好地跟 NFT 结合，获得更加好的元宇宙，同时也会给我们提供去中心化的应用。\n\n这是关于 NFT 数字方面的现象，相信在未来 NFT 将会获得越来越多的关注，比如说你的房子也可以变成 NFT，可以进行购买、交易。\n\n世界上所有产权都可以通过这样的方式进行交易。\n\n我知道有一些电影是通过 NFT 的结构进行制造，所以可以看到在电影中演员、工作人员都是通过 NFT 网络进行工作，最终将会赋能很多非常好非常棒的区块链想法。\n\n\\*\\*Dominic Williams：\\*\\*我同意 Juan Benet 讲到的，NFT 是以这样的方式确保数据可以更好地交易。\n\n另外一点关于互联网计算机，我相信在未来将会有一些非常棒的代币化功能在互联网计算机上推出。比如说聊天工具的账户可以通过代币实现，比如说你可以对文件进行公正，获取代币。\n\n另一方面，有一些服务「神经网络」可以跟 Dapp 相结合，用户将会成为服务的拥有者，用户也会成为社交应用团队的一员，更好地更新它，以及对它进行迭代。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：Vitalik，你觉得 NFT 是否在朝着正确的方向发展？你有什么建议给到团队？**\n\n\\*\\*Vitalik Buterin：\\*\\*我想给大家稍微提醒一点，我觉得我们不应该假设 NFT 按当前的形式是金融上可持续的，至少它应该要存在经历过一个加密货币的寒冬，或者是多个寒冬。过去加密世界发展了很长一段时间，这个领域有一些项目可能在六个月到一年的时间里看起来很不错，有很多资金进入，但肯定一到两年的时间很快就变得岌岌无名了，大家应该耐心地等待，让我们真正地看到并理解 NFT 长期可持续的市场应该是怎样的。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：非常感谢，这些项目确实能提供真正的价值，如果能够实现可持续的话，就能长期存在。**\n\n下一个问题其实我是从今天早上 Dominic 主旨演讲中获得的灵感，有关于应用。从应用的角度来说，您觉得能够触发大规模应用的基点，甚至带来数千万、数亿用户进入到区块链的基点何时会发生？\n\n\\*\\*Dominic Williams：\\*\\*很多时候技术发展往往领先于应用，现在看到的情况恰恰如此。\n\n比如说银行往往用 Cube 相对来说比较落后的技术，并雇那些有几年经验的编程人员对 Bug 进行修复。\n\n最简单的智能合约、新的软件将会基于传统 IT 技术栈所搭建的应用和软件，新的软件和技术将拥有巨大的优势，区块链将变成完整的技术栈，人们会用智能合约进行开发，智能合约将会席卷全世界。\n\n当然，这样的愿景不会在一夜之间实现，当我在说区块链基点的时候并不是说一夜之间所有的事情都被迁移到区块链上，这样的情况趋势会加速。区块链不仅仅代表新的互联网，同时也是新的技术栈。\n\n核心关键在于当你用智能合约进行开发的时候，你往往能够获得新的能力，这意味着如果当你进行开发的时候，你对这些事物进行了重新的想象。\n\n当我们对于社交媒体、游戏进行重构的时候，当我们对企业应用系统进行重构的时候，每一个具体使用场景中都会重新思考这些场景到底会发生什么样的变化。\n\n我觉得，趋势是渐进性的，但是在未来几年趋势会加速。十年后，整个世界将会看起来截然不同在未来不会有任何人去怀疑区块链不仅仅是新的互联网，同时也是新的技术栈。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：非常感谢 Dominic Williams，我想请问 Juan Benet 您认为大规模应用的触发点是什么？**\n\n\\*\\*Juan Benet：\\*\\*我觉得区块链系统确实使得很多新的技术成为可能，使得我们开发很多新的应用。归根到底，人类本质并没有发生太大变化，同样类型的应用、同样的场景、同样的使用用例都没有发生太多变化。\n\n我非常同意 Dominic Williams 所说的，这是有关于社交方面的体验是，比如说游戏，游戏本身就是社交性活动，而且游戏参与方投入程度非常高，有很多人在游戏领域已经有多年的从业经验，所以游戏是具有很大的社交属性并且大家非常投入的领域。\n\n像抖音的出现以及在全球范围内迅速获得了大量用户，速度非常快。很快也会看到区块链驱动的社交媒体、社交网络在全球范围内有数十亿用户，在此之后游戏紧随其后。\n\n在这里最成功的或者能够长期让用户留下来的因素是元宇宙的结构，也就是说人们对于数字自我、数字身份有全新的认知，对数字资产、数字关系有全新的认知。而这些都是由元宇宙所支持的，大家对元宇宙的思考不应该觉得和你习惯的应用程序、电子邮件、社交媒体、计算机、游戏是一样的，这样的思索是错的，元宇宙代表的是全新的计算环境，在全新环境里会有很多应用，而元宇宙应用会提供很多交互，沉浸式体验、沉浸式环境，在元宇宙的世界里大家能够对资产拥有所有权，同时很有可能是可编程的。\n\n我觉得也可以通过 VR 和其他 AR 技术进行结合，这一切都需要强化，元宇宙代表的是你如何掌控空间，如何与其他人进行交互，所以游戏、社交、元宇宙三个关键词。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：我想请问 Vitalik，您觉得触发点是什么？**\n\n\\*\\*Vitalik Buterin：\\*\\*我觉得 Dominic Williams 和 Juan Benet 刚刚所提到的点，比如说社交媒体的应用，纳入了金融和区块链的社交媒体存在巨大机会，除此之外我也觉得游戏领域存在巨大的机会，另外是大家当前所做的诸多事情。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：感谢 Vitalik，我再补充问一个有关于应用的问题。各位今天早上也有一定触及到了去中心化的话题，我想听一下各位的思考。**\n\n您觉得如何对待去中心化和中心化？各位觉得二者之间是否应该达成某种均衡，在我们开发应用的时候大家一直在探讨中心化、去中心化的优劣，孰优孰劣，孰好孰坏。\n\n\\*\\*Vitalik Buterin：\\*\\*我觉得权衡取决于你要做哪一层的技术栈，如果做基础层的话，对你来说去中心化至关重要，如果你做应用层开发应用，这些应用更多是面向用户的，也就是说应用程序只会和用户进行直接的交互。对你来说，去中心化其实不是那么重要。\n\n但我确实觉得如果你能够在没有高成本的情况下实现去中心化的话，你应该做你应该选择，当然也有很多情况，哪怕并不是完全实现去中心化，合理的原则是应用种种的加密技术、零知识证明等，从而使得你的应用能够提供更强大的安全性保证，提供更强大的隐私保证希望。\n\n哪怕在区块链领域也已经有了大量范例、大量应用，比如说有很多应用确实依赖于中心化服务器，但服务器用的是零知识证明来说服用户相对来说是可以信任的。\n\n除此之外还有中间件，这些应用的用户本身不是终端的用户，相反是其他应用的开发者。对中间件开发来说完全去中心化是非常重要的，因为在这些情况下，你不仅仅希望能够获得安全性，同样也需要获得活性。安全性代表你的应用不会背叛，也就是说没有任何人会盗窃你的资金，而活性意味着网络能够持续保持运行。\n\n一切基于单一计算机的东西都能够获得安全性的保证，但没有办法提供活性的保证。如果做完全去中心化的系统，一旦系统上线的话就使得应用开发者和应用能够联系。而对于应用用户来说会比较有信心，基于中间件进行开发的话，相对来说应用会持续更长一段时间。\n\n作为应用开发者，希望你能关注加密技术，能够实现系统相对来说无需信任的属性，非常感谢！\n\n**邓超（主持人）：接下来的问题是关于生态系统的搭建，现在的区块链希望可以引入越来越多利益相关者，比如说投资者、开发者、用户等等，也可以看到现在有一些区块链生态系统基金。**\n\n对你们来说，搭建有活力生态系统的关键要素是什么？\n\n\\*\\*Juan Benet：\\*\\*我们非常关注于搭建高质量的生态系统，使得社区更好地成长，就要考虑到它所托管的应用及服务。\n\n考虑到用户体验，用户体验非常重要，开发者在搭建应用时的体验是什么样的这点非常重要。我看过很多不同生态系统，了解了不同公司及不同团队在搭建生态系统中的问题。一开始是通过许多资源、文件，进行黑客松的活动，征集更多项目，同时也可以了解更多系统里的人，跟这些人建立联系。\n\n希望黑客松是非常有趣的，同时也是非常有吸引力的，这对于搭建社区来讲非常重要。\n\n也希望帮助开发者了解如何使用技术实现梦想，黑客松是使很多非常棒的应用脱颖而出的好机会，可以帮助我们识别更多的项目、更好的服务。通过这些项目可以更好地相互合作搭建生态系统，也可以吸引一些人帮我们更好地实现社区目标及加速目前的进程。\n\n通过这样的方式可以成立生态系统基金，如果有人要建开源技术栈的话，就可以获得生态基金支持。\n\n总而言之，通过黑客松相互学习发现非常棒的项目，接下来可以把它们融入到生态之中。许多应用都是基于这样的过程才被创建的，这是非常不错的搭建区块链生态的方式。因为在区块链上有成千上万项目及很多开发者。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：不同阶段实施不同的战略，实现不同的目标。接下来 Vitalik，你觉得呢？如何更加促进利益相关方更好地搭建生态。**\n\n\\*\\*Vitalik Buterin：\\*\\*刚刚 Juan Benet 提到的非常好，以太坊会引入一些社区人士，其实从一开始就跟太坊社区合作，也会通过以太坊基金支持不同项目的进展。\n\n也有黑客松项目，黑客松通过以太坊相关组织来组织的，有些时候也会对项目、社区进行补贴。\n\n当然，基金会可以做很多，但最终所需要的是非常棒的社区，可以带来很多想法及非常不错的点子。对我们来说，以太坊生态搭建经历了好几年的时间，充满了起伏。\n\n现在扩容、Rollup 团队都是不同人在负责，也有不同的团队。基金会在生态中的作用是激励、鼓励越来越多的项目，同时补贴越来越多的项目。不是区块链的中心，只是作为边缘给予一些支持。\n\n\\*\\*Dominic Williams：\\*\\*Juan Benet 提到了搭建生态的过程，我们也在进行相似的操作，有黑客松，有许多应用在平台上搭建。\n\n我们的方法和主流区块链不一样的在于现在有许多 PoS 区块链会给很多补贴，希望开发者可以建立完全去中心化的 Dapp 建立神经系统，所有的 Dapp 会创建微观经济，所有 Dapp 完全去中心化。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：对观众及相关团队来说，可以知道通过基金会获得支持地接下来的问题从投资观点出发，对传统 VC、加密 VC 会有不同的看法及争议，除了融资外，VC 在区块链上扮演的作用是什么？**\n\n\\*\\*Vitalik Buterin：\\*\\*我觉得非常重要的 VC 例子是他们会把钱给到不同的项目，这种 VC 比其他 VC 好，因为很多 VC 会根据项目情况选择投资，获得短期收益就离场了。对生态系统来说，这是没有意义的。\n\n我们做了很多研究，发现许多项目都是通过 VC 的方式进行投资，这种 VC 对以太坊生态来说是有好处的，但是我认为在未来将会回到 VC 的方式发布不同的项目，所以 VC 当然有它非常重要的作用和意义。我认为区块链中还是不能缺少 VC。\n\n\\*\\*Dominic Williams：\\*\\*所以 Dapp 及其他去中心化项目都会通过这样的方式获得资金，一般 VC 会在早期介入，帮助团队、帮助项目起步。\n\n我所担心的是目前大家还是有点过于中心化的投资，比如说找出一些非常去中心化的服务是非常困难的。在未来 VC 会在早期介入项目，会像过去一样对于区块链进行投资。\n\n\\*\\*Juan Benet：\\*\\*我个人认为 VC 对于任何技术生态而言是重要的一部分，技术开发需要资金的支持，我可以给大家推荐一本书关于技术的发展及技术的演进，投资的好可以加快技术的发展，同时缩短开发的时间。有许多团队会获得 VC 的投资，最好投资者是找出来有价值的项目了解到项目的价值，同时也愿意承担风险投资项目，变成项目的一部分。\n\n通常这样的投资者可能有过去的相关经验，同时也了解技术发展的周期，所以他们有远见、胆识来投资项目，帮助创建新一代技术。\n\n不仅仅是指投资，另一方面是融资，许多融资模式进展的不是很顺利，对于我们来说，最好的公共投资平台是 Alpha （音）所采取的战略方式，他们会有项目管理，他们会预料未来会发生什么，同时也会更好地了解项目的进展，帮助项目实现愿景。\n\n我相信，所有融资都会帮助区块链更好地发展。对区块链而言机制不一样，不需要传统公司、实体机制进行管理，可以拥有 DAO，只要生态需要，所有的融资渠道都是非常有意义的。非常重要的一点是创立区块链空间，让投资者找到非常不错的项目，愿意把他们的钱投到里面来。对于开发者而言，希望通过投资使得他们的开发程序为大众所用。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：在区块链生态中 VC 扮演着非常重要的作用，但是 VC 也要适应区块链生态的一些变化。**\n\n为了节省时间，想再问最后一个问题，如果往前看的话，你们觉得在未来一年的关注点会在哪里？\n\n\\*\\*Dominic Williams：\\*\\*在接下来两到三个月有两个功能上线，一个是 TernCare （音）解决方案，主要是给 Dapp 开发者，他们会有一体化工具帮助他们更好地开发应用。现在也知道许多项目都在等着功能的发布，使得他们的项目更加去中心化。所以，焦点还是完全去中心化的 Dapp。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：Juan Benet，对你来说呢？你在接下来一年里的关注点是什么？**\n\n\\*\\*Juan Benet：\\*\\*第一，使得网络能力更加扩充，同时使得它非常易用，使得开发者更好地建立他们的应用。\n\n第二，需要在网络上进行更好的计算和验证，这也是跟智能合约相关，会通过 EVM 及其他网络，通过 EVM 就可以更好地应用上面的智能合约。这一层将会通过数据进行运算、计算，实现线性扩容，是我们即将拥抱的非常令人激动的变化。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：Vitalik 你呢？**\n\n\\*\\*Vitalik Buterin：\\*\\*首先是 PoS 的转移，还有分片、合并，把现在的以太坊转移到 PoS 链上，所有这些都还没有发生，但会是我们一直致力于及关注的焦点，以太坊网络也会有更多安全性及更高的效率。\n\n会进一步扩容使得人们在使用区块链的时候无需支付高昂的交易费用。所有这些都是即将关注的工作，当然也需要假以时日才能实现。可以以不牺牲区块链的好处使得应用更加友好。\n\n**邓超（主持人）：以上是 Panel 的所有内容，非常感谢三位嘉宾跟我们共同分享区块链产业的最新进展，给予你们最热烈的掌声，希望明年跟你们再会！**", "timestamp": 1635338780, "digest": "MVDJLRG2cb1HYctlb1LOA4I-50OJCUnaqmWxfgn4H5M", "contributor":

Research Collaborator**\n\n本篇为全篇的第二部分，约 19000 字，建议阅读时间 45 分钟；全篇共四部分，将陆续发布。\n\n在 [第一篇](https://www.chainnews.com/articles/252138338927.htm) 中，我们将跨链技术划分为原子交换、见证人、轻节点式侧链、中继链、共享验证人五大类别，并从跨链事务原子性、跨链消息验证、资产托管、多链适配四个维度分别进行了拆解和阐述，建立了跨链技术的认知框架和全景俯瞰。\n\n从本篇开始，我们将对跨链技术的应用形态进行举例。本篇将着眼于「BTC 锚定资产」和「以太坊跨层快速资产桥」两大应用形态，结合项目举例，进行纵深分析。\n\n### BTC 锚定资产\n\nBTC 是区块链世界的奠基石，BTC 因其在区块链领域的特殊地位，以及其架构中蕴含的深刻思想，聚集了很多坚定的信仰者。直至如今，BTC 在加密生态中的市场价值、流动价值、用户基础，都具有绝对的优势地位。因此，新生的公链，往往有极大的动力将 BTC 引入，为自身的生态注入强大的活力。于是，产生了众多的 BTC 锚定资产。\n\nBTC 锚定资产的基本原理是：\n\n* Lock-Mint\n\n在 BTC 链上锁定 BTC，目标链上铸造锚定资产\n\n* Burn-Unlock\n\n在目标链上销毁锚定资产，在 BTC 链上释放 BTC\n\n由于 BTC 链不具备图灵完备性，在 BTC 链上锁定 BTC 的环节，需要通过一个托管账户来完成，该托管账户由见证人来管理；另外，BTC 链上无法构筑目标链的轻节点合约，当 Burn 交易发生时，必须由见证人手动去完成 Unlock 环节。\n\n目标链一般而言是具有图灵完备性的，所以在 Lock-Mint 环节上，可以有不同的选择。可以选择在目标链上部署 BTC 轻节点合约，当用户把 Lock 交易传递给轻节点合约时，轻节点合约验证并执行 Mint 动作，也可以选择依旧靠见证人验证 Lock 交易和触发 Mint 。一般而言，项目方倾向于选择前者，但如果目标链是 Gas 费昂贵的以太坊，项目方更倾向于选择后者。\n\nBTC 锚定资产设计的关键点在于见证人机制，不同的项目在见证人机制上做了不同的设计，整体上分为\\*\\*信任式（无须抵押）和非信任式（需要抵押）\\*\\*两大类。\n\n#### 信任式 BTC 锚定资产\n\n信任式 BTC 锚定资产的见证人不需要抵押保证金，这类项目往往设计简洁，费用低廉，因此占据了巨大的市场份额，他们靠着长期积累的链下商誉和公开托管地址接受监督来获得社区的信任。需要注意的是，信任式的 BTC 锚定资产的见证人不一定是单个主体，也有可能是多个主体组成的联盟。\n\n**RBTC/LBTC**\n\n最早 BTC 锚定资产，是发行于 BTC 的侧链上的。Rootstock Labs 于 2018 年 1 月开发上线的 RSK 是 BTC 的第一条侧链，紧随其后，2018 年 9 月，Blockstream 开发的 BTC 侧链 Liquid Network 上线。两者都在侧链上创建了 BTC 锚定资产，分别是 sBTC(SmartBTC) 与 LBTC(Liquid BTC) ，后来 Rootstock 在 2019 年更新其白皮书时，将 sBTC 更名为了 RBTC(RSK BTC) 。\n\nRSK 是采用 Solidoty 语言编写的兼容 EVM 的智能合约平台，旨在赋予 BTC 以可编程性。RSK 使用 DECOR+ + (中本聪共识的独特变体)，通过「合并挖矿」机制，鼓励 BTC 矿工来兼任 RSK 节点，使 RSK 达到很高的安全性。\n\nRBTC 是按照 1:1 的比例锚定到 BTC 的，RBTC 的铸造和赎回过程依赖被称为 PowPeg 联盟的见证人集来实现。\n\n* RBTC 的铸造过程如下：\n\n用户将 BTC 转入到由 RSK PowPeg 联盟控制的多签地址中，到达该地址的 BTC 被锁定，该转入交易的 SPV 证明被 PoWPeg 联盟发送到 RSK 侧链上的桥接合约（Bridge Contract），一旦桥接合约获得此证明，它就会将相同金额的 RBTC 发送给用户指定的 RSK 侧链地址。该过程被称为 Peg-in 。\n\n**Peg-In 过程是非信任式的，并不需要依赖见证人。尽管 PoWPeg 联盟要负责向桥接合约递送 SPV 证明。但该过程实际上可以由任何人进行，当 PoWPeg 联盟递送不及时时，用户也可以自己去递送。**\n\n* BTC 的赎回过程如下：\n\n用户将 RBTC 发送到 RSK 区块链上的桥接合约地址，由于 BTC 链无法验证 RSK 链上的交易，我们需要 RSK PowPeg 联盟协助签署 BTC 链上的赎回交易，当 15 个联盟成员，有 11 个完成签名时，即可从多签地址中向用户转出相同金额的 BTC，此过程被称为 Peg-Out 。\n\n**Peg-Out 过程是信任式的，我们需要相信 PowPeg 联盟不会串谋签署错误交易，盗取托管资产。**\n\nPoWPeg 联盟由 15 家知名的、信誉良好的、具有高安全标准和节点维护技术能力的区块链公司组成。现有联盟成员分布在多元化的地理单元和司法管辖区，他们通过 11-of-15 签名来管理成员的新增和清退。除此之外，RSK Labs 已经制定了联盟成员的详细章程，包括安全政策、备份要求等。\n\n为了保证安全，避免区块链可能的重组带来的损失，RSK 采取了非常保守的最终性原则。Peg-In 过程大概需要 14 个小时（100 个 BTC 区块），Peg-Out 过程大约需要 33 个小时（4000 个 RSK 区块）。鉴于 Peg-In 和 Peg-Out 操作需要较长的等待时间，许多机构用户（例如交易所）会直接铸造好现成的 RBTC，普通用户可以直接向他们获取。\n\nLiquid 与 RSK 采用了大体相同的设计，同样是 M-of-N 联盟多签式的资产托管方案，同样采用了「非信任式 Peg-In + 信任式 Peg_out」的非对称方案。\n\n不同的是，RSK 更侧重赋予 BTC 可编程性，而 Liquid 更侧重于提供一个 BTC 的快速交易网络。在这样的指导思想下，Liquid 被设计为了联盟链，负责资产托管的联盟实际上也是 Liqiud Network 的节点。此外，Liquid Network 支持隐私交易，通过 Liduid Network 交易，可以做到隐藏交易金额和资产类型。\n\nRSK 和 Liquid 都曾是天王级的项目，受到万众期待，但后来由于以太坊及其 DeFi 生态的崛起，RBTC 和 LBTC 的光芒被后来居上的 WBTC 所掩盖。\n\n> [RBTC 文档](https://developers.rsk.co/)\n>\n> [LBTC 介绍文档](https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/sections/900000129806-Understanding-Liquid)\n\n**WBTC ( Wrapped BTC )**\n\nWBTC 是 Wrapped BTC 的简称，2019 年 1 月由 BitGo 和 Kyber Network 联合发起。WBTC 是当前铸造量最大的 BTC 锚定资产，锁仓的 BTC 超过 200 万枚，占到了 BTC 锚定资产份额的 80% 以上，是无可辩驳的王者。如今 WBTC 已经有 WBTC on Etheruem，WBTC on Tron 两种格式。WBTC 通过 WBTC DAO 成员组成的见证人集来管理资产兑换的过程。\n\nWBTC 对见证人的角色进行了拆分，分为了托管商（ Custodian ）和兑换商 ( Merchant )。兑换商是介于用户和托管商之间的一个中介角色，将用户和托管商隔绝开来，用户与兑换商交互，兑换商和托管商交互。\n\n![0 (2).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/2ac4d4f27d2f5879978aa41b83fa007d_p3JTkZr.png-article)\n\n理论上，兑换商和托管商都不止有一个。每个兑换商和每个托管商都管理着一个独立控制的托管地址。无论是兑换商，和还是托管商，都必须是 WBTC DAO 的成员，而 WBTC DAO 成员的新增和清退则由现有成员通过 M-of-N 多签合约来进行许可式管理，但不一定所有的 WBTC DAO 成员都会成为兑换商或托管商。\n\n* 兑换商申请铸造 WBTC 的过程如下：\n\n兑换商发起一个 X 个 WBTC 的铸造请求，并将 X 个 BTC 发送到托管商的托管地址，托管商收到 BTC，等待 6 个 BTC 区块（ 1 小时左右）确认后，创建 WBTC 铸造交易，向兑换商发放 X 个 WBTC。\n\n* 兑换商申请赎回 BTC 的过程如下：\n\n兑换商发起一个 Burn 交易，销毁 X 个 WBTC （该交易是一笔多签交易，需要兑换商和托管商都签名才能正式完成），托管商等待 25 个以太坊区块（ 6 分钟左右）确认后，将 X 个 BTC 释放到兑换商的地址，最后托管商签名 Burn 交易，使得销毁正式完成。\n\n\\*\\*用户无权申请铸造和赎回，只能向兑换商买入或卖出 WBTC，托管商也无权直接服务终端用户，只能服务于兑换商。\\*\\*用户可以自由选择信任的兑换商，至于兑换商如何选择托管商，机制尚不明确，当前 WBTC 只有 BitGo 一家托管商。\n\n用户可以用 BTC 和兑换商通过基于哈希时间锁的原子交易换取 WBTC，也可以用同样的方式将 WBTC 换回 BTC。\n\n通过托管人和兑换商的角色拆分，用户体验被大幅改善了，如果允许用户和托管人直接互动，用户将不得不忍受 Mint 和 Burn 的缓慢过程，但兑换商却可以通过提前储备 WBTC 和 BTC，让用户的兑换能够快速完成。\n\n尽管 WBTC 相对中心化，还要求用户 KYC ，但它却是最成功的 BTC 锚定资产。Paka Labs 认为，有三个重要的原因可以给我们启示：\n\n其一：借鉴前人经验，将复杂性封装在兑换商和托管商之间，给用户简洁快速的体验；其二：WBTC 高度重视兑换商的商务拓展，兑换商实际上成为了 WBTC 的经销商，WBTC 成功构筑了商业利益链条；其三：WBTC 借助了以太坊的势能，并抢先拓展其在 DeFi 中的应用，反过来促进了 WBTC 的铸造需求。\n\n> [WBTC 白皮书](https://wbtc.network/assets/wrapped-tokens-whitepaper.pdf)\n\n**BTCB/HBTC**\n\nBTCB 是 Bitcoin BEP2 的缩写，是 Binance Smart Chain 发行的 BTC 锚定资产，托管了大约 10 万枚左右的 BTC，HBTC 则是 Huobi 发行的 BTC 锚定资产，托管了大约 4 万枚左右的 BTC。两者分别是铸造量 Top2 和 Top4 的 BTC 锚定资产。（ Top3 为 RenBTC ）\n\n两者都是中心化机构依托自身庞大的用户群体和长期经营的商誉而发行，拥有不错的用户体验，其技术路线是极端中心化的方式，由发行机构直接作为见证人，负责资产的托管和跨链事务的验证。\n\n**XBTC （ChainX）**\n\nXBTC 是跨链项目 ChainX 于 2018 年 5 月推出的 BTC 锚定资产。与 RBTC/LBTC 类似，ChainX 本身也被开发为了 BTC 的一条侧链，并采用了「非信任式 Peg-In + 信任式 Peg-Out」的非对称设计。\n\nChainX 的优势是基于 Substrate 框架开发，未来有机会成为波卡的平行链，将 XBTC 带到波卡生态。**ChainX 在链上使用 WASM 技术首次实现 BTC 轻节点，支持 BTC 交易的 SPV 验证，使得在 XBTC 铸造环节实现了非信任式的安全性。**\n\n在 BTC 赎回环节，则由多位「信托」通过链上多数派投票完成销毁-解锁流程。一共会有 15 位信托，他们通过多签来管理托管地址。第一批信托将从 ChainX 测试网的验证人中选拔产生，后续将通过「禅让制」进行更替。ChainX 的托管地址有 2 个，一个冷钱包地址，一个是热钱包地址，冷热分离，提高安全性，签名记录公开透明，接受社区监督。\n\nChainX 并不满足于当前的信任式的设计。ChainX 宣称，其资产托管方案还会持续不断演进，上述是 1.0 版本，后续将有 2.0、3.0、4.0 版本的资产托管方案，一步步走向去中心化。2.0 版本：采用 XCLAIM 机制，启用分布式的托管方案。3.0 版本：将账户控制技术由多签改为私钥分片。4.0 版本：让用户掌握托管账户的一个特殊私钥分片，该分片具有一票否决权。通过该设计提高资产托管安全性，让见证人免于超额抵押。\n\n> [ChainX 白皮书](https://www.chainx.org/static/ChainXWhitePaper-901b6b70f654c8f8824686a2277971c0.pdf)\n\n#### 非信任式 BTC 锚定资产\n\n尽管信任式 BTC 锚定资产在成本和体验上有优势，但业界对非信任式方案的探索更有热情，出现了很多具有独创特色的项目。这些项目在秉持去非信任理念的基础上，对见证人的准入机制、分组机制、抵押机制做了创新。\n\n**tBTC：早期的探索者**\n\ntBTC 是一个发行于以太坊平台上的 BTC 映射资产，是由 Keep Network 等多个团队支持的开源项目。tBTC 发行于 2020 年 5 月，是以太坊上第一个非信任式的 BTC 锚定资产项目。\n\ntBTC 由签名人责管理托管账户，签名人是自由准入的，但需要用 150% 价值的 ETH 进行超额抵押。由于用 ETH 作超额抵押，所以会涉及到预言机喂价和抵押债仓清算的问题，tBTC 直接参考了 MakerDAO 的机制，并通过 MakerDAO 的预言机喂价。\n\ntBTC 的签名人被随机分为多个 3 人小组，每个小组，通过 3-of-3 多签来管理一个托管地址。每个托管地址只托管 1 个 BTC 。\n\n可以说，tBTC 是一个非常极客化的开放系统，但设计上高度复杂，易用性上极其反人性。首先，用户一次只能铸造 1 个 tBTC，如果要铸造多个，则需分多次申请，而且用户无法铸造小于 1 个 tBTC，其次，多签账户的签名人更替是很麻烦的，所以 tBTC 没有设计签名人的灵活更替机制 ，为了让签名人能够退出，tBTC 系统要求用户每 6 个月必须赎回一次 BTC。\n\ntBTC 作为以太坊上第一个去中心化的，无须信任假设的 BTC 锚定资产，具有开创意义。但由于其糟糕的用户体验，tBTC 并没有获得成功。\n\n> [tBTC 白皮书](https://docs.keep.network/tbtc/index.pdf)\n\n**renBTC ( Ren Protocol ) ：MPC 网络**\n\nrenBTC 也是在 2020 年 5 月发行在以太坊上的 BTC 锚定资产。\n\nRenBTC 上的见证人，被称为暗节点（Dark Nodes），众多的暗节点，通过 BFT 共识机制组成一个 MPC （安全多方计算）网络。Ren Protocol 将该网络抽象的认知为了一个 Ren 虚拟机（RenVM）。\n\n\\*\\*暗节点按照 100 个为一组，分成若干组，每 100 个暗节点组成一个 RenVM 的分区，负责管理一个私钥分片账户，托管一部分 BTC ，但分组不是固定的，每天会重新洗牌一次。\\*\\*暗节点可以自由加入，也可以随时退出，并不需要像 tBTC 那样，在托管资产被赎回时才能退出。暗节点之所以「暗」，是因为它隐藏在 RenVM 之下，RenVM 作为一个抽象的整体，承担见证人的职能，与用户交互，但在实质上，还是由暗节点执行相关操作。由于 RenVM 是 BFT 共识机制，我们可以认为每个分区中的 100 个暗节点，只需有 67 个及以上签名（2/3），即可对托管资产进行操作。\n\n暗节点需要在 Ren Protocol 的以太坊合约中质押 100,000 个 REN 通证才能工作，直到退出暗节点时才能赎回。如果暗节点试图盗取资产，质押的 REN 将被 Slash。暗节点质押 REN 的数量，将随着网络中托管的 BTC 数量而调整，以维持一个安全的超额抵押率，该调整是通过治理完成的，不会用到预言机。\n\n值得一提的是，renBTC 和 Acala 之间建立了合作关系，Ren Protocol 支持在 Acala 上铸造 renBTC，Acala 是一个波卡生态的 DeFi 平台，其测试网 Karura 已经通过竞拍，获得了 Kusama 的平行链插槽。未来 renBTC 将有可能通过 Acala 流入波卡生态。\n\n![0 (1).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/b04a54b1ea155b90a8b7e8ec5938b89c_KCdXddX.png-article)\n\nRen Protocol 除了支持用户铸造 RenBTC on Ethereum 和 RenBTC on Acala 之外，还支持用户在这两者之间转换。假设用户要将 RenBTC on Ethereum 转换为 RenBTC on Acala，用户并不需要将 RenBTC on Ethereum 赎回为 BTC，再去铸造 RenBTC on Acala，而是直接可以**通过 Burn-Mint 逻辑**直接转化。这样的设计节约了操作步骤，也节约了转化费用，有效的提高了用户体验。\n\nrenBTC 是 Ren Protocol 支持的映射资产之一，Ren Protocol 还支持 renZEC，renBCH，机制与 renBTC 大同小异。\n\n> renBTC 介绍文档：\n>\n> [RenVM](https://github.com/renproject/ren/wiki)\n>\n> [DarkNodes](https://docs.renproject.io/darknodes/)\n\n**eBTC(DeCus) 重叠分组机制**\n\neBTC 是由 DeCus 在以太坊上发行的 BTC 锚定资产，eBTC 中的签名人被称为 Keeper，Keeper 可以无经许可，自由出入网络。当用户需要铸造 eBTC 或者赎回 BTC 时，由系统分配的一个 3 名 Keeper 组成的 Keeper Group 来处理。其过程如下图：\n\n![0 (5).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/39c7c71659d05d68b647893ec4a604d5_bfLDq9C.png-article)\n\n每 3 个 Keeper 负责组成一个小组，管理一个 2/3 门限的托管地址。当前阶段，Keepers 是通过多签来管理托管账户，首批 Keeper 将通过拍卖活动产生，Keeper 无法自由退出，随后会迭代为由私钥分片技术控制的账户，Keeper 将可以自由进出。\n\neBTC 的最大特点是其独有的「重叠分组」机制。Decus 宣称：通过该机制，仅需低于 50% 的抵押率，即可实现相当于 100% 抵押率的安全性。\n\n假设有 6 个 Keeper，被分成两个 3 人小组分别负责管理 50% 的资产，这两组分别是 ABC 组，和 CDE 组，假设有 2 个恶意 Keeper ，那么这 2 个恶意 Keeper 被分到一组的概率是 40% ，**所能威胁的托管资产比例是 50%**；\n\n假设 6 个 Keeper，采用重叠分组方式分成多个三人小组，则可以分为 ABC、ABD、BCE…20 个组，每个组负责管理 5% 的资产。如果有两个恶意 Keeper ，他们被分到同一个组的概率是 100% ，其中两人同在一组的组有 4 个，所能威胁的托管资产比例是 20% 。\n\n我们发现， 2 个恶意 Keeper 的「危害概率 \\*威胁资产比例」是恒定的，没有被改变，\\*\\*重叠分组的本质是增加了危害概率，而降低了威胁资产比例。\\*\\*然而，这个改变非同寻常，Keeper 只需质押 20% 的抵押金，即可保障系统的安全。因为有抵押金的存在，危害概率即便很大，恶意 Keeper 也不敢妄为。\n\n以上是以 6 个 Keeper 中有 2 个恶意 Keeper 为例，Decus 计划招募 121 个 Keeper ，将产生 C(121,3)=287980 个 Keeper Group ，假设恶意 Keeper 的数量为 m ，那么他们可以破坏的组数为 (121-m)\\*C(m,2)+C(m,3)，当 m 为 10 时，可以破坏的组数为 5115 个，占总组数的比例约为 1.78% ，这意味着所能威胁的资产比例只有 1.78% ，其他 m 值的情况，我们也可以依次计算，并与常规分组方案对比：\n\n![0 (4).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/051256dc02355343a2fb799f0acd2d3c_u4TEju6.png-article)\n\n由表中数值可知，**重叠分组方案相比常规分组方案，始终具有更低的安全抵押率。但我们也发现，Decus 所宣称的低于 50% 的安全抵押率，是有假设条件的**：只有恶意 Keeper 数占比不超过一半的情况下，安全的抵押比例才不用超过 50% 。\n\n* [eBTC 介绍文档](https://docs.decus.io/mechanism)\n\n**InterBTC 独立控制地址矩阵**\n\n2016 年，波卡在白皮书中提出要和 BTC 建立互操作关系，2020 年 1 月，Web Foundation 委托 Interlay 以 XCLAIM 为基础，设计并开发一个一款在波卡上的 BTC 锚定资产。因此，Interlay 开发的 PolkaBTC，可以被认为有波卡官方背景。后来，PolkaBTC 被更名为 InterBTC。\n\nInterlay 使用 Rust 语言和 Substrate 框架开发了一条 BTC-Parachain，计划在未来作为平行链接入波卡生态。2021 年 10 月，Interlay 的先行网络 Kintsugi 已经拍到 Kusama 插槽，并接入了 Kusama 网络。\n\n与 ChainX 相似，BTC-Parachain 上部署了 BTC 的轻节点，使得 BTC-Parachain 具备了验证 BTC 链上交易的能力。在 InterBTC 系统中，托管账户是众多独立控制的 BTC 账户，这些账户被称为 Vaults (金库)，见证人被称为 Vault 管理人。任何主体都可以通过质押 DOT 成为 Vault 管理人，质押 DOT 的金额与所能托管的 BTC 最大额度成正比。用户向 Vault 中转账 BTC ，BTC-Parachain 验证后，给用户发放 InterBTC。当用户需要赎回 BTC 时，BTC-Parachian 销毁 InterBTC ，Vault 管理人向用户返还 BTC 。尽管每个 Vault 都是一个独立控制账户，但 150% 的超额抵押可以保障这些 Vault 管理人不作恶。\n\n用户铸造和赎回，需要支付 DOT 作为手续费，费用将给到 Vaults 管理人作为激励。如果 Vault 管理人试图盗窃托管的 BTC，质押的 DOT 将被没收，赔偿给受损失的用户。超额抵押机制的存在要求系统配置预言机喂价，但由于 InterBTC 还未上线，预言机的供应商还未确定。\n\nVaults 管理人除了负责管理托管账户，还要承担 Relayer 的职能，负责将 BTC 链的区块头传输到 BTC-Parachain 。\n\n**InterBTC 系统允许用户选择自己建立 Vault ，来托管自己的 BTC ，对于需要将大额 BTC 转化为 InterBTC 的大型流动性提供商，这个功能十分必要。**\n\n![0 (8).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/ac4736a2aed253b5b4ca3dba084bb865_BdaMton.png-article)\n\n尽管介绍文档中没有提及，但依照我们的理解，Vaults 管理人应该是无法随时退出的，需要等到托管的 BTC 被赎回时才能退出。不过，我们可以做一个猜想：如果支持 Vault 管理人出售自己的 Vault 会怎么样？\n\n> [InterBTC 介绍文档](https://docs.interlay.io/#/start/overview)\n\n#### 关于 BTC 锚定资产的小结\n\n以上我们介绍了 8 个具有代表性的 BTC 锚定资产，信任式的锚定资产具有经济效率优势，整体上也更加成功，非信任式锚定资产更符合区块链精神，但目前还处于探索中：tBTC 作出了最早的尝试；随后 RenBTC 通过采用私钥分片机制解决了见证人的退出机制问题，并用定期刷新的分组来提高安全度；eBTC 在抵押不可避免的情况，通过改变分组方式，降低安全抵押率，InterBTC 则着力于提高见证人的分布程度，为用户提供更多选择。\n\n整体上，非信任式 BTC 锚定资产，还有很大的创新空间，什么样的方案是最佳实践，也有待时间的验证。\n\n下表是对 5.1.1-5.1.2 中所提到的 BTC 锚定资产的一个特征对照表：\n\n![0 (3).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/6c0b4bc9bd875d87be0a05ebc3e0c069_4iAoAaa.png-article)\n\n点击

的部署有最大吸引力的公链。Solidity 语言和 EVM 环境也成为区块链开发人员最习惯的开发工具。然而，以太坊的生态容纳量似乎已经达到瓶颈，交易缓慢、Gas 费高企成为阻碍其继续发展的核心限制因素。\n\n尽管以太坊 2.0 的分片方案已经在计划中，但实际落地尚需时日，于是各种扩容方案先后被提出来，包括侧链、闪电网络、Plasma、Truebit，状态通道、Rollup。其中，侧链虽然可以解决扩容问题，但其安全性是独立负责的，不能继承以太坊的安全性，所以侧链被认为是一个新的 Layer1，其余的扩容方案则被认为是 Layer2。\n\n为了行文简洁，后文将把 Layer1 和 Layer2 分别简写为 L1 和 L2。\n\nL2 的实现形式历经演化，最后 Rollup 成为了主力的扩容技术。Rollup 方案在 L1 级别安全性、数据可用性、可扩展性，用户体验等方面的综合表现最好，以太坊生态的大多数的扩容网络都选择了采用 Rollup 方案构建。后文所称的 L2 ，将特指 Rollup 二层网络。\n\nRollup 的基本路线是将二层网络的状态转换信息全部提交到 L1 ，但同时通过提供有效性证明或者欺诈证明的方式，让 L1 可以实现「懒惰验证」（仅仅验证欺诈证明或有效性证明即可等效于验证 L2 提交的所有状态转换），从而节约 L1 的计算资源。\n\n根据 Rollup 网络提交给 L1 的证明形式，Rollup 网络被分为两类，一类是通过挑战期生成欺诈证明的 Optimistic Rollup （ 后文简称 Op Rollup ） ，一类是采用零知识证明技术生成有效性证明的 Zk Rollup。\n\n#### 为什么需要跨层快速资产桥\n\n由于挑战期的存在，Op Rollup 有一个缺陷，那就是用户从 L2 向 L1 的提款周期较长，需要 7 天左右，ZK Rollup 则由于生成零知识证明的计算复杂度较大，用户提款时，也有大约 1 个小时左右的等待时间。然而，目前应用较广的是 Op Rollup ，因为 Op Rollup 对 EVM 的兼容较好，便于迁移 L1 Dapp，ZK Rollup 兼容 EVM 的难度较大，需要做大量的技术研究工作，目前尚未实现。另外，即使 ZK Rollup 未来成功做到兼容 EVM，1 个小时左右的提款时间，对于没有耐心的用户也是无法接受的。用户期待的是：几分钟，甚至几秒钟！\n\n除了快速提款之外，还有一个典型需求，那就是在 L2 与其他 L2 之间快速转账。常规的途径，是要先从 L2-1 提款到 L1 ，再从 L1 存入到目标 L2-2 ，但这样既缓慢，又不经济。\n\n鉴于上述需求，不少提供 L2→L1 快速提款和 L2⇋L2 快速转账的跨层快速资产桥被开发出来。\n\n#### 跨层快速资产桥的技术本质\n\n快速资产桥本身并没有加快原有的资产流转通道，而是另起炉灶，构建了一个新的资产流转通道。后文行文中，我们将分别称为\\*\\*「原始通道」**和**「快速通道」\\*\\*。\n\n在快速通道中，增加了一个新角色，来为用户提供流动性垫付。用户在源账本向流动性提供者付款，流动性提供者在目标账本上向用户的目标地址付款，然后，流通性提供者再通过原始通道，重新平衡自己的资产，实现流动性回归。\n\n我们发现跨层快速资产桥，除了支持 L2→L1 快速提款和 L2⇋L2 快速转账，往往也可以支持 L2 与其他 EVM 兼容链之间的快速转账，这是因为 EVM 兼容链往往与以太坊建立了桥接关系（包括成为以太坊的侧链），与 L2 之间，存在一条多跳的原始通道。\n\n有些文献把跨层快速资产桥的流动性垫付模式归结为了一种新的跨链方案，并称之为「流动性互换」，但 Paka Labs 认为，在进行跨链技术类型归结时，还是应该关注其核心——信任机制。根据其信任机制，所有的跨层快速资产桥，基本可以落入两个框架内，一个是**原子交易模式**，一个是**见证人模式**。我们将分别介绍几个典型项目：\n\n#### 原子交易型跨层快速资产桥\n\n**cBridge ( celer.network )**\n\ncBridge 是以太坊 L2 层扩容平台 celer.network 搭建的跨层快速资产桥。\n\ncBridge 采用了哈希时间锁方案，并让中继节点（Rely Node）作为公共交易对手方。一笔交易的完成过程如下：\n\n* Step1 : 用户在源账本上发起 TransferOut 交易，向中继节点转账，该交易设置哈希时间锁；\n* Step2：中继节点在目标账本上发起 TransferIn 交易，向用户转账，设置同样的哈希时间锁；\n* Step3 ：用户 Confirm 源账本上的 TransferOut 交易，哈希锁原象被披露；\n* Step4 ：中继节点 Confirm 目标账本上的 TransferIn 交易，跨层交易完成。\n\n我们发现，**上述过程和典型的基于哈希时间锁略有不同**，典型的哈希时间锁交易应该是由中继节点 Confirm 源链上的 TranferOut ，而由用户 Confirm 目标链上的 TransferIn 。\n\n**cBridge 如此设计的目的是改善用户体验，避免用户在跨层交易过程中需要切换钱包。优化后的交易过程中，用户的所有操作都在源账本完成，将无须切换到目标账本钱包进行任何操作。**\n\n这样的调整，带来一个小问题：中继节点如果不进行 Step4 操作，等到 TranferIn 超时失效，便无偿的获得了用户 TransferOut 的资产。事实上，在 Step3 完成后，哈希原象已被披露，任何人都可以去完成 Step4 步骤的操作，cBridge 建议用户及时关注 TransferIn 交易的状态，如果中继节点迟迟没有完成 Step4 ，则需用户自己去目标账本上确认 TransferIn 交易。\n\ncBridge 实际运行下来，中继节点在绝大多数情况下都会忠实的履行 Confirm 操作。TransferIn 的交易金额会略小于 TransferOut ，其中的差价是中继节点收取的手续费。如果中继节点多次出现不确认交易的情况，将可能失去担任中继节点的资格。\n\n在 2021 年 9 月的 cBridge2.0 更新中，中继节点角色已经被合并到了 Celer 的状态守卫者网络 (SGN) 验证人中，以后将不存在单独的中继节点角色。\n\ncBridge 除了支持以太坊及其二层网络 Arbitrum 之外，目前已支持了兼容以太坊 EVM 的 BSC、Fantom、Avalanche、OKExChain、Polygon 等区块链网络间的资产快速转移。\n\n> [cBridge 介绍文档](https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/#/)\n\n**NXTP (Connext)**\n\nNXTP 由 Connext 团队发布，全称 Noncustodial Xchain Transfer Protocol ，中文译为非托管跨链转账协议。该协议使用类似于哈希时间锁的原子交易机制，但没有依赖哈希原象，而是基于智能合约，将一笔交易的触发条件直接设定为提供另一笔交易的签名。\n\n用户通过 NXTP 进行跨层交易时，交易将经历三个阶段：\n\n* Step1 : Router 招标\n\n用户向网络广播交易需求，Router 以承诺的交易完成时间和手续费金额秘密投标，用户选定具有优势的 Router （选标），进入下一阶段；\n\n* Step2 ：准备（Prepare）\n\n用户选标完成后，向源账本上的交易管理合约锁定要转出的资产（该交易中包含选标信息），中标的 Router 监测到该交易之后，向目标账本的交易管理合约锁定用户应得数量的资产（用户应得资产数量与系统中的总流动性分布有关，稍后说明）；\n\n* Step3 ：完成（Fulfill）\n\n用户提供签名，获得 Router 在目标账本上锁定的资产，Router 使用用户公开的签名信息，解锁用户在源账本上锁定的资产。为了避免用户切换钱包，其他的非中标 Router 会提供中继服务，用户并不需要亲自去目标链提供签名以解锁资产，而是可以将签名信息发送给中继 Router，并由中继 Router 在目标链上代为解锁。中继 Router 也会收取少量手续费。\n\n![0 (9).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/004cb758c4875cc68b77c8155bb24c6b_n0YSpBC.png-article)\n\nNXTP 中的 Router 与 cBridge 中的中继节点承担了相同的作用，不同之处在于，前者是自定义其服务价格并向用户竞标的，而后者的服务价格则由协议统一规定并通过治理调整。\n\n值得一提的是， NXTP 的流动性提供存在虚拟 AMM 机制，这意味着用户在源账本上付出 1 个 USDC，在目标账本上获得的，可能不是（1 - r）个 USDC ( 设手续费为 r ) ，而可能是（0.99-r）或是（1.02-r），具体的数值取决于源账本与目标账本上的总流动性比值。这样设计的目的是**增加一个负反馈机制，促进 Router 根据需求平衡不同账本上的流动性**。\n\n截至发文，NXTP 还在审计中，NXTP 发布后，将首先实现对以太坊、Optimism、Arbitrum One、BSC、xDAI、Polygon、Fantom Opera 的支持。\n\n> [connext 介绍文档](https://docs.connext.network/)\n\n**StarkEx Bridge**\n\nStarkWare 是一家零知识证明研发机构，也是 ZK Rollup 二层网络 StarkNet 的开发者。StarkEx 则是 StarkWare 为 StarkNet 开发的扩展性工具集，其中就包括 StarkEx Bridge。\n\nStarkEx 目前服务模式是 L2 as a Service，支持其他项目利用 StarkNet 技术，构建自己独立的 L2 网络，目前 StarkEx 的客户包括 Immutable X，DyDx，DeversiFi ，三者都在 StarkNet 的支持下搭建了自己的 L2 网络。因此，StarkEx Bridge 首先要解决的只是 StarkEx 生态内的 L2 网络的跨层交易问题，然后才会逐步扩展为适配所有 L2 的解决方案。\n\nStarkEx Bridge 采用了类似 Connext 的条件交易机制，通过该机制实现无信任的跨层原子交易。StarkEx Bridge 上有专门的 LiquidProvider (LP) 作为公共交易对手，提供流动性。其过程如下：\n\n▸ StarkEx L2→L1\n\n* Step1 : Alice 在 L2 向 LP 发起 1 ETH + 手续费的条件转账 T(X)，条件是 T(Y)：LP 在 L1 向 Alice 付款 1 ETH，在 T(Y) 生效前，T(X) 状态为 \\[invalid\\]；\n* Step2：LP 签署 T(Y)，在 L1 上向 Alice 付款，Alice 立即可在 L1 使用该资金，LP 拿到 T(Y) 的生效证明；\n* Step3：LP 使用 T(Y) 的生效证明，更新 T(X) 状态，T(X)\\[invalid\\] 转化为 T(X)\\[Valid\\] ；\n* Step4 ：LP 通知 L2 节点打包 T(X)\\[Valid\\] 到零知识证明批次中，该批次抵达 L1 并被验证时，LP 正式拿到 Alice 的付款。\n\n![0 (7).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/1d555f2e8d40532eac1819e9911f62d7_PROYM1s.png-article)\n\n▸ StarkEx L2→ StarkEx L2\n\n* Step1：Alice 在 L2-1 中向 LP 发起 1 ETH + 手续费 的条件转账_T(X)*，触发条件设为_T(Y)*: LP 将 1 ETH 转到 Alice 的 L2-2 账户。在_T(Y)_生效之前，_T(X)_为 \\[invalid\\] 状态 ；\n* Step2：LP 签署_T(Y)_，在 L2-2 上向 Alice 付款 1 ETH，该交易立即生效，Alice 立即可在 L2-2 使用该资金；\n* Step3：_T(Y)_被 L2-2 节点打包到零知识证明批次中，提交给 L1 并被 L1 验证，LP 拿到_T(Y)_在 L1 的生效证明 ；\n* Step4：LP 使用_T(Y)*的生效证明，更新_T(X)_状态，_T(X) \\[invalid\\]_转化为_T(X)\\[Valid\\]*；\n* Step5：LP 通知 L2-1 节点打包_T(X)\\[Valid\\]_到零知识证明批次中，该批次抵达 L1 并被验证时，LP 正式拿到了 Alice 的付款。\n\n![0 (6).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/395e0faffa165c3986b0277ae6d49f45_BTeKEMX.png-article)\n\n注意：上述描述对条件交易过程进行了简化，事实上，如果要创建以 T(Y) 作为触发条件的 T(X) ，T(Y) 需要先被创建，只是处于未签署状态，或者可以称为 invalid 状态。可以将创建 T(Y)\\[Invalid\\] ，理解为一笔 Lock 操作。另外，StarkEx L2 作为非独立的状态机，一切交易的生效与否都以被 L1 验证为准。\n\n我们发现，与 Connext 不同，\\*\\*StarkEx Bridge 采用了一种非对称的原子交易设计，用户可以立即拿到资产，但 LP 却需要等待一段时间，等到 LP 对用户的付款信息通过原始通道抵达，才能解锁用户的付款。\\*\\*这个等待时间不会太长，大约 1 小时左右。这个等待时间就是 LP 的资金占压成本。\n\nStarkWare 还提供了 StarkNet L2⇄侧链 的快速交易通道，流程与 StarkNet L2→ StarkNet L2 大体相似。\n\nStarkWare 认为，ZK Rollup 相比 Op Rollup，有一个重要的优势：Zk Rollup 的跨层快速通道，对于 LP 而言，具有更优的资金效率，而 Op Rollup 的跨层快速通道，LP 的资金占压达 7 天之久，资金效率更低，这会转化为昂贵的流动性手续费。\n\n> StarkEx Bridge 介绍：\n>\n>

<https://medium.com/starkware/a-trustless-sidechain-to-starkex-bridge-secured-by-ethereum-61e00f19f7e0>\n\n**小结**\n\n我们发现，**原子交易型的跨层快速资产桥，设计的关键点在于如何避免要求用户切换钱包操作**，cBridge、NXTP、StarkEx Bridge 采用了不同的设计。\n\ncBridge 选择将原子交易的执行顺序进行微调，NXTP 则选择让 中继 Router 代替用户去目标账本解锁资产。\n\nStarkEx Bridge 则进行了更彻底的改变：cBridge、NXTP 的原子交易都是让用户的转账触发流动性提供商的转账，而 StarkEx 则交换了两者，让 LP 的转账触发用户的转账，并让触发过程走原始通道，这样一来用户可以先拿到钱，而且不用手动去操作为 LP 付款的事情。\n\n#### 见证人型跨层快速资产桥\n\n除了原子交易型，还有一些跨层快速资产桥采用了以见证人为中心的设计方案。见证人可能是单一职能的角色，也可能兼任了流动性提供者的角色。见证人可能是非信任式（需要抵押）的，也可能是信任式（无须抵押）的。我们通过项目举例来说明：\n\n**Hop Exchange**\n\nHop Exchange，也称 Hop Protocol，由 Authereum 钱包团队打造，其创始人是以太坊编程语言 Solidity 的开发者之一 Chris Whinfrey。Authereum 团队在开发该钱包的时候发现了当时以太坊对于扩容的紧迫性，所以将精力转移至了 L2 相关的设施中。\n\nHop Exchange 设计了一个媒介通证：hToken，例如 hWETH，hDAI，hUSDC，并在各个支持的 L2 上部署了 hToken:Token 的 AMM 兑换池。\n\nHop Exchange 中见证人角色被称为 Bonder ，中文可译为连接者。Bonder 是实现快速提款和快速交易的流动性垫付者，也是在 Layer 之间传递消息的中间人。Bonder 要在 L1 上抵押原生 Token，以获得在 L2 上铸造对应的 hToken 的额度。（此处注意，只是获得额度，并不是 L1 抵押原生 Token ，立即在 L2 生成 hToken ）。\n\n下文我们将在 USDC 为例\n\n* 依照当前系统设置，设 AMM 流动池手续费 0.3%\n* 依照当前系统设置，设 Bonder 提供的垫付服务手续费为 0.2%\n* 假设 AMM 流动池是绝对平衡的，1 USDC 始终兑换 1 hUSDC\n* 暂且忽略批量交易机制\n\n的情况下，阐述 Hop Exchange 的系统设计。\n\n▸ L2→L1\n\n当 Alice 需要从 L2 快速提款 1000 USDC 到 L1 时，需要经历以下过程：\n\n* Step1：Alice 通过 L2 上的 AMM 兑换池，将 1000 USDC 兑换为 997 个 hUSDC；\n* Step2：Alice 通过 L2 的 HopBridgeContract (下文简称 HBC)，在 L2 上销毁 997 hUSDC，设该交易为 X；\n* Step3：Bonder 监听到交易 X，在 L1 上从自己的抵押金里垫付 995 USDC 给 Alice ，Alice 在 L1 上拿到 995 USDC，对于 Alice 而言，交易已完成；\n* Step4：交易 X 被提交到 L1，通过欺诈证明或零知识证明，被 L1 验证；\n* Step5：L1 的 HBC 获取到交易 X 已被完成的信息，向 Bonder 归还 997 USDC。\n\n▸ L2⇄L2\n\n当 Alice 需要将 L2-1 上的 1000 USDC ，转移到 L2-2 上时，需要经过以下过程：\n\n* Step1：Alice 使用 L2-1 上的 AMM 兑换池，将 1000 USDC 兑换成 997 hUSDC；\n* Step2：Alice 调用 L2-1 上的 HBC，销毁 997 hUSDC，设该交易为 X；\n* Step3：Bonder 监听到交易 X，使用自己的 hUSDC 铸造额度，调用 L2-2 上的 HBC，为 Alice 铸造 995 hUSDC，Alice 将 995hUSDC，在 AMM 池中兑换为 992 USDC，此时，对 Alice 而言，交易已完成；\n* Step4：交易 X 被传回 L1 ，经过欺诈证明或零知识证明，被 L1 验证；\n* Step5：Bonder 监听到被验证的交易 X，同步给 L2-2 上的节点；（为了加快速度，Hop Exchange 建议 Bonder 自己运行 L2 节点）。\n* Step6：L2-2 节点验证后，L2-2 上的 HBC 为 Bonder 铸造 997 hUSDC。\n\n**批量处理机制**\n\n如果每一笔兑换的流动性归还步骤，都需要走一遍 L1 的话，会耗费很多 Gas，所以 Hop Exchange 实际上是批量处理流动性归还的。系统会收集一段时间内的垫付，再把流动性归还的需求打包为一个 Transfer Root 处理，代价是 Bonder 的回款周期会延长一些。\n\n**理解 Bonder 的见证人性质**\n\nBonder 在提供垫付服务时，事实上充当了见证人的角色，因为垫付是提前发生的，早于目标账本自身对来自源账本的交易有效性验证。因此为了完成垫付，源账本上的交易会首先由 Bonder 进行监听和验证，并传递给目标账本上的 HBC。倘若恶意的 Bonder 向目标账本传递虚假交易，则可能造成不正确的垫付。\n\nBonder 在 L1 上的抵押金不光是其在 L2 铸造 hToken 的额度，也是其忠实履行职责的保证金。Hop Exchange 设定了专门的挑战者（Challenge Watcher），一旦发现 Bonder 的欺诈行为，Bonder 的抵押金将被没收，变成给挑战者的赏金。\n\n**AMM 与再平衡机制**\n\nHop Exchange 会在所有支持的 L2 上部署 AMM 兑换池，任何人都可以往兑换池里注入 hToken:Token 的流动性，以赚取兑换手续费。由于 hToken 和原生 Token 的价格属性是基本一致的，Hop Exchange 在 AMM 中选择使用类似于 Curve 的 Stablecoin 价格曲线，减小滑点。尽管如此，hToken 和 原生 Token 可能还是会存在微弱的价差，这当中会有套利者的空间。套利者并不是 Hop Exchange 当中的正式系统角色，任何人都可以充当套利者。套利者的存在将使得 hUSDC 和 USDC 的价格基本保持平衡。\n\n与 StarkEx Bridge 相似，Hop Exchange 也设计了一个不对称的系统，让用户可以立即获得资金，但让流动性提供者，也就是 Bonder 的，等待通过原始通道拿到回款。\n\n![0 (10).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/d865e6d7997050339d565206f4ab042c_aYLRCQo.png-article)\n\nhToken+AMM 的设计是相对复杂的， 但 Hop Exchange 的前端界面上努力做到简洁，让用户几乎可以不用感知 hToken 和 AMM 兑换过程的存在。\n\nhToken + AMM 的引入，事实上降低了整体的资金效率，因为 AMM 中的流动性是需要额外占压资金的。Hop Protocol 之所以采取这样的设计，是出于技术性的考量，这样做可以避免去维护一个 L2 上的资产合约清单，详细的解释，可以参考 [这篇文章](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/404296680)。\n\nHop Exchange 目前已支持以太坊主网与 Arbitrum、Optimism、xDai Chain、Polygon 的跨层兑换。\n\n> [Hop Exchange 白皮书](https://hop.exchange/whitepaper.pdf)\n\n**Hyphen (Biconomy)**\n\nHyphen 是由 Biconomy 推出的跨层快速资产桥。Hyphen 目前的开发还处于早期阶段，仅支持 Ethereum 和 Polygon。\n\nHyphen 将 LiquidtiyPoolManager 合约（后文简称 LPM 合约）部署在所有受支持的账本上。LPM 合约中存储了所有的流动性。任何人都可以向 LPM 合约中存款来提供流动性，提供流动性的人我们称之为 LP ，LP 将获得流动性费用。\n\n用户需要跨层转账时，只需在源账本将资产存入 LPM 合约，Hyphen 网络的执行节点（Executor Node）会监听存入事件，并转发给目标链上的 LPM 合约，目标链上的 LPM 合约接收到之后，就会释放资产到用户提供的目标链地址。执行节点并不需要提供流动性，所有流动性都在 LPM 合约中，并通过 AMM 机制调节兑换价格比。但这个 AMM 机制有点特别，一个交易对的两种资产不在一条链上，AMM 想要计算出价格，还需要执行节点来提供另一种种资产的储备量。\n\nHyphen 的特色功能是：用户在源账本和目标账本上需要支付的 Gas，都会由 Hyphen 网络统一代付，并折算为用户要兑换的资产类型向用户收取。用户在目标账本收到的金额，将会是 源账本上的金额-源账本 Gas 费-目标账本 Gas 费-给执行节点的手续费-给 LP 的流动性费用。这样做的好处是，用户可以在没有 ETH 的情况下进行兑换，而且可以清晰的看到兑换的总成本。\n\n我们发现 Hyphen 的设计极其简洁，通过 Hyphen 进行跨账本转账也非常迅速，可以在几秒内完成。但我们细心留意，也可以发现，Hyphen 的设计，包含了对执行节点的信任假设，是一种相对中心化的方案。\n\n> [Hyphen 介绍文档](https://docs.biconomy.io/products/hyphen-instant-cross-chain-transfers)\n\n**Degate Bridge**\n\nDegate 的目标是创造一个更强大的 Uniswap，打造一个功能丰富程度可以比肩中心化交易所的去中心化交易所。Degate 将通过各个模块，分别支持 AMM 交易、订单薄交易、杠杆交易、跨层交易等功能。Degate Bridge 是 Degate 用以实现跨层快速交易的模块。\n\n![0 (11).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/d47dbe090e135b8cbd695fa8e1e765fe_zm5muyR.png-article)\n\nDegate Home DAO 作为单个主体，承担见证人的角色，并以其锁定的资产作为担保。此外，Degate Bridge 的流动性是放在链下的，由 Degate Home DAO 直接在源账本上接收用户资产，并在目标账本上向用户输出资产。Degate 设置了虚拟 AMM 机制，采用类似 Curve 的 Stablecoin 自动做市曲线。\n\nDeGate 在白皮书中表示，当以太坊生态出现服务于 L2→L1 消息传递的成熟预言机服务后，DeGate Bridge 将依托该预言机服务，实现去中心化的跨层兑换服务。\n\nDegate 的开发还在早期阶段，仅支持了 以太坊 和 Arbitrum 之间的跨层交易。\n\n> [Degate 白皮书](https://common-resource.degate.com/doc/whitepaper_cn.pdf)\n\n**Optimism DAI Bridge ( MakerDAO )**\n\n为了扩大 DAI 的使用，MakerDAO 正在逐步推动在 L2 部署 DAI 的合约，目前已经在 Optimism 上部署，与此同步推出的是名为 Optimism DAI Bridge 的桥接器，该桥接器将支持 Optimism 上的 DAI （称为 oDAI）到 Ethereum DAI 的快速提款。\n\nOptimism DAI Bridge 本质上是依赖于一个中心化的预言机（Oracle）在 L1 和 L2 之间传递消息，来实现快速提款的。\n\n当用户需要把 oDAI ，提现为 L1 上的 DAI 的时候，会经历这样的过程。\n\n* Step1：用户在 L2 上通过 DAI Bridge 合约，销毁 oDAI；\n* Step2：Maker Oracle 将销毁信息从 L2 传递给 L1 的 DAI Bridge 合约，L1 的 DAI Bridge 合约为用户铸造 fDAI；\n* Step3：用户拿到 fDAI 之后，可以选择在 7 天（挑战期）后到 MakerDAO 的财政库中兑换 DAI，也可以选择拿 fDAI 作抵押，从 Maker 财政库借出 DAI (借出数量＜抵押数量)，当抵押的 fDAI 过了挑战期，债务将被自动结算。\n\n%% 注意：没有 fDAI:DAI 的 AMM 兑换池，因为考虑到在不同时间的操作中获得的 fDAI 挑战期到期时间不同，fDAI 被设计为了 NFT。\n\n![0 (12).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/ea2a671a3c715ab0baaf7d8b545ebc47_TQoNsmD.png-article)\n\nOptimism DAI Bridge 尽管只支持 DAI 这一种资产的跨层兑换，但是以 DAI 为媒介，也可以实现其他资产的跨层兑换，不过，那样做在 Gas 费上不占优势。\n\n> Optimism DAI Bridge 介绍资料\n>\n> <https://forum.makerdao.com/t/announcing-the-optimism-dai-bridge-with-fast-withdrawals/6938>\n>\n> <https://github.com/makerdao/optimism-dai-bridge>\n\n**小结**\n\n以上，我们介绍了四个采用见证人机制的跨层快速资产桥项目。在 Hop Exchange、Hyphen、Degate Bridge、 Optimism DAI Bridge 中，见证人分别是 Bonder、执行节点、Degate Home DAO 和 Maker Oracle。其中，Bonder 的信誉来自于抵押，执行节点、Degate Home DAO 的信誉来自于链下商誉，包含了信任假设，Maker Oracle 则比较特别，如果 Maker Oracle 行为不当，承受损失的是 DAI 财政库，也就是 MKR 的持有者，相当于 MKR 持有者替 Maker Oracle 作了担保抵押。\n\n在流动性垫付职能方面，Bonder 和 Degate Home DAO 兼任了流动性提供者的功能，执行节点和 Maker Oracle 则只负责传递跨层信息，Hyphen 的流动性提供者是 LP，Optimsm DAI Bridge 的流动性提供者是 DAI 财政库。\n\n**整体上，见证人型快速跨层资产桥和原子交易型相比，做不到无条件信任，但见证人型有更大的开发空间，未来有可能不局限于跨层资产桥，还可以进一步支持任意状态转换的跨层传递，从而支持广义上的跨层互操作。**\n\n#### 跨层快速通道进阶演化：聚合、互操作\n\n前文我们介绍了不同类型的跨层资产桥，那在实际操作中，我们如何选择合适的桥梁呢？我们需要一个工具，能够聚合所有的桥梁，并根据我们的实际需求进行匹配和推荐，这就是 FundMovR 在做的事情。\n\n此外，上述所有跨层资产桥，都只实现了资产兑换的功能，没有实现对跨层互操作的支持。尽管见证人型跨层资产桥有实现跨层互操作的潜力，但尚且没有项目真正实现，DataMovR 正在这个方向布局。\n\nFundMovR 和 DataMovR，都出自同一个项目—— MovR Network，二者是 MovR Network 的两个独立模块。聚合和互操作是跨层快速通道进阶演化的两个重要方向，MovR Network 准确的抓住了这两个方向，可以看出对于赛道的理解非常深刻。\n\n**FundMovR ：跨层快速资产桥聚合器**\n\n跨层资产桥已经足够多了，FundMovR 选择做一个聚合器，将各资产桥聚合起来，并为用户推荐最优路径。由于各跨层资产桥都只支持同质资产的兑换（例如，USDT 只能兑换 USDT，不能兑换其他资产），FundMovR 不光聚合了跨层资产桥，还聚合了各账本上的 Dex ，以便用户可以通过 FundMovR 直接完成异质资产的兑换。\n\n假设 Alice 在 Arbitrum 上有 DAI，但她换成 Optimism 上的 ETH。她可以使用多种路径来实现：\n\n* 路径一：通过 1inch on Arbitrum，把 DAI 换成 ETH ，然后通过 Hop Exchange，把 ETH 从 Arbitrum 换到 Optimism ；\n* 路径二：通过 Paraswap on Arbitrum，把 DAI 换成 ETH ，然后通过 Connext 将 ETH 从 Arbitrum 换到 Optimism；\n* 路径三：通过 Hyphen，把 DAI 从 Arbitrum 换到 Optimism，然后通过 Uniswap on Optimism，把 DAI 换成 ETH ；\n* 路径四：通过 cBridge，把 DAI 从 Arbitrum 换到 Optimism ，然后通过 Sushiswap on Optimism， 把 DAI 换成 ETH。\n* 还有更多路径 ……\n\n对于不同的需求，上述路径可能各有千秋。假设兑换资金量很大，那么含有 AMM 机制的 Hyphen、Hop 会不可取，因为滑点会比较大，cBridge 会比较合适；假设兑换资金量很小，Gas 将成为主要成本，为了节约 Gas，Hop Exchange 可能是更好的选择；假设 Alice 对速度的要求是最优先的，那么采用中心化方式的 Hyphen 和 Degate Bridge 会更有优势；至于 DEX 兑换环节，是在源账本 Arbitrum 上完成，还是在目标账本 Optimism 完成，取决于哪边流动性更大，滑点更低。\n\n如果没有 FundMovR，上述权衡和考量，将由 Alice 自己完成。但通过 FundMovR ，系统会自动找到所有可用的路线，并分别以下面三条标准进行排序：\n\n* 目标链上的最大输出\n* 最低 Gas 费用\n* 最短时间\n\nAlice 只需轻松的选择她喜欢的选项，剩下的就交给 FundMovR。\n\n在有一定规模用户之后，FundMovR 还将推出**点对点结算层**，以实现更低成本的跨链交换。\n\n假设 Alice 想将 100 DAI 从 Optimism 转移到 Arbitrum，而 Bob 想将 50 DAI 从 Arbitrum 转移到 Optimism。FundMovR 将相互清算 DAI，并将剩余的 50 个 DAI 从 Optimism 转移到 Arbitrum。\n\n![0 (13).png](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/95cea96ceb515eb1ad04f90f677a0c2c_BoC12O6.png-article)\n\n对于跨层部署的 Dapp，桥接功能是其必要组成部分。Dapp 开发人员希望构建内置的桥接器，为用户提供无缝的用户体验。FundMovR 通过 SDK 和 API 使 Dapp 开发人员可以轻松集成 FundMovR，以实现内置的效果，例如，像 Aave、Instadapp 等 Dapp 可以轻松地允许用户从不同 L2 迁移用户抵押资金。\n\n**DataMovR 跨层互操作通用组件**\n\nDataMovR 将允许任意形式的状态转换跨层传递，这意味着 DataMovR 将支持任意形式的跨层互操作。DataMovR 有两个独立的组件，分别是负责消息传递的 MMF(MovR Messaging Framework)，和负责先于 L1，快速验证 L2 状态的一个见证人网络，该网络被称为 Finality Gadget （终结器）。\n\n与 FundMovR 相同，DataMovR 也将被开发为一个可内置于 Dapp 的模块。导入该模块的 Dapp 将在免于自己开发的前提下实现跨层互操作。例如：\n\n* Yearn Finance 可以在诸多的 L1，L2，乃至侧链上，寻找最优的收益率，并在此基础上采取行动；\n* 可以允许用户在 Arbitrum 上的 Aave 销毁 aToken，并在 Optimism 上的 Aave 上提取质押；\n* Uniswap 可以支持 LP 跨层快速挪动流动性，以实现各层价格的均衡。\n\nDataMovR SDK 将帮助 Dapp 在各 Layer 上部署的合约可以相互通信，以实现以上用例。\n\n更进一步，DataMovR 还有野心实现跨 Dapp 的跨层互操作，例如让用户可将 Aave on Optimism 当中的抵押品挪动到 Uniswap on Arbitrum 中提供流动性，或是让用户将 Compound on Arbitrum 的抵押品挪动到 Aave on Polygon。这点的实现，有赖于足够多的 Dapp 内置了 DataMobR SDK。\n\n关于 DataMovR 的更多技术细节，MovR Network 暂时没有披露更多，Paka Labs 将持续关注。\n\n#### 跨层快速通道与泛 EVM 网络\n\n2021 年以来，业界对以太坊扩容的努力方向发生转向，人们放弃了对改进以太坊本身的期待，而是将目光投向了 L2 和 EVM 兼容链，相关项目喷发式出现：\n\nOp Rollup 日趋成熟，主流 DeFi 项目陆续开始向之迁移；拥有巨大用户体量加持的 HECO，BSC 被构建为了以太坊的高性能侧链；EAR、Fantom、Avalanche、Substrate 等以底层创新著名的区块链也快速地加入了 EVM 版图；进展最慢的兼容 EVM 的 Zk Rollup 也呼之欲出。\n\n一个以 Ethereum 为中心的，众多 L2、EVM 兼容链组成的泛 EVM 多链网络已逐渐形成。尽管 EVM 的执行效率低于 WASM，但是在巨大的惯性力量和成熟的 DeFi 代码库的加持下，EVM 依旧凝聚起来了最大的势能。\n\n**在这样一个泛 EVM 多链网络中，跨层快速资产桥是其重要基础设施，也是其不可或缺的一部分。快速通道将承担大多数的资产交易，原始通道只负责流动性的结算，释放以太坊的压力。除此之外，我们更加期待，快速资产桥演变为快速互操作桥，让整个泛 EVM 生态的 DeFi 连为一体，产生乐高效应。**\n\n当然，我们也得认识到，泛 EVM 网络或许还不是以太坊生态演化的终局，还有很多其他方向的尝试，例如 Celer 开发的 Layer2.Finance 和 StarkWare 开发的 Caspin 正在尝试在不割裂 L1 流动性的情况下进行原地扩容，Polygon 则正在开发以自身为中枢的 EVM 分片网络，ETH2.0 虽然要等待很久，但终究会来，到时候，以太坊生态会是什么样，犹未可知，让我们拭目以待。\n\n### 本篇小结\n\n本文列举了两大跨链应用形态，分别是「BTC 锚定资产」和「跨层快速通道」。我们分析了两者的技术本质，并根据其核心技术特征，进行了分类，在分类的基础上，结合项目举例进行了深入分析。至此，我们在对跨链技术有全景式框架认知的技术上，对「BTC 锚定资产」和「跨层快速通道」两大应用形态进行了纵深探究。在后续的篇目中，我们将对更多的应用形态进行举例分析。\n\n本文已描述分析以下技术方案：\n\n* BTC 锚定资产\n  * 信任式\n    * RBTC/LBTC/WBTC/BTCB/HBTC/XBTC\n  * 非信任式\n    * tBTC/renBTC/eBTC/InterBTC\n* 以太坊跨层快速资产桥\n  * 原子交易型\n    * cBridge/Connext/StarEx Bridge\n  * 见证人型\n    * Hop Exchange/Hyphen/Degate Bridge\n  * 进阶演化\n    * FundMovR/DataMovR\n\n本文的案例选取仅从技术方案的代表性角度考量，不含推广目的，亦不作为投资建议。如果您发现文中所写的内容与实际的情况不符，或者对本文观点存在不同的理解，欢迎关注 PAKA Labs 公众号并留言，非常期待与您交流。\n\n*感谢 Nic Lin @imtoken 在本文写作过程中提供的帮助。*", "timestamp": 1635338945,

联合创始人张中南深入探讨元宇宙的基本模式与具体使用场景。\n\n**整理：万向区块链**\n\n10 月 27 日，第七届万向区块链全球峰会上，rct AI 联合创始人兼总裁吴显昆（主持人）、The Sandbox 首席运营官兼联合创始人 Sebastien Borget、AlchemyNFT CEO 兼联合创始人张中南共同探讨了热门的元宇宙，对元宇宙的潜在应用场景、商业模式进行了具体解读。以下为文字内容整理：\n\n\n***\n\n![The Sandbox 与 AlchemyNFT 探讨元宇宙应用场景与商业模式](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/675387015c3e54a3ae35b8b2c0e83504.jpeg-article)\n\n\\*\\*吴显昆（主持人）：\\*\\*女士们、先生们，各位下午好！非常感谢各位参与到下午的圆桌讨论，我的名字是吴显昆，今天我来到了舞台上，这属于 2021 第七届区块链全球峰会最后一个圆桌讨论环节，各位嘉宾会讨论具体的使用场景、元宇宙的基本模式。\n\n我们邀请到了业界两个创新领袖，一位是 The Sandbox 的 COO 和联合创始人 Sebastien Borget。\n\n以及 Alchemy NFT 的 CEO 和联合创始人张中南，请两位先跟各位观众打招呼，**简单介绍一下自己和各自所在的项目**。\n\n\\*\\*Sebastien Borget：\\*\\*大家好！我叫 Sebastien Borget，我是 The Sandbox 的 COO 和联合创始人。The Sandbox 的中文名叫《沙盒》，它是一个游戏工具、游戏平台，可以让用户和游戏玩家能够获得 NFT，并且在虚拟的土地上将情景使用或者变现。\n\n同时，我也是区块链游戏联名的主席，现在区块链游戏联盟一共有 250 个成员，主要是推动区块链游戏技术的应用、区块链技术的应用，比如说 NFT、DAO 等等，主要是在游戏行业对技术的力推。谢谢！\n\n\\*\\*张中南：\\*\\*各位好！我的名字是张中南，Alchemy NFT 是属于我们的项目之一，主要是在今年年初的时候正式开发的，过去几年间一直从事 NFT。一共发了超过 30 个和 NFT 相关的项目，还有包括 2018 等等，还有最近的一些项目。\n\n另外还有以太坊，基金会在接下来开发者大会的项目，另外还有一些 Token、会员积分的 NFT 项目。我的目标是给 NFT 赋予更多的功能性，通过智能合约和非智能合约实现这一点。\n\n\\*\\*吴显昆（主持人）：\\*\\*自我介绍一下，我是 rct AI 的联合创始人和总裁，主要是做智能 AI，从而实现真正动态个性化的元宇宙体验。\n\n就像是电影，我们有世界上第一个女娲 NFT 收藏，很快会推加密原生的 3A 游戏大作。今天的圆桌一共有 40 分钟的时间，时间有限，话不多说，直奔主题。\n\n在我们进行元宇宙探讨之前，首先对于元宇宙进行定义。\n\n请两位给出**元宇宙的定义**，您自己对于元宇宙的定义。换言之，如何给十岁小孩儿介绍元宇宙的概念，请 Sebastien Borget 先回答。\n\n\\*\\*Sebastien Borget：\\*\\*对我们来说，元宇宙代表一种概念，这种概念是来自于科幻小说和电影。本质上的概念在于人类终有一天能够在数字平行宇宙通过虚拟形象实现现在的各种体验，虚拟形象代表的是数字世界中的个人身份。\n\n相信的是开放的元宇宙，意思是将会有成百上千的虚拟世界，在虚拟世界中用户拥有数字身份、数字资产，并且数字身份、数字资产能够在各个虚拟世界中进行可迁移性、可携带性，另外还在虚拟世界中有各种各样的活动，包括可以工作，可以打游戏，通过对于 NFT 和对于虚拟形象的所有权来实现。\n\nThe Sandbox 对元宇宙的贡献是提供各种各样不同的娱乐体验，包括虚拟演出、虚拟博物馆、游戏体验。我们也希望用户可以通过拥有一部分虚拟土地来拥有元宇宙，而且他们也能够从自己创造的内容中进行变现，感谢！\n\n\\*\\*张中南：\\*\\*对于 Sebastien Borget 所说的元宇宙定义，我从另一个角度分享我对元宇宙的认识。\n\n我觉得元宇宙代表数字世界，现在是通过计算机、浏览器、不同应用、不同技术元素在访问数字世界，但是对于元宇宙和其他的数字世界，或者数字世界其他部分，这两者之间的根本差别在于访问的方式、能够获得的体验以及开放性。\n\n比如说刚刚 Sebastien Borget 已经就开放性进行了解释，相信各位也能够理解开放世界的意思就是你的数字资产能够在不同平台上跨平台转移，在元宇宙里、不同的虚拟世界里虚拟资产可以跨世界的转移。\n\n大多数元宇宙都会提供 VR 体验，通过这些设备能够获得交互沉浸式的体验。这和一般手机端、网页端的应用不太一样了。从用户体验的角度来说，由于 VR 能够提供对用户而言全新截然不同的深度沉浸式体验，这就是对元宇宙的一种理解方式。\n\n另外还有另外一种理解方式，元宇宙相当于在新的地方，在新的世界里人们可以创造，也可以进行内容的消费，除此之外人们之间也可以彼此交互。\n\n内容会成为传播最快的资产类别，有游戏、音乐、图片、文章，这些内容都会作为元宇宙里传播最快的资产类别，并且取得积极发展。\n\n\\*\\*吴显昆（主持人）：\\*\\*展望十年，未来元宇宙会出现怎样的发展？对各位来说元宇宙是想进行下一代尝试的最好方式，至少我的女儿可以很快理解元宇宙的概念，各位都提到了访问方面的开放性，就这个问题进一步探讨，**元宇宙和区块链之间的关系是什么，大家觉得二者之间是别无二致的，只是说区块链是实现元宇宙的基础设施吗？**\n\n\\*\\*Sebastien Borget：\\*\\*对，区块链代表的是技术、基础设施，提供透明度，提供共享数据，也就是说没有单一的公司，没有单一的实体组织能够控制资产、用户数据。\n\n而 NFT 代表下一步的发展，NFT 定义了数字资产在虚拟世界中到底如何普及，同时在区块链中如何进行存储。比如说有一些源数据，包括链接，链接可以链至其他内容、视频。有两点非常重要：一是记录，所有权的记录；二是创造，创造的记录，这个内容到底是由谁创造的，当前是由谁所拥有的。另外，由于 NFT 的稀缺性，所以可能会考虑 NFT 到底会存在多少副本，未来是否还会有额外的增发？围绕着数字资产发展数字经济。\n\n从本质上来说，使得 NFT 能进行价值的存储，而且提供功能性，使得人们基于现有的区块链基础设施搭建额外的内容层和应用层。\n\n\\*\\*吴显昆（主持人）：\\*\\*Victor。\n\n\\*\\*张中南：\\*\\*接着 Sebastien Borget 的解释来说，同时就着第一个问题所提出的开放性概念进一步扩展发散一下。\n\n用区块链可以将在元宇宙的所有权进行记录，什么意思呢？在区块链之前，也可以拥有不同虚拟世界、不同数字世界，但是当时的问题在于不同虚拟世界如果要彼此之间交互需要合作的话，必须要有交互性的平台，或者彼此之间必须进行对接。\n\n要么通过第三方进行对接，要么彼此之间对接，需要第三方或平台作为受信任的第三方实现平台之间的对接。\n\n但是，区块链的出现，虚拟世界有同样受信任的第三方，受信任的第三方本质就是区块链，区块链能够将数字世界里的数字资产所有权在同一个地方进行记录，然后这些数字资产就可以在不同的虚拟世界进行自由流通和使用，并且最终能够形成大的元宇宙。\n\n\\*\\*吴显昆（主持人）：\\*\\*感谢 Victor。现在探讨下一个话题，有关于文化。随着元宇宙的发展，各位觉得元宇宙和现实世界关系将会发生怎样的演变？换言之，如何思考进一步深入元宇宙的探索，增加对元宇宙的投入将如何改变人们在现实生活中的生活。\n\nSebastien Borget：确实从现实世界中有一些文化、品牌、IP 都是熟悉的。现在进入到元宇宙新的世界，而这个世界完全就是从 UGC （用户产生内容）所构建的，99% 都是由用户自己的内容所构建的，也就是是由想象力构建的。除此范围内，很多社区的想法、创意都能共享。\n\n让我觉得很高兴的一点是元宇宙里看到的各种创意，比如说一开始的时候看到的元宇宙引爆点是 Beeple 一幅 NFT 的画作拍卖拍出了几百万美元，激励很多创作者、艺术家，所以现在大家也在元宇宙里打造不同的虚拟头像、虚拟形象，建立社区。\n\n我觉得新的元宇宙文化和现实世界文化是不一样的，它代表的是加密原生一种文化。而这带来了创作者经济，创作者经济代表着人们对于内容拥有所有权，在交互过程中可以对内容进行分享。\n\n其实这正好会带来一些新的收入机会、新的工作机会。比如说你可以创作内容，把你创作的内容进行销售，因为你可以成为元宇宙的参与者，而且可以通过创作内容、玩游戏获得额外的收入来源。\n\n现在元宇宙所提供的种种可能性在传统的游戏和娱乐行业是我们看不到的，尤其是现实世界由于疫情造成了各种各样的问题。\n\n\\*\\*张中南：\\*\\*我觉得在现实世界中，看起来经济已经发展到了某个阶段、某个地步。要么进一步对资源进行攫取，要么创造新的东西让人们来消费。但在数字世界事情可以有另外一个走向，也就是元宇宙的发展。\n\n正如刚刚 Sebastien Borget 提到的，元宇宙是能够提供新的就业机会、新的商机。\n\n我自己在这里有一些切切实实的例子想跟大家分享，几个月之前和以太坊开发大会进行了合作，一块儿做了活动，要搭建多功能大厅。在搭建的过程中找了专业的设计师团队帮我们进行设计，也找了专业的团队帮助我们打造 VR 多功能厅，在虚拟世界、数字世界里进行打造。\n\n这样的例子代表着新的商机，新的工作机会，对于那些有才之士来说，如果他们能够进行设计、进行创作的话。\n\n\\*\\*Sebastien Borget：\\*\\*日益蓬勃的趋势是很多用户现在进入到了元宇宙感受元宇宙，这些人会在元宇宙搭建创作不同的东西，在元宇宙里进行自我展示。随着越来越多的人进入，他们也会带来其他更多的用户进入，更多的用户进入就会生成更多的内容，自此生态蓬勃发展。\n\n像《沙盒》游戏类的元宇宙也带来了很多游戏用户的进入。\n\n\\*\\*吴显昆（主持人）：\\*\\*对我们来说要投入大量的时间和精力，因此打造可持续的元宇宙这一点变得至关重要了。在 Web2.0 的各种场景中，Web2.0 是被滥用、被误用，比如说对于隐私的保护是不够的，数字数据的所有权其实被算法滥用了，用户受害了。\n\n打造可持续元宇宙的过程中，如何保证它变成为公共福祉而服务的东西，而非造成公众损害，如何评判元宇宙是否能为公众带来更多的价值呢？\n\n\\*\\*Sebastien Borget：\\*\\*过去 25 年间看到各种 UGC 用户创作的内容，同时也看到各种各样的虚拟世界内容创作及各种各样的活动。\n\n治理非常重要，用户应该是关键的决策者。元宇宙的治理方式像新的数字国度一样，也可能会有政治的身份存在，各位可能未来会看到政党及相关用户会被推选出来代表其他用户的利益。\n\n我们从核心保证用户拥有自己的数据，用户可以自行决定是否要把数据分享给他人。而且在未来的三到五年间，正确的方向应该是开源，在元宇宙《沙盒》里，最开始是中心化的治理方式、中心化的运营方式，逐渐个人可以在完全开源的环境里进行自由开发与部署，就像 NFT 代表的是可以和元宇宙有关联的绑定资产。\n\n商业模式和中心化平台也不一样，作为用户在中心化平台的价值是被平台变现了，但是在元宇宙里你有自己的地址、钱包、NFT，通过购买和进行 NFT 的交易，整个链条中交易链条怎么样的，在这种模式里不会有隐藏的大家看不到的变现元素，在未来更多将会是社区推动，而且将会改变过去 25 年比较熟悉的方式，这意味着会给用户更多的机会，给用户额外的收入来源，我非常乐观元宇宙将会以不同的方式进行搭建，而且将不会面临之前的问题。\n\n\\*\\*张中南：\\*\\*我试着从另外一个角度来解读，如果说元宇宙就像一个世界的话，这样的世界意味着可能会有好的数字世界，也会有坏的数字世界，人们可能倾向于在好数字世界里互动，也就是说它不是被一党一方控制的，将会像宇宙一样，在宇宙里有不同的行星，所有行星都不是为任何一个国家所拥有的，但是对于数字世界来说，这样的世界将会更加开放，更加像数字物体一样存在。\n\n比如说你有 NFT 的话，在这样的世界里可能通过 NFT 就能够展现它的颜色，但是在其他的世界中，白色的特征可能会变成黄色，你需要把物体在你所拥有的世界里进行交易。\n\n\\*\\*吴显昆（主持人）：\\*\\*刚刚关于元宇宙的观点都非常有趣，我也知道你们两位都在致力于相关项目，**我们应该打造什么样的原生加密元宇宙体验？**\n\n\\*\\*Sebastien Borget：\\*\\*现在正在致力于打造、重塑产品。从 2D 游戏开始切换到 3D 游戏，通过使用区块链。我们所关注的是内容本身，而不是所谓的 NFT。\n\n想要的是如何创建更新以及更不同类型的内容，打造数字 3D 体验。现在有成千上万个 IT 技术人员帮助我们打造客户体验，所以会打造一些非常棒的内容及动画创造沉浸式的游戏环境。\n\n比如说在游戏中，人们可以占领所谓的领地来玩游戏。另外是打造游戏的工具 GameMaker 来打造游戏，现在也有其他的软件工具，帮助游戏玩家更好地获得游戏体验。在这种情况下，使得玩家更好地参与，边玩边赚。\n\n引入了一些基于区块链的应用，给游戏玩家带来更多好玩的东西，跟一些相关品牌合作。在所有链上都会有代币的消耗，首先关注的是产品本身，接下来会引导社区更好地使用代币。\n\n现在跟其他合作伙伴在合作，当然取得实质性的进展也是需要假以时日的，最重要的是需要打造更多内容、更多 IP，使得玩家获得越来越好的游戏体验。\n\n\\*\\*张中南：\\*\\*对我来说。\n\n第一，需要自由地使用任何任何元宇宙服务，同时也要证明服务所有权及数字身份，这是非常重要加密原生。\n\n第二，刚刚 Sebastien Borget 也讲到了，对于任何元宇宙而言，你要注册进入的话都不应该有管制、有限制，应该是完全开放的。\n\n\\*\\*吴显昆（主持人）：\\*\\*我知道在座各位都非常了解区块链及比特币，可能有一些人不是非常了解如何使用这样的概念，对产品开发者来说，如何降低用户使用元宇宙的门槛？\n\n\\*\\*Sebastien Borget：\\*\\*人们为什么会使用元宇宙？他们的动机是什么？首先是非常有趣的体验，现在人都通过手机及电脑来玩各种各样的游戏，他们就想获得娱乐体验。所以要打造非常棒，非常有参与度的元宇宙要假以时日的。\n\n我相信假以时日用户将会变成蝴蝶，他们可能会飞到元宇宙来玩几个小时，再回到现实世界。要把所有相关的互联网都结合在元宇宙里，更多吸引用户。\n\n如果说用户没有非常大非常好的动机接受元宇宙的话，那他们可能就会觉得用不用无所谓。如果他们觉得通过这样的方式可以在游戏中进行更多互动及实现交易活动的话，用户就会更有动机。\n\n我们所创造的内容也是非常关键的，对于一些加密玩家来说，他们可能更容易被元宇宙的打造所说服。\n\n\\*\\*张中南：\\*\\*我们有另外一款产品，它是最大的开元 EVM 网络，非常了解新用户的痛点，以及他们进入元宇宙时的犹疑。\n\n我非常同意 Sebastien Borget 的观点，加密技术本身是一种手段，但它不是目的。要打造的元宇宙将是基于加密技术的，但是同时也要确保客户体验。\n\n我们的目的是给用户打造最好的体验，而不是仅仅为了加密而加密。也就是说，在一开始考虑元宇宙的时候就要牢记于心，哪些人将会成为用户体验元宇宙。\n\n发布了另外一个产品，其实它是以太坊上的另外一种智能合约，智能合约不仅仅能够识别储存价值，同时也有其他功能。所以对于普通的用户来说，他们每次想执行合约的时候，都可以使用一次性钱包执行智能合约，在合约执行后就可以把钱包删除，如果下一次要使用智能合约的话，也可以进行同样的操作。\n\n对于用户来说，用户体验非常容易。我们也有其他项目致力于此方向，帮助新用户在进入加密空间、加密行业的时候，有更低的进入门槛。现在可以看到有越来越多的好项目。\n\n\\*\\*吴显昆（主持人）：\\*\\*谢谢 Victor，我相信产品永远是第一位的，在我们探讨元宇宙的时候都不可避免地讲元宇宙的经济模型、经济体制。我们也不知道所谓的元宇宙经济模式、商业模式会怎么样，但是还是不妨可以讨论一下元宇宙的商业化，或者目前现有的商业模式有哪些可以借鉴到元宇宙里？\n\n\\*\\*Sebastien Borget：\\*\\*有许多商业模式可以参考，可以对所有可能性都进行探索。比如说社区管理者、游戏设计者等等，他们都能够成为商业模型的一环。\n\n以及内容创造者、打造者，也可以跟买家、卖家建立经济关系。还有其他的模式，比如说可以通过广播、售卖内容来获得代币收入。元宇宙将是全新的世界，但是它最终也会为用户模式、使用案例所驱动。\n\n比如说可以通过元宇宙取代现有的平台，元宇宙的设想非常令人激动，可以继续探讨在元宇宙话题之下的更多应用场景。\n\n\\*\\*张中南：\\*\\*Sebastien Borget 刚刚跟我们解释了数字世界的商业机会。我可以举一些例子，作为数字世界的创造者、打造者，他们能做些什么？首先可以利用刚刚 Sebastien Borget 提到的商业机会打造数字世界，另一方面作为创造者，也在打造新的国家，可以把一些虚拟的东西、物品进行售卖，可以获得相关的货币。有点像税收的体制。\n\n对于数字世界的打造者及数字世界使用者来说，可能还没有足够成熟的商业模型可以参考。\n\n\\*\\*吴显昆（主持人）：\\*\\*非常抱歉因为时间的关系我可能只能问最后一个问题了。所有在场的观众都希望你们跟我们分享一下你们未来的计划是什么？你们有哪些比较令人激动的项目？\n\n\\*\\*Sebastien Borget：\\*\\*下周我们将会公布价值制造的路线图，所有这些都是旨在帮助用户了解平台将如何打造非常丰富的体验。\n\n另外，也会跟一些大 IP、名人、运动项目进行合作，会继续重塑在游戏行业的愿景，打造更加全球性的生态系统。\n\n\\*\\*张中南：\\*\\*对于我们来说，元宇宙是一直探讨的终点。一方面会继续智能合约进行相关开发，比如说把不同的特征联系起来。另一方面正在开发代币框架，提供代币接口。通过接口使得在不同平台间使用数字物品，而且通过这样的框架可以保证所有数字化产品都是安全的，同时不会被篡改。\n\n通常来说，会引入新的信任协议，帮助大家了解如何更好地使用逻辑。我讲到的新框架将会给我们带来代币的新布局。同时也会给我们带来多重化的数字化世界。\n\n\\*\\*吴显昆（主持人）：\\*\\*以上就是今天 Panel 的全部环节。", "timestamp": 1635338986, "digest": "AKm5sI4_bzuKe-Dq4gGMOZp6_TSExakkeNFIbeDyv5Q", "contributor": "0x4C48F992B9201b4f7C26a7bE42D80D034402e14C"}

The person who gained access to its innards noticed some changes Apple has made to make some parts easy replaceable, and others, not so much.\n\n## The Process of Getting Inside the Smaller 2021 MacBook Pro Is the Same as the Versions That Featured a Touch Bar\n\nAccording to the_Ex_Lurker on Reddit, Apple has made some changes to how authorized personnel can replace the affected components on the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro. We are assuming the same changes will be carried to the larger 16.2-inch variant, such as easily replaceable batteries, which now feature iPhone-style pull tabs instead of being glued on the previous models. Down the road, if you feel that your MacBook Pro is not delivering the same battery endurance, switching it with a new one should not be difficult.\n\nHowever, getting inside still requires the removal of pentalobe screws and clips, making the entry process similar to that on the MacBook Pro models that feature the Touch Bar. Although Apple uses the scissor-switch mechanism for its keyboards on both portable Macs, there are still chances of failure. Unfortunately, according to the Redditor, a replacement will be virtually possible without the involvement of authorized personnel because the keyboard is part of the unibody chassis.\n\nThe plus side to owning one of these 2021 MacBook Pro models, however expensive it may be, is that these appear to have modular ports, including MagSafe. Down the road, if a defect occurs in which one or more ports are not working, the modular design can mean a simple desoldering and replacement is possible. The Redditor has commented that these subtle changes will mean less electronic waste will be dumped, and since Apple wants to keep its image alive and well about being environmentally concerned, it will have to design its products in a similar fashion.\n\n> “These computers will create much less e-waste since a battery replacement no longer means tossing out a perfectly good speaker system, keyboard, trackpad and a pound of machined aluminium.”\n\nWe will continue to wait for an in-depth teardown of the 2021 MacBook Pro from the likes of iFixit but there is no doubt that the_Ex_Lurker has educated us and the readers significantly on what changes have been implemented on the inside.\n\nNews Source: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/qghddk/first_look_inside_the_14_macbook_pro_m1_pro/)\n\n#### Products mentioned in this post\n\n[MacBook Pro \n USD 1031.61](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V49KGVQ?tag=wccftechplug-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1)\n\nThe links above are affiliate links.

日举行的第七届万向区块链全球峰会上，Mixmarvel 全球市场负责人 Nicolas Zhu、Flow 产品负责人 Layne Lafrance、Genies 全球合作伙伴关系负责人 Allison Sturges 展开了一场关于元宇宙的深度对话。Nicolas 是本场讨论的主持人，Layne 和 Allison 将通过线上连线的方式接入现场。以下为讨论内容的文字整理。\n\n\n***\n\n**Nicolas Zhu （主持人）：两位好，今天在这里会和各位探讨元宇宙技术基础设施，请先简要介绍一下自己，我先简单介绍一下我自己及我的项目，再请两位嘉宾来介绍。**\n\n我们主要是在传统游戏行业有很多年经验，在育碧参与到一些应用开发。离开育碧之后做了自己的独立游戏公司，而且在公司又发布了一些游戏产品，产品在 61 个国家和地区都获得好评。\n\n2018 年的时候，Mixmarvel 开发了去中心化应用，通过去中心化应用获得了 100 万注册用户。在过程中发现区块链基础设施存在很多问题，这也是为什么我们推出区块链基础设施协议 Rocket Protcocol （音）主要是为复杂应用技 NFT 跨链提供之前。\n\n当前协议得到了很多机构的投资，期待下半年的时候主网会上线\n\n**Nicolas Zhu （主持人）：请 Allison Sturges 介绍一下您的项目及您自己的自我介绍。**\n\n\\*\\*Allison Sturges：\\*\\*非常感谢主办方的邀请，我的名字是 Allison Sturges，我是 Genies 全球合作伙伴关系负责人，主要是负责和品牌及 IP 之间的合作，帮助 IP 进入到生态系统中。\n\nGenies 主要是虚拟头像公司，我们觉得虚拟头像是表达自我的核心工具，同样也是元宇宙核心的基础设施。\n\n过去几年间，花了很长一段时间对于名人虚拟头像进行创作，比如说艺术家名人、运动员在虚拟世界建立了自己的虚拟身份，满足自己的虚拟，表达身份的需求。现在可以看到已经进入到了日常生活，也推出了 Genies 应用，这样每个人可以通过自己的应用打造自己 3D 的虚拟头像，而且可以将 3D 虚拟头像应用到很多程序中，其中包括游戏应用。\n\n另外也可以利用工具进入到其他世界，除此之外也和 DAppLabs 一起合作，打造 NFT 市场，预计在今年下半年的时候就会正式推出，所以大家可以在平台上交易那些名人可穿戴设备及头像这类的数字资产。另外，这些数字资产也可以实现定制化，能够允许个人打造自己的虚拟头像。\n\n**Nicolas Zhu （主持人）：非常感谢，请 Layne Lafrance 介绍一下。**\n\n\\*\\*Layne Lafrance：\\*\\*非常感谢主办方的邀请，我的名字是 Layne Lafrance，我是 Flow 的产品负责人，是 2017 年加密猫创始团队的成员，非常幸运看到了元宇宙的发展，看到了未来元宇宙潜力巨大。其实我们推出了不同元宇宙的技术标准，DAppLabs 主要是将加密体验进一步带到主流化，并且带入到文化和娱乐行业，相等和 Genies 进行合作，刚刚 Allison Sturges 也提到了交易市场很快在今年下半年就会上线。因为在加密猫之后，我们打造了 Flow 公链，主要是因为以太坊网络拥堵等很多限制，而且大家也熟悉像一些主流协议技术复杂度是以太坊网络不能承受的，所以建造了 Flow 区块链，确保大家都能享受元宇宙的好处，非常感谢！\n\n\\*\\*Nicolas Zhu （主持人）：\\*\\*非常棒，听到了两位的介绍，也介绍了两位各自所代表的项目和产品，现在进入到今天的第一个问题。第一个问题相对比较宏观的问题，我想问一下各位的看法和观点，\\*\\*对于当前元宇宙的总体趋势看法以及各位觉得元宇宙当前这么受欢迎的原因是什么？\\*\\*请 Allison Sturges 先回答。\n\n\\*\\*Allison Sturges：\\*\\*我觉得元宇宙代表的是现实世界和数字世界之间相互联系和交互，比如说现在大家花越来越多的时间到数字世界，而且也会在数字世界里有虚拟身份进一步探索虚拟世界，我们认为，比如说像虚拟头像、虚拟世界、NFT 区块链这样的去中心化应用，使得我们能够实现在元宇宙进一步的互操作性。\n\n而这样的技术越来越多地为普通消费者主流所采用，也看到了这些新技术本身发展、创新都发展的非常棒，而且也代表着人类能够获得一种新的线上和线下、虚拟和现实交互的方式。它本代表的是真正去中心化的，而且在虚拟世界人类可以进行自我表达，同时可以在全球范围内实现彼此之间的交流，这是在线下没有办法做到的。\n\nGenies 主要是提供虚拟世界的身份层，但总体来说看到元宇宙的交互。\n\n\\*\\*Layne Lafrance：\\*\\*我非常同意 Allison Sturges：说的交互及元宇宙所发生的种种现象，元宇宙能带来的各种各样的可能性确实是非常强大的，比如说你的社会经济和数字资产能够进行交融、集成，而且通过线上和线下的融合，确实能够带来多样性，可以跨网络享受丰富的应用，这是在线下没有办法感受到的。\n\n确实看到了在游戏、经济、去中心化虚拟资产确实吸引到很多人的进入，正如 Allison 刚刚提到的，数字经济发展本身非常新，很高兴看到大家在虚拟世界里发现各种无限的可能性。\n\n\\*\\*Nicolas Zhu （主持人）：\\*\\*您说的非常多，确实可以想象出未来的元宇宙会是非常好的方法，将世界各地的人联系起来，并且让世界各地的人进行交互。同时也发现有很多问题有待解决，主要是在基础设施层面。比如说我自己的 Renges （音）协议希望提供实时确认，也希望提供高的 TPS，主要是为了支持当前一些行为，而且当前的区块链基础设施是没有办法支持这样行为的。\n\n**请 Layne Lafrance 先给我们介绍一下 DAppLabs 通过退出 Flow 公链，旨在解决哪些最重要的问题，想请您采用怎样的手段解决这个问题？**\n\n\\*\\*Layne Lafrance：\\*\\*这个问题特别好，在基础设施方面我们进行了大量的思索，比如说现实、困境、大规模应用、TPS，因此我们预见到了这样的情况，包括实时的终局性，对我们来说都非常重要。\n\n对于 Flow 公链来说，有 PoS 共识协议，就能实现很快的终局性。比如说在几秒的时间里就可以实现交易的终局性确认。TPS 对我们来说肯定是至关重要的，因为你有高的吞吐量，这也是 Flow 基础设施非常重要的驱动因素。\n\n现在我们也在研究其他协议是否能够帮助我们实现我想做到的大规模应用、主流化应用，这就是我们思索的过程，包括对于共识、状态终局性的确认，还有 Flow 到底如何保证网络的有效运营、TPS 的发展，终局性对我们来说是非常重要的两点。\n\n在设计过程中不断在思考用户参与、用户加入，让主流世界的人进入到加密世界来说相对比较难，但是 Flow 希望让主流用户首次接触加密活动觉得是非常简单的过程，而不是复杂的 KYC 的过程。希望让生态系统通过提供法币支付的方式，让更多主流用户进入到 Flow 生态系统里。\n\n很多人并不想要玩加密货币，他们只是想购买自己感兴趣的资产。而且在过程中也涉及到很多交易费用。比如说 gas 费概念本身，还有有时候你所需要支付的 gas 费比你购买的资产价值还要高。\n\nFlow 公链要确保费用不会成为阻碍用户的因素。另外也要确保生态系统的安全性、系统架构的安全性，包括 Dapp 本身的可组合性，从而不会影响到终端用户的使用体验。\n\n另外有关基础设施方面还有一点非常重要，那就是可组合性。在 Dapp 上打造状态空间，以及与之相关的社区进行可组合性的开发，基于体验之上开发可组合性的表示，这点非常重要。另外，可组合性将会继续驱动元宇宙生态系统的发展和繁荣。\n\n\\*\\*Nicolas Zhu （主持人）：\\*\\*这个答案非常棒，确实看到了在区块链基础设施方面有了很多进步和进展，而且我也相信这确实是对数字所有权方面带来的革命。**想请两位分享一下有关数字所有权的看法，以及数字所有权到底如何影响人的生活，以何种方式建立数字所有权，为什么人们在获得 NFT 的时候同时也有必要确认所有权呢？**\n\n\\*\\*Allison Sturges：\\*\\*这一点特别有意思，记得前几天我听到一个圆桌讨论，大家觉得在现实世界中所有权起来理所当然，现实世界中自然而然就拥有了所有权，NFT 技术的出现，人们需要对数字资产、数字价值的所有权进行真正的确认，所以才刚刚开始利用 NFT 技术，这不过只是开始，逐渐假以时日技术将扮演更加基础性的作用。\n\n对于数字所有权的另外一个看法是和虚拟头像、数字商品、数字皮肤相关的，这些数字商品、数字资产可能会存在 20、30 年，比如说在游戏世界里会存在很长一段时间，并且数字商品在传统的世界里用户没有办法真正获得所有权，但 NFT 却提供了另外真正的数字所有权，通过打造虚拟头像、NFT 交易市场，可以为用户提供真正的数字所有权，并且能为数字资产提供效用。\n\n另外数字资产所有权独特点在于可以解锁其他体验，比如说社区参与，比如说有一些大项目如雨后春笋般涌现，另外看到其他的资产、数字现实的物理资产也会不断进入，非常兴奋看到大家到底是怎么利用提供的基础设施进一步提供数字所有权，谢谢！\n\n\\*\\*Layne Lafrance：\\*\\*我非常同意 Allison Sturges 刚刚所说的一切，之前从来没有拥有过数字所有权，但现在大家可以在互联网世界里对资产拥有所有权，就像你在现实世界一样，你可以说我是这个东西的所有者，而且你可以用数字资产和他人进行交易。\n\n全球范围内在网上有非常蓬勃的市场，这样的市场给用户提供过去没有办法获得的资产，除此之外所有者也有变现的渠道，这是传统所不能提供的，这确实是新的资产类型，而且现在也正在看到这种资产类型。这是全新的让人们进行价值存储的媒介，这点非常难以置信，如果没有区块链和新技术的话，这点不可能实现。比如说在最开始的时候看到人们收集加密猫，后来又出来了 NBA Topshot，人们对 NBA Topshot 里的精彩瞬间是拥有所有权的，数字所有权确实是一切机制的基础，由于去中心化公链，所以数字所有权成为可能，而且我们也知道数字资产会永久存在，不管是 DAppLabs 资产，还是 Genies 资产，还是 Mixmarvel 的资产，都会永续存在。\n\n\\*\\*Nicolas Zhu （主持人）：\\*\\*说的非常棒，刚刚 Layne Lafrance 提到了各方面的信息，包括比较低的成本、很多场景用户之间可以实现交互。我们也可以看到 DAppLabs 和很多全球品牌进行合作，**吸引主流用户进入到区块链和加密世界**，比如说像 NBA、GUCCI 这样的品牌，和贾斯汀比伯这样的名人进行合作。\n\n**很多观众肯定希望想听一下您到底是怎么遴选大的品牌，如何挑选合作伙伴的？**\n\n\\*\\*Allison Sturges：\\*\\*对于 Genies 来说，在过去两年间和几千名人进行合作，比如说现在和 WBMG、美国 GUCCI 及其他品牌都有正式的合作，而且在未来几周还会公布更多的合作。包括这些品牌，还有一些球员对于数字世界的认知就像对现实世界的认知是类似的，可以看到有很多赞助和广告的机会。\n\n他们需要重新思考元宇宙如何更好地利用品牌价值，并且要积极和社区一道通过创新的方式参与到元宇宙，从而能够为人提供真正的价值。\n\n对我们来说，也是寻求那些希望的合作伙伴，对合作伙伴的期待首先要理解对于虚拟头像及真正身份的愿景，这确实是核心，也愿意不断地实现跨界，实现虚拟世界和现实世界之间的跨界和融合。\n\n另外希望利用技术、NFT 的力量更多带到主流用户中，对我们来说，之所以 Flow 选择和 DAppLabs 合作的原因是希望打造可以访问、可以接近的市场，从而为主流用户提供空间和平台，让他们能够更好地接触加密技术和 NFT 技术。\n\n我刚刚给各位介绍了我们想要选择哪些合作伙伴以及如何进行合作过程。\n\n\\*\\*Layne Lafrance：\\*\\*我在 Allison Sturges 的基础上补充一点，我确实非常同意 Allison Sturges 所提出的观点。\n\n和用户之间的关系已经发生了改变，到底谁来获得价值，谁来进行定价。这些品牌确实在这方面进行了努力，另外提供的资产也能够获得相应的价值，并且这些品牌会有更多社区主导的因素，品牌不是完全自己垄断价值，更多会和用户共享。我们会更多选择那些愿意改变、调整现有客户关系的品牌。\n\n不断探索更多可能性，也和品牌不断分享新的技术，不仅仅是为了实现功能和目的，同时也可以为了实现娱乐，让大家觉得这些东西玩起来很有意思。\n\n这是这一切的前提是改变支付的方式，而不是让人们终其一生都使用加密货币进行支付，这点非常重要，要让用户理解世界的精彩性，让他们愿意参与。\n\n**Nicolas Zhu （主持人）：刚刚已经探讨了品牌希望创新进入到区块链世界，并且能够进一步革命，让他们呈现出崭新的面貌，并且进行自我改善和优化。**\n\n对我们来说，Nterx （音）协议很快会推出新的营销活动，会让很多设计师进入到社区里，他们会自己铸造 NFT，同时也会在主网上将已经确认的 NFT 进行发布。\n\n刚刚已经讲过了基于名人的虚拟头像，同时也有原生的虚拟头像概念，直接在区块链上铸造生成的。我想请问两位，您觉得在未来由名人驱动的还是原生的更受欢迎？\n\n\\*\\*Allison Sturges：\\*\\*Genies 的愿景是让数字身份进入到主流用户，为所有人提供数字身份，只要他愿意去探索数字世界，这也是我们最开始的愿景。\n\n所以在过去两年间首先选择了名人，一直以此为驱动，希望能通过名人效应让他们自己的粉丝和社区感兴趣，预计未来会有越来越多人参与到 NFT 和虚拟头像，他们会为自己打造自己的数字身份。并且今年下半年的时候也会推出消费级产品，在接下来几个月就会推出。\n\n假以时日，希望为消费者提供工具、能力，这些工具和能力之前是给名人开放，之后会向普通人开放，也希望用户爱上数字身份，通过数字身份真正在数字世界表达自我和真我。\n\n希望提供工具让人们对自己的身份进行变现，比如说打造 IP，打造品牌，可以围绕着数字世界的数字身份变现，另外也会提供其他的工具，比如说可穿戴设备、内容创作工具等，这也是之前向名人开放的，之后会向普通人开放。\n\n会在全球有更多弄潮儿帮助我们，让普通人知道到底如何进入到这个领域，到底如何在数字世界与他人交互，这确实是面向主流的一个点，而且这样的趋势未来肯定会随着技术的创新进一步发展。\n\n\\*\\*Nicolas Zhu （主持人）：\\*\\*Layne Lafrance，您的看法？\n\n\\*\\*Layne Lafrance：\\*\\*Allison Sturges 刚刚说的非常对，从名人先开始，名人往往是潮流的制定者，他们可以向粉丝展示潮流时尚的东西再吸引主流，名人的行为往往会上头条。当然我们也需要更多的社区驱动东西，尤其是给社区相关的资源和工具。\n\n比如说这些东西你从名人身上看到非常酷，你也希望和你的朋友尝试，尤其是希望定制化。这些因素至关重要，你想要展示你自己的成功，同时也想展示自我。虽然一方面名人会进一步吸引到其他粉丝、关键人员进入，但是另外一方面提供平台让所有人能够参与，并且让所有人能够利用其中的元素。\n\n比如说他们能够获得名人的盲盒投放等其它各种元素都是很有意思的。一方面，名人的 NFT 是高价值的，会上头条。另一方面，也需要更多推动社区驱动，由社区由个人驱动，这一切应该合二为一。\n\n比如说粉丝关注了名人，他们可以买到名人的周边，可以用在自己所创造的 NFT 上，这是非常好的想象，希望能让社区通过这些应用、元素能够进一步丰富，而且让社区有各种各样可以向朋友展示的东西。\n\n\\*\\*Nicolas Zhu （主持人）：\\*\\*非常有启发的论坛，我相信观众想了解你们对项目有什么样的未来计划，现在你们已经获得了非常不错的成功，想知道你们未来对项目会有什么计划？\n\n6 月份我们开始进行招商，现在获得了许多投资，而且在今年稍候会公布另外的项目，针对开发者开放相关子网，年底会开放主网。明年会整合开发环境，旨在帮助开发者有非常完善的工具链，这样可以更好地开发他们的应用。\n\nAllison Sturges 你们未来的计划呢？\n\n\\*\\*Allison Sturges：\\*\\*在未来的短时间来说，非常激动人心的就是我在接下来几个月将会发布 NFT 项目，NFT 市场使得用户在上面建立网络化身，同时也会有不同的合作伙伴，包括奢侈品、IP 公司等等，在这种情况下消费者可以通过市场更好地发布内容。\n\n也会发布另一个应用，所有人都可以通过不同的社交网络进行交互。Facebook 大约有 10 亿用户，通过跟相关平台的打通，也可以让用户跟生态系统的其他网络及平台进行互动。同时也可以使用工具打造内容，远期愿景是通过虚拟工具使得用户更好地使用数字身份，以及从中变现赚钱，每一个都可以通过平台打造他们的数字身份。相信这样的工具可能会在未来 1-2 年内陆续推出，会跟相关奢侈品牌及其他的 IP 进行合作，创建他们的数字身份，让他们更好地进行创作。\n\n\\*\\*Layne Lafrance：\\*\\*非常希望通过数字身份使得创作者最终把他们的作品进行变现，也希望可以创造工具在整个生态系统进行共同分享，非常乐意跟所有合作伙伴共同合作，因为整个生态系统都是非常兼容，而且都是发展的非常欣欣向荣。\n\n正如我刚刚提到的，社区会有越来越多其他跟运动相关的 NFT 及其他项目不断推出。关于社区项目的话也会有一些相关的社区置身于其他更加富有活力的项目打造，期待更多社区成员可以加入我们，他们可以在平台上对资产进行租赁，项目获得了非常不错的进展。\n\n对于不同资产进行数字化及通过 NFT 更好地进行内容的发布。对于我们来说，产品路线主要是基于社区的需求，所以肯定会在未来看到 Flow 公链有很多可组合性，比如说 Cadence 智能合约语言，主要是用来在 Flow 上进行开发，另外还有很多其他令人期待的有关元宇宙的东西，通过标准整合能够找到最好的交互方式，同时为社区创造真正的价值，在这方面肯定会有很多发展和项目，整个领域会不断拓展。\n\n不仅仅是最开始大家提到的有关于数字所有权的重要性，Cadence 编程语言主要旨在确保大家能够对于数字所有权和数字价值进行编程，除此之外将其进行扩展。可以用其他生态系统不同的代码，并且让整个体验变得更加吸引人，这对于更多开发资源来说非常重要，会看到有越来越多开发资源的流入。\n\n非常棒。\n\n\\*\\*Nicolas Zhu （主持人）：\\*\\*确实非常期待元宇宙的未来，而且看到各位在不断发展、不断开发、不断推进，朝着元宇宙未来的目标前进。\n\n最开始的时候 Allison Sturges 也提到了会有共同的工具集，让普通用户做自己，我们也有一个应用获得了大量用户，还有开发者的项目。\n\n最近才推出了新的界面，而且也在不断做 UI 优化，在明年会做类似的事情，会为开发者发布开发工具包，这样大家就能够进一步用工具包进行开发，非常期待 DAppLabs 和 Genies 之间的合作，并且希望会后可以探讨三方怎样进行合作。\n\n今天的圆桌讨论就到这里了，感谢大家的参与。\n\n\\*\\*Allison Sturges：\\*\\*非常棒非常感谢主办方的邀请。\n\n\\*\\*Layne Lafrance：\\*\\*非常感谢。", "timestamp": 1635339139, "digest": "-bqKApRGZRaOguhILMUtZCQDzHB1l0WZtM3at4RFgMU", "contributor": "0x89ddA427e73F33f285277D88Dfa611696c31d881"}

Releasing simultaneously in theaters and on streaming service HBO Max, *Dune* earned Warner Bros.’s largest opening weekend box office of 2021 with $40M in the United States. This resulted in the swift announcement that *Dune: Part Two*’s release date is set for October 20, 2023, nearly two years to the day after its predecessor.\n\nThe announcement of *Dune: Part Two* should come as no surprise, with director/writer **Denis Villeneuve** saying that the studio was “100 percent behind the project.\" In fact, Villeneuve seems to be busy at work already, having started writing *Dune: Part Two* months ago, before it was even greenlit.\n\nVilleneuve said on writing the sequel:\n\n> *“I’m writing \\[Part Two\\] now, and I feel like I’m eight years old again.

{"id": "HOK8FZQkBaUfkxkQpQsuxsovP72Rm9oHSWqWLNt9QrE", "title": "Google Reportedly Blocked Ad Competition and Avoided Privacy Regulations, Reveals Court Filing", "body": "Google has been facing an investigation by the United States Department of Justice for some time now. The investigation took place over anti-competitive practices that were mainly related to Google's search and ad business. The Department of Justice released a complaint last year alleging that Google dominated the search engine market through its advantage of deep integration with Android along with other agreements that limited the use of other search engines. More recently, the focus has been put on Google's dominance of online advertisement, and a new complaint does not do the company any justice.\n\nA massive [168-page complaint](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.564903/gov.uscourts.nysd.564903.152.0_1.pdf) was filed by 17 states. Most of which are controlled by the Republicans. Texas, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah. The report covers a lot of information, including some details about some secret Google initiatives to limit competition and privacy measures.\n\n[Sony Xperia Pro-I vs iPhone 13 Pro Camera Showdown Reveals Interesting Results](https://wccftech.com/sony-xperia-pro-i-vs-iphone-13-pro-camera-showdown-reveals-interesting-results/)\n\n## Google's Advertising Practices\n\nThe filing mainly looks at Google's advertising business and how they have managed to gain control of every online advertising sector over the past years. That should not come as a surprise to anyone, but the filing does include some details about \"Jedi,\" which is a secret project that allowed google to win in bids for online advertising.\n\nThis came after the publishers started adopting \"header bidding,\" which is a way to bid on multiple ad exchanges simultaneously, even if Google hosted the ads. This Jedi program ensured that Google's exchange would always win these automatic bidding wars even when other exchanges offered higher bids.\n\nIn Google's own words, the Jedi program “generates suboptimal yields for publishers and serious risks of negative media coverage if exposed externally.”\n\nBack in 2017, Facebook announced that it would start supporting header bidding on its ad platform, the Facebook Audience Network, which would have been a potential hit to Google's domination of the ad industry. However, the purpose of this program was to pressure Google into giving Facebook information, speed, and other benefits in Google's ad auctions. Facebook cut back on its decision with header bidding, and both companies started working together to identify people using Apple products. In an agreement internally known as \"Jedi Blue,\" both companies  “agreed up front on quotas for how often Facebook would win publishers’ auctions—manipulating the auction with minimum spends and quotas for how often Facebook would bid and win.”\n\nThe filing also mentions several other monopolistic and anti-competitive practices in the advertisement. Back in 2013, Google blocked ad-buying tools by other companies from placing ads on YouTube, this forced advertisers to use Google's tools “If advertisers feel like they don’t have to work with Google directly to access video inventory—including YouTube—we will lose our ability to influence decisions about budget allocation.\n\n[2021 MacBook Pro Has Easy-to-Replace Batteries, Modular Ports, but Impossible Keyboard Disassembly, Shows New Teardown](https://wccftech.com/2021-macbook-pro-teardown-battery-and-ports-replacement-easy/)\n\n## Price Fixing and Privacy by Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft\n\nGoogle reportedly had a closed-door meeting on August 6, 2019, with reps from Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft, where the giants discussed how to delay efforts to improve privacy. Google stated in a memo prepared for the meeting, “we have been successful in slowing down and delaying the process and have been working behind the scenes hand in hand with the other companies.”\n\nAll companies involved also discussed their strategy towards child privacy and safety, which has become a major talking point in the past few years. Google has been heavily criticized for not having proper content filtering. At the meeting, Google was concerned that Microsoft was taking child privacy more seriously than itself. The same memo also stated, “Whether, at this meeting or another forum, we may want to reinforce that this is an area of particular importance to have a coordinated approach.”\n\nMicrosoft's response was also noted with “we have direction from Kent \\[Walker\\] to find alignment with MSFT where we can but should be wary of their activity \\[in promoting privacy\\] and seek to gain as much intel as possible.”\n\nGoogle also showed concern that Facebook was not aligned with its privacy efforts saying that \"we’ve had difficulty getting FB to align on our privacy goals and strategy, as they have at time\\[s\\] prioritized winning on reputation over its business interest in legislative debate.” The filing reports that this behavior is similar to the anti-competitive practice of price-fixing. Still, instead of secretly agreeing on prices, tech companies are forming agreements over privacy measures.\n\n## Google AMP\n\nAccelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP, is a technology that Google first created. The public goal is to allow websites to have faster-loading versions of their articles, which AMP achieves by limiting the amount of scripting and custom styles used by a page. Much to the annoyance of both visitors and publishers, Google later required sites to support AMP before they could appear in Google Feed, Google News, and other promotional platforms. Google only started dropping these conditions recently.\n\nThe filing alleges that a personal goal for AMP was to reduce the effectiveness of header bidding in ads, giving a competitive advantage to Google's ads. AMP code prevented publishers from routing bids to more than a few exchanges at once, but no limitations were placed on the bids from Google's ad server. AMP also provided Google more information about browsing behavior and ad loading, because in most cases, AMP pages that are given by Google itself are cached copies.\n\nFor the longest time, Google AMP has been criticized for being anti-competitive and giving Google more control over the internet. So the information about AMP is the least surprising part of this filing. This is also why many websites have added AMP support even though it is not good support for readers and publishers. If sites do not add AMP, they could lose web traffic, even if ad manipulation from Google resulted in less revenue from AMP pages.\n\nThe filing also suggests that Google has committed several violations of the [Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act_of_1890) (also known simply as the ‘Sherman Act’), an anti-trust law in the United States that prevents noncompetitive agreements and attempts to monopolize markets. The filing also calls for Google to surrender all the profits and information gained through deceptive trade practices, and of course, pay various fines.\n\nFor now, we will have to wait and see what happens as the lawsuit continues through the U.S. legal system. If the filing is anything to go by, Google could be in deep, deep trouble, which might mean that the internet may no longer be the same.\n\nSHARE TWEET \n ", "timestamp": 1635339080, "digest": "S4KI8q1QMMCr9oZ5cPP90bUkBLS_XIpI2XAyHb01mr4", "contributor": "0xf960c047a47677eA00c94a1074C90850c550c24C"}

PDD）分享新加坡官方智慧城市的规划思路，探寻区块链如何赋能城市管理模式、管理理念、管理手段的创新，从而加速推动城市治理体系和治理能力的数字化发展。以下为演讲内容。\n\n\n***\n\n![区块链如何推动城市治理体系数字化发展？以新加坡榜鹅数字园区为例](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/c84efb31e40e5d4f97cf441ccd7dde73.jpg-article)\n\n\\*\\*Steven：\\*\\*大家早上好，欢迎来到今天的炉边谈话，我将主持本次谈话。最近在数字领域新加坡有很多新动向，而且很多动向在接下来的圆桌讨论中，也会跟大家分享，下面正式开始，先请 Kok Poh June 介绍一下。\n\n\\*\\*Kok Poh June：\\*\\*感谢 Steven，我是来自新加坡裕廊集团，我们是新加坡领先的开发集团，我们有一个榜鹅数字园区（Punggol Digital District, PDD）项目。非常荣幸跟各位分享，同时也很幸运。榜鹅数字园区（Punggol Digital District, PDD）智慧城市非常重要，首先它是一个智慧都市，整个的开发大概有 0.5 平方公里，它的设计非常好，可以在那里工作、生活、享受，那里的生活方式非常丰富多样，有各种各样的美景，有各种各样的自然和人文景观。那里代表的是一种新的生活方式，而且它是由裕廊集团开发的，它也代表着新加坡的未来园区，它包括技术的元素。我们现在有 3000 个工人和 1 万个居民，它代表的是一个非常年轻的地区，大概能够为新加坡创造 28,000 个工作岗位，而且它作为新加坡数字化方面的一个雄心体现。这样的园区在生态系统里，扮演了非常重要的角色，它推动了研究、开发和知识分享，除此之外，我们也有商业的生态系统，我们也有企业，像机器人、可再生能源，以及其他企业。企业的话，彼此之间都有密切的合作，去寻求新的机会。包括今天的领先区块链企业——万向，也会很快来到智慧城市。我们非常激动，跟万向有合作机会。\n\n\\*\\*Steven：\\*\\*非常感谢你快速介绍了榜鹅数字园区（Punggol Digital District, PDD），从我感觉来说，这也是一个非常令人激动的园区，它的数字化转型，从学界影响到了公众。这样对于建造合作伙伴关系方面，也创造了很到新的机会，其实各位也已经理解中国和新加坡在政府之间有密切的合作。所以我想要邀请王总回答这个问题，作为区块链行业的领军者，在具体的机遇方面，对像您这样的前沿机构来说机遇有哪些呢？\n\n\\*\\*王允臻：\\*\\*首先回答一下区块链是什么？我们将区块链称之为信任机器。从信任角度出发，它代表了一种生产关系引擎，也就是它是机器引擎，我们可以打造新的商业关系和商业模式。前面嘉宾提到了 PDD，你也提到了万向即将进入 PDD，从万向角度来说非常高兴，能够作为一个技术架构师的角色，利用我们在区块链的积累，以及一些新兴的技术，从而挖掘区块链的潜力。\n\n就生产关系而言，我们可以探讨这个话题，它有很多层。第一层，刚刚 Steven 主持人提到了，就是在新加坡和中国之间在生产关系方面的合作，这可以说是源远流长，上溯到几十年之前。在城市合作方面，有很多的范例。比如在苏州、天津、重庆、广州和深圳。因此我们要思考如何更好地将这些现有的成功，让它变得更加成功。只有通过在 PDD 项目方面的合作，我们可以作为一种新的世界领先的城市的基础设施，我们可以打造数字化的城市，而这样的数字化城市，将超越智慧城市所能够取得的成就。为了实现这样的目标，我们需要在正式的应用之前，在正式的场景设计之前，我们需要打造一个可信的数据基础设施，而这也是区块链能够扮演至关重要角色的领域。所谓的可信的数据基础设施，它的意思是什么呢？在新加坡这样的城市环境中，数据是非常丰富的，来自于不同的来源。有一些是行政数据，是由政府所管理，而有一些数据是由商业企业所拥有，还有一些数据，是由个人所产生，由新加坡的居民所产生。所以我们到底如何去打造一个数据池呢？这样的数据池就能够允许不同来源的数据，在这个数据池中汇合。与此同时，又能够从数据生成、数据起源的源起起点，从起点开始，对于数据的隐私和数据的所有权进行保护，这一点也是至关重要的。我们需要以更加直观的方式做这一点，而不是引入额外层，再导致额外的成本和管理方面的成本，这就是艺术和科学的结合。\n\n我们希望能引入前所未有的可信数据基础结构，在 PDD 中。另外我们也会引入一些额外的构建，希望稍后有机会和各位分享。\n\n\\*\\*Steven：\\*\\*非常感谢，您刚刚提到了数据，不管是对于工业的发展还是对于研发来说，都是至关重要的关键。您拿到的数据越多，能够提出的创新越多。我想要再问一下 Kok Poh June，PDD 的数据是海量的。请问推动智慧城市、智慧国家方面，到底如何更好地利用数据呢？PDD 的计划是什么呢？因为数据代表的是终生数据，它不是一个瞬时数据，你如何确定它可持续地发展呢？\n\n\\*\\*Kok Poh June：\\*\\*这个问题非常好，我们做的是创新的事情。过去我们开发基础设施时，开发的是物理基础设施，现在我们在开发物理基础设施的同时，同步开发数字基础设施。在开发过程中，也是分为多个层级的。第一个是数据的结构，大家会去探讨商业服务，企业的商业服务如何与数据基础结构并行不悖。同时数据基础结构，如何更好地支持 PDD 智慧城市。当然大量的数据将会被收集，被传输，从而确保整个的智慧城市、智慧园区的有效运行。当前我们正在做一个项目叫做开放数字平台（ODP, Open Digital Platform），平台将会接入 PDD 各种数据场景，包括整个 PDD 开发过程中，所产生的数据，还有附近的城镇数据。这样的话，就有一个系统做数据的集成，这是一个非常高效的系统，能够让我们更好地实现管理。\n\n同时我们对于街道的管理、对于制冷、对于停车，都能进行中心化的有效管理。这意味着在后台，我们有一个系统，这样的系统可以实现很好的集成，很好满足个人的需求，这一切都是我们所拥有的数据所驱动。我们为个人提供良好的居住体验，大楼里有自动温度，你不需要去调。而且建筑会逐渐理解人的需求，使用建筑时间越长，建筑对人的需求理解越深。这意味着虚实世界的数据和现实世界的数据实现交融，希望在这个过程中时延会比较少，这样我们就能够从不同的企业去分享数据，不同的层面进行数据的分享。所以在这方面，我非常有信心，万向也提供了很多多很好的想法，提供可信服务这是很重要的一点。\n\n\\*\\*Steven：\\*\\*你提到了开放数字平台（ODP, Open Digital Platform），给我们提供了很好的想法，而且这个平台也能为学界和大学所用，如果它能提供低时延服务的话。你提到了数据安全性，虽然我们拥有海量的数据，但是大家对于数据的分享存在着疑虑，有些人会抗拒数据的分享，而且有些人对数据分享持非常谨慎的态度。他们觉得数据是私人的隐私数据，请问区块链如何驱动数据的分享带到下一个阶段？\n\n\\*\\*王允臻：\\*\\*我觉得数据分享，需要保证数据的安全性，需要保护数据。第二，确保数据可信，也就是不是假数据，或没有经过验证。\n\n第三，哪怕解决了上述两个问题，依然还有一些问题有待回答。比如你对数据进行了保护和验证，下一步就是数据的价值是什么。你耗费了很大的精力，将数据验证，将数据收集过来。如果没有办法从数据结构中进行数据的挖掘的话，你做的是无济于事，对于城市不能产生任何好处。要回答前两个问题，我们通过安全计算和区块链技术、加密技术相结合。\n\n加密计算从本质上来说，允许我们获得安全性的数据主权，而且能够对数据进行验证，保护数据最好的方法不是不产生数据或避免数据的流通。这样的观点是对数据的虚无主义的看法，也就是你的数据必须要正式参与到生活中，数据必须要被投入积极的使用中。也就是说，保护数据的安全，不仅仅需要区块链技术，也需要机制设计，包括激励设计，还有治理工具。而这也是万向区块链公司所擅长的，接下来我们就进入到了数据挖掘和价值创造的领域。价值创造是通过生态系统，和合作伙伴所实现的，包括提供知识图谱。也就是说我们能够从数据中创造价值。\n\n第四，我们现在已经从数据中创造了价值，这个价值到底应该属于谁呢？是属于垄断型的科技企业吗？我们如何确保数据的价值，真正回归到数据的所有者手中，这需要机制设计和行为经济学，一道起作用。所以我们已经观察了，而且也进行了深入研究，我们从世界各地的智慧城市中大量研究，汲取了经验，其中也包括北美智慧城市中，有一些经验存在问题，所以这些做法后来被取消了。我们需要确保整个过程做得好，把整个城市的基础设施做好。我们要有远见，也需要怀谦逊之心，也需要有想象力。这样的谦逊，是存在于万向区块链公司的基因中。从公司成立的第一天开始，由于我们对于生态系统对于投资，我们没有办法。我们独木难支，在世界范围内投资了大量的企业，让它们帮助我们一道去实现愿景，这并不是说万向出海去寻求机会，相反，我们是非常期待和活跃，和活跃的学界、研究界和新加坡企业界，进行合作。这也是除了 PDD 项目给我们带来的吸引力之外，万向之所以选择进入新加坡，我们非常期待和 SIT 合作，同时也能从新加坡的年轻人那里获得灵感。因为新加坡的年轻人代表是未来数据的所有者，城市的所有者，城市的主人翁。\n\n\\*\\*Steven：\\*\\*您说得非常好，您的观点非常对，因为智慧城市并不是一个新的想法。大家一直讲智慧城市，人们只关注技术方面，就是如何去收集数据，它忽略了这期间有人问的因素，而且也忽略了数据真正的价值层面。您说得很对，将所有的数据放到统一的平台，你说我已经建成了智慧城市和智慧国家，你应该围绕数据做生态系统，从而释放数据的价值。\n\n下面的问题，问一下 Kok Poh June，对于万向这样的中国企业来说，如何进一步参与到 PDD 的项目中呢？\n\n\\*\\*Kok Poh June：\\*\\*这个问题非常好，从王总的介绍中，感觉可以一起和 PDD 做很多事情。关于可持续性我多讲几句，包括能源的效率。如果没有智慧技术，我们没有办法实现的，包括能源效率的一系列可持续的目标。还有数据的安全性和人类的行为非常重要，作为项目的业主，如果能够更好地去管理企业的能源效率。比如万向信任我们，我们可以帮助他们管理能源的效率，这一点非常好，也就是我确实诚挚希望更多的中国伙伴参与到 PDD 项目，这个项目非常好，从技术角度，它代表了更多技术的融合，我们期待更多的合作伙伴，能够进入到新加坡，一起做 PDD 项目。\n\n\\*\\*Steven：\\*\\*遗憾的是，今天时间确实有限，各位嘉宾探讨了生态系统的建设，我们看到了数据的收集、分享、信任，可以通过区块链技术来实现打造可信的数据基础设施。归根到底，大家齐聚一堂，分享想法，让愿景变成现实，再次感谢王总，非常遗憾。今天时间有限，期待接下来有更多的探讨。如果各位听众对 PDD 项目感兴趣的话，可以联系今天的圆桌嘉宾，再次感谢各位的聆听，也感谢炉边谈话的嘉宾。\n\n\\*\\*王允臻：\\*\\*今天我们的讨论非常精彩，我也期待在未来进一步深化合作，感谢！\n\n\n***\n\n2021 年 7 月 28 日，在新加坡榜鹅数字园区（Punggol Digital

生态的可持续性发展是必不可少的两个方面。\n\n**演讲：王语薇，万通投资控股股份有限公司副总裁，《艺术商业》出版人及清华大学社会科学学院特聘研究员**\n\n在 10 月 27 日举行的第七届万向区块链全球峰会上，万通投资控股股份有限公司副总裁、《艺术商业》出版人及清华大学社会科学学院特聘研究员王语薇带来了「价值革命？NFT 及数字资产的兴起」 的主题演讲。以下为演讲内容。\n\n\n***\n\n![万通副总裁王语薇：如何将 NFT 价值革命进行到底？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/a0ef6fe9a3f35bbaae2f90f69a3455ec.jpg-article)\n\n我今天的题目是「价值革命？NFT 及数字资产的兴起」。希望从社会学的角度，分享一下对这个话题的思考。\n\n2021 年无疑又是颠覆大家价值观的一年，这些表情包、头像、电子宠物、体育比赛的精彩瞬间，甚至一条推特，上网就可以免费观看的东西，只要变成了 NFT 就可以具备某种价值，搞得大家脑洞打开，好像万物皆可 NFT，这些价值怎么被创造出来呢？回到十年前，就会发现加密世界的价值逻辑一直在经历一个演变的过程。\n\nNFT 成为了可以跟互联网上所有内容绑定的事物，把价值的载体进一步的扩大了。所有这些现象背后的价值，我们一般会归功于区块链技术。其实从本质上来讲，区块链就是一种数据库，它具备一些非常特殊的结构和特征。我们将它比喻为颠覆性的技术革命，称其为信任的机器或价值互联网。问题来了，信任是产品吗？只要使用区块链技术就可以创造信任吗？那数据是如何变成信任和价值的呢？\n\n无论我们使用什么技术，所有的数据库不管是中心化还是去中心化数据库，它的核心逻辑是谁可以添加、记录、更改数据，以及为什么相信它。这不是一个单纯的技术问题，而是和人相关的问题，从技术到信任、到价值，并不是一个技术可以自动化完成的过程，需要在人与人、人与系统、人与社会中来理解。我认为它是一个多元的社会学问题，这是我的博士学论文。我认为里面有三大问题，首先从制度层面来解释我们为什么信任的问题。\n\n它好比一个项目的白皮书，需要提出一系列的规则、共识和机制，给信任提供足够的理由。有了系统还不够，还要提供功能和互动模式，使它在不断运行过程中持续创造信任。最后文化要解决的是是否应该信任的问题，即使我没有足够的理由、足够的功能和互动，都不能够回答的问题，而是需要在一个文化的环境、意义的体系和社会共同体的价值观去寻找答案。所以我今天想从这个框架中，跟大家分享一下我对 NFT 的思考。\n\nNon-fungible Token 这个概念从哪来的呢？「Fungible」这个词，不光咱们不认识，即使在西方的英语世界中，它也不是一个日常用语，它是一个经济学概念，用来指大宗商品，比如货币、股份，这种种类物。它们的特征是，每一个单位都可以相互替换，因为只有这样才便于流通和交换。所以这些 fungible 是所有货币类资产的重要属性。Non-fungible 是指非同质、不可替换，每个单位都拥有某种不同属性的特定物。在自然世界中，绝大部分事物，由于自身物理性差异，在某种意义上都是 Fungible，就像世界上没有两片相同的树叶一样。而传统的有形资产，像车、房、艺术品、珠宝、股东，这些都是特定物，不能被随意替换。但是人其实是最典型的特定物，我们每个人都是一个独立的存在，我们有一个特殊的身份不能被随意替换，所以我是 Non-fungible。\n\n当我们成为了 GDP 的经济计算单位时，我们也会变成 Fungible 的种类物，就是我贡献的 DGP 和你贡献的 GDP 是可以相互替换，没有差异的。所以 Fungible 是一个经济学语境下才能理解的概念，它也不是绝对的区别，而是一个程度的区别。我们把 Fungible 和 Non-fungible 放在一个轴的两端，就会看到，偏向 Fungible 都是类似于货币资产的流通物，而偏向 Non-fungible 都是具备某种不可替代价值的特殊物。像艺术品、收藏品这些特别强调特殊性价值的事物，就是最典型的 Non-fungible 的事物。\n\n什么是数字资产呢？我们都知道信息的最小单位是比特，而比特是由 0 和 1 这两个二进制符号组成，数字资产是所有基于二进制的集合，所组成的独立、可识别、具有一定价值的资产形式。由于二进制是所有的计算机设备可以理解被运行的唯一的形式，所以它也是数字资产化的决定性特征。这里出现了一个问题，0 和 1 在本质上可以被低成本的复制和传播，所以数字资产在这个意义上，它就失去了自然界物质本身拥有的非同质性、稀缺和独特等属性的特性，而趋于数字化和同质化。我们如何确定数字资产的非同质性呢？当比特成为了特定资产的载体，我们面临的问题怎么把 Fungible 的 bits 变成 Non-fungible 的 Stucture。在区块链系统诞生以前，这个过程必须有可信第三方，也就是权威机构的背书完成的。他们需要基于自己的信用背书，为资产提供数字化的形式和所有权的记录和证明。\n\nNFT 在我看来，是通过一种新的社会架构解决了这个问题，就是分布式网络和区块链的信任机制。从制度层面上来看，现在绝大部分的 NFT 是基于以太坊的制度架构而运行的，ERC721 和 ERC1155 是如何记录交易和追踪 NFT 所有权形成的标准。但我昨天也听到了 V 神讲，以太坊的制度架构本身也在经历一个快速变化的过程，NFT 的制度架构正在经历一个非常早期和快速变化的时期。我们已经看到了一个非常重要的制度创新，就是它被一种数字所有权的东西提供证明。什么是数字所有权呢？看左边的钻石，购买这颗钻石会得到一个 GIA 机构提供的证书，证书需要对钻石的很多细节做出精确的记录，从而证明这颗钻石的独特性。\n\nBeeple 的这个作品是一个数字艺术作品，也是一颗钻石。以太坊不要求发布者发布这个作品的任何信息，它能记录的只是一个名称，一个非常简短的说明，以及一个数字文件可能存在的地方。你拥有一个 NFT，不但不拥有任何实物资产，甚至连这个数字资产都不能形成排他性的占有。同时这个数字资产的占有，既非其价值的充分条件，也非必要条件。所以 NFT 的诞生就为这些原来根本没有办法去物质化和客观化的有价值的数字资产提供一种新的渠道。它其实带来的很多的新的可能性，同时也提出了很多新的问题。\n\n首先什么是数字资产的所有权呢？我们知道现在全世界对于 NFT 究竟代表物权、债权还是知识产权，都还没有一个标准的判断。它有没有可能，重新定义数字资产的真实性问题呢？假如有两个数字文件在于手机里一模一样，我们能否判断一个真的，另外一个是假的呢？\n\n第三，它对一个根本没有办法进行交易的资产类别，提供了超越国家边界的新兴全球性市场和价格发现机制。它基于智能合约，它的所有交易自动留痕。NFT 的留痕，是留在交易系统中，为未来新的交易方式和可能性打开了一个非常新的局面。\n\n最后由于它可编程，也就是可以基于智能合约对 NFT 的交易方式、应用场景、中间可能存在的权益分配，进行全新的处理和定义。即使这样，大家依然会问，如果不能拥有这个 NFT 背后的数字资产，为什么要买它呢？在目前的阶段，NFT 重构了数字世界中所谓独特性和稀缺性这两个非常关键的概念。因为 NFT 的独特性不是一种自然属性，而是一种基于区块链分布式网络构建的独特的数据结构。并基于全网的共识，获得了某种客观性和真实性。但是在这种独特性的基础上，人们从收藏的动机想，我希望拥有这个独特的东西。从炫耀的角度，希望别人知道我拥有这个独特的东西。从投资的角度，我相信还有很多人想要拥有这个独特的东西。同时它把稀缺性的概念也变化了，就是艺术作品的稀缺性转变为了数字所有权的稀缺性。我们看到这个 CryptoPunks，大家上网可以随意下载传播，但是拥有 CryptoPunks 的人，不在乎多少人占有这个资产，甚至说他希望越来越多的人拥有它，他越高兴。所以在这个产品极大丰富，且复制成本越来越低的世界，所谓的物质的稀缺性，也就是越少越值钱的逻辑，已经被这个注意力的稀缺性，也就是越有名越值钱的逻辑所取代了。\n\n现在 NFT 一定处于一个非常早期，但是高度火热的市场。只是你只是铸造 NFT，很难实现交易。就是拿 Beeple 来说，他在发布 NFT 之前，在社交媒体拥有一个庞大的粉丝数量。有了 NFT 以后，他创建了一个社群。同时跟所有人说，可以免费下载我的作品，把他的作品变成 NFT，用 1 块钱卖掉。传统的艺术市场中，当一个艺术家卖掉艺术作品以后，之后这个作品在二级市场的价格表现，跟这个艺术家没有直接关系了。由于 NFT 可以基于智能合约去定义交易规则，它可以规定，每次交易 NFT 时，都有一定的收入回到创作者的手中。这就使艺术家从创作者具备了某种运营者的角色，Beeple 自己在一次访谈中说，购买我作品的人，投资的不是作品，主要是我这个人。\n\n从收藏者的角度来讲，他也变成了运营者，这是买 Beeple 画的人，他是早期的币圈投资者，也有 NFT 的基金。他购买了 BP 的画以后，他成立了一个艺术品指数基金叫 B20。大概的逻辑是，你不能买黄金，可以买黄金指数。他通过收藏艺术，也变成了收藏艺术家，把艺术家对社会的影响力变成了一种金融产品，并持续参与这个价值创造的过程。所以我们知道，如果 NFT 想要实现长期的价值，社区是至关重要的，正是因为它的价值的承担者，是一个共同认可某种文化符号的群体。左边是第一个可以支持多人合作模式的可编程的加密作品，它由一个 22 个 Layer 的 NFT 和一个 Master 的 NFT 组成的，每个 Layer 的 NFT 都可以单独交易，当一个人购买了这个 Layer 时，可以在一定范围内改变这个 Layer 的形态。所以这是一个会随着交易和时间的发展，而不断变化的作品。在这个意义上，收藏者也变成了创作者，他们在一个共同的价值创造的过程中，凝聚成为了一个所谓的共同体。\n\n右边是最近大火的猴子，到处都能看到。这两个创始人都是艺术背景，从 2017 年开始就是非常想要接触亏铺头（音）这个世界，苦于当时没有一个语境和渠道，完全是技术和金融的属性。他们看到 NFT 以后，创始人就说，以太坊上终于有文化的一席之地了。所以他想怎么创造一个社区，让这些很有创意性的人聚在一起，在亏铺头（音）的世界做一些事情，即使它只是一个荒谬的猴子俱乐部。\n\n社会科学的诞生本身可以被定位在那个时刻，所有的事物、观念及物质对象都被等同于价值，从而一切东西都与社会有关，并从社会获得其存在，无论是好、坏或可感对象的时候。信息社会的价值逻辑就是梅特卡夫定律，也就是一个网络的价值和用户的平方成正比，因为信息的价值来源于复制和传播，把信息藏在家里是没有价值的。NFT 作为一种信息的载体，它目前的价值主要体现在展示和交易。\n\n但问题在于更多的信息就等于更多的价值吗？陈词烂掉和有效信息难道没有区别吗？信息社会现在一个根本的问题，就是巨大的通信量和不断缩小的有效信息量之间的矛盾。所以我认为，真正的挑战在于如何将 NFT 的价值革命进行到底。就是我们知道一个 NFT 具有两方面的价值，一方面是以 Token 这种形式承载的货币化价值，这部分价值使 NFT 得以流通，引入巨大的社会资源。问题在于所有货币类价值实际上都是 Fungible，另外一方面，是需要有社会、经济、文化这些领域的发展，形成真正多元的价值体系。而这两个方面，对于 NFT 生态的可持续性而言，都是必不可少的。如果我们只把注意力集中在 Token 层面，是没有办法看到这个价值的可持续发展的。那么 NFT 的独特性就只是形式上的，而非实质上的。一个 NFT 的价值也可以轻易被其他同类型的 NFT 所取代。\n\n所以我认为在数字世界中，技术本身不足以决定什么是好的和有价值的，而是需要由人决定。我们希望在这个世界中看到什么新的概念、审美和价值观，能够超越所谓的社会注意力这个转瞬即逝的事情，需要所有的文化内容创作者共同努力。\n\n在这个长期目标下，万通控股和艺术商业成立了数字以上创新实验室，我们的目标希望联动科技创新和文化艺术行业的内容创作者，去挖掘具有长期价值、可以持续数字人文的内容。\n\n最后我引用曼德拉这句话，就是金钱不能创造成功，而创造金钱的自由可以。\n\n希望大家都能生活在一个充满了自由创造的数字世界，谢谢大家！",

The CPU will carry 6 Golden Cove and 4 Gracemont cores for a total of 10 cores (6+4) & 16 threads (12+4). The P-cores (Golden Cove) will operate at a maximum boost frequency of up to 4.9 GHz with 1-2 active cores and 4.5 GHz with all-cores active while the E-cores (Gracemont) will operate at 3.6 GHz across 1-4 cores & up to 3.4 GHz when all cores are loaded. The CPU will feature 20 MB of L3 cache and TDP values are maintained at 125W (PL1) and 228W (PL2).\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n* \n* \n\nThe performance benchmarks show the Intel Core i5-12600K blasting up the single-core test with a score of 773 points and the multi-core test with 7220 points. This puts the Core i5 Alder Lake at a massive 50% lead over the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and even faster than AMD's 8 core and 16 thread Ryzen 7 5800X which is very impressive. Versus the [leaked Core i5-12400 benchmarks](https://wccftech.com/intel-core-i5-12400-alder-lake-budget-desktop-cpu-with-6-cores-faster-than-amd-ryzen-5-5600x-in-leaked-benchmarks/), the Core i5-12600K offers a 45% increase in multi-threaded performance which means that those E-cores are being used properly plus the higher clock speeds really push the performance even further. Even Intel's Rocket Lake flagship couldn't keep up with the new Core i5 chip which ends up 13% faster in single and 10% faster in the multi-core tests.\n\nThe Intel Core i5-12600K beats the Rocket Lake flagship, the Core i9-11900K, with ease and it shows that Intel is seriously going to give AMD a tough time in the mainstream segment if these numbers are to be believed. We are just a few weeks away from the NDA lift and the Core i5-12600K is going to be one chip that many consumers, especially gamers, are going to be interested in.\n\n## Intel Core i5 Desktop CPU Generational Comparison\n\nCPU NameCore i5-12600KCore i5-11600KCore i5-10600KCore i5-9600KCore i5-8600KCore i5-7600KCore i5-6600KFamily12th Gen Alder Lake11th Gen Rocket Lake10th Gen Comet Lake9th Gen Coffee Lake8th Gen Coffee Lake7th Gen Kaby Lake6th Gen SkylakeArchitectureGolden Cove (P-Core) \n Gracemont (E-Core)Cypress CoveSkylakeSkylakeSkylakeSkylakeSkylakeProcess NodeIntel 7 (10nm ESF)14nm14nm14nm14nm14nm14nmCPU Cores10 (6+4)666644CPU Threads16 (12+4)12126644Base Clock3.70 GHz (P-Core) \n 2.80 GHz (E-Core)3.90 GHz4.10 GHz3.70 GHz3.60 GHz3.90 GHz3.50 GHzBoost Clock4.90 GHz (P-Core) \n 3.60 GHz (E-Core)4.90 GHz4.80 GHz4.60 GHz4.30 GHz4.20 GHz3.90 GHzCache20 MB L312 MB L312 MB L39 MB L39 MB L36 MB L36 MB L3TDP (PL1)95W95W95W95W95W91W91WPrice$262?$262$262$262$257$257$242Launch2021202120202018201720172015\n\nSo we know that the performance should match or surpass the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X but what's the pricing going to be like. It is stated that the Core i5-12600K should follow the pricing of the previous Intel Core i5 chips. If we look at the historical pricing of Intel's Core i5 CPUs starting with 7th Gen & up till the recent 11th Gen Rocket Lake parts, you will see that the MSRP has remained within the $260-$270 US price range. Intel is unlikely to change the pricing model of Core i5 CPUs with its 12th Gen processors so if that's the case, we will be looking at the Core i5-12600K at around $260 US. It should also be noted that a 'KF' variant would also be introduced that could retail around $25-$30 US lower, bringing the overall pricing down to the $235-$245 range.\n\n[DeepCool Joins Other PC Cooling Manufacturers in Offering LGA 1700 Intel Alder Lake CPU Compatibility with Free Upgrade Kit](https://wccftech.com/deepcool-joins-other-pc-cooling-manufacturers-in-offering-lga-1700-intel-alder-lake-cpu-compatibility-with-free-upgrade-kit/)\n\nNow think about it this way, you are essentially getting slightly better performance than the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, a $400 US+ chip, in a processor that costs $30 US lower than the Ryzen 5 5600X. It sounds like an absolutely phenomenal deal. Obviously, there are a few drawbacks which include investing in a brand new platform and migrating to a new OS platform ([Windows 11 in this case](https://wccftech.com/intel-alder-lake-p-core-e-core-detailed-golden-cove-offers-50-higher-single-threaded-hybrid-design-offers-50-higher-multi-threaded-performance/)) which would raise the cost and effort but if you set your mind aside from these short-term concerns, the Core i5-12600K could end up serving you far better performance at an insane value proposition. Furthermore, it is also stated that owing to the 12600K being segmented in the Core i5 lineup, its power consumption and thermals won't be as rampant as the high-end models.\n\nNews Source: [TUM_APISAK](https://twitter.com/TUM_APISAK/status/1452863833953824771)\n\n#### Products mentioned in this post\n\n[Core i9-11900K \n USD 544.89](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08X6PPTTH?tag=wccftechplug-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\n[Ryzen 9 5900x \n USD 838.98](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NXYLBN5?tag=wccftechplug-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1)\n\nThe links above are affiliate links.

表示混合型智能合约不仅限于区块链，而且能够通过预言机网络访问链下资源，让开发者实现更多的创新。\n\n**演讲：Sergey Nazarov， Chainlink 联合创始人**\n\n在 10 月 27 日举行的第七届万向区块链全球峰会上，Chainlink 联合创始人 Sergey Nazarov 及中国区负责人费联浦带来了关于混合型智能合约的分享。以下内容整理自演讲会场。\n\n\n***\n\n\\*\\*费联浦：\\*\\*很荣幸介绍下一位发言人，也就是 Chainlink 的联合创始人 Sergey Nazarov。Chainlink 为全球预言机网络设立了标准，为混合型智能合约提供服务，并将区块链应用连接至真实世界的数据。Chainlink 未开发者提供了最丰富的优质数据源和最安全的链下计算资源，可以覆盖任何区块链上的智能合约，帮助智能合约实现更强大的功能。Chainlink 为全球顶级区块链几百个项目，保障了数百亿美元的价值，其中包括以太坊等。Sergey Nazarov 将分享智能合约的总体发展趋势、智能合约功能的发展历程，以及技术创新将为区块链解锁应用哪些新的功能。他将提到一些创新，不仅包含去中心化金融，还包含非同质化通证、游戏和保险等众多新兴行业。Sergey Nazarov 将重点谈混合型智能合约如何推动这些发展趋势，混合型智能合约不仅限于区块链，而且能够通过预言机网络访问链下资源。他将深入探讨 Chainlink 如何推动混合型智能合约的发展，专注于开发跨链服务，特别是跨链互操作性协议来联通所有区块链。\n\n最后 Sergey Nazarov 将畅想未来，探讨这种连接性如何推动刚接触企业和机构进入这个新兴领域，下面有请 Chainlink 的联合创始人 Sergey Nazarov。\n\n![Chainlink 联合创始人 ：混合型智能合约将为去中心化应用带来新机会](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/e55aaa6d63af5601aac49fae50bf6c2c.jpg-article)\n\n\\*\\*Sergey Nazarov （线上）：\\*\\*Chainlink 将实现点对点的交易。首先我们要记住的一点是，智能合约的构建方式和应用范围在不断的发展，智能合约最初是一条区块链上的一行简单的代码。智能合约的定义快速迭代，变成了一代代码，智能合约首先是通证合约。这就是智能合约最初的架构，现在出现了各种各样的金融协议，比如去中心化的保险，如今的智能合约包含了一系列链上代码，以及各种线下最小化信任系统，也就是预言机的机构。Chainlink 为用户提供上百个、上千个预言机网络，现在我们的范围已经拓展到了各种信任最下化的链下计算。因此智能合约的定义不断发展进化，从最初的单个合约，发展到同一链上的各个合约，到现在多个合约可以接入预言机，提供不同的随机数，以及各种合约的接入。我们相信未来合约的数量会不断增长，也会有越来越多的链下去中心化预言机和网络。智能合约的定义现在也扩大成了，包含在各个链条上的多个合约，每个合约都可以接入不同的预言机网络，获取数据计算机资源。随着智能合约的发展，人们可以在智能合约上加入越来越多的元素，智能合约也可以帮助解决越来越多的社会问题，并实现点对点的交易，所以出现了越来越多的金融产品和服务，同时我们也看到了越来越多的保险产品、去中心化防欺诈游戏，以及越来越多的使用加密技术制成的合约。这些产品都是基于混合智能合约架构打造的，这就是我们的目标，我们的目标是将混合型智能合约架构应用于现实世界中，提供各种链下服务，包括经过验证的数据，为随机数生成信任最下化的链下计算。甚至通过跨链通信技术，打造更先进的跨链智能合约。\n\n这类似于互联网的发展轨迹，我们在互联网世界中，有许多人接入几百个服务，开发各种复杂的 Web 应用，应用中嵌入了很多服务。还接入了很多外部服务，包括支付、信息传输功能。这将会打造出最具价值的 Web 应用，这也就是区块链行业需要发展的方向。我们需要建立一个快速迭代、面向服务的基础架构，集中包括一些是链上，一些是链下。我们提供的是链下服务，包括链下的数据，以及确保输入智能合约的数据是真实可靠的。除此之外，我们需要一些链下的计算资源，比如预言机网络。现在我们的服务还加入了跨链数据验证，以及跨链数据传输，以及跨链通证转移。开发者不仅可以开发出丰富数据的智能合约，也可以通过预言机网络执行链上无法进行的计算，要使得这个智能合约更加的混合，我们的开发者开发出来了联通其他链上服务和其他代码的智能合约。你可以打造出来一个同时覆盖许多区块链的应用，其他链上的用户，也可以使用这个应用。同时你的应用仍然是在一条核心区块链上运行的，你仍然可以享受到区块链上的优势，比如可拓展性等等。你不仅可以灵活选择应用所运行的核心的区块链，还可以灵活地访问任何所需的链下数据，以及计算资源。\n\n同时我们可以保障计算是基于最小的信任化，也可以灵活地访问其他链上的所有智能合约，或者把你的智能合约高效地拓展到其他链上。同时我们可以保证这种无缝的连接，这是行业下一阶段的发展方向。一方面为金融的合约提供数据，提供最小化的链下计算。来实现区块链无法实现的功能，同时与区块链的状态结合，我们深度参与并推动了整个过程的发展。另外一个发展，就是区块链企业和机构应用，我们知道这个区域发展得很快，一些是因为区块链跟智能合约的效率，一些是市场经济的因素，一些是由于客户的需求。客户希望从企业、机构获得这样的应用。我们已经集成了几百个这样的链，这样的话，我们就建立了一个抽象层，这个抽象层相当于企业访问所有区块链的接口，这也就是说无论是企业、机构、政府还是私营公司，它们不需要研究每个区块链。如果是跨国企业，它需要跟全世界各个企业打交道，不得不跟不同的区块链交互。因为在全世界的不同地区、不同行业，可能会有不同的区块链。有些是交易衍生品，有些是证券，有些是国际贸易，还有广告、网络等等。也就是未来区块链的格局会不断变化，不同垂直区域也会有它们的区块链。但是对于这些企业和机构来说，它们需要跟不同的区块链环境进行交互，但是由于我们在区块链环境中发布了预言机网络，我们就发布了执行计算机的网络。我们同时可以帮这些集成的项目保障了数百亿美元的价值，为智能合约提供服务。所有这些集成，都经历了时间的考验，他们现在都非常成熟。因为我们知道核心开发者希望在他们的生态中，集成这样的服务，使得我们有越来越多的去中心化服务，可以服务于这样的区块链生态。链上开发者生态，是衡量一条区块链发展的真实目标。随着我们现在提供成百上千个去中心化的预言机网络，这些都可以帮助我们赋能智能合约，同时我们也积累了越来越多的集成案例，有一些开发者负责维护区块链和 Chainlink 的集成，他们不仅会使用 Chainlink。甚至是区块链的核心开发团队，也希望对集成进行操作，这样使得来自企业后端的交易和指令，都可以通过这个接口来传输。最终会对所有人有好处，对区块链来说，在链上可以输入大量的指令，可以高效运行。企业不需要每个季度研究 10 到 15 条的区块链，只需要在交易对手方选择的环境中开展交易。通过这样单一的抽象层，我们可以辅助这样一些交互，同时它也会更好地改善银行、保险、国际贸易，以及贸易金融等各个领域的客户体验。\n\n毫无疑问，如果作为跨国企业的话，你将需要高效地跟不同的区块链进行交互。所以这对企业来说，是一个非常大的技术壁垒。因为区块链有它的安全性和复杂性，所谓的复杂性，才需要我们建立抽象层。API 接口就是一个抽象层，为用户提供各种资源的平台，也是抽象层。除了通过去中心化预言机网络提供服务外，所关心的另外一个领域。CCIP 就是我们这个领域的工作成果，我们正在为跨链传输信息，开发一个全局的标准。这里的重要的细微差别就是信息传输，CCIP 是跨链互操作协议，不仅支持通证的转移，转移通证的同时可以传输信息。因为消息是大多数金融系统的核心要素，消息可以传达指令，以及如何转移通证。总体来说，CCIP 是我们和区块链行业顶尖的开发团队共同合作的结果。包括各个金融智能合约的团队，以及区块链上的一些众多中心化的金融平台。同时我们还携手了其他一些组织。专注于消息传输还有另外一个好处，不仅可以通过跨链来发送任何通证，同时可以发送你想要的操作。控制你想要通证。同时也可以 NFT，同时还可以在中央数字货币和 NFT 上加上指令，还可以命令通证如何桥接。只有通过建立抽象层，才可以保障数百亿的美元资产，在这样的链上进行数据的传输。同时它可以帮助我们提高信任和安全性，所以我们非常专注于 CCIP 的开发。这也帮我们解决了最关键的问题，就是作为企业来说，如何跟不同的区块链交互。其实最终的解决方案，还是通过抽象层。\n\n我们一开始通过服务实现这样的抽象层，而现在这个抽象层逐渐演变成信息、消息传输的中枢。企业不需要逐一研究 50 条或更多的区块链，甚至他们不需要拥有这些区块链上的钱包。它们之需要向抽象层或框架发送他们的指令，这样的指令可以确保信息的安全，同时也可以确保这些指令可以在目标链上正确执行。所有的智能合约的状态，也会被监控，而且这个监控结果也会发回企业自身的系统里面。在这种情况下，构建了这么一层抽象层。这个抽象层非常常见，一般来说，这个机制同样适用于中央数字货币。如果这个中央数字货币是基于区块链的话，抽象层的价值也会被实现，它可以实现各个系统之间的交互，比如说金融贸易的区块链、游戏里的区块链、以及央行数字货币的区块链。而抽象层负责传输的是所有的事件和信息，只是对于不同的区块链而言，它们的信息内容可能不一样，所以这就是我们讲的抽象层。\n\n非常感谢大家对这个话题的兴趣，我希望在不久的将来，可以跟大家面对面交流。\n\n\\*\\*费联浦：\\*\\*刚刚 Sergey Nazarov 讲到，混合型智能合约可以为去中心化应用带来的新机会，用一句话总结，也就是接入链下资源，可以让开发者实现更多的创新。正如 Sergey Nazarov 所说，将各种不同的服务和数据类型连接在一起，可以创造无限价值。我们现在使用的一系列互联网服务连接在一起，共同构成了 Web2.0，而 Web3.0 会遵循同样的发展逻辑，将新一代去中心化互联网服务连接在一起。为了推动 Web3.0 的发展，Chainlink 开发跨链户操作性协议，也就是 CCIP，在跨链交互上，它制定了新的全局标准。Sergey Nazarov 在演讲中提到了一个重点，也就是 CCIP 对跨链消息传输非常重要。消息是现代金融和计算系统中的核心要素，通过消息传输功能可以跨链发送指令。在一个生态中，如果可以跨链发送指令，区块链之间就可以真正实现无缝交互地通信。Sergey Nazarov 在演讲中提到最有意思的一点，也就是 CCIP 可以将区块链连接至更广阔的现实世界。在未来的多链世界中，企业和机构不想把所有的筹码压到一条链上，又没有足够的资源去研究各种区块链。有了 CCIP 企业可以无缝接入任何所需的区块链，这个功能将打造出一个良性循环，提升整个区块链的生态价值。\n\n这个良性循环就是，随着越来越多的企业接入区块链，也会有更多区块链希望提升自己的连通性。随着越来越多的区块链连通性提升，区块链对企业的使用价值也会虽之升高。所有这些要素结合在一起，最终将使区块链充分发挥潜力和价值。如果大家想进一步了解 Chainlink，请访问我们的官网，如果你所在的企业想用 Chainlink 进行开发，请联系我。\n\n让我们再次感谢 Sergey Nazarov 和各位的聆听，谢谢大家！", "timestamp": 1635339224, "digest": "rF9O57EQyLpyoVWYpFmA6fJ_47bsBb5zjI2n5yjc5xU", "contributor":

{"id": "EJV1p6EqVt_4owep9uCd-XIxRA8tzBQ_s69l12bRtaY", "title": "揭开明星 DeFi 协议治理的梦想、现实与可能演进方向", "body": "> DeFi 治理日新月异的浪潮已经开始，DeFi 协议纷纷采用方法争取在决策效率与权力去中心化之间取得平衡。\n\n**撰文：Ellen Guo，@e^{i} Ventures 分析师编译：Perry Wang**\n\n人类一直在进行治理系统的宏大实验，来协调那些影响自己集体未来的决策。治理是一个纷繁复杂且艰难的过程，几乎为所有人类努力奠定了基础。今天，去中心化金融（DeFi）是数千年人类经验与互联网社区速度和规模相结合的交叉点，可编程货币和信任最小化交易的强大创新也被融入其中。\n\n在过去的一年中，DeFi 彻底改变了加密货币世界， DeFi 应用不仅追求去信任和无需许可的交易，而且还通过治理实现决策的去中心化。其目标不是由受信任的专家组成的中心化核心团队为用户社区做出决策，而是由社区参与和投票直接决定变化。\n\n为了更深入地了解人类伟大实验的这一最新篇章，我调查了去中心化治理的现状，以确定哪些行之有效，哪些革命尚未成功、同志仍需努力。\n\n### 背景\n\n去中心化协议的治理是指：协议的各个参与者如何对协议的未来共同做出决策。DeFi 协议参与者在执行有利于协议的操作时，通常会获得治理代币奖励。参与者所持有的治理代币数量，通常与其投票权相关联。迄今为止，大多数去中心化协议都遵循一币一票的方法，其中每个代币都赋予其持币者对社区提案的投票权。提案通常旨在修改和升级协议。\n\nCompound 于 2020 年 6 月发布的 COMP，启动了 [收益耕种](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClnnLI1SClA&ab_channel=Finematics) 和 DeFi 治理日新月异的浪潮。从那时起，很多其他协议纷纷采用了各种新颖的治理方法。\n\n#### 治理形式\n\nDeFi 协议治理分为两种主要范式：链上和链下。\n\n#### 链上投票\n\n由 Compound 首创的链上治理系统是通过智能合约交互，在区块链上进行整个提案、投票和实施的过程。提议者使用可执行命令列表，调用合约的 `propose （提案）` 函数，如果提议获得通过，这些命令就会运行。投票者直接与智能合约互动进行投票。在投票期结束时，对所投票进行统计，提案或在链上执行，或者宣告失败。\n\n由于链上投票要求提案为可执行代码，因此只需执行代码即可保证成功提案获得实施。结果是安全的，最终计票的诚信度受到链上共识强大安全性的保护。\n\n但是，在链上治理系统中提交提案需要参与者具备高度的技术能力。此外，根据底层链的具体机制，提议者和投票者可能会 [花费大量交易费用](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price) 才能参与。\n\n#### 链下投票\n\n链下治理系统允许用户提交提案和投票，而无需提交区块链交易。最常见的链下投票平台 [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) 是开源软件，它将提案和投票作为签名消息存储在 [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/) 上。Snapshot 使协议团队成员可以灵活地在 Snapshot 上创建自己的空间，包括设置确定持币者投票权的规则。\n\n链下投票避免了交易费用，鼓励了社区成员更广泛地参与，但它需要一个受信任的第三方来统计选票。此外，成功提案的实施并不像执行代码那么简单。获得批准的提案可能需要核心团队或其他代表采取链下行动，例如编写新代码或文档、雇用人员、获得法律意见或进行链下金融交易。\n\n### 基本信息：DeFi 协议治理背景\n\n每个协议的发展历史和代币经济学彼此间存在差异，可以帮助我们确定哪些行之有效，哪些未能成功。\n\n治理一直在发展变化中，本文的数据更新截止 2021 年 8 月 19 日。\n\n#### Compound\n\nCompound 的链上治理于 2020 年 4 月 16 日与 [GovernorAlpha](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc0da01a04c3f3e0be433606045bb7017a7323e38#code) 智能合约一起上线。在 [第 42 号提案](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/42) （2021 年 3 月）之后，社区迁移到 [GovernorBravo](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc0da02939e1441f497fd74f78ce7decb17b66529#code)。\n\n最初，任何向协议委托超过 100,000 COMP 的地址都可以创建提案（即调用 `propose`）。 2021 年 7 月 14 日执行的 [第 52 号提案](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/52) 将该门槛降低至 65,000 COMP。提案需要以绝对多数通过，且要求必须达到 > 40 万 COMP 的法定数值。\n\nCompound 还在 2020 年 9 月实施了 Compound Autonomous Proposals (CAP)，以降低创建提案的门槛，因为达到提案门槛所需的 COMP 耗资不菲（撰写本文时超过 4100 万美元）。现在，任何拥有 100 COMP 的人都可以创建一个 CAP，CAP 是一种智能合约，可以让其他社区成员将投票委托给它。一旦 CAP 获得的委托将满足 COMP 阈值，就会自动启动正式的链上提案。\n\n**以往议案**\n\n* 总提案数： 57\n* 已执行： 48\n* 未获通过： 4\n* 取消：4\n* 投票进行中：1\n\n**代币经济学**\n\nCompound 的治理围绕 COMP 代币进行，COMP 发行上限为 10,000,000。初始分布为：\n\n![揭开明星 DeFi

天的速度释出，以与每个市场应计利息成正比的比率分配给每个市场（请参阅这里了解当前详细信息）。在每个市场中，50% 给贷方，50% 给借方，用户赚取的 COMP 与其余额成正比。\n\n**Uniswap**\n\nUniswap 链上治理是 Compound GovernorAlpha 的一个分叉（尽管目前有提案要求迁移到 GovernorBravo），其功能与 Compound 的版本基本相同。该协议在 2020 年 9 月启动治理时，提案阈值设置为 1000 万 UNI，之后在 [4 号提案](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/0/4) 中降至 250 万 UNI。所需的法定数值始终为 4000 万 UNI。\n\n除了链上提议和投票之外，Uniswap 还鼓励在创建链上提议之前发出链下讯息。你可以点击 [这里](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/governance/process/) 查看详细信息。总而言之，Uniswap 指定了一个讨论论坛，以及 Snapshot Temperature Checks （如果支持票超过半数，且达到 2.5 万 UNI 的法定数值即获通过），然后进入论坛和 Snapshot Consensus Checks （如果支持票超过半数，且达到 5 万 UNI 的法定数值即获通过）。\n\n**以往提案**\n\n* 总提案数： 7\n* 已执行：3\n* 未获通过：2 (两个提案支持票比例达标，但未达到 UNI 法定数值)\n* 取消：1\n* 提案进行中 : 1\n* 链下提案总数：29\n* 通过： 18 (13 次 Temp Checks, 5 次 Consensus Checks)\\*\n* 未获通过： 11 (9 次 Temp Checks, 2 次 Consensus Checks)\n\n\\* 未标记的提案都是假设为 Temperature Checks。\n\n**代币经济学**\n\n当 UNI 代币于 2020 年 9 月 16 日上线时，共铸造了 10 亿个 UNI。 最初 4 年的分配如下图所示。UNI 为投资者、团队成员和顾问提供为期 4 年的分阶段退出计划。通胀率（2%/ 年）将在 4 年后开始引进。\n\n![揭开明星 DeFi 协议治理的梦想、现实与可能演进方向](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/dc1a83bf57cb59adaf575cb5ea737af0_mY2IPje.png-article)\n\nUNI 代币刚发行时，归属社区的份额（60%） 中 四分之一者（即 15%）[空投](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) 给流通性提供者（LP）、用户、SOCKS 持币者的钱包，这也是当时轰动加密社区的知名事件。治理金库保留 43% 份额，用于分配给贡献者的津贴、社区项目和流动性挖矿。这一分配由社区治理管理，社区所持有 UNI 的最后 2% 于 2020 年 9 月至 11 月通过流动性挖矿释出。\n\n#### Sushiswap\n\n与 Compound 和 Uniswap 不同，Sushiswap 的治理完全在链下使用 Snapshot 进行。目前，只有核心团队——[0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xMaki)（联合创始人）、[Omakase](https://twitter.com/OmakaseBar)（核心开发者）、[0xJiro](https://twitter.com/0xjiro?lang=en)（核心开发者）或 [Ross Campbell](https://twitter.com/r_ross_campbell)（律师）发布的提案，如果以法定数值通过（500 万 SUSHIPOWAH——参见代币经济学）才被认为具有约束力 。一旦「有约束力」提案获得通过，Sushi 团队必须手动实施更改，但这取决于团队是否在线。\n\n作为另一项安全检查措施，任何使用 devfund 钱包的通过提案都需要获得平台多重签名（@SBF_Alameda、@rleshner、@0xMaki、@lawmaster、@cmsholdings、@mattysino、@mickhagen、@JiroOno、@zippoxer）中至少 6 个签名者的批准，而且任何操作变更，例如资产再平衡和收益耕种资金池的管理、使用成长基金等，都需要来自 @0xMaki, @LevxApp, @OmakaseBar, @0xJiro, @0xKeno, @josephdelong, @MatthewLilley 中至少 3 人的签名 。\n\n不过，这种链下 Snapshot 投票（由核心团队成员发布）和多重签名的结构只是暂时性的，该团队 2021 年发展路线图表明，Sushi 的目标是到 2021 年第四季度过渡到成熟的 DAO。\n\n**以往提案**\n\n* 提案总数： 243\n* 核心团队提案总数： 61\\*\n\n\\*Sushiswap 提案的所有未来分析仅考虑核心团队提案。我还决定排除多重签名选举提案，因为结果针对于多个提案，而不是仅针对一个提案进行投票。有关选举的统计数据，请参见 [这里](https://twitter.com/SushiPOWAH/status/1303708721722261505?s=20)。\n\n**代币经济学**\n\n投票权由 SUSHIPOWAH 余额决定。SUSHI-ETH 资金池中的每个 SUSHI 价值 2 SUSHIPOWAH，通过 xSUSHI 持有的每个 SUSHI 价值 1 SUSHIPOWAH。\n\nSUSHI 的供应量严格封顶为 2.5 亿个，新的 SUSHI 以 100 SUSHI/ 区块的速度创建，生产出质押在受益耕种的代币。质押 SUSHI 后获得 xSUSHI，并从交易所的所有矿池中赚取 0.05% 的交易费。\n\n#### Yearn\n\nYearn 治理机制自诞生以来已发生了重大变化。 Yearn 协议采用链上治理架构，YFI 于 2020 年 7 月 17 日推出。在 [YIP-10](https://yips.yearn.finance/YIPS/yip-10)（7 月 24 日）实施之前，两项提案——Yearn Improvement Proposal (YIP) 1 和 12 获得通过，并出于安全考虑将治理转移到新的智能合约。在社区决定将治理迁移到链下的 Snapshot （点击 [这里](https://snapshot.org/#/yearn) 可看到 Snapshot 存档，点击 [这里](https://snapshot.org/#/ybaby.eth) 可看到当前 Snapshot）之前，新合约处理了 YIP 30-45，Yearn 治理迁移至链下，以避免交易费用，并鼓励社区更高的参与度。\n\nYearn 治理的一个显著特征是参与激励机制。依据 [YIP-45](https://yips.yearn.finance/YIPS/yip-45) ，所提提案 YIP 达到「实施」阶段的人将会获得价值 500 美元的 yCRV 赏金，由该协议的金库支付。\n\n**以往提案**\n\n* 提案总数 : 37\n* [第一个治理合约上](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3A22dF48d84957F907e67F4313E3D43179040d6E#code) (链上)：7\n* 已实施：3\n* 未获通过：4\n* [更新后的智能合约上](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBa37B002AbaFDd8E89a1995dA52740bbC013D992#code) (链上)：16\n* 已实施：11\n* 通过：12 (其中 1 个提案正等待实施)\n* 未获通过： 4\n* 链下： 15 (全部通过，但都尚未实施)\n\n**代币经济学**\n\nYFI 治理代币于 2020 年 7 月 17 日推出，共铸造了 30,000 个 YFI。 用户通过为 Yearn 产品提供流动性、在 YFI 分配合约中质押所输出的代币，以及每天的治理参与来赚取 YFI。 质押 YFI 除了可以获得治理投票之外，还能从 Yearn 产生的利润中获得一定比例的收益。\n\nGemini [认为](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/defi-solutions-decentralized-governance-meaning#section-fair-launches-the-yearn-finance-example) YFI 的发行是公平的，因为没有为创始团队、项目投资人、顾问或其他内部人士保留 YFI。\n\n另外 6,666 个 YFI 作为 YIP-57 提案的一部分被铸造（⅓ 给主要贡献者，作为分阶段退出奖励包，⅔ 给协议金库）。\n\n### 治理现状如何？\n\n我设定了四个参数，来评价这些去中心化协议在治理实践中的运行状况，然后，再通过对社区参与和讨论的定性研究进行补充。\n\n我设定的四个参数分别是：投票权分布、有影响力的投票人、提案来源和投票参与率。\n\n#### 投票权分布严重不平等\n\n首先，我研究了投票权在每个协议的用户之间是如何分配的。尽管存在代币经济学差异，但这些协议中的每一个都显示出极高且具备可比性的 [基尼系数](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient)，这表明：协议用户的相对投票权存在严重不平等。\n\n![揭开明星 DeFi 协议治理的梦想、现实与可能演进方向](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/8fbc06a03500533880f2889265442e4d_6dnVzLt.png-article)\n\n![揭开明星 DeFi 协议治理的梦想、现实与可能演进方向](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/a8e73cc4a06c5a6794c8ac2260aff747_os0rFfc.png-article)\n\n每个协议中不到 1% 的投票人持有 50% 的委托选票。由于投票结果基于严格多数，这意味着不到 1% 的投票人就可以决定这些协议中每个提案的结果。绝大多数选票 (95%) 由不到 3% 的投票人持有。\n\n#### 少数极具影响力的投票人控制着投票结果\n\n投票权的不平等分配，对提案的结果有着深远的影响。对于每个提案，我找到了投出总票数 50% 或更多比例的地址数量。由于本文考虑的协议的投票结果基于严格多数，因此这些投票人对每次投票的结果影响最大。\n\n![揭开明星 DeFi 协议治理的梦想、现实与可能演进方向](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/e92880e2ab8c50e8af81481eca4fb2a3_rCgbtR1.png-article)\n\n我们可以看到，几乎每个提案的结果都由 2-7 名投票人决定。 Yearn 的治理（链上和链下）在有影响力的投票人数量分布方面，表现出更长的右尾。换句话说，Yearn 的一些提案，决定其结果所需的头部投票人数量要比其他协议更多。尽管存在这条长尾，但平均有 5-7 个（最多 20 个） Yearn 投票人就能影响提案的结果。\n\n#### 提案发起人倾向于是核心团队或巨鲸\n\n自然地，我想知道谁在提交提案？ 我想看看每个协议有多少地址提出提案。\n\n请记住，提交提案存在技术和财务障碍。对于链上治理（Uniswap、Compound、Yearn 的旧系统），编写和提交提案需要技术背景（调用治理合约的 `propose` 函数，并在提案中编写可执行函数），且大多数协议都需要提议者持有满足门槛要求的代币，以防止低质量的垃圾提案。\n\n截止 7 月中旬，Compound 的提案门槛是 100,000 COMP，[第 52 号提案](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/52) 将这一门槛降低至 65,000 COMP (撰写本文时约价值\\~$43,700,000)。不过随着 CAP 的引进，任何人只需持有 100 COMP (\\~$43,700) 就可以发起提案流程。Uniswap 的提案门槛在截止 6 月中旬时为 1000 万 UNI (\\~2.6 亿美元)，[第 4 号提案](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/0/4) 将这一门槛降至 250 万 UNI (\\~6500 万美元)；同时， fish.vote 平台 允许任何持有 400 UNI (\\~$10,400) 的人士可以创建一个自治提案。要在 Yearn Snapshot 上创建提案，提案人必须至少持有 1 个 YFI （\\~36,900 美元）； 但是，如果您的提案在 Discourse 治理论坛上获得了极大的关注，Yearn 团队成员将主动帮您提出提案。至于 Sushiswap，任何人都可以在他们的 Snapshot 上提出建议，但只有核心团队成员创建的建议通过后，才被视为具有约束力（将被实施）。\n\n在这一背景下，让我们调查每个协议中的提案人背景。\n\n![揭开明星 DeFi 协议治理的梦想、现实与可能演进方向](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/bc2dcdc4940d55e8b8ac59fc6569d284_zrzq1Oq.png-article)\n\n总的来说，我们看到大多数提案都是由 3-7 个地址提出的；就像有影响力的投票人情况一样，提案一直是小圈子的产物。\n\n对于 Compound 的 57 个提案，分别有 17 个独立的提案人。提案数量排名前 3 名的提案人都是 DeFi 领域的巨鲸： [blck](https://compound.finance/governance/address/0x54a37d93e57c5da659f508069cf65a381b61e189) 提出了 19 个， [Geoffrey Hayes](https://compound.finance/governance/address/0x8169522c2c57883e8ef80c498aab7820da539806) 提出了 8 个， [Gauntlet](https://compound.finance/governance/address/0x6626593c237f530d15ae9980a95ef938ac15c35c) 提出了 7 个。\n\n对于 Uniswap 的 7 个链上提案，Dharma 提出了前两个，接下来的两个是自治提案，然后是哈佛法学院区块链和金融科技项目、Dave Balter 和 Getty Hill 各提出一个。\n\n对于 Sushiswap，只有 4 名核心团队成员（Snapshot 中所定义）才能创建具有约束力的 Sushiswap Snapshot 投票。\n\n对于 Yearn，每个提案还附带一份参与起草提案的提案人名单，而不仅仅是提交提案的地址。提案人也集中在创始 / 核心团队中：[banteg](https://twitter.com/bantg)（撰写了 9 项提案）、[lehnberg](https://twitter.com/lehnberg?lang=enhttps://twitter.com/lehnberg?lang=en)（8）、[milkylkim](https://twitter.com/milkyklim)（8）、[Andre Cronje](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech)（6）、[Substreight](https://twitter.com/Substreight)（4）、[lex_node](https://twitter.com/lex_node)（4）—— 都是创始 / 开发 / 运营 / 法律团队的成员，或者目前 / 已经是多重签名的签名者。\n\n#### 投票参与率很低\n\n提案一旦激活，社区的参与程度如何？\n\n![揭开明星 DeFi 协议治理的梦想、现实与可能演进方向](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/c3896e6b9c135fb9845614b76d7c7bf4_XCf6agB.png-article)\n\n从统计数据上看，参与率与投票权分布率之间没有显著差异，但较大的差值表明，部分提案获得了很高的参与度，而投票人对其他提案的参与度则不太活跃。\n\n对 Compound 和 Uniswap 而言，这是委托代币的参与率（您必须委托自己的代币，才能用这些代币投票；您可以委托给自己）。以总流通代币为参考，其委托代币 AKA 的参与率分别为 [43%](https://www.withtally.com/governance/compound) 和 [19%](https://www.withtally.com/governance/uniswap)。换句话说，平均有 43% \\* 45.6% = 19.6% 的流通中 COMP 代币用于投票，UNI 的这一比例为 19% \\* 52.7% = 10%。\n\n但是，我认为数据分析无法捕捉到去中心化治理的精神和文化真髓，所以我想谈谈在 DeFi 治理中最近出现的两个案例。\n\n### 案例研究： Uniswap DeFi 教育基金\n\nUniswap 的 [第 5 号提案](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/1/1) 将 100 万 UNI 捐赠给 DeFi 教育基金，作为「[治理大剧场](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-removal-of-established-cranial-follicles-fund/13314/33)」的一个戏码引发了争议。社区成员批评该提案缺乏透明度——一项提案为什么为这么一个几乎没有详细说明要做什么的提案提供如此多的资金，像 DeFi Watch 的 Chris Blec 这样的人提出的重要问题没有得到答复，尽管提案承诺了 500,000 UNI 将在 4 到 5 年内被清算，这些代币 [在 6 月全部售出](https://cointelegraph.com/news/concern-as-uniswap-backed-defi-education-fund-dumps-10m-worth-of-uni)。不过，由于少数地址掌控了投票权，该提案获得通过：主要是学生团体（如提案人哈佛法学院区块链和金融科技项目），但都 [得到了 a16z 的支持](https://chaincatcher.medium.com/what-kind-of-organization-is-the-defi-education-fund-that-gained-1-million-uni-215790fb3b04)。\n\nUniswap Discord 的一位用户写道：「我认为这表明，如果一个组织及其盟友可以任意从金库中向自己开出空白支票，那么 DAO 和财政部就会面临中心化控制的风险。」事实上，不满情绪蔓延到了讽刺的程度，在治理论坛上发起了一项 meme 教育基金风格的提案，要创建一份理发基金。Yearn 的核心开发者 Banteg [写道](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-removal-of-established-cranial-follicles-fund/13314/19)：「尽管最初的反应是将其视为讽刺而置之不理，但我认为这可能是一个很好的提议，可以激活抗议群体的投票者，并改变本质上已经死了的治理代币 ...... 我全力支持你们。」\n\n### 案例研究： Sushiswap 「幻影旅团」\n\n在 Sushiswap 治理论坛上，0xMaki [提议](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushi-phantom-troupe-strategic-raise/4554) 向机构投资者（折价）出售 5100 万个 SUSHI 代币。可以在 DeFi Weekly 的 [一篇文章](https://defiweekly.substack.com/p/sushiswaps-phantom-troupe) 中找到有关这一情况（被称为「幻影旅团」 Phantom Troupe）的完整报道。\n\n简单总结一下就是：「在没有明确理由的情况下，在 $sushi 代币的历史低点期间以很大的折扣将大量金库资产出售给没有明确增值意义的投资者，社区对此感到非常愤怒。」\n\n这次情绪爆发引发了对 Sushi 更有利的更多谈判，但最终该提案被完全撤回。正如 Arca 首席投资官在论坛帖子中 [写的那样](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushi-phantom-troupe-strategic-raise/4554/383)，「这是成功治理的案例研究，我们很高兴能够同时成为历史和未来的一部分。」 或者更强大的是，正如 DeFi Weekly 所写的那样：「社区的力量现在已经上升到可以与很多机构投资者公开谈判的层级。」\n\n### 去中心化治理的未来之路\n\n我收集的大部分数据似乎表明，当前的 DeFi 治理仍处于过渡状态，尚未兑现去信任、无需许可、完全由社区控制的承诺。我发现，投票权、影响力和提案发起权集中在少数人手中，真实的参与率显示了并没有广泛的社区参与。\n\n不过，值得注意的是，去中心化治理是实验性的，仍处于起步阶段。我们的研究结果支持了一个直观的结论，即在任何项目的早期形成阶段，都需要一定程度的中心化，因为社区仍在逐步接近临界质量，且该项目仍在整体的 DeFi 经济中巩固自己的地位。通过使用正式和非正式技术进行协调，DeFi 治理正在取得迅速发展，同时争取在决策效率与权力去中心化之间取得平衡。\n\n#### 代币经济学\n\n对 DeFi 治理最响亮的批评声音之一是投票权的分配不平等，导致权力集中在少数人手中。尽管这是早期 DeFi 治理的特征，但我认为还会有很多故事。\n\n尽管这些协议中代币分配结构不同，却导致了投票权的相似集中，投票者如何看待手中的选票似乎也很重要。 例如，Yearn 相对公平的分配可能不会导致基尼系数大幅降低，但可能会让普通投票人相信不会有大型 VC 或核心团队成员主导投票；这个假设可以解释为什么 Yearn （链上和链下治理投票中）的普通投票人参与度更高。\n\n代币经济学的另一个层面是分配。我观察到，Uniswap 与 Sushiswap 相比社区活动较少，可能是因为这个原因。用户在初始分配期间获得 UNI 的唯一方式是通过追溯空投或 3 个月的流动性挖矿计划（仍然只占总数发行数量的 17%）；所有剩余的 UNI 要么锁定在金库中，要么锁定给团队 / 投资人。这种排他性分配可能就是参与很困难的信号，而且仅适用于先行者，有效地将很大一部分用户排除在治理之外。相比之下，SUSHI （和 SUSHIPOWAH）不断地发放给协议的用户。\n\n二次投票是解决投票权分配不均问题的常用想法之一，虽然它不在本文的探讨范围内，但我认为这是投资于治理的人们应该考虑的事情； Vitalik 的「[Quadratic Payments: A Primer](https://www.chainnews.com/articles/517042192558.htm)」一文是一个很好的开始。\n\n#### 提案人身份\n\n尽管提案人明显集中于小圈子内，但投票人更愿意相信由知名 DeFi 人物撰写的提案，而不是由自治社区成员创建的提案，这并非没有道理，尤其是当链上提案需要技术知识，或者更重要的是，实施的提案可能会对协议造成重大影响，无论好坏。其次，大多数协议领导者尊重治理论坛，官方提案（链上或链下）通常反映中的社区意见。在 Sushiswap 案例研究中，负面的社区反应意味着：核心团队成员没有提出具有约束力的 Snapshot 投票。\n\n我相信在 Compound 和 Uniswap 中引入自治提案，是鼓励更多去中心化提案人的良性机制——即使社区成员没有足够的代币来直接提出某些东西，只要他们获得足够的社区支持，仍然能够提交链上提案。自治提案是让持币较少的持币者感受到被倾听的一种方式，这在去中心化治理中至关重要：被倾听的感觉直接影响忠诚度度和参与度。正如传统政治一样，当选民认为他们的声音很重要时，他们更有可能出席投票。\n\n如果我们看一下 Uniswap，在引入 fish.vote 之后以经出现了 2 个自治提案。看到自治提案的引入，感觉很有希望让提案人实现大众化，但这也许是因为过去的提案门槛（1000 万 UNI）高得丧心病狂。\n\n此外，提案门槛降低到 250 万 UNI 后，我发现 Dave Balter 和 Getty Hill 持有的 UNI 远低于最初的提案门槛——1000 万 UNI，这表明降低门槛确实也允许持币较少的参与者提出建议。换句话说，降低提案门槛将允许更多不同的提案人；当然，这可能会以更多垃圾提案为代价，不过以 Yearn 为例，其提案门槛相比前几个协议最低（1 个 YFI 约为 36,900 美元），但迄今为止只看到富有成效的提案。\n\n除了自主提案，强大的治理论坛似乎也推动了去中心化治理的健康发展。任何人无论持有多少代币，都可以对提案流程发表评论和想法，因此论坛是一个非常强大的资源。不过，官方提案反映论坛意见也非常重要； 在 Uniswap 案例研究中，Harvard Law Blockchain 无视了论坛上许多担忧和抱怨声音，导致社区对 Uni 治理失去信任，并削弱了他们为协议治理做贡献的积极性。\n\n#### 透明度\n\n在我个人看来，DeFi 项目为进一步实现其去中心化目标所做出的最直接和最有影响力的改进是：通过改进治理文档和提升透明度，来削减社区参与的障碍。在研究过程中，我发现这些信息可能很难找到或已经过时。关于治理流程如何运作的问题是治理聊天频道中的一个常见话题，尤其更多问题来自社区的新成员。在我看来，协议应该集中精力提供全面且可访问的治理流程文档，并帮助新成员开始提案、投票或委托投票。\n\n### 结语\n\n总而言之，我很高兴观察 DeFi 治理在当前基础上如何继续发展。我最喜欢 DeFi 的是：每个人都可以参与改进项目和整个生态系统。如果您正在阅读本文，我敢打赌您已经对去中心化治理感兴趣或参与其中的投资了。您如何看待 DeFi 治理？ 您认为我们可以如何改进？\n\n*特别感谢 :

旨在构建一条「合规化的金融公链」，致力于助力传统金融行业业务转型及区块链技术的外部扩张，并针对区块链「不可能三角」做出了针对性的优化。\\\\\n\n**撰文：Haoren**\n\n9 月 7 日，加密世界迎来了一个重要的里程碑：比特币正式成为萨尔瓦多法定货币，这意味着 **萨尔瓦多** 成为世界上 **第一个** 赋予加密货币法定地位的国家。而在一周前的 8 月 31 日，萨尔瓦多政府刚刚与拉丁美洲区块链资产代币化和金融基础设施公司 **Koibanx** 签订了协议，将合作开发区块链基础设施，而该基础设施将基于 **Algorand 区块链** 进行开发。\n\n### 在公链赛道千帆竞逐的当下，Algorand 究竟凭借什么「脱颖而出」？\n\n**技术方面** ，Algorand 针对区块链 **「不可能三角」** （去中心化、可扩展性、安全性） 做出了针对性的优化。可扩展性方面，Algorand 采用可验证随机函数 （VRF） 随机选择区块的生产者和验证者，一旦得知被选中，生产者和验证者只需广播一个简短的消息即可证明自己的身份。每产生一个新区块在网络中需要交换的消息不会随着用户数的增大而改变，因此即时用户规模增大，系统仍可保持较高的 TPS （每秒处理的交易数） 。 **Algorand 的 TPS 是比特币的 125 倍** 。\n\n**安全性方面** ，由于采用了上述的 VRF 随机选取生产者和验证者，并且选取的过程完全由节点独立完成，因此 Algorand 网络中的攻击者无法预先得知下一个区块生产者和验证者，从而也就无法完成攻击。具体来说，生产者和验证者的身份只有在他们确定自己被选中并广播对应的证明信息时才会被披露，这时攻击者即使立刻采取各种攻击手段，也无法阻止关于新区块的正确消息在网络中的传播。\n\n**去中心化方面** ，Algorand 中每一轮的区块生产者和验证者都是随机选取的，并且加入网络没有任何门槛，因此是 **完全去中心化的** 。\n\nAlgorand 的自我定位是构建一条 **「合规化的金融公链」** ，此外，Algorand 也一直致力于助力传统金融行业进行业务转型，助力区块链技术向外扩张。通常来讲，政府和大型金融机构采用某种区块链技术之前首先考虑的就是合规性，因为合规性通常保证了安全性，而合规性恰恰是 Algorand 一个与生俱来的标签 （获得伊斯兰教法合规证书；成为首批加入「BSN 开放联盟链项目」的公链之一；成为国际互惠信贷和衍生品协会「ISDA」成员等等） 。\n\n我们梳理了 Algorand 生态的重点项目，发现大多数的项目都与金融相关，有 **去中心化金融** （DeFi），包括 DEX、借贷，数字证券、实体资产上链等，也有很多 **传统金融机构** 利用 Algorand 区块链进行业务转型。除此之外，Algorand 也与政府、环保机构等广泛合作，利用区块链的技术帮助他们更好地开展自己的业务。\n\n![从突破「不可能三角」到打造「合规化金融公链」，盘点迎难而上的 Algorand 生态](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/2ab503b210cb4b5170708d4d64755c64.jpg-article)\n\n### DeFi\n\n####

I’m sure you can also think of a few people who could have a head of lettuce for dinner and feel full until breakfast.\n\nI’ve always wondered why that is. Is it based on what they predominantly ate as a child? Does it have to do with the amount of exercise in their life? Are they just *really* unhealthy?\n\nIt could be a mix of all three, and more. Who’s to say. The mystery of the human body is forever unfolding and, at this time, I can’t make a definite judgement call. However, I was recently introduced to a concept that shifted my entire thinking when observing people’s diets.\n\nIn 1996, Peter J. D’Adamo, an American naturopathic physician, released The Blood Type Diet. At its core, this way of eating centers on aligning your diet with your specific blood type (**A**, **B**, **AB**, or **O**). In his book, *Eat Right for Your Blood Type: The Individualized Blood Type Diet Solution*, D’Adamo states,\n\n“Your blood type reflects your internal chemistry. It is the key that unlocks the mysteries of disease, longevity, fitness, and emotional strength. It determines your susceptibility to illness, the foods you should eat, and ways to avoid the most troubling health problems.”\n\nIn other words, your blood type is one of the greatest communicators of your body’s needs. While some of D’Adamo’s work has been questioned over time, I really found this a fascinating perspective on choosing what foods to eat. By learning the history about when, where and why each blood type came to be (that’s right — every blood type wasn’t just present the day humans popped up!) we can provide better for our body.\n\nWe’ll start with the oldest blood type, **O**. Generally speaking, people with this blood type are thought to be strong and steadfast. These people tend to have shorter and hardier digestive tracts, which aids in digesting meat. High protein foods, red meat, and leafy greens are important for the **O** blood type, due to the strong enzymes in their gut. If you fall into this group, you may have a low tolerance for new diets. When it comes to exercise, **O** blood types will feel best participating in intense movements, such as running, contact sports, and martial arts.\n\nFast forward a couple hundred years, humans began relying on agriculture, and blood type **A** emerged. These are probably your vegetarian and vegan friends. **A** blood types’ have a more sensitive digestive tract that is open to microbial invasion, which is why meat doesn’t usually settle well with them. However, their immune systems are great at preserving and metabolizing nutrients, so type **A** will probably find success with a plant-based diet. Many yogis are blood type **A**, and all benefit from calming but strengthening exercises.\n\nThen, humans began migrating and settling in places with less-than ideal soil, and had to adapt. Blood type **B** is thought to have appeared during this period in human history, and helped the body adjust to the new lifestyles. With a strong immune and nervous system, those with this blood type can count on an omnivorous diet to fuel them well. Type **B**’s enjoy exercises such as hiking or swimming so much because it is, quite literally, in their blood.\n\nFinally, we have the newest blood type, **AB**, which is said to be most well adapted for modern life. Their rugged immune system is arguably over-tolerant, but their digestive tract is quite sensitive. While blood type **AB** would feel just fine on a mixed diet, the key here is *everything in moderation*. If you’re blood type **AB,** you’ll probably get some sort of enjoyment from many types of exercise. However, finding the motivation to exercise might be the bigger issue.\n\nHonestly, I think it is amazing how migrations and lifestyles hundreds of years ago still affect us today. These insights into our shared human history may help you understand why being vegetarian has never worked for you or may offer you a direction to explore as you make changes to your lifestyle. But, it can also just be an interesting fact to share at the next trivia night.

{"id": "9XPtkauE3ZXRvSy080liNVAjlLy2eSbckm2bpI_aYZI", "title": "简单理解DeFi2.0", "body": "[https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/DgaWGzjl7tkN1qr0fsmB_w](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/DgaWGzjl7tkN1qr0fsmB_w)\n\n## DeFi 2.0之流动性关系重构\n\n### 流动性挖矿的过度开采\n\nDeFi的节奏很快。去年我们见证了一个风起云涌的DeFi，当时的DeFi采用了流动性挖矿模式，引爆了整个加密领域。但随着流动性挖矿模式的探索，人们逐渐发现了流动性挖矿的弊端。这种短期激励模式会导致一些流动性提供者对项目和协议的过度开采，甚至加速项目走向消亡。\n\n在这种模式中，流动性提供者和协议长期利益并没有形成一致，这种矛盾的存在导致DeFi处于增长缓慢的状态。当然，这只是原因之一。\n\n在这种背景下，DeFi2.0概念出来了。在这里，我们不对1.0和2.0的定义进行争辩。因为这没有太大的意义，叫1.0、2.0甚至3.0改变不了事情的本质。本文主要是简单介绍一下DeFi的新变化，这里使用DeFi2.0更多是为了介绍方便，也是对DeFi演化的简要描述。\n\nDeFi2.0通过新的机制改变了协议和流动性提供者之间的关系，并最终重构了流动性服务本身。\n\n### DeFi2.0之流动性捕获\n\n人们一般关注协议费用的捕获，但如果从协议的长期可持续发展的角度看，协议的流动性捕获同样重要，甚至更加重要。关于协议的流动性捕获是区分DeFi1.0和2.0的重要部分；另外一个是资本效率的提升。\n\n**流动性捕获**\n\nDeFi之所以能成为DeFi，除了以太坊等底层公链基础设施之外，最重要的是有流动性的提供。这是DeFi能够运行的前提，是支撑其生命的血液。这也是为什么2020年夏天，在Compound推出流动性挖矿之后，引爆了整个市场的重要原因。\n\n随着一年多实践展开，人们看到了流动性挖矿的弊端，短期的激励模型只会鼓励流动性提供者短期的行为。增发代币进入流动性提供者手中，不少情况下，流动性提供者并没有跟协议形成长期的互利合作关系。流动性提供者随时可以撤退，并留给协议一地鸡毛。\n\n为解决这个问题，出现了POL（ Protocol Owned Liquidity）的概念，也就是协议控制的流动性。蓝狐笔记称之为“流动性捕获”。甚至还出现了“流动性层”的服务，专注于为DeFi项目提供流动性基础设施层。\n\n* **PCV与POL**\n\n上面提到POL是指协议拥有流动性（Protocol Owned Liquidity），这是Olympus DAO最先实践的概念。关于Olympus DAO，蓝狐笔记在今年早些时候介绍过《[OHM的算法稳定币探索](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAwOTk1NjM0NQ==&mid=2247491350&idx=1&sn=42c62151ce53ac61726aca3c737ac68a&chksm=9b56e180ac2168964679b42646d80ca843b26b6be62cf1c881b71e3e56b99c7c4e642ac4dc04&scene=21#wechat_redirect)》。不过如今的Olympus有了不小的变化。\n\n跟之前DeFi流行的流动性挖矿模式不同，Olympus DAO的核心之一在于PCV，也就是协议控制价值，这改变了它跟流动性提供者之间的关系。Olympus将资金流向协议，而不是团队。协议使用这些早期支持者的资金提供流动性。\n\nOlympus DAO向参与者发行折扣价格的OHM代币（债券），获得流动性提供者的LP代币头寸，从而捕获了“流动性”。Olympus DAO的财库掌握了流动性，虽然其OHM在增加，但随着其债券销售越多，其掌握的流动性也越大。截止到目前，Olympus DAO拥有超过4.6亿美元的流动性。\n\n![（Olympus协议拥有超过4.6亿美元的流动性，DuneAnalytics）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JI4Bxq2fSxmya6EwZ4vbs.png?height=303&width=1080)\n\n![（Olympus协议拥有流行性趋势，DuneAnalytics）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZyJWFUPpuxNCkV33j7Pv1.png?height=701&width=1080)\n\n协议捕获的“流动性”不是由LP自由掌控，而是由协议来控制，这意味着，不会产生流动性突然消失的“rug pull”，从而保证了参与者的退出可能性。同时，协议参与流动性提供，成为做市商，可以获得交易费用收入，目前为止获得超过1000万美元的费用收入。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YUIPG6akFQa_oR0CRvvp1.png?height=267&width=1080)\n\n（Olympus协议捕获的LP收入，DuneAnalytics）\n\n更好的流动性，可以提升参与者持续参与的信心，不用担心突然有一天流动性完全消失，这也是早期DeFi挖矿时代rug pull的常见情况，让很多参与者的损失惨重。\n\n当然，这也不是完全安全，只是相对来说，比之前的流动性支撑度更好些。随着Olympus DAO的成功，现在各个链上的类似项目已经多达十来个，这里面的风险会越来越高，Olympus DAO的模式并不能保证没有Rug Pull。\n\n在Olympus DAO自身的成功实践基础上，其还推出了可被其他DeFi协议采用的流动性服务产品。其他项目可以实现类似Olympus DAO的“流动性捕获”，同时对于Olympus来说，也可以将其代币OHM嵌入到更多的协议中，从而形成其更多的应用场景。对于这种方法，甚至有人提出了Liquidity as a Service的概念。也就是下面要提到的DeFi流动性方案进一步演化。 \n \n\n* **专注于流动性提供的协议**\n\n上面提到LaaS流动性即服务的概念，其他DeFi协议可以从市场上购买流动性，而市场会竞争，从而提供更高质量更优价格的流动性，形成一种相对平衡的状态。\n\nTokemak是其中一种专注于流动性供应的协议。简言之，它试图成为defi项目的做市商，成为DeFi的流动性提供的基础设施层。\n\n在TokeMak协议上，它可以收集各种闲置代币，参与者可以提供单边代币，其中包括ETH、DAI等代币，也包括不同协议项目的代币。这些代币可以组成代币对以提供流动性。每个代币资产都有自己的“反应堆”（当流动性提供者将某代币资产存入之后，会获得相应数量t资产，可以1:1赎回）。TokeMark的协议代币TOKE充当引导流动性的作用，也可以理解为将流动性进行代币化。TOKE控制了流动性的流向。\n\n对于DeFi项目来说，通过TokeMak可以更低廉成本构建“代币反应堆”，以构建可持续的流动性；对于流动性提供者来说，可以提供单边代币的流动性，不用担心无常损失。最终来说，它希望各种协议不再自己构建流动性池，而是通过TokeMak来获得流动性。\n\n对于流动性提供者来说，其将代币存入“代币反应堆”，可以获得协议代币TOKE的奖励收益。这些存入“反应堆”代币资产跟ETH或DAI等资产配对，部署到DEX中。这些存入“反应堆”的代币，可以1:1赎回。那么，如果产生无常损失，由谁来承担？这里就涉及到TOKE代币。TOKE代币是Tokemak的协议代币，不仅有治理功能，也用来为流动性提供者作为奖励。TOKE代币可以捕获流动性的交易费用，这是支撑其价值的关键。同时，它也用来缓解无常损失。\n\n如果当某个“反应堆代币”提取时存在无常损失，那么TOKE会进行支撑偿付。TokeMak采用抵押网络来缓解无常损失。在TokeMak的设计中，除了流动性提供者，还存在流动性引导者。流动性引导者通过质押TOKE来引导流动性，在这个过程中，流动性引导者会获得TOKE代币的奖励。如果产生了无常损失，首先会由协议财库进行支撑，最后会由TOKE质押者（流动性引导者）的TOKE奖励支撑，如果这还不够，则由TOKE质押者的TOKE来支撑（按比例）。\n\n对于TokeMak协议来说，其长远目的是构建一个在没有第三方参与者情况下提供流动性和做市服务。它的方式是通过其在流动性提供服务中积累越来越多的价值，然后这部分价值化身为流动性提供。当然，前提是它有足够的网络效应，在这个过程中积累足够的价值，一旦价值突破临界点，它有可能产生类似黑洞的效应。当然，在达到临界点之前，会经历很多的阶段，并不是那么容易的事情。\n\nFei协议也试图提供流动性的服务，其跟一些DeFi项目合作，为其提供流动性租赁。比如在一段时间内将其代币存入到其他DeFi的流动性财库中，然后在DEX提供“项目代币/FEI”的流动性。当然，同时，FEI也可以收取一定的费用以及交易费用，不过也存在潜在的无常损失。\n\n## DeFi 2.0之资产效率优化\n\n由于DeFi的去中介化模式，因此往往需要提供超额抵押的资产。这里存在资产效率低的情况。\n\nAbracadabra模式跟MakerDAO类似，都是超额抵押资产以生成稳定币。不过跟MakerDAO不同的是，Abracadabrao抵押的资产是带有收益的资产，这样对于抵押资产的用户来说，相当于提高了资金的效率。因为这些抵押资产本身还在获得收益。这些带有收益率的资产包括yvYFI、yvUSDT、yvUSDC、xSushi等。超额抵押这一类资产可以生成其稳定币MIM。\n\n除了提高资金的利用率之外，还降低了清算的可能性。因为这些抵押资产会增加价值。这是一类基于用户需求的创新。\n\n## DeFi2.0的风险\n\n由于DeFi存在大量的DAO to DAO的组合，这里存在更大的可组合性风险。例如Abracadabra这样的协议，一旦其抵押资产的协议出问题，那么，它本身也会出问题。因此，我们在看到其优点的同时，也可看到其潜在的风险。\n\n此外，DeFi2.0并不能保证没有rug pull，在没有形成自身的可持续流动性之前，风险也是无处不在的。因此，不要被DeFi2.0的概念所迷惑，这里同样充满极高的风险。\n\n## DeFi2.0本质上要完善DeFi的基础设施层\n\nDeFi的基础设施不仅包括以太坊等公链，不仅包括DEX、借贷、衍生品等基础乐高积木，它还包括支撑这些模式的流动性，流动性本身也是DeFi可持续的重要基础设施层。\n\n而DeFi2.0的核心就是要将流动性变成DeFi的基础设施层，在这个基础上，让DeFi变得更加可持续发展。从这个角度看，DeFi2.0本身是DeFi必然的演化趋势。DeFi就像是生命体，它要不断成长，需要完善它各个部分，最终成为可以不依赖于任何中介的自我增强且可持续的技术演化趋势。", "timestamp": 1635340618, "digest": "CcJOdUi2VSoy-cudzNHr1iohZyRhi0g6D-KFb-RBzWQ", "contributor": "0xAE623c8B158C3dF75b4f0f3886cA36b49b72f3e9"}

{"id": "HnCuSgCkEVKGLcpeIaHrdtBXQvxnSA08_CI_KX3WZmo", "title": "以Uniswap为例，讨论用于 DEX 路由器构建和分析的构建区块", "body": "## 概述\n\n用一种资产交换另一种资产是金融市场的一个基本概念。在加密货币市场中，这种情况通常发生在代币或货币与他人交换或交易的地方。Uniswap是一种自动流动性协议，有助于这种类型的交换。它使用成对或池(以下称为对)，两种资产的池储备，允许用户将一种资产交换为另一种资产。\n\n图1.0：Uniswap代币A和B池，以及流动性提供者(LP)和交易者的互换和存款交互示例。LP接收池代币以提供流动性。\n\n如果有人想要的资产与他们想要交易的资产不成对，会发生什么?在这种情况下，在多个对之间进行一系列互换以获得所需的资产——用于促进这种交易的对被称为路由。\n\n 图2.0：一条涉及多对交易 DAI 以换取 USDC 的路由。\n\n路由是从一个资产到另一个资产的路由，由零或多个对之间的段组成。如果交易的数量足够大，或者如果一对的流动性足够低，可以从多个路由中形成一条路由，通过吸收更多来自其他对的流动性来减少滑点。\n\n图3.0：由Paraswap路由器说明的多路径路由\n\n图4.0：多路由\n\n滑点是指一个人预期为资产支付的价格与实际支付的金额之间的差额，这是由一些因素造成的，比如订单进入市场和交易执行之间的价格变动，或者成交量和流动性低。\n\n另一个需要考虑的是路由中的段数。这将以在以太坊区块链上操作的gas费用的形式增加交易成本。一条路由上的段数越多，所产生的gas费用就越高。类似地，如果有多种途径，如上图3和图4所示，gas费用也会更高。\n\n路由器必须考虑这些因素，以产生适合交易数量的路由。此外，由于市场状况经常变化，影响gas费用和池的流动性，生成的路由也将是动态的，现在是一条很好的路由，不一定在一小时后或第二天表现良好。\n\n本文的其余部分将讨论可用于构建和分析Uniswap V2协议及更高版本构建和分析路由器的构建区块。\n\n## 数据建模\n\n注意:这里提到的Graph协议不同于下一节讨论的Graph数据类型。图协议是一个或多个智能合约的区块链交易的索引，而图数据类型是指使用数学图论的数据表示。\n\n正如使用地图在点之间导航一样，可以使用图数据类型来导航可用的流动性对，以生成可以评估以提高回报的路由。在对 Uniswap 对进行建模时，一开始就需要做出一些实现选择:\n\n* 作为顶点或边的对、符号或资产标识符 ?\n* 有向还是无向?\n* 简单还是多图?\n\n为了做出上述实现选择，理解Uniswap对的属性是很重要的:\n\n* 每一对都有一个唯一的ID。\n* 每对包含以下数据对 2 个代币：符号、名称、ID。\n* 代币符号不是唯一的——例如，符号BOND表示许多不同的资产或不同的ID。\n* 代币名称也不一定是唯一的。\n* 代币ID是唯一的，并且是代币的ERC-20合约地址。\n\nUniswap对的这些属性建议使用代币ID作为图数据类型中的顶点。由此可见，图的边代表唯一的一对ID。在这种形式下，图可以是无向的，也可以是有向的，每条边代表一对ID、代币价格和储备。然而，不断更新代币价格和保留信息的需求表明，将该数据存储在具有适当的实时设置的缓存结构中可能更有效和可扩展，特别是对于实时交易的应用程序，而不是静态分析。\n\n今后，在Uniswap V2和V3协议对之间路由是可取的。在这个场景中，可能存在多个对相同的代币ID。虽然可以在一对ID之间添加额外的边，但另一种解决方案是在同一条边上分组不同的对ID，从而避免遍历多重图的性能成本。下面是分组对ID无向简单图结构的部分示例，其中符号 ID 替换了符号名称：\n\n图5.0：在一个无向简单图中对Uniswap V2和V3协议对进行建模(注意，实际结构使用代币ID而不是代币符号，所以在这里会很麻烦)。\n\n最初，深度优先搜索(DFS)已经证明可以遍历图，一般情况下深度限制为4。该深度的一个例外是从WETH开始的路由，其中连接节点的数量超过30000。当一条路由从WETH出发时，DFS被限制为2，以减少遍历时间。\n\n有许多用于处理图形数据类型的工具，包括图形数据库Neo4J和RedisGraph。这些讨论超出了本文的范围，目前的项目需求可以通过Javascript库Graphlib来满足。然而，如果路由问题的规模达到了LinkedIn或其他大型网络的规模，那么上述图表数据库的规模就会满足这些需求，从而权衡成本和开发复杂性。\n\n### 约束\n\n当在图数据结构中计算路由时，约束是有用的。例如，它们有助于确定只遍历有限数量对的路由，或者可以用来忽略包含某些资产的对的路由。\n\n现有的 Uniswap V2 路由主要是通过六项资产的路由，这些资产可以比作机场枢纽。这六项资产是：\n\n* WETH\n* DAI\n* USDC\n* USDT\n* COMP\n* MKR\n\n这六种资产是有用的，因为它们是常用的，当它们与其他资产成对组合时，不会施加流动性限制(即它们不是稀缺的，并且不会与新的、未经证实的加密资产构成相同的风险)。然而，它们的使用可能会造成效率问题，在这里说明:\n\n> “Uniswap没有以去中心化的方式路由交换。”\n\n使用约束，比如忽略上面提到的6个“枢纽”资产，可以探索比当前Uniswap V2界面提供给用户的更有效的潜在路由。约束也可以扩展到其他标准，例如:\n\n* 通过具有 X 美元流动性或 Y% 美元交易的池路由。\n* 通过具有特定定价的特定池路由。(适用于Uniswap V3协议)。\n\n同样值得注意的是约束是可组合的,也就是说，它们可以组合在一起，这样路由就可以限制为最多 2 个池，每个池的流动性超过 X。当前的数据模型在图数据类型和查找表之间拆分数据，这意味着在图遍历期间和之后发现对数据时都可以修剪路由。\n\n## 扩展\n\n扩展主要考虑向路由器公开一个公共API，以便基于当前市场数据计算路由。性能是一个函数:\n\n* 计算路由的时间\n* 如果需要，获取更新对数据的时间(代币价格和储备)\n* 计算路由请求的影响所需的时间\n\n下图说明了一个初始的系统架构，其中包含用于最常请求路由的缓存和用于计算路由请求影响的缓存对数据。这种架构非常灵活，可以以多种方式进行水平扩展。例如，完全复制图数据结构和路由缓存以及请求聚合器和对缓存，或者简单地复制缓存并在缓存之间分配路由请求。\n\n图6.0:具有可扩展组件、缓存和定期更新的路由服务架构。\n\n另一个潜在的可扩展性修改可能是考虑路由请求和数量的完整路由解决方案缓存；如果数量在一定的公差内，最近计算的结果可以重用。根据用户体验和应用程序的需要，最近计算的结果也可以用作临时结果，而为用户计算更精确的结果。\n\n## 路由缓存\n\n路由缓存由最常请求的路由的结果组成，其生存时间 (TTL) 与数据源的定期更新频率相关。例如，如果之前请求过WETH和DAI之间的一条路由，则可以在路由缓存中以可能路由数组的形式找到图遍历的结果:\\[WETH -> USDC -> DAI, WETH -> WBTC -> DAI，…\\]。与代币价格和储备等对数据不同，路由可能性——特别是配对的存在——变化较少，因此该缓存的TTL预期要比对数据缓存大得多。此外，该组件还可以扩展为包含对死路由(即过期或已被取代的令牌地址或非流动对)的试探法。\n\n## 配对数据缓存\n\n配对数据缓存包含特定对的代币价格和保留数据，便于计算使用指定数量路由请求的影响。该数据比可用路由选项的变化更频繁，并且将具有大约一个以太坊区块（约 15 秒）的 TTL。\n\n当请求的数据不在缓存中时，这些请求将被捆绑在一起，并从数据源中获取，目前是Graph协议中的Uniswap子图(见下面的数据源部分)，最多可包含 1000 对数据查询。发送捆绑的对数据请求之前的等待时间将根据流量进行调整——在低流量的场景中，让用户等待直到发出额外请求是没有意义的。\n\n此外，为了改进用户体验，在获取和计算更新数据时，可能会呈现基于旧数据的预结果。\n\n## 静态分析\n\n路由性能将通过将生成的路由与现有Uniswap V2路由器的路由进行比较来评估。具体来说，是通过计算给定数量的源代币的收益。例如，在从DAI到COMP的交易中，路由器的性能将通过计算从100万个DAI代币接收到多少COMP，并检查从Uniswap V2路由器建议的路由获得的相同结果来进行比较。性能将根据各种不同的输入进行测量，例如，不同的初始数量，对搜索深度的不同限制等。\n\n在执行静态分析时，不需要图6.0中所示的对数据缓存和捆绑请求。静态分析是在区块链的特定区块时间内对交易的计算。它有助于结果的一致性和重复性，以便进行比较。为Uniswap V2设计新路由器的初始工作范围由静态分析提供帮助，在静态分析中，可以在一个区块时间评估一组交易，并与现有的路由算法或变体进行比较。如果潜在的配对数据发生变化，则不清楚交易结果的改善或下降是由于算法变化还是配对流动性和定价。\n\n## 数据源\n\n随着区块链技术的成熟，出现了大量提供区块链当前和历史数据的服务。数据源的选择涉及下列考虑事项:\n\n* 预算\n* 开发工作和成本\n* 延迟\n* 数据的准确性\n\n开发工作和成本可以通过使用预先消化或索引的数据来减少，就像在Graph Protocol的众多子图中发现的那样。\n\n对于初始交换路由器的设计和实现，将使用Graph Protocol中的Uniswap子图。该数据源提供了极好的易用性，能够分析过去的合约数据，否则将需要更昂贵的存档以太坊节点，并且能够在不执行静态分析时在单个HTTP请求中更新1000对数据。Graph Protocol中的数据延迟比前面提到的解决方案低得多，只有通过直接运行以太坊节点或对内存池建模(或者使用Blocknative之类的服务)才能胜出。Graph Protocol的延迟明显在1区块左右，在某些索引场景下可以动态改变。值得注意的是，当索引和映射区块被证明无效时，数据也可以更改。\n\n一旦对交换路由器设计进行了评估，这个数据源将被证明不适合生成路由，因为实时数据需要具有竞争力。在这样的场景中，需要直接来自区块链当前状态的数据，例如来自Alchemy、Infura或其他来源的以太坊节点。\n\n## 未来\n\n上面概述的系统提供了灵活性和可扩展性，以分析现有Uniswap系统的性能，以及在协议之上构建新的系统，包括一个成熟的交易解决方案。类似于Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro或Synthetix vs Kwenta，也有一些对专业交易者至关重要的高级功能，我们在下面列出了一些。\n\n## 交易生成器\n\n通过使用避免上述6个枢纽代币的约束，本文描述的系统可以用来检查某些代币之间的替代路由及其效率。这可以定期完成以构建一个基于启发式的列表，现有系统/交易者可以使用该列表来改进对这些对的推荐路由，或允许他们进行其他更改。\n\n## 跨协议路由\n\n通过增加图形或交替地使图形数据结构成为多图并添加额外的数据源，可以扩展该系统，为用户提供跨Uniswap V2和V3协议的资产之间的路由。根据目标的不同，这可以减少交易中的滑点，也可以对分散的流动性进行管理。\n\n## 跨层路由\n\n类似于跨协议，路由器可以扩展到生成跨层路由。降低gas费用和改进交易带宽的承诺表明，layer2解决方案将有助于定义以太坊未来的很大一部分。在L2和L1资产之间交叉提出了一个新的路由挑战，其复杂性超过了协议交叉。然而，相同的基本构建区块可以生成允许跨层交易的解决方案，利用即将到来的协议来实现这一目的，例如Hop Protocol、Nova等。\n\n## MEV\n\n通过将路由解决方案与防止MEV的技术相结合，如Flashbots，该路由系统可用于保护大额交易免受攻击。试探法或其他输入可以确定一笔交易的价值是否足以表示这种风险，然后保护性解决方案可以自动合并由确定的最佳路由提出的交易解决方案中。\n\n## 低延迟数据源和预测路由\n\nGraph Protocol数据源虽然方便和快速，但通常至少有1区块延迟。对于某些交易应用来说，这可能还不够。在这方面，可以替代其他性能更好的数据源，要么直接绑定到一个以太坊节点，要么过滤已完成的感兴趣的交易，以更新路由系统的数据结构。更进一步，还可以构造内存池的有限描述，并应用类似的交易过滤，以提供未执行的已知交易状态下的预测路由结果。", "timestamp": 1635341378,

Defi 的多个特性：\n\n* **「无许可」**这意味着它们向所有人开放。\n* **「无信任」**意味着没有对中心化实体依赖，参与者不需要用信任构建交易，仅仅只需要了解只能合约就行。\n\n而构建 Defi 系统和 Dapp 的区块链，则带来了：\n\n* 不变性（安全性）\n* 可扩展性\n* 透明度高\n* 去中心化\n\n## DeFi的历史\n\n2009年比特币引入了一个新的点对点金融支付系统，不久后以太坊诞生，并引入了智能合约。而随后就出现了使用这些智能合约的去中心化组织——DAO，最早的一个是 MakerDao 。在大多数人的共识里，DeFi 的概念始于首个 DEX：OASISDEX（2016年），然后出现了首个稳定币 DAI ，接着就是 UNISWAP（2018年），或 COMP（2018年）。\n\n尽管 Defi 的概念出现的很早，但 DeFi 的魅力首次绽放则是 2020 年那个 “DeFi之夏”，并在 Twitter、Reddit和Youtube等社交媒体平台的加密货币社区病毒式扩散。MakerDAO（MRK）和Compound（COMP），这些建立在以太坊上的项目，点燃了 DeFi 最初的火炬。创造了稳定币 DAI 的 Maker 也许是发动 DeFi 这个引擎的最重要项目之一，早期的先驱者。\n\n目前，大约 50 %的 DeFi 项目是建立在以太坊之上，并且拥有最大的 TVL（总锁定资产）份额。然而，这一点正逐渐被其他新生区块链的野蛮生长所削弱，如 Avalanche 、 Solana 、 Fantom 。他们提供的智能合约具有更快和更便宜的交易成本等好处。\n\nDeFi 其实就是加密货币的延伸，它让这些代币有了用例，从而产生了更多的价值。与过去很长时间的纯粹性投机相比，购买者拥有加密货币的动机可以由项目的收入和利润等基本指标来驱动。\n\n## DeFi的增长\n\n投资者被 Defi 领域的可观回报所吸引，而同时 DeFI 的用户群也正在成倍增长。数据显示，6月底，有291 万个以太坊地址与DeFi市场互动，根据ConsenSys的数据，该数据较上一季度增加了65%。\n\nDeFi市场的规模可以通过查看市值（Market Cap）来衡量。排名前100的DeFi币总市值目前为 1350 亿美元，约占加密市场总市值——2.5万亿美元的5.6%。\n\n锁定的总价值（TVL）也是了解 DeFi 领域增长的一个流行指标，它代表了在一个特定协议中的总质押金额。而这也代表了系统中有多少用户正在存入资产以换取稳定的利息回报。\n\n根据DeFI Pulse，以太坊的 DeFi 领域体量从 2020 年开始增长了近1125%，而如果从去年 10 月开始计算，增长也是可观的 450 %，目前约有 950 亿美元 TVL。自2020年开始，所有链上的 TVL 有了恐怖的 36000 %增长，同比（YOY）增长 2180 %。\n\n## DeFi中TVL增长的3个驱动因素\n\n### 借贷\n\n利率有助于决定借款和贷款的需求和供应，本质上它代表的是借款的成本和贷款的回报。这与传统银行系统中的功能非常相似。在 DeFi 中，有一些细微的差别，如非托管，它可以提供较低的借贷成本和较高的借贷回报。而这也是受到收益率和存款利息的影响。\n\n中央银行无法控制 DeFi 协议的利率。DeFi 的利率独立于传统金融系统，不受约束，这意味着 DeFi 的利率更加灵活，也能更好的反应系统中的供应和流动性。\n\n抵押品是必须了解的，因为它代表了在偿还贷款之前作为抵押的东西。当你想在DeFi中借款时，你用你的加密货币作为抵押品，向其他加密货币借款，但这通常是过度抵押的。这是在拖欠偿还贷款的情况下作为担保。\n\n### 质押：Yield Farming, Liquidity Providing （LP）\n\nYield Farming, Liquidity Providing 是所有的质押形式，都是以赚取可观的利息为最终目的。它们通常是通过协议代币向 DEX 提供流动性。但是，由于其去中心化的性质，Defi 里面有着更客观的收益，并且与仅仅将钱存在银行有着本质上的区别。\n\n### 交易\n\nDeFi的交易涉及以无监管的方式购买和出售加密货币，无需设立账户和发送身份证和地址文件，而这一步骤被称为 \"了解你的客户（KYC）\"。而促进这些交易的去中心化交易所 （DEX） 则是中心化交易所（CEX）的一个替代方案。\n\n交易所是加密货币的第一个重要的商业模式，这对于第一批早期的 DeFi 项目来说也同样通用。\n\n## 支持DeFi的区块链\n\n* 以太坊\n* Solana\n* Avalanche\n* Fantom\n\n## 中心化金融（CeFi）和去中心化金融（DeFi）\n\n目前，CeFi 的用户比 DeFi 多，但由于交易成本下降和平台上交易深度逐渐变得更广（流动性更强）等原因，这种情况可能在逐渐改变。\n\n流动性是指在市场上实现交易的数量，通常更高的流动性意味着更低的滑点。（注：滑点指的是实际价格和你在交易所执行交易时支付的价格之间的差异。）对于交易者来说，滑点增加了交易者的成本，这也是交易者在挑选工具时所极力避免的问题。\n\n对于尝试使用DeFi应用程序 （DApp） 的投资者来说，参与DeFI生态系统可能很棘手，并且成本很高。建立钱包的过程可能很繁琐，因为处理你的安全问题是你自己的责任。管理你的私钥和钱包信息就变得至关重要了。而通常情况下，在中心化交易所里，你的资产由服务供应商进行控制和管理，作为简便的代价，你必须信任交易所。\n\n除此以外，还有一个成本问题。在以太坊这样的链上执行交易，你会付很高的Gas费用。以太坊区块链上的交易成本，以 \"Gwei \"衡量，也被称为 \"gas\"。在链上活动剧烈增加的时候，这个成本可能高的超乎你的想象。而现在这似乎也变成了筛选投资者的方式之一，小资金体量的投资者，是无法在以太坊链上生存的。\n\n下图是在7月8日实施的 ETH-1559 升级后的 Gas 费用走势，以帮助降低交易成本，目前交易成本仍为 8-12（美元），约 0.003 ETH，或 140 gwei。\n\n要成为 DeFi 投资者，投资于 DeFi相 关项目，而且不需要直接与DeFi协议互动也是可以的。作为投资者，你可以通过中心化交易所进行投资，这比直接与 DeFi 互动更容易。\n\n**以下是3个DeFi协议，这3个协议都有一个良好运作的社区，并且都具有强大且独特的功能：**\n\n### AAVE\n\nAAVE 是 DeFi 最接近银行系统的协议。它使用货币市场系统来实现借贷。它有一个名为 AAVE 的原生代币，用于奖励用户在其协议上的质押和社区治理行为。\n\n**它如何运作？**\n\n在银行的传统借贷系统中，贷款人与借款人相匹配。银行作为中间人，对资金进行管理。然而，在AAVE上，该协议通过智能合约实现了自动的、自动化的贷款，从而减少了中间人这个步骤。AAVE的借贷流程，贷款人将他们的加密货币存入流动性池。这些流动资金池本质上是一个资金池，使存款人能够根据他们的存款获得利息，而 AAVE 则从流动资金池中抽取贷款给借款人，而借款人则为此支付利息。然而，这取决于流动性资金池中资产总量（即深度）。这意味着，利率会根据需求和供应水平而波动。较高的利率是用来激励贷款人存入更多的代币，而当利率下降，就意味着市场上的贷款人资产供应量非常充足。\n\n在传统的银行系统中，发放的贷款是没有抵押物的。然而，在 AAVE 中，贷款是超额抵押的，这意味着用户需要存入高于他们所借金额的抵押品。\n\n提醒一下，抵押品代表作为担保的东西；在这里的情况下，加密货币即抵押品被锁定，直到偿还贷款，以防违约。而AAVE采取了一定的预防措施，如果抵押品的价值低于抵押金额，则会自动开启清算程序。\n\n**衡量标准**\n\n* 价格：304美元，707%（年涨幅）。\n* 市值：40亿美元\n* TVL：160亿美元\n\n### Uniswap\n\nUniswap是DeFi中最受欢迎的去中心化交易所和自动做市商（AMM）。AMM是DeFi的一个概念（你可以把 AMM 设想成一个原始的、机器人式的做市商，它根据一个简单的定价算法，在两种资产之间随时提供报价。）。\n\n**它如何运作？**\n\nUniswap不使用传统的挂单模式来匹配买家和卖家，以确定价格和执行交易，而是使用特定的公式（x \\* y = k.）、代币池和以太坊来自动化该流程。\n\n通过利用任何ERC-20资产（使用以太坊建立的代币），用户会为这些池子注入流动性（成为LP），为每个提供交易的代币提供流动性，然后赚取 UNI 作为完成交易的回报。UNI是Uniswap的治理代币；它的唯一功能是作为治理代币，对社区提出的 Uniswap 提案进行投票。\n\n**衡量标准**\n\n* 价格：27美元，909%（年涨幅）。\n* 市值：140亿美元\n* TVL：49亿美元\n\n### dYdX\n\n最大，且有最可观的流动性的去中心化衍生品交易所，建立在以太坊区块链上。提供永续合约、期货、保证金交易和现货市场，旨在成为 DeFi 中最佳交易工具。它的原生代币被用于社区治理、采矿奖励、质押池和交易折扣。\n\n衍生品在加密市场中占有相当大的份额；它们的交易量现在与 Coinbase 等大型 CEX 供应商的顶级 CeFI 现货交易市场相当；过去 24小时内 dYdX 的交易量为 59 亿美元，而一周前 Coinbase 的交易量为34亿美元。\n\n投资者对 DEX 和衍生品的需求可能会继续增长，因为它正在成为一些加密货币投资者投资和交易的唯一解决方案。\n\n**它如何运作？**\n\n根据标准的DeFi设计，dYdX是一个借贷协议。虽然，dYdX突破了这个限制，成为了以太坊去中心化衍生品交易的首选方案。而且它拥有与市场上一些最大的 CEX 一样的流动性。用户将资金存入他们的保证金或现货账户，开始向协议借出资金，或借入 ETH 、 DAI 和 USDC 。用户可以在从他们的钱包存款后，直接在他们的账户进行交易。其中，来自这些钱包的存款然后被用来对不同的货币对进行交易。用户可以再次提取他们的资金放回钱包中。\n\n像大多数DeFi金融产品一样，dYdX 可供任何人使用，其用户的资产通过利用智能合约应用程序进行管理和运行，没有中间环节。\n\n**衡量标准**\n\n* 价格：22.4美元\n* 市值：12.5亿美元\n* TVL: 9.8亿美元\n\nDeFi 发展路径时间轴：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dn2-7DAAqHFbuDxYFriuk.png?height=1536&width=800)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635341310, "digest":

In cryptocurrency markets, this commonly occurs where tokens or currencies are swapped or traded for others. Uniswap is an automated liquidity protocol that facilitates this type of swapping. It uses pairs or pools (henceforth pairs), pooled reserves of two assets\\[1], to allow a user to swap one asset for another.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*kCrAxgEXdrPJ5Hqu)\n\nFigure 1.0: A Uniswap pool of tokens A and B along with example swap and deposit interactions by a Liquidity Provider (LP) and Trader, respectively. The LP receives Pool Tokens for providing liquidity. Image credit \\[2].\n\nWhat happens if someone wants an asset that is not available in a pair with the asset they wish to trade with? In this situation, a series of swaps are made across multiple pairs to get the desired asset — the pairs used to facilitate this trade are called a *route*.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1176/0\\*SosxKE9FWzTog86h)\n\nFigure 2.0: A route involving multiple pairs to trade DAI for USDC. Image credit \\[3].\n\nRoutes are a path from one asset to another consisting of zero or more segments between pairs. A route can be formed from multiple paths to reduce slippage by incorporating more liquidity from other pairs if the amount being traded is large enough or if the liquidity of a pair is low enough.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*FUWeajnaN9MpNVAv)\n\nFigure 3.0: A multiple path route illustrated by the Paraswap Router\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*GGreXQu4xyNrjd9B)\n\nFigure 4.0: A multiple path route, optimizing for maximum return from the 1inch Router\n\nSlippage is the difference between the price a person expects to pay for an asset and the actual amount paid due to factors such as price movement between the time the order enters the market and the execution of a trade or low volume and liquidity \\[4].\n\nAnother consideration is the number of segments in a path. This will contribute to the cost of the trade in the form of gas fees for operations on the Ethereum blockchain. The more segments in a path, the higher the resulting gas fees. Similarly, if there are multiple paths, as shown above in figures 3 and 4, gas fees will also be higher.\n\nA router must take these factors into consideration to produce suitable routes for the amount being traded. Furthermore, because market conditions are frequently changing which affects gas fees and pool liquidity, generated routes will also be dynamic and an excellent route now, will not necessarily perform well an hour later or the next day.\n\nThe remainder of this document discusses building blocks that can be used in the construction and analysis of a router for the Uniswap V2 protocol and beyond.\n\n## Data Modelling\n\nNote: *The Graph protocol mentioned herein differs from the graph data type discussed in the following section. The Graph protocol is an index of blockchain transactions for one or more smart contracts, whereas the graph data type refers to a representation of data using mathematical graph theory.*\n\nJust as a map is used to navigate between points, a graph data type \\[5] can be used to navigate the available liquidity pairs to produce routes that can be evaluated for improved returns. In modeling Uniswap pairs, a number of implementation choices need to be made at the outset:\n\n*   Pairs, symbols, or asset identifiers as vertices or edges?\n*   Directed or undirected?\n*   Simple or multigraph?\n\nTo make the implementation choices outlined above, it’s important to understand the properties of Uniswap pairs:\n\n*   Each pair has a unique ID\n*   Each pair contains the following data for the pairs 2 tokens: Symbol, Name, ID\n*   Token symbols are not unique — for instance, the symbol BOND represents many different assets or different IDs.\n*   Token names are also not necessarily unique.\n*   Token IDs are unique and are the token’s ERC-20 contract address\n\nThese properties of Uniswap pairs suggest the use of the Token IDs as vertices in the graph data type. It follows that the edges of the graph represent the unique pair ids. In this form, the graph may be undirected or directed with each edge representing the pair id and token price and reserve. However, the constant need to update token price and reserve information, suggests storing this data in a caching structure with appropriate time-to-live settings may be more efficient and scalable, especially for applications in real-time trading as opposed to static analysis.\n\nGoing forward, it is desirable to route between Uniswap V2 and V3 protocol pairs. In this scenario, it may be that multiple pairs exist for the same Token IDs. While it’s possible to add an additional edge between pair IDs, another solution is grouping the different pair IDs on the same edge, avoiding the performance costs of traversing a multigraph. A partial example of the grouped pair ID undirected simple graph structure appears below with symbol IDs substituted for symbol names:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/996/0\\*N4Z1LHvqofPpvjdG)\n\nFigure 5.0: Modelling Uniswap V2 and V3 protocol pairs in an undirected simple graph (note that the actual structure uses token IDs instead of token symbols, which would have been cumbersome here).\n\nInitially, a Depth First Search (DFS) has proven sufficient for traversing the graph, limited to a depth of 4 in the general case. An exception to this depth is routes starting from WETH, where the number of connected nodes exceeds 30,000. When a route starts from WETH, the DFS has been limited to a depth of 2, to reduce traversal times.\n\nA number of tools exist for working with graph data types including the graph databases Neo4J and RedisGraph. A discussion of these exceeds the scope of this document and the current project requirements can be met with the Javascript library Graphlib \\[6]. However, should the scale of the routing problem reach a similar magnitude to that of LinkedIn or other large networks, then the aforementioned graph databases reportedly scale to meet those demands, trading off cost and development complexity.\n\n## Constraints\n\nConstraints are useful when computing routes in a graph data structure. For example, they facilitate determining routes that only traverse a limited number of pairs or can be used to ignore pairs containing certain assets.\n\nExisting Uniswap V2 routing is dominated by routes through six assets that can be likened to airport hubs. These six assets are:\n\n*   WETH\n*   DAI\n*   USDC\n*   USDT\n*   COMP\n*   MKR\n\nThe six assets are useful because they are in common use and when combined with other assets in a pair, do not impose liquidity limitations (i.e. they’re not scarce and do not pose the same risk as new, unproven crypto assets). However, their use can pose efficiency problems documented here \\[7], where it is stated:\n\n> “Uniswap is not routing swaps in a decentralized way.”\n\nUsing constraints, such as ignoring the six hub assets mentioned above, allows exploration of potentially more efficient routes than what the current Uniswap V2 interface offers users. Constraints can also be extended to other criteria, such as:\n\n*   Routing through pools with X liquidity in USD or Y% of the trade in USD.\n*   Routing through specific pools with specific pricing. (Useful for Uniswap V3 Protocol)\n\nIt’s also worth noting that constraints are composable — that is they can be combined so that routing can be limited to a maximum of 2 pools, each with liquidity exceeding X. The current data model splits data between the graph data type and lookup tables which means that routes can be pruned both during the graph traversal and afterward when pair data is being discovered.\n\n## Scaling\n\nScaling is largely considered for exposing a public API to the router for computing routes based on current market data. Performance is a function of:\n\n*   the time to compute a route\n*   the time to get updated pair data if needed (token prices and reserves)\n*   the time needed to compute the impact of a route request\n\nThe diagram below illustrates one initial system architecture, featuring caches for the most commonly requested routes and cached pair data for calculating route request impact. This architecture is flexible and can be scaled horizontally in multiple ways. For example, replicating the graph data structure and route caches as well as the request aggregator and pair caches completely, or simply by replicating the caches and distributing route requests among the caches.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Hrq1LHd\\_5cqXhh8D)\n\nFigure 6.0: Routing service architecture featuring scalable components, caching, and periodic updates.\n\nAnother potential scalability modification could be a complete route solution cache that considers the route request and amount; if the amount is within a certain tolerance a recently calculated result can be reused. The recently calculated result can also be used as a temporary result while a more accurate one is computed for a user, depending upon the needs of the UX and application.\n\n## Route Cache\n\nThe route cache consists of results of the most commonly requested routes with a Time-To-Live (TTL) related to the periodic update frequency from the data source. For example, if a route between WETH and DAI has been previously requested, the results of the graph traversal can be found within the route cache as an array of possible routes: \\[WETH -> USDC -> DAI, WETH -> WBTC -> DAI, …]. Unlike pair data, such as token prices and reserves, the route possibilities — specifically the presence of pairs — change less frequently, so this cache’s TTL is expected to be significantly larger than the pair data cache. Additionally, this component may expand to incorporate heuristics for dead routes (i.e. pairs that are expired or have superseded token addresses or illiquid pairs).\n\n## Pair Data Cache\n\nThe pair data cache contains the token price and reserve data for specific pairs, facilitating computing of the impact of a route request using a specified amount. This data changes more frequently than the available routing options and will have a TTL that is approximately one ethereum block (\\~ 15s).\n\nWhen data requested is not in the cache, those requests will be bundled together and fetched from the data source, currently the Uniswap Subgraph on The Graph Protocol (see the Data Sources section below), in groups up to 1000 pair data queries. The wait time before sending a bundled pair data request will be tuned based on traffic — in low traffic scenarios, it doesn’t make sense to make users wait until additional requests are made.\n\nAdditionally, for improved UX, pre-results based on old data may be presented while updated data is being fetched and computed.\n\n## Static Analysis\n\nRoute performance will be evaluated by comparing the yield of generated routes against the existing Uniswap V2 router’s routes. Specifically by computing the yield for a given amount of the source token. For example, in a trade from DAI to COMP, the performance of the router will be compared by calculating how much COMP is received from 1 million DAI tokens and examining the same result from the Uniswap V2 router’s suggested route. The performance will be measured for a variety of varying inputs, for example, different initial amounts, different limitations to the search depth, etc.\n\nThe aforementioned pair data cache and bundled requests of figure 6.0 are not needed when the static analysis is being performed. Static analysis is the computation of trades at a specific block time in the blockchain. It facilitates consistency and repeatability of results for comparison purposes. The scope of the initial work in designing a new router for Uniswap V2 is aided by static analysis where an ensemble of trades can be evaluated at a block time and compared to the existing routing algorithm or variations. If the underlying pair data was changing, it would be unclear if improvements or degradations in trading results were due to algorithmic changes or pair liquidity and pricing.\n\n## Data Sources\n\nAs blockchain technologies mature, a plethora of services have surfaced to provide current and historical blockchain data. The choice of a data source involves the following considerations:\n\n*   Budget\n*   Development Effort & Cost\n*   Latency\n*   Data Accuracy\n\nDevelopment effort and cost can be reduced by using pre-digested or indexed data like that found in the Graph Protocol’s numerous sub-graphs.\n\nFor initial swap router design and implementation, the Uniswap Subgraph of the Graph protocol will be used. This data source provides excellent ease of use, the ability to analyze contract data from the past that would otherwise necessitate a more expensive archival Ethereum Node, and the ability to update the data for 1000 pairs in a single HTTP request when the static analysis is not being performed. Data in the Graph Protocol has much lower latency than the aforementioned solution and is only bested by running an Ethereum node directly or modeling the mempool (or perhaps with services like Blocknative). The Graph Protocol’s latency is observably about 1 block, which can change dynamically under certain indexing scenarios. Notably, the data can also change when indexed and mapped blocks prove to be invalid\\[8]\\[9].\n\nOnce the swap router design has been evaluated, this data source would prove unsuitable for generating routes because of the need for real-time data to be competitive. In such a scenario, data directly from the current state of the blockchain would be required, for example, Ethereum nodes from Alchemy, Infura, or another source.\n\n## Future\n\nThe system outlined above provides flexibility and extensibility to analyze the performance of existing Uniswap systems as well as building new systems atop the protocol including a full-fledged trading solution. Similar to *Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro* or *Synthetix vs Kwenta*, there are advanced features essential for professional traders, and we have outlined a few below.\n\n## Trade Generator\n\nBy employing constraints that avoid the aforementioned 6 hub tokens, the system described herein can be used to check for alternate routes and their efficiency between certain tokens. This can be done on a regular basis to construct a heuristic-based list that can be employed by existing systems/traders to improve their recommended routing for those pairs or allow them to make other changes.\n\n## Cross-Protocol Routes\n\nBy augmenting the graph edges or alternately making the graph data structure a multi-graph and adding extra data sources, it is possible to extend this system to furnish users with routes between assets that cross from between the Uniswap V2 and V3 protocols. Depending upon the objectives, this can serve to reduce slippage in trades or alternately work towards managing fragmented liquidity.\n\n## Cross-Layer Routes\n\nSimilar to cross-protocol, the router can be extended to generate cross-layer routes. The promise of reduced gas fees and improved transaction bandwidth suggest that layer 2 solutions will help define a significant portion of the future of Ethereum. Crossing between a layer 2 and layer 1 asset presents a new routing challenge with complexity that exceeds protocol crossings. However, the same fundamental building blocks can generate solutions that allow for trades across layers, taking advantage of upcoming protocols for this purpose, for example, the Hop Protocol \\[10], Nova \\[11], and others.\n\n## MEV (Maximally Extracted Value)\n\nBy combining route solutions with technologies to prevent MEV, such as Flashbots \\[12], the routing system herein can be used to protect large trades from attacks. Heuristics or other inputs can determine if the value of a trade is sufficient to present such a risk and then protective solutions can be automatically incorporated into the trade solution presented from the determined best routes.\n\n## Low Latency Data Sources & Predictive Routing\n\nThe Graph Protocol data source while convenient and fast does have at least 1 block of latency typically. This may be insufficient for some applications in trading. It’s possible to substitute other data sources that are more performant in this regard, either by tying directly into an ethereum node and filtering completed transactions of interest to update the data structures of the routing system. Going a step further, it is also possible to construct a limited depiction of the mempool and apply similar transaction filtering in an effort to provide predicted routing results given the state of unexecuted known transactions.\n", "timestamp": 1635341556, "digest": "jLuK2YVYY9E01TLILhPPf_Svb0rrlvY5jIe9FgymeyE", "contributor": "0x4CC11987Ee4D62076F8218d0f97e81437611e311"}

{"id": "7XeRa8GvxXjNKHfE_cSnwxDkFbq7M-YCn1lma2LO51w", "title": "METAVERSE AND THE IDEAL WORLD", "body": "Before talking about the ideal world, let's first discuss the political and economic system and ideology of the currently existing society.\n\nMany people think that the concept of the country has always existed. This is an illusion. The entire history of humanity has lasted millions of years from primitive society. However, the first country near the Nile River began to appear bout 5000 to 7000 years ago. In China, we all know that it was in the Xia Dynasty around the 21st century BC, right? Why did that country appear? And will it exist forever in the future? Let's think about this, the emergence of the country, this is the form of a tribe with dozens of people or hundreds of people in primitive society. At that time it was impossible for too many people to gather together. People were in the era of gathering and hunting, if too many people gathered together, there would not be enough food, so there is no conditions to form a country. With the emergence of the agricultural era, the energy density human could gather is much much higher. What does it mean? That is to say, compared to one hectare of forest with one hectare of cultivated land, no doubt cultivated land can feed more people. Therefore, human beings could make large-scale gatherings possible, and then cities and nations can be formed. So the forming of a country is related to technology. It’s the technology that determines the country, not technology determines the form of the country. So geopolitics has been around for thousands of years. However, In a longer time dimension, will it continue to exist?\n\nFirst of all, from the biological point of view, the current genetic sequencing and archaeology have fully proved that modern humans evolved from early Homo sapiens in Africa. We are the same in terms of blood relationships and genetics. No matter which country you are from, Whether it is black, brown, or white, everyone comes from a unified ancestor.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, Today, the civilization of industry and commerce have highly developed, we carried out an unparalleled global division of labor. Any commodity, like a mobile phone, a car, may have the American chip, the Japanese semiconductor included, and the Chinese assembled, right? Many products around us have already condensed the wisdom and labor of people from all over the world, so this is a global collaboration in the economy, which is integrated.\n\nThought and ideology. In history, due to differences in ideology, ideology, and religious beliefs, constant and endless conflicts, and killings have been causing. But for modern society, you can learn about different cultures and different thinking at your fingertips through the Internet. For example, many Chinese understand the way of thinking of Western countries, such as concepts like freedom, democracy, and equality. They also study Western political systems. Americans also study Chinese culture and political systems, right? So in terms of way of thinking, technology has laid the foundation for humans to understand and tolerate each other.\n\nBut currency, there is still no global integration. A philosopher said that the modern monetary system is the greatest slavery. The current monetary system has three problems:\n\n1. Inflation: The Federal Reserve dilutes people's wealth through continuous currency issuance. It is the eternal shackles on the people. In any country’s legal currency system, its genes are destined to be an inflation currency, and there is no solution for the inflation problem;\n2. The inefficiency of cross-border transfers: the currencies of various countries in the world are not unified, the United States has the US dollar, China has the RMB, the Russian ruble, the Indian rupee, and so on. In the process of international economic and trade exchanges, the flow of money will be hindered and frictional. International remittances are time wasted and are costly. Currency has to go through different bank accounting systems, and there are foreign exchange settlement losses, many of which require manual processing. Therefore, after Qin Shihuang unified the six countries, the first thing to do was to unify weights and measures, unify currency, otherwise, it would be difficult to conduct transactions. Today, with the integration of the global economy and trade, we still do not have a unified currency.\n3. The US dollar uses its currency status to isolate and sanction other countries. The US-led SWIFT system can exclude other countries’ banks from entering their system, preventing other countries from conducting normal trade with other countries. It even freezes the assets of other governments and enterprises. This type of event has occurred many times in history.\n\nWhen I learned about Bitcoin in 2013 for the first time, I instantly understood the problems that Bitcoin was trying to solve.\n\nAbove all, I just want to state that politics, economics, and thinking, and ideologies have been constantly changing. There are still a lot of problems in the current economic and political systems in the world. Our future generations will look back to our current political and economic systems in the future, and they will certainly ask why we use such a backward system.\n\nTherefore, the ideal society should be a society without discrimination against certain nationality, no political oppression, and no war anymore; regardless of religious and ethnic differences; currency is unified, without economic oppression and trade friction, economic rules are transparent and freely chosen by the people, A new world where everyone can realize their self-worth. Readers may think that this is just a dream, a Utopia that could never be achieved. Then I want to say that this solution has arrived, the answer is METAVERSE!\n\nIn METAVERSE, do people’s nationalities, races and religious beliefs matter? Is there any political oppression? Is there a METAVERSE police will arrest you and state that your remarks are contrary to the political purpose of METAVERSE? Does Cryptocurrency have national boundaries? Will anyone block you and prevent you from trading on ETH? Are the protocols of ETH, SOLANA, ICP, etc. transparent? Are you free to choose between different protocols, ETH, EOS, ICP, and other different chains? But in the real world, you can choose the nationality you like freely, right? In the Metaverse, there will be various divisions of labor soon. Everything in it needs us to build. like literary works, artistic works, the basic construction in the metaverse, the design and generation of various objects, and so on. There will be production, transactions, consumption, and social activities. Details will be discussed in the next chapter. Hopefully, everyone would find their place and belonging in the metaverse.\n\nIn summary, METAVERSE for the first time makes a perfect ideal world come true, which is in the minds of idealists for thousands of years. Mankind is about to enter a new era. The currency is unified, economic rules are transparent, there is no political oppression, regardless of nationality, religion, and race.

That was USV’s initial web2 thesis:\n\n> USV in 140 characters: invest in large networks of engaged users, differentiated by user experience, and defensible though network effects\n>\n> — Brad Burnham (@BradUSV) [June 8, 2011](https://twitter.com/BradUSV/status/78512458419015680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAnd the way many/most of those networks were built was by delivering single user utility day-one and then building out network effects around that utility.\n\nChris Dixon called that “come for the tools, stay for the network” in [this blog post](https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network).\n\nWe are seeing a different go-to-market action in web3.\n\nMost consumers start with the token/asset and go from there. Initially, it was Bitcoin and you’d store it at Coinbase. Then it was Ethereum and you’d stake it. Then it was a Cryptokitty and you’d sire it. Then it was a TopShot and you’d collect it and trade it. Then it was a CryptoPunk and you’d make it your Twitter avatar. Then it was an Axie token and you’d use it to play Axie Infinity. I could go on and on but you get the idea.\n\nAnd what is most interesting to me is that these assets that you start with don’t need to stay in the networks you first use them in. You can move your Bitcoin to your ledger wallet. You can pool your Ethereum on Uniswap. You can list your CryptoPunk on OpenSea. You can [use your Axie token to buy a car](https://twitter.com/ChattBarbara/status/1452909807514513416?s=20).\n\nWhich leads me to believe that the go-to-market action in web3 is:\n\nCome for the assets, stay for the experience.\n\nI [shared that on twitter yesterday](https://twitter.com/fredwilson/status/1453057105959833620?s=20) and putting it here today.\n", "timestamp": 1635343613, "digest": "iA-lkzLgzwDh_SIlCwxLD9GtYYdz98iQqzJzC-wcBYM", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

Think, design, develop and deploy NFT-related dApps, across chains, with a focus on products sitting at the intersection of the NFTs and DeFi ecosystems\n2. Build PirateDAO itself into a long-lasting decentralized organization that can guarantees funding its own operations, through smart treasury management (such as re-investing revenues from previously shipped products)\n\nPirateDAO wants to be different from many DAOs that have come before it. To date, DAOs have mostly been synonymous with a treasury of funds + group signal-voting on where to send those funds; with very little input from communities on the kind products that are to be built, or on the development direction for existing ones. PirateDAO aims to achieve something more fun and valuable: **a fully decentralized organization that  ships new products**.\n\nToday, following up right away on our own motto, we are releasing Programmable Loot on Polygon (more on this below), along with our completely fair-launched initial offering for **JollyRoger** (🏴‍☠️), PirateDAO governance and only token; with a soft-capped, **ultra-scarce supply of 818 units available for minting to early users of our first product**.\n\n\\*JollyRoger (`0x0c80963e7228A81D6F805418531E44C48975d6D5`) rewards table for [ProgrammableLoot](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x76ade2d575e5db76f1c9b977575a9b324c5d23ea):\n\n* SACK = ***0.000213 🏴‍☠️***\n* BARREL = ***0.00213 🏴‍☠️***\n* CRATE = ***0.00426 🏴‍☠️***\n* URN = ***0.0106 🏴‍☠️***\n* COFFER = ***0.0213 🏴‍☠️***\n* CHEST = ***0.05 🏴‍☠️***\n* TROVE = ***0.2 🏴‍☠️***\n* RELIQUARY = ***0.4 🏴‍☠️***\n\n## Programmable Loot\n\nProgrammable Loot (or pLOOT) is a big upgrade over the concept of scarce, general-purpose, on-chain loot metadata originally introduced by [dom](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1431316631934967815) in multiple variants, that inspired many of us in the Ethereum community and naturally spurred derivatives and tooling to augment the project.\n\nAs a TLDR:\n\n* There are 8 Container classes (*SACK, BARREL, CRATE, URN, COFFER, TROVE, RELIQUARY*), each with unique base properties that affect what Items can be found within after genesis\n* The containers baseline attributes only compound the random genesis seed provided by the Chainlink VRF oracles, which is the ultimate factor in determining both the number and rarity of the generated Loot Items\n* Minting a Loot Container (and the Loot Items within) is a process made up of two asynchronous, distinct phases: a genesis step (where the container minting floor price fee is transferred to PirateDAO treasury and randomness is requested from  Chainlink VRF service) and a claim step (where the container and items, if any, are actually minted)\n* Loot is composable; that is, containers can accept and transfer items at the will of their owners. This allows for any arrangement of loot composability and shifts the balance of value towards Loot Items themselves\n* Rarity (only applicable to Loot Items) is made up of 7 classes (UNCOMMON, COMMON, RARE, EPIC, LEGENDARY, MYTHIC, RELIC), dictates what attributes a particular Item will exhibit, and is derived from the original container seed\n\n### Minting Loot Containers with the UI\n\nIn pLOOT there are Loot Containers and Loot Items, the latter is what can be valuable (e.g. based on their rarity, or usefulness in a particular application or game) but can only be obtained by minting the former; in other words, you will need to generate and claim (mint) Loot Containers (there are 8 classes of them, with different properties), in order to mint Loot Items.\n\n**Minting containers is a two-step process:**\n\n* First, you request a ContainerGenesis event, in exchange for that container class mint floor price; besides reserving the container for yourself, this will initiate a Chainlink VRF request that will eventually seed (usually within a few blocks) and permanently associate your container with a truly random genesis seed\n* Second, and only after the Chainlink VRF oracle will have fulfilled the randomness, the container is ready to be claimed and any Loot Items inside it unveiled (and minted in the same tx); initially these will be owned by the container itself\n\nSpeaking of ownership: in pLOOT, every Loot Item is ownable (and per above, initially belonging to the container that minted it) which makes for programmable Loot Containers (able to host any Loot Item combination), from which owners can freely deposit (items that they now own, e.g. because they acquired them on the market) and withdraw them (if they were transferred inside the container).\n\nFollows a visual guide showcasing said features:\n\n![1-time WETH approval for Programmable Loot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Rhz4Tnwli_mVdMxNskA9X.PNG?height=769&width=997)\n\n![Pick the container class you wish to generate](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PFVs9gHw80cBuirrGOle6.PNG?height=765&width=994)\n\n![After genesis, the container shows up (give it a few blocks) in the SEEDING state](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CF22S6qpOe22_-HOLYLdc.PNG?height=317&width=994)\n\n![After a few blocks time, Chainlink will seed the genesis event with randomness, allowing you to mint the container, and all items within](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vkpLItSgJdiH8Xk35xObw.PNG?height=316&width=993)\n\n![After claiming, you can browse the newly minted container by ID and see what came with it (though luck here).

We have improved the product, added new integrations, scaled our team with great talents, and grown the community tremendously. Our mission is more ambitious than ever: we want to become the default tool for data collection and computation for all Web3 projects.\n\nTo achieve this ambitious goal, we are proud to announce that we have closed our second fundraising, led by [Permanent Ventures](http://permanent.ventures/) and [Hypersphere Ventures](https://www.hypersphere.ventures/), as well as outstanding crypto funds and networks such as [Volt Capital](https://www.volt.capital/), [Mechanism Capital](https://www.mechanism.capital/), [Coinbase Ventures](https://ventures.coinbase.com/), [Distributed Global](http://www.distributedglobal.com/), [4SV](https://www.4sv.io/), [Compute Ventures](https://compute.ventures/), [Zee Prime](https://zeeprime.capital/), [CMS Holding](http://cmsholdings.io/), [Ternary Capital](https://www.ternary.capital/), [Flori Ventures](https://www.floriventures.com/) ([Celo](https://celo.org/)’s venture arm), [Mina Foundation](https://minaprotocol.com/), [Octopus Network](https://oct.network/), [Composable Finance](https://www.composable.finance/) and a group of notable angel investors including [Justin Kan](https://twitter.com/justinkan) (founder of Twitch), [Robin Chan](https://twitter.com/robinchan), [Santiago Roel Santos](https://twitter.com/santiagoroel), [John Scianna](https://twitter.com/john_scianna) from [Nifty’s](https://niftys.com/), Ganesh and Erik from [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/) and Alex Shevchenko from [Aurora](https://aurora.dev/). In addition, we received a grant from the [Moonbeam Foundation](https://moonbeam.foundation/).\n\nThe whole team is more focused than ever on making this project a success.\n\n## What is coming up next?\n\n## Additional Integrations & Features\n\nIn the coming months, we plan to iterate over the protocol to improve KYVE. We recently launched a private ambassador/beta-tester program to get better feedback from the community and deliver the features it needs. As we want to become the default tool for data collection and computation, we hope to convince more and more web3 projects to integrate with us.\n\n## Incentivized Testnet\n\nWe have been improving our website and protocol for the last months, which will be released soon. After the release, we aim to kick off an incentivized testnet, gather more feedback from the community, and reward the members who have helped us since day one.\n\n## Recruiting\n\nWe’re looking for new talents to help us scale and iterate on KYVE. We are looking to hire a marketing/growth manager, a software engineer, a solidity developer, and a technical support manager for the following months. More info will follow soon.\n\nLastly, we want to thank again the unique investors that believed in our project since day one. Their help is not just about funds but also assisting us in our journey through the crypto world. We would also like to thank the incredible community following us, supporting us at this very early stage of the project. We cannot thank you enough and cannot wait for you to see what comes next.\n\n## **About Us**\n\n[KYVE](https://www.kyve.network/) is a next-generation protocol that enables data providers to store and reliably verify their data streams seamlessly.

At that time it was impossible for too many people to gather together. People were in the era of gathering and hunting, if too many people gathered together, there would not be enough food, so there is no conditions to form a country. With the emergence of the agricultural era, the energy density human could gather is much much higher. What does it mean? That is to say, compared to one hectare of forest with one hectare of cultivated land, no doubt cultivated land can feed more people. Therefore, human beings could make large-scale gatherings possible, and then cities and nations can be formed. So the forming of a country is related to technology. It’s the technology that determines the country, not technology determines the form of the country. So geopolitics has been around for thousands of years. However, In a longer time dimension, will it continue to exist?\n\nFirst of all, from the biological point of view, the current genetic sequencing and archaeology have fully proved that modern humans evolved from early Homo sapiens in Africa. We are the same in terms of blood relationships and genetics. No matter which country you are from, Whether it is black, brown, or white, everyone comes from a unified ancestor.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, Today, the civilization of industry and commerce have highly developed, we carried out an unparalleled global division of labor. Any commodity, like a mobile phone, a car, may have the American chip, the Japanese semiconductor included, and the Chinese assembled, right? Many products around us have already condensed the wisdom and labor of people from all over the world, so this is a global collaboration in the economy, which is integrated.\n\nThought and ideology. In history, due to differences in ideology, ideology, and religious beliefs, constant and endless conflicts, and killings have been causing. But for modern society, you can learn about different cultures and different thinking at your fingertips through the Internet. For example, many Chinese understand the way of thinking of Western countries, such as concepts like freedom, democracy, and equality. They also study Western political systems. Americans also study Chinese culture and political systems, right? So in terms of way of thinking, technology has laid the foundation for humans to understand and tolerate each other.\n\nBut currency, there is still no global integration. A philosopher said that the modern monetary system is the greatest slavery. The current monetary system has three problems:\n\n1. Inflation: The Federal Reserve dilutes people's wealth through continuous currency issuance. It is the eternal shackles on the people. In any country’s legal currency system, its genes are destined to be an inflation currency, and there is no solution for the inflation problem;\n2. The inefficiency of cross-border transfers: the currencies of various countries in the world are not unified, the United States has the US dollar, China has the RMB, the Russian ruble, the Indian rupee, and so on. In the process of international economic and trade exchanges, the flow of money will be hindered and frictional. International remittances are time wasted and are costly. Currency has to go through different bank accounting systems, and there are foreign exchange settlement losses, many of which require manual processing. Therefore, after Qin Shihuang unified the six countries, the first thing to do was to unify weights and measures, unify currency, otherwise, it would be difficult to conduct transactions. Today, with the integration of the global economy and trade, we still do not have a unified currency.\n3. The US dollar uses its currency status to isolate and sanction other countries. The US-led SWIFT system can exclude other countries’ banks from entering their system, preventing other countries from conducting normal trade with other countries. It even freezes the assets of other governments and enterprises. This type of event has occurred many times in history.\n\nWhen I learned about Bitcoin in 2013 for the first time, I instantly understood the problems that Bitcoin was trying to solve.\n\nAbove all, I just want to state that politics, economics, and thinking, and ideologies have been constantly changing. There are still a lot of problems in the current economic and political systems in the world. Our future generations will look back to our current political and economic systems in the future, and they will certainly ask why we use such a backward system.\n\nTherefore, the ideal society should be a society without discrimination against certain nationality, no political oppression, and no war anymore; regardless of religious and ethnic differences; currency is unified, without economic oppression and trade friction, economic rules are transparent and freely chosen by the people, A new world where everyone can realize their self-worth. Readers may think that this is just a dream, a Utopia that could never be achieved. Then I want to say that this solution has arrived, the answer is METAVERSE!\n\nIn METAVERSE, do people’s nationalities, races and religious beliefs matter? Is there any political oppression? Is there a METAVERSE police will arrest you and state that your remarks are contrary to the political purpose of METAVERSE? Does Cryptocurrency have national boundaries? Will anyone block you and prevent you from trading on ETH? Are the protocols of ETH, SOLANA, ICP, etc. transparent? Are you free to choose between different protocols, ETH, EOS, ICP, and other different chains? But in the real world, you can choose the nationality you like freely, right? In the Metaverse, there will be various divisions of labor soon. Everything in it needs us to build. like literary works, artistic works, the basic construction in the metaverse, the design and generation of various objects, and so on. There will be production, transactions, consumption, and social activities. Details will be discussed in the next chapter. Hopefully, everyone would find their place and belonging in the metaverse.\n\nIn summary, METAVERSE for the first time makes a perfect ideal world come true, which is in the minds of idealists for thousands of years. Mankind is about to enter a new era. The currency is unified, economic rules are transparent, there is no political oppression, regardless of nationality, religion, and race.

"DeFi协议越来越多地采用「代币空投」的方式，以分散治理并促进早期用户的参与，项目方通常会进行“追溯性空投”，这意味着他们会根据你过去与其协议或系统交互的多少来分配奖励。\n\n在这篇文章中，我们将概述一些可能会进行空投的协议。\n\n目标：确定未发行代币的协议，以捕获未来可能的空投机会。\n\n技能：初级\n\n努力：中等\n\n## 经验总结\n\n根据我们在过去一年中看到的情况，我们可以合理地得出一个结论：「空投」正在成为年轻 DeFi 项目的标准操作实践。从项目方的角度来看，优化这些空投还有一些工作要做（比如让它们抵抗女巫攻击）。\n\n问题的关键是？大多数人没有大量的时间和无限的资源来将活动分散到每个最终可能会推出代币的 DeFi 项目中。\n\n因此，重点就在于效率：确定要关注哪些项目（例如，给定协议是否有非常小的机会在6-12个月内推出代币？）以及规模（即存款多少以平衡风险和潜在的回报）。\n\n就第一点而言，通过一点研究，你通常可以找到团队/社区的代币计划来指导你的工作。例如，ParaSwap 最近宣布它没有空投计划。相反，MetaMask团队最近透露其对最终发布原生代币的想法持开放态度。\n\n因此，作为一个例子，你可能想开始通过MetaMask 执行一些加密资产交易。当然，我们并不能保证代币空投就一定会到来，但至少现在我们知道了，它存在着可能。\n\n接下来，为了获得空投资格，你需要和这些未发行代币的协议进行多少次（或量）的交互？\n\n这将因项目而异，但DeFi早期的黄金法则是“决不要存入超过你承受能力的加密资产。”\n\n好消息是什么？正如The Daily Ape创始人Darren Lau在上个月指出的那样，即使只是一点点的钱/活动，也足以让你获得空投的资格。\n\n25个可能会有空投的加密项目\n下面是我们V2版空投指南收录的加密项目列表，这些项目有可能在不久的将来推出自己的代币并进行追溯性空投。\n\n免责声明：我并不确定它们是否会进行空投，这完全是基于我（作为一名活跃的加密用户和研究人员）的经验得出的观点。\n\n1、Element Finance\n描述：Element Finance是一个“针对固定收益率和可变收益率市场的开源协议”。\n\n资源：网站|文档‌|Twitter‌|Discord‌\n\n理由：Element Finance已经创建了一个治理模型，这表明该项目必然会发布一个原生代币。\n\n空投策略：Element Finance的旗舰产品是其Earn应用程序和Save应用程序，使用这两种产品中的任何一种，都可能让你有资格获得未来的空投。\n\n2、Hop Protocol\n描述：Hop Protocol是一种代币桥协议，其用于在区块链和rollup二层网络之间轻松发送ETH和ERC-20代币，它目前支持跨以太坊、Arbitrium、Optimism、Polygon以及xDai这几条链。\n\n资源：网站‌|文档‌|Twitter‌ | Discord‌\n\n理由：关于潜在的Hop代币，该项目团队之前已说过“任何关于该协议的官方公告，Hop团队都将直接发布在官方的Hop频道。”\n\n如果Hop没有发布代币的计划，他们可能会像ParaSwap一样发布官方公告。\n\n空投策略：访问hop.exchange，然后（1）使用发送仪表板将资产从一条链跨到另一条链，或者（2）成为Hop池子的流动性提供者（LP）。\n\n3、DeFi Saver\n描述：DeFi Saver是“一站式仪表板，用于创建、管理和跟踪你的DeFi头寸。”\n\n资源：网站‌|文档‌|Twitter‌ | Discord‌\n\n理由：到目前为止，DeFi Saver一直在使用一个原生代币，但这是一个策展代币，持有者可以用其投票和优先考虑新的协议整合。\n\n空投策略：试用DeFi Saver的投资组合系统或Recipe Creator。\n\n4、Ondo Finance\n描述：Ondo Finance是一个支持“去中心化金融风险市场”的协议。\n\n资源：网站‌|文档‌| Twitter‌ | Discord‌\n\n理由：Ondo团队之前曾说过“Ondo目前没有代币”，注意一下，他们的说法是当时没有。\n\n空投策略：加入Ondo的一个风险市场（请注意，他们有特定的“开放窗口”，在此期间你才可以加入）。\n\n5、Saddle Finance\n描述：Saddle是一个去中心化交易所，其对稳定币和封装BTC等锚定加密资产进行了优化。\n\n资源：网站‌|文档‌| Twitter‌ | Discord‌\n\n理由：Saddle是Curve系统的一个改编版本，尽管它是用Solidity语言而不是Vyper编写的，考虑到Curve推出了CRV，不难想象Saddle最终也会有自己的代币。\n\n空投策略：通过该交易所进行代币互换，或者充当流动性提供者（LP）。\n\n6、Charm\n描述：Charm协议提供了一套 DeFi 产品，包括 Alpha Vaults、Cube Token等。\n\n资源：网站 ‌| 文档‌ |Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：从第一天起，Charm 团队的既定目标就是“任何人都可以研究、构建和治理 Charm 中的协议”。这里提到了“治理协议”，似乎意味着他们将发行一种代币。\n\n空投策略：存入 Charm 的初始产品之一，例如Alpha Vaults。\n\n7、Slingshot\n描述：Slingshot 是目前在 Polygon 上运行的一个 Web3 交易平台，接下来它还将支持 Arbitrum。\n\n资源：网站‌ | Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：Slingshot 似乎可能会走其他 DEX走过的道路，并最终发布自己的代币。\n\n空投策略：连接到 Polygon 网络并在 Slingshot 应用上进行一些交易。\n\n8、TokenSets\n描述：TokenSets 是一个建立在 Set 协议之上的 DeFi 资产管理平台。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：该项目似乎要实现完全去中心化治理，这可能需要发布一个原生代币。\n\n空投策略：购买/出售Set token或创建你自己的Set token。\n\n9、Gro Protocol\n描述：Gro Protocol是一种迎合稳定币的收益聚合器协议。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：Gro 团队计划让该项目“在不久的将来完全去中心化”，并计划让早期支持者参与治理。\n\n空投策略：使用 Gro Protocol 的 Vault 或 PWRD 产品。\n\n10、Cowswap\n描述：Cowswap 是一个抗 MEV 的 DEX 聚合器，它构建在 v2 版本的Gnosis协议之上。\n\n资源： Website | Docs | Twitter | Discord\n\n理由：Cowswap 计划在完全去中心化的道路上建立一个 DAO，这意味着它会有一个代币。\n\n空投策略：通过该交易所进行一些交易。\n\n11、Cozy Finance\n描述：Cozy Finance 是一种为 DeFi 创建信任最小化保护市场的协议（即保险协议）。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：迄今为止，大多数 DeFi 保险项目都推出了自己的代币，因此我们最终可能会在Cozy 身上看到同样的情况。\n\n空投策略：在 Cozy 上借用/提供资产，或者，更高级的用户可以创建自己的保护市场。\n\n12、Zapper\n描述：Zapper 是一个面向 DeFi 和 NFT 用户的 Web3 钱包管理仪表板。\n\n资源：Website | Twitter | Discord\n\n理由：Zapper 还没有“消除”发行代币的可能性，也就是说，我们还有机会。\n\n空投策略：试用Zapper原生的Exchange、Pool、Save等产品。\n\n13、Zerion\n描述：Zerion 是另一个面向 DeFi 和 NFT 用户的Web3 钱包管理仪表板。\n\n资源：Website|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：和Zapper 一样，我们可能会看到 Zerion 在未来某个时候推出一个原生代币来促进社区治理。\n\n空投策略：试用Zerion的Invest、Exchange、Pool产品等。\n\n14、 Kwenta & Lyra\n描述：这是两个不同的协议，但它们的共同点是，两者都是构建在 Synthetix 上的衍生项目，并且已部署在 Optimism L2 上。\n\n资源：Kwenta Twitter|Lyra Twitter\n\n理由：这两个项目方已公开确认将进行追溯性空投。\n\n空投策略：将 SNX 放在 Optimism 上，然后使用其中的任何一个协议。\n\n15、 Mirror\n描述：Mirror 是一个去中心化的内容发布平台\n\n资源：Website|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：虽然 Mirror 已经拥有 WRITE代币，但该代币的发布是受到限制的，也许 Mirror 可能向其早期用户空投更多的代币。\n\n空投策略：利用Mirror的各种工具，例如通过平台发布博客文章。\n\n16、以太坊域名服务（ENS）\n描述：ENS 是一个 Web3 域名和配置系统。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：ENS正在演变成一个成熟的去中心化身份系统。未来，由代币持有者驱动的去中心化治理可能会监督这个系统。\n\n空投策略：注册/更新ENS域名。\n\n17、Optimism\n描述：Optimism 是一种Optimistic Rollup二层网络，其可以帮助以太坊实现扩容。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：似乎rollup二层网络都会推出自己的代币来引导流动性并争夺用户。而Optimism是一个需要关注的大项目。\n\n空投策略：将资金从以太坊转移到 Optimism，并使用一些应用，例如Uniswap 或 Synthetix。\n\n18、Arbitrum\n描述：和Optimism一样，Arbitrum也是一个optimistic rollup二层项目，其最近的发展势头非常不错。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：再强调一下，作为一个rollup 二层项目，Arbitrum 似乎最终可能会推出自己的代币来引导流动性并争夺用户。\n\n空投策略：将资金从以太坊主网转移到Arbitrum，并使用Balancer等应用。\n\n19、zkSync\n描述：zkSync 是使用zk rollup技术的L2扩容网络。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：zkSync 的创建者 Matter Labs 已确认他们将发布代币以激励早期用户。\n\n空投策略：打开zkSync 钱包并测试这个L2网络。\n\n20、PartyBid\n描述：PartyBid 是一个用于“对 NFT进行集体竞标”的dapp，该项目让一群朋友甚至一群陌生人可以轻松地一起竞标 NFT。\n\n资源：Website|Twitter|Discord\n\n空投策略：针对你想要参与的任何NFT发起PartyBid，或向已激活的PartyBid 贡献 ETH（如果竞价失败，你可以取回自己的ETH）。\n\n21、Foundation\n描述：Foundation 是一个面向创造者经济的 NFT 铸造和市场平台。\n\n资源：Website|Twitter\n\n理由：在 SuperRare 通过 RARE 推出其社区所有的治理模式之后，像Foundation 这样的类似平台似乎很可能会选择类似的方法。\n\n空投策略：在 Foundation 上竞标/收集 NFT，请记住，不要因为纯粹的投机原因而买入自己不喜欢的NFT。\n\n22、Zora\n描述：Zora 是一个 NFT 铸造和市场协议。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：社区管理和治理是许多 NFT 平台的未来，因此如果Zora 最终发行自己的代币，我不会感到惊讶。\n\n空投策略：在 Zora 上铸造和收集 NFT。\n\n23、 Fractional\n描述：Fractional 是一个 NFT 碎片化平台，例如，你可以将一个稀有的 1/1 NFT 分成 1,000 个碎片。\n\n资源：Website|\\[Docs\\](<https://docs.fractional.art/fractional/#:\\~:text=Fractional> is a decentralized protocol,the NFT that they own.)|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/fractional_art)|[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fractional)\n\n理由：如果我没记错的话，Fractional 团队对未来发行原生代币的可能性表示出了开放的态度。\n\n空投策略：在平台上收集 NFT 的碎片，或者自己拆分NFT。\n\n24、 Sudoswap\n描述：Sudoswap 是一个交易 NFT 和 ERC20代币的交易平台。\n\n资源：Website|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：Sudoswap 团队富有创新精神和想象力，他们似乎可能会在某个时候进行一次深思熟虑、前所未有的空投。\n\n空投策略：通过 Sudoswap 应用程序进行一些 NFT 交易。\n\n25、OpenSea\n描述：OpenSea 目前是全球领先的 NFT 市场。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：随着大型新玩家（例如Coinbase 和 Reddit）持续进入 NFT 领域，OpenSea 可能会推出自己的代币以激励用户留在 OpenSea 上。\n\n空投策略：通过 OpenSea 铸造和收集 NFT。\n\n其他可能会空投的项目\n有太多的项目还没有发行自己的代币，我也无法在这篇文章中深入探讨其中的每一个。注意，以下这些项目也存在着空投的可能，请记住，我对它们的代币发行计划没有直接的了解。\n\nArt Blocks\nArtion\nFuji Finance\nGoldfinch\nHashflow\nHorizon Finance\nMetaMask\nOpyn\nRabbithole\nRisk Harbor\nRubicon\nSablier\nShell Protocol\nSherlock\nSuperfluid\nTeller\n结论\n请务必记住，使用年轻的 DeFi 和 NFT 项目可能存在着风险，它们本质上都是实验。\n\n因此，在深入探索这些协议之前，你需要做更多的研究。 如果你确实测试了其中的任何一个，请确保谨慎进行，并且仅使用自己能够承受损失的资金。\n\n也就是说，正如 Darren Lau 在之前的推文中提到的那样，即使是适度的参与，也可以让你获得丰厚的空投回报。\n\n最后，请记住，我们最终可能会看到像 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 这样的rollup项目推出自己的原生代币。\n\n另外，你可以尝试像 Hop Protocol 这样的项目，你可以在其中与这些rollup网络进行交互，这可能会让你实现“一石二鸟”。​​​​\n\n\\--转自DEFI之道。", "timestamp": 1635345770, "digest": "el-ecYc66tEQrcPqFOsJdH_j3EIlApxQiJYeIZLI8EU", "contributor":

{"id": "qdC9c3gLg8xwK0XJ1jpEs-foOBAiReBixmfD__eFQts", "title": "METAVERSE与人类文明", "body": "大家好，今天我们来聊一聊metaverse，大家对于元宇宙最直观的感受来自电影那个《头号玩家》，戴上VR眼镜进入到和现实世界相平行的另外的一个宇宙里面去，在里面可以进行有各式各样的社会经济活动。那我们更深层面来探讨下到底是什么是原宇宙，原宇宙的本质是什么？与人类文明是什么关系？与区块链的关系？元宇宙有什么意义？也就是说我们为什么需要它？它的将来会是什么样的形态，会是什么样的结局？\n\n \n\n**元宇宙的本质**：metaverse是平行于物理世界的另一个虚拟世界，我想这大家都认同这一点。那虚拟世界是从什么时候开始的？其实从人类文明的开端，元宇宙同时就开始了。也就是说，人类文明基本可以部分等同于元宇宙。为什么这么讲？ \n  \n \n\n赫拉利在《人类简史》里面有讲到，其实我们人跟动物最根本的差别，并不是因为人类学会了使用火，学会了使用工具。因为有很多动物，像乌鸦，猿猴等它们都会制作并使用工具，所以以是否能制造并使用工具来划分人类与动物的差别，这显然是有问题的。赫拉利认为人与动物最根本的差别就是人类有了想象力，那是什么意思呢？有一天忽然亲人去世了，他会联想到这个死去的亲人可进入了另外一个世界，就说这个就是一种想象力。发展到现在，包括我们的科学知识，文学，艺术，像国家，公司，货币等等的事物，其实这都是一个个由人类虚拟出来的。\n\n \n\n这可能会有点反直觉，但事实的确如此。打个简单的比方，我们的肉眼看到树叶是绿色，苹果是红色，但事实上这个世界上根本就没有绿色，也没有红色，只是眼睛这个光感受器，对于不同波长与频率的光波接受后用电信号传导到大脑，然后大脑再对它进行了一个扭曲解读，分成红色和绿色。虽然是扭曲解读，但非常有用。因为在原始的采集狩猎时代，迅速在绿色的树叶中找到鲜艳的那个果实，无疑是非常重要的。但世上并没有所谓的颜色，只是我们的大脑把它曲解为这个颜色，既然是一种曲解，那就一定不是世界的本质，但它的确非常有用。\n\n \n\n我们再来看知识，比如物理学，牛顿力学与爱因斯坦的相对论，其实本质上我们现在学到的所有的知识，它本质上都是一个虚拟的，只是对所有现象的归纳建模。所以康德说，人为自然立法。既然是建模，那肯定不是真实，不是这个世界的本真。是我们虚构出来的纯意识层面的东西。\n\n \n\n像文学，艺术等活动，大家会比较容易理解这是虚拟的，只是人的的主观心理活动的外在表达。比如绘画，画并不是那一张纸，纸只是媒介。我们可以画在纸上，也可以是木板上，也可以是区块链上。比如现在的 ART NFTs，是吧？本质上是虚拟的精神活动在不同介质上进行表达。\n\n \n\n只有动物才会只认实物，比如说狗认骨头，猩猩认香蕉，你要是拿100美元和它交换，它们才不会理你。对吧？为什么他不认钱？通常很多人认为钱就是我们看了就摸得着的这100块纸币，但事实上并不是这一张纸，而是说这一张纸背后我们赋予它的那个东西，是所有人都认为这一张纸可以去换到别的有价值的东西的这种共识，对吧？所以，任何货币从一开始，就是虚拟出来的，不是我们看到的这张纸币。所以中文把cryptocurrency翻译成虚拟货币，是有问题的，因为任意一种货币的本质都是共识，是共识就是虚拟的。cryptocurrency准确来翻译应该叫可编程的数字货币，或加密货币。所以本质上来说，金钱，国家，公司，科学，文化，艺术等等全都是我们想象力所赋予的，虚拟的事物。可能有人要问，虚拟的事物有什么意义？它的意义是2个：1，共识带来分工协作，分工协作带来的效率提升。试想如果没有货币，没有公司，人与人之间的协作就会有很大问题。2，科学知识能让我们对于更高级别的能量进行利用（畜能 ——化石能源——核子能）。\n\n \n\n索罗斯有个著名的老师叫做卡尔波普尔，很多年前我看过他的著作《开放的宇宙及其敌人》，他在背后最后面的章节中，我记得他就认为就是书籍里是一个平行世界，我们书籍里面比如说你写一个小说，里面就是一个世界，现在想来，他说是就是元宇宙啊。\n\n \n\n综上所述，人类文明，比如艺术创作，知识，包括我们建构起来这虚拟的概念，包括：国家，政党，公司各个学科的知识、全都是我认为是我们虚拟出来的一些东西。一个区别于物理世界的另外的一个在我们大脑里面的一个世界。所以说metaverse, 在人类第一次出现了想象力的时候，它就已经诞生了，只不过呢它的展现形式是不同而已。现在我们描述的它是随着新的硬件如VR, 5G网络，计算能力等基础设施的出现与发展，它的展现形式会更加生动形象、更加具象化表达出来。", "timestamp": 1635347447, "digest": "gAgU97-9JwIFJvWyc4LU1Bz6mffQeHOhzoyRlZEmGyE", "contributor": "0x5DdA68A8990038a13f8B4937e01Be1236c36C018"}

Think, design, develop and deploy NFT-related dApps, across chains, with a focus on products sitting at the intersection of the NFTs and DeFi ecosystems\n2. Build PirateDAO itself into a long-lasting decentralized organization that can guarantees funding its own operations, through smart treasury management (such as re-investing revenues from previously shipped products)\n\nPirateDAO wants to be different from many DAOs that have come before it. To date, DAOs have mostly been synonymous with a treasury of funds + group signal-voting on where to send those funds; with very little input from communities on the kind products that are to be built, or on the development direction for existing ones. PirateDAO aims to achieve something more fun and valuable: **a fully decentralized organization that  ships new products**.\n\nToday, following up right away on our own motto, we are releasing Programmable Loot on Polygon (more on this below), along with our completely fair-launched initial offering for **JollyRoger** (🏴‍☠️), PirateDAO governance and only token; with a soft-capped, **ultra-scarce supply of 818 units available for minting to early users of our first product**.\n\n\\*JollyRoger (`0x0c80963e7228A81D6F805418531E44C48975d6D5`) rewards table for [ProgrammableLoot](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x76ade2d575e5db76f1c9b977575a9b324c5d23ea):\n\n* SACK = ***0.000213 🏴‍☠️***\n* BARREL = ***0.00213 🏴‍☠️***\n* CRATE = ***0.00426 🏴‍☠️***\n* URN = ***0.0106 🏴‍☠️***\n* COFFER = ***0.0213 🏴‍☠️***\n* CHEST = ***0.05 🏴‍☠️***\n* TROVE = ***0.2 🏴‍☠️***\n* RELIQUARY = ***0.4 🏴‍☠️***\n\n## Programmable Loot\n\nProgrammable Loot (or pLOOT) is a big upgrade over the concept of scarce, general-purpose, on-chain loot metadata originally introduced by [dom](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1431316631934967815) in multiple variants, that inspired many of us in the Ethereum community and naturally spurred derivatives and tooling to augment the project.\n\nAs a TLDR:\n\n* There are 8 Container classes (*SACK, BARREL, CRATE, URN, COFFER, TROVE, RELIQUARY*), each with unique base properties that affect what Items can be found within after genesis\n* The containers baseline attributes only compound the random genesis seed provided by the Chainlink VRF oracles, which is the ultimate factor in determining both the number and rarity of the generated Loot Items\n* Minting a Loot Container (and the Loot Items within) is a process made up of two asynchronous, distinct phases: a genesis step (where the container minting floor price fee is transferred to PirateDAO treasury and randomness is requested from  Chainlink VRF service) and a claim step (where the container and items, if any, are actually minted)\n* Loot is composable; that is, containers can accept and transfer items at the will of their owners. This allows for any arrangement of loot composability and shifts the balance of value towards Loot Items themselves\n* Rarity (only applicable to Loot Items) is made up of 7 classes (UNCOMMON, COMMON, RARE, EPIC, LEGENDARY, MYTHIC, RELIC), dictates what attributes a particular Item will exhibit, and is derived from the original container seed\n* Loot Items content variety is greatly expanded, there are:\n  * 30+ appearance states\n  * 256 prefixes and 256 suffixes\n  * hundreds of new item names across RPG domains\n  * 0-10 augmentation states\n\n### Minting Loot Containers with the UI\n\nIn pLOOT there are Loot Containers and Loot Items, the latter is what can be valuable (e.g. based on their rarity, or usefulness in a particular application or game) but can only be obtained by minting the former; in other words, you will need to generate and claim (mint) Loot Containers (there are 8 classes of them, with different properties), in order to mint Loot Items.\n\n**Minting containers is a two-step process:**\n\n* First, you request a ContainerGenesis event, in exchange for that container class mint floor price; besides reserving the container for yourself, this will initiate a Chainlink VRF request that will eventually seed (usually within a few blocks) and permanently associate your container with a truly random genesis seed\n* Second, and only after the Chainlink VRF oracle will have fulfilled the randomness, the container is ready to be claimed and any Loot Items inside it unveiled (and minted in the same tx); initially these will be owned by the container itself\n\nSpeaking of ownership: in pLOOT, every Loot Item is ownable (and per above, initially belonging to the container that minted it) which makes for programmable Loot Containers (able to host any Loot Item combination), from which owners can freely deposit (items that they now own, e.g. because they acquired them on the market) and withdraw them (if they were transferred inside the container).\n\nFollows a visual guide showcasing said features:\n\n![1-time WETH approval for Programmable Loot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Rhz4Tnwli_mVdMxNskA9X.PNG?height=769&width=997)\n\n![Pick the container class you wish to generate](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PFVs9gHw80cBuirrGOle6.PNG?height=765&width=994)\n\n![After genesis, the container shows up (give it a few blocks) in the SEEDING state](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CF22S6qpOe22_-HOLYLdc.PNG?height=317&width=994)\n\n![After a few blocks time, Chainlink will seed the genesis event with randomness, allowing you to mint the container, and all items within](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vkpLItSgJdiH8Xk35xObw.PNG?height=316&width=993)\n\n![After claiming, you can browse the newly minted container by ID and see what came with it (though luck here).

{"id": "De_23uXe61D6VyiGjfNsKgtaJpaoB8DdPsPB34ozgak", "title": "Fundraising in a Community First World", "body": "What if instead of founders pitching investors, investors pitched to communities?\n\nStarted just over a year ago, Friends With Benefits is a self-organized and internet native community that is collectively building the ultimate cultural membership.\n\n**Today, we’re excited to announce a $10M raise led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from Pace Capital, Kindred Ventures, Spark Ventures, and Li Jin.**\n\nThese funds purchased tokens from the FWB DAO treasury - setting precedence for how future community owned platforms can build along side venture capital support.\n\nHere’s how we did it, why did it, and how your community can too.\n\n## Raise In Public\n\nIn Web2, founders pitch investors— often at misalignment with their users and community. In Web3, communities own and drive the product, introducing a new dynamic where an empowered community has the choice to accept outside investment if it aligns with its strategic goals.\n\nThis is what it looked like in practice.\n\n*Early Interest and Conversations*\n\nAs FWB gained traction through a series of successful product launches, the community received inbound interest from investors who were drawn to the autonomy and collective culture of the group.\n\nInitial conversations gauged value and vision alignment, as well as ballpark investment scope.\n\n*Community Discourse*\n\nOnce mutual interest was established, FWB hosted a community Town Hall to gauge the entire community’s perspective and open the floor for discussion on:\n\n* What role could venture capital play in our community?\n* What do we want to build and how do we get there?\n* Do we share the same values and desired goals?\n* What is our shared belief on growth vs. quality?\n\nWe set up a Temporary Investment Committee comprised of community members to evolve the discourse through an advisory group of investors, legal consultants, and community stakeholders— all tasked with providing honest input and summarizing major points to be shared with the community at large through our public Governance channels.\n\n*Community Relations*\n\nAs momentum escalated after the initial Town Hall, investors were eager to propose how they might participate in different community initiatives.\n\nFrom joining Product Team discussions and vision-mapping sessions to [hosting a physical event in NYC](https://twitter.com/FWBtweets/status/1425234208016928774), the prospective investors demonstrated their interest in aligning with the community in a tangible way.\n\n*Roadmap*\n\nOur Team Leads presented a multi year vision, roadmap, and strategy alongside proposed use of funds and initial terms with actionable ways for anyone to get involved. This FWB Town Hall boasted the highest attendance in the community’s history, with a peak of 300 members present.\n\nFor reference, you can view the [roadmap](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BIYVM-rQ7VJP43eVlc2G2Kd2k_zQNT1z/view) and audio recording of the Town Hall [here](https://drive.google.com/file/u/1/d/1o-5cVkK35kuFHcJYDiMMfIMeG0YgS1vB/view).\n\n*Investor Q&A*\n\nLeading representatives from each participating firm came to talk directly with the community at the following Town Hall, giving the chance for community members to ask prospective investors about their values, web3 contributions, and investment goals.\n\nNot only did this discussion help humanize each of the firms but it also demonstrated a long term alignment in values and a mutual desire to create a new world together, one where members of a platform are empowered, not taken advantage of.\n\nFor many community members, this was their first time interfacing with well-known investors who commonly only interface publicly on Twitter. Creating a safe space for the community to ask honest questions and receive meaningful feedback built trust and showed that investors were here for more than profit-oriented motives.\n\n**Imagine if the first thousand users of Facebook had a chance to sit down with the platform’s investors 15 years ago to align on values and future vision.**\n\n![Screenshot from the FWB investor Town Hall](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eg4BAX7sohYzE1m1Tro7n.jpeg?height=512&width=415)\n\n*Governance Proposal*\n\nProposed structures, details, and framing were shared with the community in the form of an open working draft. All FWB community members had the chance to edit, suggest, and comment on what would become the official fundraising proposal shared with Investors.\n\n*Vote*\n\nThe governance proposal went [live on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmUFFkMER4R54dnBRJXL3WTLsktfUTK8KrdTwBbZmRTjSn), offering a special POAP NFT to those who voted from No Pattern.\n\n[https://twitter.com/NoPattern/status/1433148582102712324?s=20](https://twitter.com/NoPattern/status/1433148582102712324?s=20)\n\nThe vote received the most activity of any community vote to date, with 522 unique members representing 18% of all $FWB token holders. For reference, the average voter turnout across most DeFi protocols is roughly 1%.\n\n*Token Swap*\n\nOnce the proposal passed, the FWB team set up legal structures to oversee the token swap. Investors signed token purchase agreements, and custody solutions (e.g. Fireblocks and Gnosis Safe) were established with each respective firm.\n\nIn aggregate, the entire process took roughly two months.\n\n## The Next Chapter\n\nAs we continue to navigate uncharted territory, we’re excited to pioneer the model by which decentralized communities scale and collaborate with outside investment.\n\nThis treasury raise demonstrates that social DAOs like FWB are entering a new phase of maturity and growth preceding social clubs of the past.\n\nWe welcome the next wave of community members into the fold, celebrate the members who have grown with us thus far, and look forward to building a brighter future together.\n\nWe can’t do this alone. If you’re interested in contributing to the FWB DAO, please head to our [Community Jobs Board](https://www.fwb.help/jobs) to view roles we are looking to fill, and as always you can learn more about us at [fwb.help](http://fwb.help).\n\n*Don’t see a role?

This allows for any arrangement of loot composability and shifts the balance of value towards Loot Items themselves\n* Rarity (only applicable to Loot Items) is made up of 7 classes (UNCOMMON, COMMON, RARE, EPIC, LEGENDARY, MYTHIC, RELIC), dictates what attributes a particular Item will exhibit, and is derived from the original container seed\n* Loot Items content variety is greatly expanded, there are:\n  * 30+ appearance states\n  * 256 prefixes and 256 suffixes\n  * hundreds of new item names across RPG domains\n  * 0-10 augmentation states\n\n### Minting Loot Containers with the UI\n\nIn pLOOT there are Loot Containers and Loot Items, the latter is what can be valuable (e.g. based on their rarity, or usefulness in a particular application or game) but can only be obtained by minting the former; in other words, you will need to generate and claim (mint) Loot Containers (there are 8 classes of them, with different properties), in order to mint Loot Items.\n\n**Minting containers is a two-step process:**\n\n* First, you request a ContainerGenesis event, in exchange for that container class mint floor price; besides reserving the container for yourself, this will initiate a Chainlink VRF request that will eventually seed (usually within a few blocks) and permanently associate your container with a truly random genesis seed\n* Second, and only after the Chainlink VRF oracle will have fulfilled the randomness, the container is ready to be claimed and any Loot Items inside it unveiled (and minted in the same tx); initially these will be owned by the container itself\n\nSpeaking of ownership: in pLOOT, every Loot Item is ownable (and per above, initially belonging to the container that minted it) which makes for programmable Loot Containers (able to host any Loot Item combination), from which owners can freely deposit (items that they now own, e.g. because they acquired them on the market) and withdraw them (if they were transferred inside the container).\n\nFollows a visual guide showcasing said features:\n\n![1-time WETH approval for Programmable Loot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Rhz4Tnwli_mVdMxNskA9X.PNG?height=769&width=997)\n\n![Pick the container class you wish to generate](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PFVs9gHw80cBuirrGOle6.PNG?height=765&width=994)\n\n![After genesis, the container shows up (give it a few blocks) in the SEEDING state](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CF22S6qpOe22_-HOLYLdc.PNG?height=317&width=994)\n\n![After a few blocks time, Chainlink will seed the genesis event with randomness, allowing you to mint the container, and all items within](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vkpLItSgJdiH8Xk35xObw.PNG?height=316&width=993)\n\n![After claiming, you can browse the newly minted container by ID and see what came with it (though luck here). You can also use the \"Withdraw/Deposit\" interface to manipulate the items inside](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B2dMLayhJerh_uG_wxSSk.PNG?height=668&width=995)\n\n### Technical notes\n\npLOOT contracts are available on GitHub at [this repository](https://github.com/PirateDAO/ploot-contracts)\n\n* ProgrammableLoot.sol is the sole owner and minter of LootContainer(s).sol\n* ProgrammableLoot.sol is governed by [this Timelock](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x539cbc03d625921308fd2d52af2e0aa8682ccc18#code)\n* All smart contracts are immutable, non-proxied, non-upgradable\n* New minting operations are guaranteed provided that:\n  * either the Sushiswap WETH/LINK pool has enough liquidity for the Chainlink VRF fee or ProgrammableLoot.sol LINK balance is otherwise replenished\n  * the Chainlink PegSwap service remains accessible, permissionless and has enough WLINK/LINK liquidity\n  * the Chainlink VRF service remains accessible and permissionless\n  * the Containers’ inflationary threshold as determined by the inflation gauge is not breached\n\nFinally, a word about cross-chain deployments and the rationale for picking Polygon as the launch platform for pLOOT: Our aim is to deploy our products wherever it makes economic and strategic sense to do so; in particular, we elected to first deploy on the Polygon blockchain for the following primary reasons:\n\n* Low fees give everyone a chance to partecipate, collect and use the product as the DAO intended to, without the paralysis that would occur on Ethereum L1 for the vast majority of users\n* Chainlink VRF is currently only available on Ethereum, BSC and Polygon. This DAO believes Polygon to be the best compromise platform considering accessibility, composability, security and gaming-friendliness\n* Polygon has a thriving ecosystem, whether it’s DeFi or NFTs, and even more importantly strong symbiotic links to the Ethereum ecosystem L1 and L2s that are here to stay", "timestamp": 1635351427, "digest": "P65d889f1Y5JYrybe0VU8Dq0Gb2cpN09MuqCzvViLBs", "contributor": "0x08F55ce05312d79B7525AB70BfF689ee48b2b53C"}

{"id": "7dQl8nszAjuFG53D5g1k2HyWQ5ceeavNsYCJKMsmgUU", "title": "The dilemma at the center of crypto and climate change", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cseWHLfS_AL-_2ULcgaoI.jpeg?height=969&width=1400)\n\nMany words have recently been written about the [climate impact of cryptocurrencies](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/bitcoin-bad-environment-mining-cryptocurrency-b1846773.html). The focus has been on the sources and quantities of energy being harnessed to mine new coins. It’s an interesting discussion but not one where I have anything new to say. What’s more interesting to me is the tension between the crypto community’s vision for the future and a planet that’s on the precipice of a climate disaster. In order to have a chance at creating the [crypto-utopia](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/technology/cryptocurrency-puerto-rico.html) of their dreams, the community’s true believers will have to reconcile the differences between their core ideologies and the reality of what it will take to preserve a stable climate. It’s not an impossible feat but it will be an immense test of mental flexibility.\n\nSo what is the ideology and vision at the center of crypto? It’s deeply [libertarian](https://www.climaticthoughts.com/p/5099efaf-9f14-4358-9b9c-fbcb2ea60826/coindesk.com/crypto-is-the-libertarian-cheat-code-in-the-final-battle-over-state-coercion) and in many senses [anarchist](https://www.coindesk.com/cypherpunk-crypto-anarchy-and-how-bitcoin-lost-the-narrative). Decentralization is fundamental to everything about crypto. No one person or group should be able to control or censor everyone else. If we assume good intentions it’s an appealing goal to strive towards. [This essay](https://1729.com/tag/the-network-state/) by one of crypto’s truest and loudest believers [Balaji Srinivasan](https://1729.com/all/) best captures the vision for a decentralized crypto future. It’s worth a read just to understand the audacity of the envisioned utopia. It’s a future where we’ll create new countries in the cloud; where [cryptocurrencies will reign supreme](https://medium.com/road-less-ventured/why-bitcoin-could-become-the-world-reserve-asset-4100f54b1093) and existing governments will be [unable to meddle](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-governments-cant-ban-bitcoin#:\\~:text=You%20Cannot%20Ban%20Bitcoin%E2%80%94You,open%2Dsource%20technologies%20like%20Bitcoin.&text=A%20government%20can%20attempt%20to,to%20run%20on%20the%20internet.) with fiscal policy; where each person will be ensured a say in the law by participating in a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://blockchainhub.net/dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization/). There’s a level of headiness that is hard to resist. The beating heart of crypto is freedom from centralization in every form. Who doesn’t want to have their right to vote enshrined in immutable and distributed code. Or to be able to [send and receive money without paying rent seeking middlemen](https://www.saveonsend.com/bitcoin-blockchain-money-transfer/). Or to be able to live without [fear of censorship by big social media companies](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/palestine-israel-censorship-facebook-twitter-instagram-7amleh-b1851328.html). Down with centralization!\n\nIt's a vision that even communists might get behind. A sort of post-capitalist and post-scarcity world where everyone can do whatever they want and nobody can interfere with the pursuits of others. Which brings me to the important takeaway: The true believers are very skeptical of authority. [Libertarianism](https://qz.com/1284178/almost-half-of-cryptocurrency-and-bitcoin-bros-identify-as-libertarian/) is a core tenet and not something to be negotiated. The government can’t be trusted and has no idea that its [money printing frenzy is leading us down a path to ruin](https://news.bitcoin.com/printing-money-from-thin-air-how-the-fed-reduces-purchasing-power-and-makes-you-poorer/). This conspiratorial tone about government overreach and the inherent flaws of fiat currency can be found in almost every forum or thread related to crypto. And it’s not surprising - if money itself can be decentralized then why not everything else. Most of crypto's true believers are certain that the future they envision is preordained. We just have to wait for the technology to scale and for everyone else to see the light. Salvation is right around the corner.\n\nBut what’s already past the corner and happening right now is the climate crisis. Regardless of when the crypto future arrives it still has to take place on Earth. Is it more likely that we create a crypto-utopia if we manage to keep Earth below 1.5 degrees of warming, or if we shoot past it and end up at 3 degrees or more? It’s not really a fair question because any vision for humanity’s future is more likely to succeed if we keep warming below 1.5 degrees. So it’s not very bold to say that the future envisioned by crypto's true believers is more achievable if we mitigate climate change.\n\nI’ll go further and say that crypto's dreams are especially dependent on mitigating climate change. If the Earth warms more than 1.5 degrees we'll be [constantly ravaged by droughts, storms, and all manner of other disasters](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html). Those conditions are not likely to leave room for the types of libertarian playgrounds sought by crypto’s true believers. The pandemic has shown us that in times of crisis the world gets more insular and governments expand their roles. And at the human level, [trust within communities becomes paramount](https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2018/Q4/a-little-help-from-your-friends-is-key-to-natural-disaster-recovery,-purdue-research-study-suggests.html). People turn to those they know and also towards authority figures in trying times. [This has happened before and is already happening again](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-darkness). Basic needs also become much harder to guarantee in an overheated world. It seems unlikely that radical new forms of governance will be experimented with when we're short on [food](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/climate/climate-change-food-supply.html), [water](https://earth.stanford.edu/news/effects-climate-change-water-shortages#gs.1dk0x2), and [places that aren't too hot to live](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/05/world/global-warming-climate-niche-temperatures-intl-hnk/index.html). Cryptocurrencies won’t disappear, but the crypto-utopia will be unreachable.\n\nBut going back to the less bold statement - The vision for a decentralized future benefits from a stable climate on Earth. A world where we’re not constantly devoting resources to securing our physical needs seems much more likely to be a place where we can make [astronomical bids on blockchain native art](https://news.artnet.com/market/most-expensive-nfts-1952597). While some communities are already facing the reality of climate change, most aren’t. And that provides a false sense of security that’s not easy to see through. Bitcoin was created in what’s potentially the last breath of a dying era. The climate of Earth today is the best it will be for the next 100 years. Without a stable climate, the potential for cloud first countries is lower (you decide by what amount). So then the question becomes what will it take to keep the Earth’s climate stable? Can crypto’s true believers get behind the path to mitigating climate change in order to achieve their own vision? This is where it gets tough.\n\nThere’s no possible scenario in which we manage to keep warming under 1.5 degrees with out significantly more government involvement across numerous parts of the economy. Most of the progress we’ve seen today is a result of government intervention. Look no further than [Tesla’s regulatory credits](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/tesla-electric-vehicle-regulatory-credits-explained.html) or the [German tariffs](https://cleantechnica.com/2014/08/07/germany-solar-feed-in-tariffs-seia/) that helped kickstart the solar boom. Regulations set the rules by which markets and corporations operate. Today these rules largely ignore the cost of carbon emissions. Voluntary targets by private groups are not very effective given there’s no penalty for falling short. The externality of emissions can only be addressed by redefining the rules. Whether that’s [embodied carbon thresholds](https://carbonleadershipforum.org/looking-ahead-to-embodied-carbon-policy-action-in-2021/) or [clean electricity standards](https://www.powermag.com/u-s-house-bill-introduces-federal-zero-emissions-electricity-standard/) it’s going to be necessary everywhere. Even if we put regulations aside, governments are still [financially crucial](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/how-jigar-shah-plans-to-manage-does-40b-loan-programs-office) to deploying climate solutions. Amongst people familiar with the topic, none of this is particularly noteworthy. It’s been the established [perspective for decades](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html).\n\nWhile crypto's true believers dream of a world where the government has a vastly limited role in the financial system, climate people dream of a global carbon tax that would affect every part of our economic life. By carrot or stick the government is going to be involved if we are going to mitigate climate change. Given the libertarian values that run so deep within the crypto community, this required course of action is a sort of nightmare. When you believe that governments shouldn’t control the supply of money it’s tough to simultaneously support government regulation over other parts of the economy. There’s a chance I’m painting a straw man of these true believers but having gone quite deep down the rabbit hole of crypto that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAnd so this is the central dilemma for crypto's true believers. The best chance of realizing a pseudo-anarchist future needs Earth to have a stable climate. But maintaining a stable climate will require a lot more government intervention. Can these believers walk through the hellish fires of increased regulation in order to get to the promised land of their dreams? Maybe, but it will be hard. Naomi Klein has a fantastic chapter in *[This Changes Everything](https://thischangeseverything.org/book/)* which explores why climate denialism is mostly found amongst American conservatives. It turns out that it’s easier to dismiss the science on climate change than it is to even entertain the idea of changing your ideology about the role of government. This is the same kind of risk facing crypto's true believers.\n\nIt’s marvelous that digital currencies, not backed by anything nor by any state, have become a trillion dollar force in the world. But this has only happened because its supporters have a religious belief that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology will change the future of everything. This conviction is the real fuel that powers crypto. Even more so than the electricity used for mining. Supporting what’s required to preserve a stable climate means going against the core values that make true believers so enamored with crypto in the first place. It’s similar to [this problem where firefighters sometimes don't drop their gear when retreating from fast moving wildfires](https://www.wildfirelessons.net/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=327f56f5-4dab-4fee-8d14-e14b90914623&forceDialog=1). Letting go of the gear makes it easier to run but letting go also creates an existential crisis. Tools help fight fires. They are core to the identify of being a firefighter. [To leave your tools is to leave your identity](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393722?seq=1). It takes great effort to act against your identity in the heat of the moment (no pun intended). With self-awareness however change is possible. Firefighters these days are less likely to keep lugging their 25 lb. chainsaws while trying to escape a fire. It’s yet to be seen if crypto’s true believers can lay down their libertarian tools in order to help prevent the planet from overheating.\n\nWhy should we care if crypto’s true believers can develop this mental flexibility? We should care because the technology and the community aren’t going away. Price fluctuations come and go but crypto is here to stay. These digital currencies have created a new class of [very wealthy people](https://businesscloud.co.uk/the-crypto-rich-list-who-are-the-worlds-richest-people-in-cryptocurrency/). With that wealth comes power. How the true believers use their power is important in a time when economic power often turns into political power. If this new class puts its resources towards mitigating climate change then the world stands to benefit. We should also care because crypto is a genuinely new ecosystem. The good part about libertarian idealism is that it means fewer hierarchies. The community is eager to explore new ways of organizing and interacting with the world. Ursula Le Guin once said, “We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings\". Cryptocurrencies may just provide a path out of our seemingly inescapable system. But in order for any of this to be possible crypto's true believers will have to put aside at least some of the values that have defined the community up to this point.\n\n**Additional Thoughts:**\n\nI use the term crypto's true believers because as I allude to in the post crypto really is like a religion. You have to ***believe.*** Otherwise what are you really doing? Satoshi is the modern day Jesus. And to be a [nocoiner](https://www.coindesk.com/the-problem-with-nocoiners) is almost heretical. The Catholic church has maybe $15 billion but Bitcoin is at least 30x larger even after the recent sell off.\n\nThe image at the top of the post is a rendering commissioned by millionaire lawyer Jeffrey Berns for a [crypto-utopia in Nevada](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/nevada-bitcoin-blockchain-society.html). He's spent $300 million on this project already. So perhaps even with climate change the true believers will achieve their dreams. There just might not be space for everyone...\n\n[Image Source](https://www.archpaper.com/2018/11/cryptocurrency-millionaire-tom-wiscombe-architecture-tech-powered-desert-utopia/)", "timestamp": 1635353437, "digest": "Q_ZGGKDPmDLTEal2D3k_qybgr25g2MdoUOzUeWar8D0", "contributor": "0xf930977E4A40948e4D13786d54aA2D2319034443"}

{"id": "E2szUECcnnQducYbNS4TbnGOXuQyZYsHx5yl3sr-fJQ", "title": "How We Get To Negative Emissions With Web3", "body": "Let’s start with some ecological grief to describe the current state of the Anthropocene. In the course of 40 years, [an area the size of Europe](https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/planet-earth/forests-and-deserts/rate-of-deforestation) has been deforested; at this rate, the world’s rainforests will be gone in 78 years. A [report](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/) from the United Nations Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) estimates that dozens of species are going extinct every day, with as many as 30 to 50 percent of all species going extinct by 2050. [21.5 million people](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/climate-refugees-the-world-s-forgotten-victims/) have been displaced by climate change-related disasters since 2010. Every month we eat one Lego brick of plastic, or about 44 lbs. in a lifetime [on average](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-plastic-diet-wider-image-idUSKBN28I16J).\n\nNext week, global leaders will travel to Glasgow to lay out their plans meet the the global warming limit of 1.5°C, as agreed upon in the Paris climate agreement. In order to hit that target, the world needs to cut climate pollution in half from current levels by 2030, and bring them down to net zero by 2050, which would require negative emissions. Few countries have policies in place to hit these targets.\n\nSo how do we get to negative emissions? It’s simple: for every CO2 tonne (or metric ton, the standard measurement for CO2) released into the atmosphere, we need to remove one tonne. That would keep us at a stasis of about 40 billion tonnes emitted annually. But that won’t remove the excess carbon. For that we need to remove 1.5 trillion tonnes before 2050.\n\n![Source: McKinsey Sustainability](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SVBKGS-a6LdG_OfIvbLWY.png?height=1218&width=1662)\n\nTo get a sense of that scale, [here is rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqSIplGXOA) of one year of New York City’s CO2 emissions. One metric ton of CO2 could fill a sphere 33 feet across. One year of New York City’s CO2 emissions is about 50 million tonnes, or 0.1% of total global emissions.\n\n![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqSIplGXOA](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qsFjCcZWrBIB_k00xTfwD.png?height=1548&width=2874)\n\nOur problems feel overwhelming, hence the eco-grief that many of my generation feel. While leaders in Glasgow discuss the technocratic ins and outs of reporting CO2 targets, and debate how much money to give to poorer nations, there are three main methods in which the Web3 community is already attempting to solve incentivize and remove carbon from the atmosphere.\n\n1. Voluntary carbon markets\n2. Reforestation / Afforestation & Regenerative Agriculture\n3. CO2 credit and natural resource-backed currency\n\n### Voluntary carbon markets\n\nCarbon credits are certificates representing quantities of greenhouse gases that have been kept out of the air or removed from it. One carbon credit equals one metric ton (tonne) of carbon dioxide. The current weighted carbon price traded on markets is $34.99, which is up from around $20 near the end of 2020.\n\n![Source: https://ihsmarkit.com/products/global-carbon-index.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-DTBTl2CqsJqd2t2vdEIn.png?height=778&width=1213)\n\nVoluntary carbon credit markets are growing quickly, increasing 20% in 2020 to $272 billion, and have been helping direct private financing to climate-action companies and projects. Many of these projects have additional benefits such as protecting biodiversity, preventing pollution, improving public-health, and creating jobs. This is especially true in the Global South where paying communities to preserve forests and wetlands could significantly improve lives and preserve existing carbon sinks.\n\nThe most popular voluntary offsets are often from Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) projects. REDD+ accounted for 53 percent of total “issuances” and “retirements” of carbon credits and are widely considered the highest quality carbon credits.\n\n## Problems with voluntary carbon markets\n\nOverall, the market is characterized by low liquidity, lack of transparency, and limited data availability. While reputable standards such as [Gold Standard](https://registry.goldstandard.org/credit-blocks?q=&page=1) and Verra’s VCS certify projects’ adherence to the requirements of their respective methodologies, buyers typically have limited transparency on the progress of the carbon-reduction projects that have been issued.\n\nCO2 certificates may also trade hands many times and an unknowable number of transactions happen off-book. In many cases, carbon credits that are purchased are never even retired. According to McKinsey, only about half of carbon credits purchased are even retired.\n\n![Source: https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/how-the-voluntary-carbon-market-can-help-address-climate-change](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KGgySuusbMpYPTH_H9FsH.png?height=862&width=1676)\n\nSo if you are a conniving oil company, could could just buy carbon credits from a broker, add them to your balance sheet, and then sell them later if they increase in price. You wouldn’t even have to retire them.\n\n## How Web3 can improve voluntary carbon markets\n\nIssuing carbon credits on blockchains solves the “double counting” problem which is when two parties claim the same carbon dioxide removal. Many times, the two claiming parties are an organization offsetting its emissions, and the host country of the project trying to reach its nationally determined contribution (NDC), or climate target, under the Paris Agreement. By using Ethereum for carbon issuances you would also have verifiable proof when a tokenized carbon credit is “burned” or “retired.”\n\nAnother benefit of Web3 is that decentralized finance primitives and protocols make it easier to collectively pool capital and increase liquidity. With smart contracts, rewards can be automated on-chain, in real time, which makes it easier to incentivize participation. Standardized, tradable carbon credits tokens increase liquidity, and because of open source software and the inherent composability of DeFi, projects can build upon other ideas and smart contracts.\n\nOne project that just began to standardize carbon credits as tokens is the [Toucan Protocol](https://toucan.earth/), which built a “carbon bridge” to bring carbon credits to Polygon. Using the Toucan Protocol, anybody can tokenize their carbon offsets on the Verra registry and make them available to DeFi protocols. They plan on expanding to other carbon registries, like the Gold Standard in the future.\n\nUsers of the carbon bridge need to retire the carbon offsets in the \"real world\" before bringing them on-chain in order to guarantee that a carbon token is unique and that burning a token on-chain is equivalent to retiring an offset. Each of their Base Carbon Tonne (BCT) tokens is backed by 1 tonne of a retired CO2 credit.\n\n![Using the Toucan Bridge.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jzYJQ2T9TEv5-c00jikkU.png?height=1464&width=2790)\n\nSince launch on October 18th, already [6.3 million tons of CO2](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x2F800Db0fdb5223b3C3f354886d907A671414A7F) have traversed the carbon bridge from the Verra registry and deposited in the Carbon Pool, BCT (Base Carbon Tonne). Incredibly, this is about 12% of NYC’s annual CO2 emissions.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t_IbVlMngcNZb__i5k3Vx.png?height=888&width=2788)\n\nWhat is driving this rapid retirement of carbon credits? One clue is that members of KlimaDAO are retiring Verra credits and turning it to BCT in order to start earning rewards in a separate DeFi protocol called KlimaDAO.\n\n$KLIMA tokens are fungible and backed by at least 1 Verified Carbon Unit in the KlimaDAO treasury. People can acquire KLIMA by depositing liquidity tokens (KLIMA/BCT and BCT/USDC) to the treasury, or directly from SushiSwap trading pools using the Polygon network. Holders of KLIMA can earn compounding interest on their KLIMA by staking, will have the ability to vote on Klima DAO policy. Staking encourages long-term holding of KLIMA, and allows participants to benefit from the rising price of carbon.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ehiqR1e89iYdquX_mWh34.png?height=1100&width=2320)\n\nAnother project, [Flow Carbon](https://www.flowcarbon.com/), already bridged about 2 million carbon credits using the Toucan’s carbon bridge. In the future they also plan on issuing a token that is a REDD+ carbon credit (meaning a higher quality carbon credit that represents reforrested land). The token will act as a depository receipt for the verified carbon credit on Verra, so instead of retired credits being a one-way bridge like BCT, it is two-way. You could use their token to get a carbon credit issued on Verra in your name, or retire it in the Toucan bridge to get BCT and start earning KLIMA.\n\n## Reforestation / Afforestation & Regenerative Agriculture\n\nOutside of voluntary carbon markets, which can contain variety of quality (and low quality) sources of CO2 reduction, some Web3 projects aim to remove carbon by directly funding reforestation projects or carbon reducing regenerative agriculture.\n\n[Rewilder.xyz](http://rewilder.xyz/) is selling NFTs to raise funds to purchase land for passive rewilding in Brazil. The fund is set up as a 501c3 based in Miami, Florida, which will act as a proxy to own the lands and keys to funds. The fund also plans on keeping the value of ETH donations and maintenance costs by invest in low-risk DeFi projects.\n\nPeople who purchase the NFT will also get a transparency tool to track exactly how money is used.\n\n![Rendition of the NFT-based transparency app](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dCuAG3Xzn0eAvg9RhHbft.png?height=1022&width=1462)\n\nNori is an Ethereum-based app focused on creating a market for sequestering carbon in croplands. Regenerative agriculture is a set of practices that could potentially remove 4.8 billion tons of CO2 a year and includes no-till agriculture, planting cover crops, and implementing crop rotations.\n\nHere is how Nori works:\n\n1. Farmers provide operating data to Nori, which is verified by an independent third-party.\n2. Once data is verified, Nori uses a US Department of Agriculture (USDA)-funded tool to determine soil organic carbon content.\n3. Nori issues certificates to the farmer in the amount of CO2 they sequestered, called Nori Carbon Removal Tonnes (NRTs).\n4. Farmers then sell the NRTs to buyers. Buyers can use NORI to pay a fixed price for their carbon removal. Farmers receive a NORI token, which they can then sell for cash.\n\nAlready, projects and individuals are using Nori to remove tonnes of carbon, such as the musician Imogen Heap who used Nori to offset 20 tonnes of CO2 after an NFT sale.\n\n![Example of a Nori Carbon removal certificate](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zfr6ei5g0ui__pnHL2Zbp.png?height=972&width=1558)\n\nAnd I’d be remiss to not mention my own fledgling project focused on urban reforrestation and maintenance of NYC’s 600k+ street trees. In the spirit of the “environmental personhood” movement, street trees on the [NYC Street Tree Map](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjonJbw8djzAhXM3KQKHe5oAkMQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftree-map.nycgovparks.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw2cIAJ22EONntPd2joNp99r) will be registered as an address on Ethereum, not as a property right, but as a contract representing the tree itself. Many blocks in NYC have informal conservancy funds and associations dedicated to street tree care. With this project, funds sent to individual trees are spent on mulching, supplies, watering, protective covers, and new trees. I’ve already raised 1.11 ETH and looking to expand our “Stewards” group. [You can read more about it here](https://jamesbeck.mirror.xyz/ByViCLPMPQ-NEcsMJuviUX8_sV2bsvcnfYIHNiqe6uU) or purchase the essay as a unique NFT to further fund the project.\n\n[https://jamesbeck.mirror.xyz/ByViCLPMPQ-NEcsMJuviUX8_sV2bsvcnfYIHNiqe6uU](https://jamesbeck.mirror.xyz/ByViCLPMPQ-NEcsMJuviUX8_sV2bsvcnfYIHNiqe6uU)\n\n## Toward a green currency\n\nEach of the projects and methods described above help further bring existing carbon credits and natural resources onto Ethereum and Web3. With more carbon credits and natural resources represent as tokens, we can start imagining distinct “green currencies” that are backed by carbon credits and natural resources.\n\nA few weeks ago Celo announced that it would start the Climate Collective and enter Elon Musk’s $100 million USD carbon removal challenge, XPRIZE. Marek Olszewski, parter at Celo, [proposed](https://medium.com/celoorg/introducing-the-celo-climate-collective-6f056f190a04) to have 40% of the $850 million Celo reserve (which backs cUSD and cEUR) transition to tokenized rainforest and other carbon sequestering assets. This would allow the protocol to buy and own $340 million worth of reforested Amazonian rainforest to back the Celo Dollar and Celo Euro stablecoins. According to Marek, “a plot of rainforest the size of Lebanon costs $25 million USD in the Amazon, which would sequester 43 million tonnes of carbon.”\n\nSimilarly, Rune Christensen wrote a winding post in the MakerDAO forum on the case for “clean money.” One of the more interesting ideas in his proposal is “backbone collateral” or real-world asset infrastructure that can absorb large amounts of capital into “safe, productive and climate aligned assets,” such as corporate bonds of top rated ESG corporations held in trusts. He also discusses the idea of tokenizing the “status signal” component of each wind turbine, each block of solar capacity, each battery unit and other sustainable flagship collateral projects, and that these NFTs would then have social value to the extent society values those who contribute towards the public good.\n\n[https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-case-for-clean-money/10684](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-case-for-clean-money/10684)\n\nEach of these examples of money backed by carbon credits or natural resources brings us closer to a transformation of money to an embodiment of our values and agreements on CO2 reduction. We can embody in our money new agreements about the planet, the species, and what we hold sacred.\n\nIn *Sacred Economics* (2011)*,* Charles Eisenstein wrote,\n\n> “The money of the future will be backed by the things we want to nurture, create, and preserve: by undeveloped land, clean water and air, great works of art and architecture, biodiversity and the genetic commons, unused development rights, unused carbon credits, uncollected patent royalties, relationships not converted into services, and natural resources not converted into goods. Even, indeed, by gold still in the ground.”\n\nIt is clear that through the process of tokenizing and creating liquid carbon markets and using them to back new currencies, we can again have money that contains agreements about the planet, the species, and what we hold sacred.", "timestamp": 1635354248, "digest": "qk5DUFuKeeGbQ8G-8EUhzZZb5fLuUKJeIsSJJ0M1IWQ", "contributor": "0x9BA0022Ec84E92dceaC90d0a22E3A857ba37bfE6"}

Enjoy! 🔥*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QuWW9Y6V6FHvQSr2_JQJ5.png?height=728&width=1456)\n\nWe're entering the 3rd phase of the Creator Economy, where Creators will become their own businesses. Creators discovered they can now BE the brand, BE the product, and they could do what they were doing for brands. Creators can now build a direct relationship with their community and create their own economy thanks to Social Tokens.\n\nThe use cases of Social Tokens are numerous. From allowing community members to invest early in creators, creating premium experiences, or collaborating efficiently with other creators, Social tokens have shown their efficiency to incentivize fans to engage and become Creator's distribution.\n\nIt's a complete paradigm shift in the way communities collaborate. It's no more the Creator and its fan, but more a whole community driven by a leader around a joint project.\n\nBy launching a Social Token, creators will gain ownership over their content and have an easier way to collaborate with their community. Social Tokens are best used when they scale or incentivize coordination and engagement between community members. Incentives are ideal when it's mutually beneficial to the Creator and its community, as this will create positive-sum games where everyone has an aligned economic interest. \n\nBecause, at [Coinvise](https://www.coinvise.co/), we truly believe in a future where creators can earn a living from their passions and leverage Social Tokens to leverage the power of a community, we've created the most trustful and easy-to-use platform to create and manage a Social Token as a creator.\n\nCoinvise, combined with other Web3 platforms, is an incredibly powerful tool to reach financial freedom. It's time to give back ownership to creators.\n\nThis essay shows creators how to leverage Coinvise to create new experiences and direct relationships with their community. Let's get into it 🔥\n\n## 1 - Receive help from community members and reward them with Social Tokens.\n\nThe best way to incentivize contributors to help a community grow is to reward them with Token. As a creator, bounties can be an incredible tool to ask your community to help you with specific tasks. Whether you're a sport creator that builds the go-to place for everything Fitness or a Musician trying to see your first album released, bounties can help you leverage your community and incentivize members to share their skills with you. \n\nWith [high-quality talent](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/how-to-attract-high-quality-talent) and [well-designed incentives](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/how-to-design-great-incentives), you'll have a whole community behind you to help achieve high ambition goals.\n\nTo create a bounty and ask your community for help, you should:\n\n* Create a Token on Coinvise. ([Tutorial here](https://www.notion.so/coinvise/How-to-mint-a-Personal-Community-Token-424196cb6f204f38b94faed3e0db301f))\n* Create a Bounty on Coinvise to gain traction from people outside of your community. ([Tutorial here](https://www.notion.so/coinvise/How-to-create-a-Token-Reward-Bounty-on-Coinvise-abfc94a17ebc44c6a6f4affeec779113))\n* Create a Google Doc gathering all the bounties (missions that you would need help with).\n* Create a bounty channel on your Discord and advertise it.\n* Add and set up [guild.xyz](https://twitter.com/guildxyz) on your Discord to send Social Tokens to people who accomplished the mission.\n\nCreators can also take a look at the [Forefront's bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dt5KxK5QmOyPAHBfj81nmY-btyTd0mbPlqJByOmkSR4/edit#gid=196077105) and the [GCR's Bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wHj-LyG9BI60EIMYZ0LOf3scqCogkg1rdknhE3eNzJo/edit#gid=0) for inspiration.\n\nBy following the steps above, creators should receive the help of their community members and leverage the power of Social Tokens through Coinvise.\n\n## 2 - Create unique relationships with fans through Token-gated content\n\nContent-gated is one of the most powerful use-cases of Social Token. Indeed, by creating their own coin, creators will be able to showcase content only to a small portion of their biggest fans, and therefore create a direct and closer relationship with them. [Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18) argued in her essay [1,000 True Fans? Try 100](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/) that creators only need to engage a modest base of \"true fans\"—those who will \"buy anything you produce\"—to the tune of $1000 per fan per year (for a total annual income of $100,000). By creating unique content and a direct relationship with their biggest fans, creators can now earn a living from their passion, creating a relationship with those 100 true fans.\n\nThrough Social Tokens, it's possible to gate content (videos, essays…) but also specific channels on a Discord Server or the server himself. The possibilities are endless, and only the Creator's creativity is the limit. We could imagine a \"Future-projects\" channel on Discord, for example, where only the community members that have enough Tokens can submit ideas. Gating the channel ensures that only the biggest fans (those with the most social tokens, those who believe the most in the project) can submit new ideas. We could also envision a Discord channel where fans with enough Token can set up a 1:1 call with the Creator. Again, the possibilities are endless.\n\nTo create token-gated content, follow the instructions below:\n\n* Create a Social Token on Coinvise ([tutorial here](https://www.notion.so/coinvise/How-to-mint-a-Personal-Community-Token-424196cb6f204f38b94faed3e0db301f))\n* Create a Discord server & add [guild.xyz](https://twitter.com/guildxyz) to the server.\n* Set up [guild.xyz](https://twitter.com/guildxyz) so only people with enough Social Tokens can access it.\n\n## 3 - Reward fans for their early support\n\nTo create a healthy relationship with fans, it's essential to reward those who have been there since the beginning. On Coinvise, we provide an easy tool to send (airdrop) tokens to your fans. You can send some tokens by simply providing the person's email address and the amount you want to send. \n\nAn interesting use-case is to gather all the email addresses from your fans (those who have bought your book on Amazon, who have subscribed to your newsletter, who have purchased your merch, who have supported you on Patreon etc…) and send them tokens to the Airdrop tool on Coinvise.\n\nTo reward your fans for their early support through Social Tokens, follow the instructions below:\n\n* Gather all the email addresses.\n* Go on Coinvise and do an Airdrop. ([Tutorial here](https://www.notion.so/coinvise/How-to-Airdrop-send-Social-Tokens-to-your-community-58bd74d129e740c088b4dc2ff082c227))\n* Optional: You can bridge some of your Tokens to an [L2 Blockchain](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/l1-and-l2) to avoid Gas Fees. ([Tutorial here](https://twitter.com/CDTEliot/status/1440713241152217102?s=20))\n\n## Conclusion \n\nCreators are entering a new era where, by leveraging Social Tokens, they will be able to earn a living from their passion by leveraging the power of their community. The overall goal of [Coinvise](https://www.coinvise.co/) is to help those creators build open economies, helping them creating and managing their Social tokens.\n\nMany other use cases still need to be discovered, and we're here to help every Creator push the space forward.

{"id": "TnIrHDnsAnIRDqfYv7QBY47Y9lIb1GTc_pDkxfVBFoA", "title": "Which do you think is more likely to realize the scalable dream of blockchain: Layer2, cross-chain or public chain?", "body": "盘点区块链这几年的发展，从最初的比特币和以太坊，到跨链和 DeFi，再到今年的 NFT 和 metasex，新事物不断涌现，越来越多的企业和用户也参与其中区块链浪潮。\n\n但是，随着区块链生态和应用的增长，越来越多的链上操作，使得拥堵从最初的“小问题”变成了“大痛点”，阻碍了区块链的发展。\n\n正如我们在之前的文章中提到的，如果要使用区块链来构建价值传递网络，有人认为其性能至少应该与当前整个互联网的实时数据处理速度一样快，包括每个 200 万封电子邮件。第二，65,000 个谷歌搜索，72,000 个 YouTube 视频，等等。\n\n但目前比特币每秒可以处理约7笔交易，以太坊每秒可以处理约15笔交易，号称纳斯达克速度的Solana，TPS最高时仅为每秒56,000笔交易，超过的交易有排队等候。\n\n因此，人们考虑了各种方法来解决这个问题，例如开发越来越多的新公共链，将操作下移到链上的 Layer2，以及研究允许多条链彼此互操作的跨链。\n\n那么，Layer2、公链和跨链，谁来实现区块链的可扩展梦想？让我们把它们整理一下。\n\n01 第2层\n\n图片Layer2也叫链下扩容，对应Layer1（链上扩容）。链上扩容是直接修改区块链中的区块大小和共识机制，类似于道路拥堵时从头到尾拓宽道路。\n\n于是，2018年以来，越来越多的链下扩容方案被称为Layer2扩容方案，类似于在拥挤的道路上修建高架桥来缓解拥堵。\n\n由于以太坊是目前生态最丰富、最安全的，因此成为 Layer2 扩展的核心。将交易速度降低到几秒的 Polygon 是以太坊上的 Layer2，它在主网络上扩展了性能。\n\n但是，除了扩展性能之外，Layer2 还可以将越来越复杂的需求下移到链上，使得一些无法在互联网上实现的功能可以向下扩展。比如比特币等几乎没有智能合约的公链，在 Layer2 技术成熟后，也可以实现像以太坊这样的智能合约的功能扩展需求。\n\n目前以太坊Layer2扩容方案主要有侧链、Rollup、channel、Plasma、Validium。让我们简单介绍一下它们：\n\n1、侧链 侧链是与主网并行并独立运行的独立区块链。它使用单独的共识机制，不受 Layer1 保护。\n\n2、Rollups Rollup 是将多笔交易汇总为一个包上传到Layer1。交易数据等发布在Layer1上，但交易在Layer1之外执行。目前有两种类型的汇总：\n\nZK Rollups，零知识汇总，将数以百计的交易捆绑到链上，并生成一个在 Layer1 上提交和发布的加密证明。\n\n这意味着 ZK Rollups 只需要有效性证明，而不是所有交易数据。使用 ZK Rollup，验证块将变得更快、更便宜，因为打包的数据更少。\n\nOptimistic Rollups 乐观地假设所有交易都是有效的，所有数据都存储在 Layer1 链上，因此 Optimistic Rollups 是安全的和去中心化的，但作为欺诈预防机制，主链上的交易确认会受到挑战期的影响。交易确认的等待时间很长。\n\n由于 Optimistic Rollups 与以太坊主链并行运行，并且兼容 EVM 和 Solidity，所以你在以太坊 Layer1 上能做的一切都可以在 Optimistic Rollups 上完成，这也不同于 ZK Rollup。\n\n(3) 频道\n\n即使参与者进行 N 次链下交易，也只需要提交两笔链上交易，实现了非常高的交易吞吐率。\n\n但是，参与者需要将一笔 ETH 存款锁定到一个多重签名的合约（一种需要多个私钥签名才能执行交易的智能合约）中。\n\n锁定后，参与者可以进行链下交易，并提交最终的链上交易，然后可以解锁先前锁定的存款。\n\n4、等离子\n\nPlasma 链是一个独立的区块链，它锚定在以太坊主链上，并使用欺诈证明（类似于 Optimistic Rollups）来仲裁争议。但是，仅支持基本的 Token 转移和交换。\n\n5、有效期\n\nValidium 使用类似 ZK-Rollops 的验证证明，但不是将数据存储在以太坊第一层主链上，而是将第二层交易数据存储在链下。\n\n这意味着每条 Validum 链每秒可以处理 1 万笔交易，多个 Validum 链可以并行运行。\n\n虽然目前Layer2的方案很多，但对于整个扩容梦来说，这些方案的机制复杂，优势无法组合，劣势也各不相同，难以实现兼容，这无疑是一个很大的问题。\n\n不过，截至10月23日，Layer2锁仓总额接近40亿美元，其中Arbtirum、dYdX和Optimism位居榜首。其中，基于 ZK Rollup 的隐私和扩展解决方案 AZTEC 的锁仓量在过去 7 天内增长最快。可见，基于ZK Rollup的扩展方案受到了很多人的青睐。\n\n02 跨链\n\n图片 前面已经提到，目前大部分生态和应用都在以太坊上，所以很多 Layer2 解决方案也是基于以太坊的。但近年来，开发了许多公链和新公链，虽然性能有所提升，但没有一条链可以单独容纳所有生态应用。\n\n结果，越来越多的公共链接变得越来越复杂，但它们变成了孤立的信息孤岛。如果这些链能够相互连接，不仅链上扩展会更加理想，这将极大地促进整个区块链的发展。\n\n为了实现不同区块链平台之间的资产转移、信息交换和应用协同，跨链技术为此正式诞生。例如，推特最近推出的闪电网络，支持“比特币支付”打赏应用，就是跨链技术的应用，提高了比特币网络上交易的速度和可用性。\n\n目前跨链技术主要有以下实现方式：\n\n1. 公证机制\n\n公证人机制是链对链操作的最简单方式，由可信的组织证明两条链之间的交互。这就像找到一位受人尊敬的村长来证明两个村庄之间的合作。\n\n1. 侧链/中继\n\n它是指通过侧链或中继链以多中心的方式进行交易，以解决信任问题。这有点像将更多的插头插入插座。\n\n1. 哈希锁定\n\n智能合约确保两个人之间的任何转账都可以通过“支付”渠道实现，履行“中介”的角色，类似于机器人。比较有代表性的项目是闪电网络，最近取得了很大进展。\n\n1. 分布式私钥控制\n\n分布式私钥控制是一种相对较新的跨链方法，它基于密码学中的多方计算和阈值密钥的共享技术。\n\n如果将私钥分成A份分发给A个参与者，则只有收集到N个私钥（N小于等于A）才能恢复完整的私钥并解锁私钥中的资产。它引入了锁定和解锁的概念。通过这样的加锁和解锁操作，可以对原链上的Token进行管理。\n\n在众多跨链项目中，Poca和Cosmos是当下备受关注的热点技术，尤其是今年Poca进入了备受期待的平行链部署和竞价阶段。\n\n12 月 8 日，创始人 Gavin Wood 公布了 Poca 的进展。就是这样：\n\n1. 启动Rococo V1（测试网），等待其稳定运行；\n2. 启动 Kusama 系统平行链（公益性质）；\n3. 在 Kusama 上开启拍卖；\n4. 平行链在Kusama线上成功拍卖；\n5. 审核完成后，将上线Polkadot公益性质的平行链；\n6. 开启 Polkadot 拍卖。\n7. 平行链在 Polkadot 上成功拍卖。\n\n目前，KSM测试网的拍卖已经完成，竞争非常激烈。Polkadot 也将在 11 月中旬开放拍卖，我们将密切关注扩展将进行哪些更改。\n\n03 男链\n\n图片 虽然横向扩展的梦想一直基于从一条链移动到另一条链，或者让许多链相互连接，但拥有一个可以尽可能轻松地完成所有事情的单一公共链会很好。\n\n不过，看到今年公链的发展，很多人都说2021年5月是公链爆发的元年。那么接下来我们盘点一下目前公链的情况。\n\n比特币：作为“数字黄金”，比特币的公链功能似乎越来越弱，更能代表价值存储。\n\n以太坊：随着去年和今年 NFT 和 DeFi 的爆发式增长，以太坊的表现已经难以承载大量的市场需求。ETH2.0 的规划分为四个阶段：阶段 0：信标链；第一阶段：分片；第二阶段：智能合约；第三阶段：链下状态存储；第四阶段：分片合约。\n\n但根据以太坊路线图，以太坊 2.0 在伦敦升级后也一再推迟，初步计划最早在 2022 年第一季度左右完成，根据团队目前的延迟模式，甚至可能更晚。\n\n因此，对于用户来说并没有明显的改善，过渡阶段似乎有望基于以太坊的各种Layer 2解决方案。由于实现机制不同，很难做到兼容，几乎不可能做到主导。\n\nBSC：9月是BSC主网上线的一年。这一年，BSC拿下DeFi市场近11%的资产锁仓份额，可谓来势汹汹。然而，链上的几起应用安全事件也令人不安。\n\nSolona：过去半年，公链可以说是开花了。从被称为以太坊杀手的 Solana 到锁定数量创历史新高的 Avalanche，他们都做得很好。\n\n比如9月14日，Solona无法提供正常服务，Solona工作人员在推特上表示，是因为网络资源耗尽和DOS攻击。结果，很多人在推特上说，他们已经卖掉了所有的SOL，想回到ETH。\n\n很多“新公链”的发展还处于初期阶段，似乎还没有一个“完美的公链”，更多的希望还是寄托在以太坊上。\n\n04总结\n\n到目前为止，Layer2 的解决方案有点拖沓，跨链进展不大但似乎不温不火，以太坊似乎仍然是众多公链中“宜居”的地方。\n\n随着越来越多的公链的出现，以及越来越多的应用和生态发展，基于目前的发展情况，我认为跨链的愿景似乎更符合长远发展，更容易实现短时间内扩大规模。让我们看看接下来会发生什么！\n\n您认为哪个更可能实现区块链的可扩展梦想：Layer2、跨链或公有链？", "timestamp": 1635356947, "digest": "RsmAmbWhQlQJMFw4gKBlZBW2-mtWBIORatAM4hTd7k4", "contributor": "0x4123c900e0Ce5B0f59d5c23d8788622b28CF391C"}

Read for more 👇*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u2jOBUAjrZEyJULCv1lrr.png?height=4096&width=6740&size=medium)\n\n\n---\n\nEarlier this year, a group of Internet friends came together and asked ourselves: “What would the Million Dollar Homepage look like, reimagined in a crypto native way?”\n\nAt the time, NFTs were blowing up and this was just a thought exercise to see what we’d come up with.\n\nThe Million Dollar Homepage was a project created by [Alex Tew](https://twitter.com/tewy) (fun fact: he is now the founder of [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) 🤯) in 2005 where he sold one million pixels for $1 each. Each pixel gave you the right to add your logo and link out to your own website to drive traffic.\n\nIt took Alex two weeks to convince friends and family to purchase the first 47 blocks for $4.7k. He took that cash and hired a PR firm. Then things got wild. By New Years Eve 2006, $999k worth of pixels had been sold.\n\nAs the site attracted more visitors, the pixels became more valuable. Alex capitalized on the buzz by auctioning off the last 1000 pixels on eBay for $38k, bringing his total haul to just over $1MM.\n\nThe site still lives today.\n\nIf you zoom into the image on the top right, you’ll find the words: “own a piece of Internet history”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NiZZJVOMbsftMiigNapnE.png?height=1234&width=1600)\n\nBut here’s the thing, the early pixel buyers and fans of the project weren’t able to freely trade the pixels and share in the financial upside of the project. To call this an experiment in digital ownership is laughable by today’s standards, where tokenization and cryptoeconomic protocols are making it possible to make the Internet truly ownable.\n\nAn NFT equivalent of the Million Dollar Homepage would presumably introduce a new business model with shared upside for pixel owners, and perpetual royalties for the creator baked into the code itself.\n\nGenius? Not so much. [Many have tried](https://milliondollartokenpage.com/) and failed.\n\nIt’s hard to replicate the viral success of the Million Dollar Homepage.\n\nBut zooming out, the key insight from the Million Dollar Homepage is that digital real estate can be very valuable. So why start a website for the sole purpose of selling *pixels* on the lottery chance that it succeeds when we could apply the same logic to existing digital real estate?\n\nJust as the Million Dollar Homepage started as a way for Alex to pay for school, we came together as founders committed to exploring alternative ways to fund our companies that better align our communities with our upside.\n\n**[The Modern Billboard Collective](https://themodernbillboard.com/) is a group of startups selling ad space on their websites - represented as NFTs on a billboard - that are freely tradeable. If you believe a website in the collective will succeed and more people will want to visit it in the future, you can buy a little piece of it now and resell it in the future. Chances are, as the participating websites become more valuable and generate more traffic, your lot will be worth more.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LPEC5qV1Pkos9mVhrtgBb.png?height=4096&width=6740&size=medium)\n\nAd products typically only work once you have millions of eyeballs. But tokenization introduces a new dynamic. By combining the benefits of a billboard ad with the appreciation potential of an NFT, we are giving lotholders a unique way to support the companies they believe in, advertise their own projects, and retain significant upside potential.\n\nIt’s the benefits of advertising, the upside of an investment, and the feel good vibes of patronage ;)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/viqSeyC8yMDReiTzyr9fq.png?height=1346&width=2966&size=medium)\n\n**Ugh, but like I have a million questions.**\n\n*Let’s unpack them.*\n\n**How exactly does it work?**\n\n**For startups in the collective (aka websites hosting a billboard):**\n\n* Add a billboard to your site. You decide where to place it.\n* The billboard is broken down into 48 lots, each represented by an NFT.\n* Invite your community to buy lots. Buying a lot entitles them to upload media and link out to a URL of their choice. They can resell the lot anytime. Websites get a % of the sale of any future lots in the secondary market, in perpetuity.\n\n**For the lotholders (aka the people buying the NFT lots):**\n\n* We are launching with billboards for three early startups that we believe will be seeing an increasing amount of traffic over time: [Startupy](http://startupy.world/), [Koodos](http://www.koodos.com/), and [Coinvise](https://www.coinvise.co/).\n* Bid on or buy billboard lots from any of these websites. A grid lot is represented as an NFT, which grants you the ability to upload media and URL of your choice to your lot.\n* You can keep your lot indefinitely, or sell it anytime. Chances are, as the participating websites become more valuable and generate more traffic, your lot will be worth more.\n\n**What’s in it….**\n\n**For the lotholders:**\n\n* **Make $ by owning a valuable piece of digital real estate:** In the physical real estate world, it is well known that value is driven by location. The same logic applies in the digital world, but thus far there have been few ways to monetize and invest in valuable digital real estate. The companies in the collective are at the forefront of their fields, and buying a grid lot is like betting early on them.\n* **Simple, self-serve advertising**: Online advertising has become overrun by “middleman” ad exchanges, audience segmentation, complicated behavioral and cross-device user tracking, and opaque cross-party sharing through data management platforms. We bring back simplicity. If you think one of the companies in The Modern Billboard Collective aligns with your brand, buy a lot and promote your company/project in it.\n* **Align yourself with the startups you believe in** and get provable, verifiable ownership of that support.\n\n**For startups in the collective:**\n\n* A new source of funding that does not involve giving up your freedom or diluting your cap table. Companies monetize from initial NFT sales and by collecting royalties every time the NFTs are resold.\n* A simple, non-intrusive ad product.\n* A fun experiment that aligns your community with your success.\n* An opportunity to participate in a collective of companies that are jointly vested in each other’s success. 5% of all initial lot sales will go towards the collective of participating companies. The pool provides a long-term hedge on the overall performance of each individual company billboard.\n\n**Can I buy a gridlot and rent out the ad space to someone else?**\n\nOnce you buy the lot, it is yours and you can do whatever you want with it (within the bounds of the hosting sites’ terms & conditions). In the future, we may add functionality such as leasing to separate ad revenue from ownership of the lot.\n\n**I want to host a billboard on my website, how can I join the collective?**\n\nTo ensure the quality of companies in the collective, participation is limited but you can apply to join the collective [here](https://airtable.com/shr1b3aRVFCCesPxh).\n\n**What about the humans browsing the sites - why would they want to see a billboard?**\n\nOur #1 priority is to make this a simple, non-obtrusive, 100% privacy-focused advertising alternative that doesn't screw up your browsing experience. Site visitors can choose to permanently collapse the billboard, although many won’t necessarily want to. This is a fun, transparent way to see who is supporting or aligning with a startup, and discover relevant projects, companies, and people.\n\n**Hmm.. why crypto though?**\n\nTokenization is perfect for this use case because combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to own and trade their gridlots in a way that is borderless and easy to transfer. In addition, NFTs enable seamless, perpetual royalties - companies monetize by collecting royalties every time the NFTs are resold, an entirely new revenue stream that is only possible because of cryptoeconomic protocols that can encode royalty logic in the media itself.\n\n**How can I browse and bid on available lots?**\n\nThe first billboards are set to be released next week.\n\n[Get notified when we launch.](https://airtable.com/shrQbP4UOfnSYpRlS) If you want pre-release access, RT this Twitter thread 🤝\n\n**Who’s behind this?**\n\n[Sari](https://twitter.com/sariazout), [Jad](https://twitter.com/Jad_AE), [Jenil](https://twitter.com/0xjenil), [Kirill](https://twitter.com/noskovvkirill), [Eliot](https://twitter.com/CDTEliot), [Gabriel](https://twitter.com/wacko_gabriel), [Aleena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleenavigoda/), [Brandon](https://twitter.com/brandonbaraban), [Max](https://twitter.com/coffeein2code) & [Josh](https://twitter.com/joshnissenboim)", "timestamp": 1635359676, "digest": "f5rGPFSdOQxFlp-xR_ERP8m4YE6oPJ0JuK1gffI3DSQ", "contributor": "0x8cCBf346E4D3623aFBE2278b43a267D39854D147"}

{"id": "OV7PpE_IBXdP0UOyUlFi0naBfrdRdtm7nxdinFomKac", "title": "Six Moonshot ZK Applications", "body": "In the last three years, we have seen an explosion in application-level innovation on platforms like Ethereum. However, recent work in DeFi and decentralized governance has often focused on iterating on or permuting existing mechanics—in the most uninspiring cases, [as Vitalik put it](https://youtu.be/oLsb7clrXMQ?t=408), \"giving people tokens, and letting people earn yield on their tokens, and tokenizing the yield, and earning yield on the yield tokens...\".\n\nWhile novel [project ownership models](https://www.lootproject.com/), improvements on [wallet](https://rainbow.me/learn) or [dapp](https://github.com/austintgriffith/burner-wallet) UX, and experiments with new [community incentivization mechanisms](https://sushi.com/) are important for pushing adoption forwards, they are less likely to move the bottom line on what is *fundamentally* possible with decentralized tech. To raise the ceiling on what decentralized applications are even capable of doing, we need to leverage *new technology*.\n\nWe believe that new tech like zero-knowledge cryptography will play a key role in a next generation of Ethereum applications. ZK crypto is a powerful and general-purpose tool enabling a wide variety of scalability and privacy primitives. Those who have read our essay on [crypto-native gaming](https://gubsheep.mirror.xyz/nsteOfjATPSKH0J8lRD0j2iynmvv_C8i8eb483UzcTM) will find this thesis familiar: **the next step function in Ethereum apps won't come from doing existing stuff better—it will come from being able to do new things that weren't possible before.**\n\nHere are six ZK projects we're excited about, ranging from \"prototype in production\" to \"sci-fi moonshot with a 10% chance of working.\" Much of this builds off of the excellent work done by [Applied ZKP](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/08/12/ef-supported-teams-research-and-development-update-2021-pt-2/#privacy--scaling-explorations) project teams supported by the Ethereum Foundation and others. 0xPARC supports R&D on projects like these via grants and contracts.\n\n* **Decentralized MMO Strategy Games**: Highly programmable [strategy games](https://zkga.me/) similar to Starcraft or Eve Online, on the blockchain.\n* **Secret Data Marketplaces**: [Marketplaces](https://github.com/nulven/EthDataMarketplace) for users to transact secret or encrypted data.\n* **Minecraft on the Blockchain**: Rich, procedurally-generated worlds that are entirely on-chain.\n* **Decentralized Machine Learning Oracles**: Matrix arithmetic, [regression](https://github.com/zk-ml/demo), and even neural network execution on-chain.\n* **Private Asset / Inventory Commitments**: Fully decentralized [TCGs](https://github.com/gubsheep/zk-chess/tree/master/circuits), where games (and not just card ownership) are on the blockchain; private inventories in digital worlds.\n* **ZK Message Board**: Fully-decentralized [message boards](https://github.com/nulven/zk-message-board) (i.e. a Reddit analog) that give mainstream users privacy and power over their data.\n\n# Decentralized MMO Strategy Games\n\nMass-market RTS, TBS, or MMO persistent strategy games, like Starcraft/Civilization/Eve Online (respectively), entirely on the blockchain.\n\n**ZK Mechanic**\n\nCryptographic fog of war, using zkSNARKs to hide the location of units in a shared digital world.\n\n**One level deeper**\n\nWithout zkSNARKs or similar techniques, any fully on-chain MMO game must be a [complete information game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_information), meaning that basic strategy game mechanics such as [fog of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war#In_video_games) are impossible. Using zkSNARKs, we can hide location on a shared map, creating a decentralized fog of war—a key missing element in on-chain RTS (prior to Dark Forest).\n\n**Progress**\n\n* [Dark Forest](https://blog.zkga.me/announcing-darkforest) is in production beta as of mid-2020.\n* A prototype of a [new strategy game](https://twitter.com/justinglibert/status/1413235504967917570) is being built.\n\n**Open questions**\n\n* Blockchain MMO scalability: Not a ZK question, but an MMO question broadly - we can currently support several thousand players on-chain on a side chain. How do we get to millions?\n\n# Private Data Marketplaces\n\nOn-chain data marketplaces where users can transact secret or encrypted data.\n\n**ZK Mechanic**\n\nzkSNARKs can be used to design private data escrow smart contracts. These contracts allow data sellers to share encrypted data with buyers, while proving that the private data being transacted does indeed satisfy some desired property that the buyer cares about. For example, I could sell another Dark Forest player the coordinates of a common enemy's home planet, conducting the transaction privately but also verifiably and completely on-chain.\n\n**One level deeper**\n\nPrivate data, such as Dark Forest planet hash pre-images or TornadoCash withdrawal notes, can be transacted on chain credibly (i.e. with smart contracts verifying that the correct underlying data is being exchanged) and privately (only buyer and seller can decrypt the data, unless either chooses to reveal publicly).\n\nWith a bit of additional work, this construction can also allow the creation of on-chain markets for private off-chain content. A marketplace could allow people to auction off private content with certain properties:\n\n* a dataset with certain aggregate statistics\n* a high-res image that downsamples to a known low-res image\n* an image which a publicly-known ML model classifies as a cat (see ZK-ML section)\n* a set of ML model parameters which achieves a desired performance on a task\n\n**Progress**\n\n* Nick Ulven, a student from ETHUniversity, has a proof of concept implementation [here](https://github.com/nulven/EthDataMarketplace).\n\n**Open questions**\n\n* UX: Some of these constructions involve more back-and-forth than is desireable. For example, data and payment must be held \"in escrow,\" necessitating the seller to make multiple blockchain transactions to complete an exchange.\n* Performance: The ZK circuits necessary to prove that some secret data has certain desired properties may be infeasible.\n\n# Procedurally-Generated Virtual Worlds on Blockchain\n\nFully crypto-native and procedurally-generated virtual worlds, as rich as Minecraft.\n\n**ZK Mechanic**\n\nProcedural generation algorithms like [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) implemented in zkSNARKs.\n\n**One level deeper**\n\nComplex procedural generation algorithms are too expensive to run in the EVM. However, ZK proof verification is always constant-time, and Perlin noise, one of the most fundamental procedural generation algorithms, is possible to implement inside of a zkSNARK.\n\n**Progress**\n\n* Last August, the Dark Forest team implemented a bare-bones [Perlin noise circuit](https://github.com/darkforest-eth/circuits) that is in now in production in Dark Forest; this circuit is also used in the unnamed new strategy game.\n* 0xPARC and ETHUniversity students are prototyping a procedurally-generated, open-world on-chain RPG.\n\n**Open questions**\n\n* Configurability: Our Perlin circuit is not very configurable; it relies on a number of hacks and hardcoded components, including hardcoded gradients and a specific SNARK-friendly interpolation function. What are the features that worldbuilders and procedural generation engineers care to be able to modify, and can they be efficiently implemented in a SNARK?\n* ZK circuit performance: Most consumer machines take thousands of milliseconds to generate SNARK proofs for our bare-bones Perlin SNARK. Are Perlin noise functions with more octaves or other auxiliary features feasible to implement?\n* Arithmetic operations, numerical methods: To implement more complex noninteger operations, we may potentially have to rewrite SNARK-friendly real number approximation arithmetic (analogs to floating point math) from scratch.\n\n# ZK Machine Learning\n\nOn-chain execution of machine learning algorithms, such as regression or neural networks—optionally with strong privacy guarantees.\n\n**ZK Mechanic**\n\nImplement matrix arithmetic, regression algorithms, neural networks, and other machine learning algorithms inside zkSNARKs.\n\n**One level deeper**\n\nMachine learning algorithms are too expensive to run on-chain directly. But by putting regression and other machine learning algorithms inside of a zkSNARK, we would be able to execute models off-chain and verify the correct execution of these models on-chain. ZK also enables us to optionally hide model parameters, or to hide private (but pre-committed) test data that models are executed on.\n\nBeing able to execute machine learning algorithms on chain would have a number of applications.\n\n* If we have access to an on-chain ZK verifier for discriminator model execution, we have an \"oracle\" that can (for example) trustlessly classify images as horses vs. ducks.\n* ZK proofs for ML model execution would enable personalized ad/attention auctions that still allow users to control their data and maintain privacy. In bidding for ad attention, clients would generate ZK proofs that public \"recommendation scoring\" algorithms output certain results on the user's private demographic or psychographic data.\n\n**Progress**\n\n* Two students (Peiyuan Liao and Milo Cress) from [ETHUniversity](https://summer.ethuniversity.org/) have implemented [linear regression in circom](https://github.com/zk-ml/demo)—generating a ZK proof that a private regression model achieves a certain accuracy on a public dataset.\n\n**Open questions**\n\n* ZK Circuit Performance: Can more complex models than linear regression be implemented efficiently in ZK?\n* Arithmetic operations, numerical methods: To implement more complex noninteger operations, we may potentially have to rewrite SNARK-friendly real number approximation arithmetic (analogs to floating point math) from scratch. Peiyuan has implemented a first pass at SNARK-friendly quantization and dequantization of model parameters.\n* Adversarial attacks: Generating adversarial test data for public models (or generating models with known adversarial outputs) is well-understood, which presents a problem for on-chain ML models that are treated as \"oracles.\" This problem is exacerbated if datasets or model params are private—people with knowledge of private model parameters may be able to \"backdoor\" these ZKML systems. For transparency and to prove neutrality of models, maybe you'd also need to put model *training* someday in a SNARK, which is seems much harder (if not impossible).\n\n# Private Asset / Inventory Commitments\n\nFully decentralized [TCGs](https://playhearthstone.com/) where entire card games, and not just card ownership, are executed completely on-chain (or in state channels). These constructions can also be applied to management of private asset sets and inventories more broadly.\n\n**ZK Mechanic**\n\nzkSNARKs can be used to implement primitives like privately rolling random items, adding items to a private inventory, withdrawing items from said inventory, and combining items in said inventory.\n\n**One level deeper**\n\nCard games (or more generally, games with private inventories) have been notoriously hard to implement in decentralized settings, dating back to the seminal paper on [mental poker](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/SRA81.pdf). Subproblems include allowing players to privately but verifiably draw random cards, and verifying that state transitions which players make on their private hands/inventories are valid while maintaining secrecy.\n\nCommit-reveal systems are inadequate in games where revealing full game history is undesirable (a player may not want to show their hand at the end of a round); oftentimes they must also be paired with staking or other cryptoeconomic systems that add additional complexity; finally, they impose practical upper limits on game complexity or duration due to the need to verify a complete historical game log at the end of a game.\n\nConversely, zkSNARKs allow us to build the necessary primitives in fairly straightforward ways—players can commit to a private \"inventory\" (i.e. a hand in a card game), withdraw assets, deposit assets, discard assets, combine assets, and draw random new assets privately but verifiably. This might enable:\n\n* A fully decentralized TCG, like Hearthstone.\n* MMORPGs with private inventories or player \"banks\"; asset privacy is a default expectation already in nearly all popular MMORPGs today.\n\n**Progress**\n\n* I've implemented some simplified [ZK constructions](https://github.com/gubsheep/zk-chess/tree/master/circuits) for drawing and playing cards from a deck, which the Dark Forest team incorporated into a proof-of-concept [demo game](https://github.com/gubsheep/zk-chess) last year. Another ETHUniversity team (Abby Lu, Shu Ge, Jennifer Pan) also showcased similar building blocks in a [recent project](https://github.com/AbbyLuHui/zkpoker/tree/zkaffold-eth/packages).\n\n**Open questions**\n\n* ZK circuit performance: For a decentralized card game, ZK circuit constraints scale either quadratically with number of cards in the deck, or linearly with a high (hundreds of constraints) constant factor. Can we efficiently prove drawing / playing cards for decks of size \\~50 or greater?\n* State channels: Running card games completely on-chain may be infeasible due to blockchain scalability limits. Can we use state channels, and if so, what are the ZK or cryptographic mechanisms necessary to move logic off-chain while still maintaining complete decentralization?\n\n# ZK Message Board\n\nFully-decentralized message boards (i.e. a Reddit analog) that give mainstream users privacy and power over their data.\n\n**ZK Mechanic**\n\nUsers can post messages anonymously, while using zkSNARKs to signal that they are credible (they have a certain reputation score, or they are a member of a certain group, etc.)\n\n**One level deeper**\n\nzkSNARKs allow us to theoretically build message boards with strong privacy guarantees, censorship-resistance, and expressive / granular reputation and credibility systems.\n\nUsing these constructions, anonymous whistleblowers can signal credibility (\"This message is signed by me; I am a US Senator, but I won't reveal which US Senator I am\" or \"I am a user with at least 10m Twitter followers\") without putting exact identity at risk.\n\nIn a message board with an associated upvote/downvote system, users can prove statements like \"I am signing this message as someone whose posts have achieved at least X karma in the past, but I won't reveal who I am or which posts contribute to that score.\"\n\nThis enables online communities to separate signal from noise and to verify reputation or credibility, without requiring that a centralized party to store underlying user data.\n\n**Progress**\n\n* The Ethereum Foundation's applied ZK team has produced [Semaphore](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/), a set of primitives for anonymous signaling.\n* Aayush Gupta and Nick Ulven from ETHUniversity have and [proof-of-concept demo](https://github.com/nulven/zk-polling) of a \"ZK Confessions\" application, similar in spirit to Semaphore. Writeup [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rQqmqMJTe8eRO9hRMt79CvApJXvIv62ufwbU1LUNflk/edit).\n\n**Open questions**\n\n* UX: Current constructions require users to make multiple back-and-forth steps just to join a system or to post messages/proofs. This is a potentially unacceptable amount of friction for a social app.\n* Execution environment: It is unclear if such a network should be completely on-chain—can we sacrifice censorship resistance or data availability for ease of use? For example, by building on a some network of broadcaster nodes in a p2p network, rather than a robustly-incentivized blockchain.\n* Constructions: We don't yet have complete ZK constructions for some of the above primitives!", "timestamp": 1635364848, "digest": "APIbJ9jWwx5hGghiKX6DgdOxgkbSzP0UW4y1PFYHUgA", "contributor": "0x6e95A8B294d7A159B2488f3d7119F82a0e243014"}

{"id": "C-fq6jWOiHpplKYo8pkQMkzMVc7qEjSfPySIrx-SANg", "title": "PRIMORDIAL VISION: 02021", "body": "*ecodao is very proud to present five works by the artist [Wendi Yan](https://wendiyan.com/), “Primordial Vision: 02021,” alongside an original essay Yan has written on the work. A speculative artist whose work often floats freely in liminal spaces between the organic and synthetic, science and science fiction, the utopian and dystopian—and occasionally the slimy and the sublime—Yan maps geographies of futuristic worlds in which the human has devolved into nature. Even that distinction may be a bit dubious, however, given the ways that Yan shows nature is, well, never quite natural itself.*\n\n*Each of these pieces also holds a talismanic weight as the first ever released by ecodao, and as such, they’ll entitle holders to additional powers as well. Each will be a passport into the ecodao community that will offer owners the right to first purchase of ecodao’s token if they’re holding when ecodao decides to tokenize—pending, yes, legal confirmation and tokenization.*\n\n*More immediately, each will also be a passport to **ecodao’s first party, late-night on November 5th, at a secret location in Williamsburg DJed by [BRUX](https://soundcloud.com/whoisbrux).** Once you’ve collected a work, you’ll just need to pull it up in your wallet at the door to get automatic admission. Just head to our Discord [here](https://alpha.guild.xyz/guild/ecodao) when the work hits your wallet, and we’re excited to welcome you to our own little alternate universe—and, we hope, to meet next week.*\n\n*Oh, and: when you collect, 50% will go to Yan, **25% will go to the [Rainforest Foundation](https://rainforestfoundation.org/)**, which supports indigenous communities with land rights and reforestation to fight climate change, and 25% will go to ecodao to support events, art collection, tech development, and what we hope will be the first artist UBI—and first web3 museum. You can read more about our vision [here](https://eco.mirror.xyz/zhtmSvJzPvBcWut0IKHQFgP6P3bEuvte3UKZDWZenNU).*\n\n*With extreme gratitude for helping make ecodao what it is, and in the spirit of speculative futurism, for enabling it to be all it will be. — ecodao*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Scroll down to see all entries*\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=459](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=459)\n\nIn elementary school, I tried to imagine myself as a goldfish.\n\nWhat would it feel like to be a goldfish, with a few seconds of memory, no linguistic capabilities and maybe no specific mechanism to differentiate objects? Of course, I would never *actually* be able to imagine a goldfish's experience, but the thought experiment always took me to a visual field in my mind where the boundaries of “objects” dissolve, everything is alien to me, and I don’t even have a self-awareness to observe *through*.\n\nCreating this series was in some way a form of invoking that state of existence—or rather that experience I call “primordial vision.” It is seeing before language, and even before distinguishing ‘things’ apart. **What lies within this visual field is alien, unknowable and unknown—not least because there is not yet a power dynamic between the perceiver of the vision and what is perceived.** There is a suspension, a gasp in our processing--\n\nI started thinking and reading a lot about nature and biology this year. My initial exploration of olfactory arts and technologies shifted to reading about fungi, algae and alternative food systems—I began musing on a future of fungal technological systems—and to reading Donna Haraway and Timothy Morton. I started taking a bioengineering class. Recently I read about biofabrication and synthetic biology, and picked up *A History of Biology*.\n\nLooking back, it was a logical reaction to the pandemic. After spending the majority of my waking hours clicking and typing in front of multiple screens for a year, I was ready to exercise my sensory muscles more dynamically and immerse myself in both nature and learning about nature.\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=460)\n\nGrowing up in a city of 20 million people in China, I compartmentalized nature as either a “thing” outside the zone of human existence—like the mountains my dad would drive hours to take me to hike during the breaks—or the patches of carefully assorted trees and flowers in the fancier neighborhoods. It took me a while to realize that “nature” as I understood it was a concept constructed just a few centuries ago.\n\nWe are standing at the cusp of some paradigm shift with biology. So much of what biologists are doing in real life today, I, an artist, could not have imagined in my wildest mind. We can take a gene from a single-celled algae species [to make a blind man see shapes](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/24/1025251/a-blind-man-can-perceive-objects-after-a-gene-from-algae-was-added-to-his-eye?curius=1159). We can make xenobots that treat DNA as a cellular hardware [implementing rewritable physiological software](https://www.growbyginkgo.com/2020/06/29/is-dna-hardware-or-software/?curius=1159), which means genome editing isn’t the only way for programming species. We can 3D print tissues like brain organoids, from a real human cell, [to test drugs on mini brain models](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/biofabrication) for more precise medicine. There’s a new CAD software that scientists use to perform *de novo* whole-genome [design of new cells from any species](https://engineeringbiologycenter.org/?utm_source=NEO.LIFE&utm_campaign=5a4aa5937f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_10_19_11_26&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_253ae8788d-5a4aa5937f-88759182). Recently synthetic chemists and synthetic biologists worked together to create interactions [that wouldn’t have otherwise existed](https://phys.org/news/2021-10-synthetic-biology-realm-unnatural.html).\n\n**The way I created *Primordial Vision: 02021* was very much like a combination of alchemy and 3D printing.** In the software, I layered images, gave them varied heights and roughness, mixed their colors and opacities, stacked them in specific orders, and added weathering or other natural effects. The result is these orbs, floating in a slightly tinted void that even I, the “creator”, don’t completely understand. I view them with the same fascination as an interested audience, perhaps just like how biologists today must feel about their own field.\n\n*Primordial Vision: 02021* is my intuitive imagination of future relationships amongst materials, regardless of their “alive-ness.” But more than that, **I want to bring back a sense of magic.** Before the 16th century, magic and science were very much the same. The “things” around us seemed to have some intrinsic nature that enchanted us precisely because we could not place it. Today, we linger in the vertigo from the naive illusion that we were close to knowing everything, which we briefly held a century or so ago. **In a time when value has long decoupled from fact, we simultaneously suffer from being directionless, due to the lack of a guiding ethos, and having a dangerously singular direction, because of the technological determinism too many people in power hold.**\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=461](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=461)\n\nModern science brought us to an increasingly mechanistic view, with great precision, of our relationships with ourselves and the world around us. We’re now able to code genes and synthesize novel chemical reactions, which makes it all the more urgent for us **to restore an organic understanding of technology.** I’d like to quote the contemporary philosopher [Byung-Chul Han](https://artreview.com/byung-chul-han-how-objects-lost-their-magic/): “It’s not objects but information that rules the living world. We no longer inhabit heaven and earth, but the Cloud and Google Earth.”\n\nHow do we live through rapidly evolving technologies and sciences, and thus constant updates to our model of the world, while retaining an organic view of the universe and remaining enchanted and awed? I find myself grappling with this question through all my intellectual and creative explorations this year.\n\nWhen the framework of the Anthropocene was proposed in 2000, it made us urgently aware of our species’ capacity to significantly alter our environment that’s co-inhabited by countless other organisms. We seem to have immense power over nature. But the climate crisis is a crisis precisely because it poses a near-existential threat upon us: **the power we felt was an illusion, and we are still very vulnerable within nature.**\n\nThese days we talk, or joke, nervously, a lot about the end of the world. It doesn’t require a lot of technical knowledge to become acutely aware of the many ways in which we face near-existential or existential risks. The atomic bomb opened the first chapter of our *serious* thinking on extinction, though it seems a small harbinger of the risks we were yet to conceive. [Thomas Moynihan, an Oxford historian of ideas, observed](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/x-risk): “the discovery of human extinction may well yet prove to have been the very centrepiece of that unfolding and unfinished drama that we call modernity.”\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=458](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=458)\n\n**While we are standing at the mesmerizing cusp of unlocking new understandings of the natural world in a degree of complexity and precision unimaginable to us not too long ago, we are also just beginning to live with the idea of *our* death. I use *02021* to denote this year in the work’s title, to hold a more expansive timeline of humanity. But more importantly, we need to collectively instill a long-term worldview that includes *all* sentient beings.**\n\nThis is where artists come in, in cooperation with other thinkers: to reimagine a future encompassing the terrain past human sight and reason, a terrain that nevertheless already surrounds us on this earth. After all, so many crises come down to our models of what we are, and how we relate to other “things.” We are not ever gods, and we need to intentionally walk away from an instrumental view of nature as objects to tame, or manipulate, for our *own* enjoyment and survival.\n\nMaybe you could look at these orbs as planets. Not as planets we will inhabit or that Earth will become. But as planets inhabited by some aliens that have different ways of moving and interacting with the substances around them. What is their nature, what is their technology, and what, frankly, is the difference? — *Wendi Yan*\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=441](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=441)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635363479, "digest": "8_z5JQrhmCAVSU6vi4V7_r7M6HQ-pOWuAVdTNPPtIJY", "contributor": "0xB1059fA05452c48495C7607a6615d5F1DB8109f9"}
{"id": "Df9FCHW2UzDm0LeB8FUg_zWNyBGmqKZeKbRASq6hRFU", "title": "How could social look on Web3", "body": "*Looking at the history of social signaling might give us an indication of how social networks might look on Web3.*\n\n### Social signaling evolution:\n\nBy definition social signaling refers to how humans in nature give clues to qualities that are indirectly observable. It helps humans in society form social hierarchies and is embedded in our natural evolution. Some researchers link social status strongly to well-being, morbidity, and even survival.\n\nEvolutionary psychology doesn't change but the mediums humans express these signals do.\n\n### Signals in the Physical World\n\nWe can backtrack and see that ancient civilizations did this very intentionally with physical objects (tattoos, jewelry, haircuts, clothing). Individuals made it a high priority to visualize their role in society and display their socioeconomic status.\n\n![Mayan civilization 1,000 BC ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3HoClOgbaYkbny3iZ2nrz.png?height=272&width=649)\n\nThis phenomena still persists today through material ownership. From fashion to watches, homes, cars and even the degrees sitting on our desks. As it should, our livelihood depends on it.\n\n## Web2 world\n\nEnter Zuckerberg.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tF0g_4U6PTrq3zUcApz-2.png?height=1190&width=2000)\n\nFast forward to the invention of social networks, a new phenomena started to emerge, something I like to describe as “digital signaling”.  For the first time in history your online presence matters and gives you a place in a universal society. For many it becomes important how many followers you have, if you are verified, what content you have uploaded, and a whole new social dynamic develops.\n\nIt also becomes an expression of your identity. You can like certain pages, upload your best pics, connect with friends and follow their “digital signals”.\n\nThere is a general problem. The content being shared is not verified. These signals are all self-administered. Verification rather depends on the amount of social praise hailed, which is why likes and comments take the center stage. Nonetheless, it changes the world.\n\n## Web3 the holy grail\n\nWeb3 brings the creation of digital ownership. Now humans can express themselves with what they *have* online and everything is verified.\n\nThis is the holy grail of everything that Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter have sought out to be. Imagine a world where you own everything on your Instagram page, this is your new home and the feed is what you do in your digital life.\n\nDon’t be mistaken in thinking that right now the only thing that users can show off on-chain are art collectibles and crypto coins.\n\n[https://twitter.com/NathanCRoth/status/1451540789356531712](https://twitter.com/NathanCRoth/status/1451540789356531712)\n\nNFTs have the potential to shape our online identity when they start to tokenize the world. Most people agree that experiences, merit awards, social communities, brands, creators, professionals, and actions online will all have an NFT receipt of on-chain validity. This world is closer than we think and this is when Web3 social explodes.\n\n**Metabio** takes one of the first stabs at this holistic social profile on-chain:\n\n![https://metabio.wtf/juanb.eth](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cMZ6p9VN6lPuZuH41dJ2S.png?height=1216&width=1056)\n\nThe other amazing aspect is that Web3 socials are aggregators, that read blockchain transactions and all the content already exists. There is no need for users to upload the data.\n\n**The future of a feed:**\nJohn went to the Kanye concert → NFT ticket \n Mary invested in Climate DAO → DAO coin enters wallet\nSam joined Launch house → NFT of community admission enters wallet\nAlexander believes in Lebron → Creator coin enters wallet \n  \n This is the way the world is moving, like it or not. The PFP craze is just the beginning.\n\n> It now becomes “Show me who you are, don’t tell me” \n\n**Friend Networks**\nNo one talks about how [friend networks](https://twitter.com/benscharfstein/status/1445463760232062980) are bigger than creator socials. Facebook at nearly a $1 trillion market cap does not rely on creators and has the most users of any social network. What fueled its global takeover was the networks it helped create from individuals’ social groups with their friends, family and old acquaintances .\n\nSince the blockchain already hosts the information, then any internet user becomes a creator just by taking actions on the web. Imagine a version of Facebook with everyone of its users is posting content. This greatly turns upside down the [1% rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)) that dictates that only 1% of people on the internet post content and the rest consume.\n\n**Non-dualism**\nEverything in social now is tied to an emotion, mostly winning and happy. The blockchain is not dualistic and rather passes on information as it is. John bought a ticket to the Selena Gomez concert, did he have a great or bad time, who knows.\n\nCould this be the answer to the depression and mental disorders that many have [argued](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/da.22466) are brought by Web2 socials?\n\n**This is the real metaverse… for now**  \n For the foreseeable future the metaverse that many visionaries imagine requires technological advancements in VR or brain-computer interface improvements (Neuralink fans?). These could take many years before the necessity of an avatar and a 3D online world bring benefits. For as long as we are consuming the internet through single screens then it is best to stick to profiles and feeds, filled with the expressions of our digital identities. Using an avatar to navigate a world through a screen greatly limits our ability to consume information and is rather an amusing experience of what might be.\n\n### The magic we can’t predict\n\nI largely look forward to the *magic* that comes from a technology innovation + a simple user interface. Take Instagram in 2010 which was made possible from the ability to take decent pictures on our smartphones. A simple interface that lets you share these pictures to your social circles seemed like fun. As the platform grew, the “magic’’ occurred: influencers, digital marketing, data collection. No one could have predicted the implications of this and the power that these technology companies wielded. A countries presidential outcomes could be defined by this photo sharing app.\n\nI presume the same will happen in Web3, blockchain + a user interface of chain activity will logically allow for human connections over these digital assets. We can see what DAOs our friends are voting on, what courses they completed and so much more. What we can’t predict is the ‘magic’ of the implications of these new social dynamics. What happens when all social content is verified? How do humans behave when they are co-owners of the same assets? What happens when each signal has more value? When all the data is public and I can easily find people with identical shared assets?\n\nLet’s build this future and find the answers to these questions. There is great power in how humans organize. I imagine that in 2022 we will have a much clearer picture and I my entrepreneurship journey has led me to start building in this space.

{"id": "e0Ktm0mbuq5YeMwjQjBheNAbyVjZLMY49H-lmrxkC8Q", "title": "Digital Natives", "body": "**First Draft.**\n\nIt is the year 2506; the human being ceased to exist 300 years ago, uprooted from its deterministic nature of biological evolution. The cause was unavoidable: Relentless pursuit of technological innovation, driven essentially by a cascading plaethora of human weaknesses and desires. The human always wanted to be a god, and so he ceased to exist, becoming one. At the turn of the 21'st century, the singularity was a popular subject debated publicly and in closed circles of futurists, intellectuals, and technologists. While singularity slowly faded in the mainstream media, being at times depicted as a far in the future yet to come event, it gained momentum in closed circles. Trillions of dollars of venture and private capital went to companies actively tackling world's toughest challenges: Quantum computers, AI, medicine and aging, genetics and biology. By the mid of the 21'st century, it was clear for everyone that humanity was not just divided but doomed.\n\nCivic unrest followed, but those in power made it clear the people were at their mercy—no need to fight against a far superior, omnipotent, omniscient species who was entitled to rule. The great merge they called it. To some, it felt like a necessity. To others, it was the natural course of life, yet most saw it as a means to survive. The merge consisted of a series of body implants that would significantly augment every human's mental and physical capacities to undergo this procedure. The advantage was unquestionable. Not a single one who did the merge would want to revert it. Mere gadgets enter your body and make you younger, smarter, and connected to unprecedented computation abilities. Who would say no to that? The demand was high, but the market was closed. They kept these technologies within a closed circle of about less than a hundred thousand people. The rest of the world saw it and knew they could never become like that. It's a hard realization for a human to witness his fall from \"the top of the food chain.\" By the turn of the century, a war started between humans and Gods. It was cold and bloody. The stakes were enormous, the democratization of body-enhancing technologies. By this time, the earth's population had fallen to 1 billion. The climate had turned into a pre-Jurassic-like environment. The custodial gods lived in highly militarized cities protected by automatic AI defense systems. For them, it was not a war; the humans were just there as an experiment, left on their own as a living fossil who could potentially yield new and interesting genes for their gene pool. The custodial gods have mastered genetics, including their own. For well over six decades, evolution became a matter of personal interest, and they could enhance their genomes the way they wanted thanks to the merge. Biomarkers would be analyzed continuously by thousands of nano-sensors spread throughout the body. Quantum computers would analyze petabytes of data every minute, run simulations of insanely complex cellular processes, and produce unique genes to enhance the god's genomes. Drugs were no longer ingested but instead fabricated within the cells.\nAging was an easy one to solve, they said. The newborns had their entire genome designed, and the gene pool used was shared within the entire custodial race. Fathers and mothers of all they said. A laudable idea that led to their peril. The newborns were hybrid humans, with bodies enhanced to a far greater extent and minds far more brilliant they saw themselves as a kind of their own. From the age of 5, they would reach adulthood and assimilate the world's entire knowledge into their minds. They quickly got involved in the governance and of their parent's world, created systems that were far too complex for anyone else to understand and shortly took over the power. In less than ten years, every custodian parent was dead, killed without mercy by their own offsprings. The digital natives now owned the planet. They were the new Gods who inherited this earth, almost by accident. They knew the past, for they have encoded the entire archive of human history in their genomes. The desolate view of abandoned cities sunk within unending jungles. The world humans had left behind was now being swollen by mother earth.\n\nThe climate changed drastically, and most of the humans perished. There were rumors of some still living, hidden in the mountains, but no technology or power grid and no breathable air. The digital natives walked out of their fortress cities into the jungle and settled new cities. Their custom biology would allow them to breathe an otherwise unbreathable air filled with CO2. They feared nothing, for they have transcended the tyranny of the body.", "timestamp": 1635360591, "digest": "SMmCs5-rLPSGbC1_EzUQeF16moSFatyMwZidEf6DoQY", "contributor": "0xC7954255FD97F777a643986fa61b44b54524Db86"}

Having recently exited my menswear business, Carson Street Clothiers, I needed a strategically located headquarters from which I could generate leads and quietly work on my freelance projects. As a “founding member” of the newly constructed Ludlow House, conveniently located just 5 blocks from my apartment, I was convinced that this relatively *de minimis* expense would pay great dividends.\n\nMeh.\n\nThis is not an indictment of Soho House. While it’s *de rigueur* among certain coastal elite social circles to shit on the membership club and its cultural adjacencies — Burning Man, SXSW, Tulum, Ted-X, Harvard’s Online Curriculum, Gary Vaynerchuk etc. — that’s not my intent. Indeed, there’s much to praise about Soho House: beautiful locations, great hotels in capital cities, superb amenities, solid (if unremarkable) dining options, interesting events, strong memberships and an inviting ambience for meetings, to name a few. So why the lack of enthusiasm and ultimate cancellation of my membership?\n\n*Grifters. Grifters everywhere.*\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nIt’s December 2017, and Ethereum is smashing all time highs each week (and by double-digit percentages). In a six-month period, the fledgling cryptocurrency has seen a 20x return, and ERC20 tokens built upon the protocol backed by white papers and dreams are easily reaching 10-digit valuations. [Dentacoin](https://dentacoin.com/), Dragonchain(!), Tierion, Golem, Bread, Kin, Cred — these are just some of the darlings of yesteryear: at best, ambitious projects leaving unfulfilled promises; at worst, complete vaporware. The [SEC is starting to crack down on illegal securities offerings](https://fortune.com/2017/10/28/tezos-sec/) wrapped in magical internet money pixie dust. People are “breeding” JPGs of generative kitty art. *And everyone with a pulse at Soho House is “a thought leader on crypto.”*\n\nIn retrospect, I’m sure a few of them were (or still are). But on average, the conversation was astonishingly surface level, falling somewhere around “college sophomore philosophy recitation” on the spectrum of meaningful discourse.\n\nA few short months later, we entered a prolonged bear market — a much needed tree trimming, if you will. Like that, with a proverbial snap of the fingers, the grifters were gone. Well, they were still at Soho House, but their conversation changed: TikTok, Fortnite, [the Yodeling Kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOZT-UpRA2Y), #metoo, Elon Musk’s metamorphosis into Tony Stark, a reheated VC market for DNVBs. See, for grifters, crypto is just another cool thing to talk about because, well, all the interesting people are talking about it. It’s iNDiE. It’s a WaVe. They aren’t building, they are riding. And with the rise of NFTs throughout 2021, they are back in full force.\n\nSo, how do you spot one of these [travelers from a certain ringed planet whose name one prefers not to mention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGvTzIOSFyc)? While no single bullet point is dispositive, measure your encounters on social media and IRL against this easy Grifter Cheat Sheet:\n\n* Passionate fans of DOGE;\n* Cardano shills who “are in it for the tech\";\n* Those who insist that “crypto is bad for the environment” but cannot dive any deeper past that very reductive, bad take;\n* Those who constantly talk about the metaverse but spend no time there;\n* Those who think a centralized metaverse is a good idea;\n* Those who “stack sats” but don’t know what a “sat” is;\n* PFP degens who don’t know (or understand the significance of) Punks and Kitties;\n* PFP degens who do not know the significance of on and off chain storage, IPFS vs. true decentralized storage vs. AWS etc.;\n* People who incessantly talk about the metaverse but have never spent any time there;\n* People who incessantly talk about the Bitcoin halving and macro cycles but cannot explain what either of those two things are;\n* People who are always talking about how high gas fees are on Ethereum but do not know why the concept of gas exists;\n* DAO Discord lobby lurkers without a requisite number of tokens to participate in a meaningful way;\n* Conference junkies;\n* Moon Bois;\n* Youtube Vloggers; and\n* Anyone who says they used to mine Bitcoin in, like, 2013 but have lost their old seed phrase (pro tip: none of these people ever mined anything — ask them what GPU they used and watch them squirm).\n\nAnd this doesn’t even address the endless list of outright swindlers looking to straight up steal your precious crypto — those posing as smart contract developers lurking on Twitter or phishing unsuspecting Discord newbs.\n\nBe careful out there. If you’re not, you may have one of these grifters advising your brand, and before you know it, you’ll end up like [Crockpot](https://opensea.io/collection/crockpot-brand-50th-anniversary).\n\nDon’t end up like Crockpot.", "timestamp": 1635362539, "digest": "PKGLRx5aAzMm2Yv7ohmnh3a-ETAHQOxviBhoLNPPBqo", "contributor": "0x7b78F347cc40F15344EDE278EcEC4E39E1F15485"}

钱包管理仪表板。\n\n资源：网站|推特|Discord\n\n理由：Zapper 还没有“” 存在代币的资产，想要实现，我们还有机会。\n\n空投策略：试用Zapper原生的Exchange、Pool、Save等产品。\n\n13、Zerion 描述：Zerion 是一个全新的 DeFi 和用户的 Web3 钱包管理仪表板。\n\n资源：网站|推特|Discord\n\n理由：和Zapper一样，我们可能会看到Zerion在未来某个时候推出一个本土代币来促进社区治理。\n\n空投策略：试用Zerion的Invest、Exchange、Pool产品等。\n\n14、 Kwenta & Lyra 描述：这是两个不同的协议，但它们的共同点是，彼此都可以构建在 Synthetix 上的衍生项目，已经部署在 Optimism L2 上。\n\n资源：昆塔推特|莱拉推特\n\n理由：这两个项目方已公开确认将进行降低性空投。\n\n空投策略：将 SNX 置于乐观主义之上，然后使用其中的任何一个协议。\n\n15、 Mirror 描述：Mirror 是一个去中心化的内容发布平台\n\n资源：网站|推特|Discord\n\n理由：虽然Mirror已经拥有了WRITE代币，但该代币的发布是受到限制的，可能Mirror可能会向其早期用户空投更多的代币。\n\n空投策略：利用Mirror的各种工具，例如通过平台发布博客文章。\n\n16、以太坊域名服务（ENS） 描述：ENS 是一个 Web3 域名和配置系统。\n\n资源：网站|文档|推特|Discord\n\n理由：ENS正在发展成为一个成熟的中心化身份系统。未来，由代币持有者带动去中心化管理可能会监督这个系统。\n\n空投策略：注册/更新ENS域名。\n\n17、Optimism 描述：Optimism 是一种Optimistic Rollup二层网络，其可以帮助以太坊实现扩容。\n\n资源：网站|文档|推特|Discord\n\n理由：似乎卷起二层网络都推出自己的代币来引导流动性并关注用户。而乐观是一个需要关注的大项目。\n\n空投策略：将资金从以太坊转移到乐观主义，并使用一些应用程序，例如 Uniswap 或 Synthetix。\n\n18、Arbitrum：和Optimism一样，Arbitrum也是一个乐观的汇总二层项目，其最近的发展描述非常不错。\n\n资源：网站|文档|推特|Discord\n\n理由：再一次会，一个上卷二层项目，Arbitrum 似乎最终可能推出自己的代币来引导流动性并实际用户。\n\n空投策略：将资金从以太坊主网转移到Arbitrum，并使用Balancer等应用。\n\n19、zkSync 描述：zkSync 是使用zk rollup技术的L2扩容网络。\n\n资源：网站|文档|推特|Discord\n\n理由：zkSync 的创建者 Matter Labs 已确认他们将发布代币以作为早期用户。\n\n空投策略：打开zkSync钱包并测试这个L2网络。\n\n20、PartyBid 描述：PartyBid 是用于一个“对 NFT 进行集体竞标”的 dapp，该项目让消息朋友好成绩评价可以轻松地一起竞标 NFT。\n\n资源：网站|推特|Discord\n\n空投策略：针对你想要参与的任何 NFT 向发起PartyBid，或激活的PartyBid 其他ETH（如果竞标失败，你可以取回自己的ETH）。\n\n21、Foundation 描述：Foundation 是一个创造者经济的 NFT 铸造和市场平台。\n\n资源：网站|推特\n\n理由：在SuperRare通过RARE推出其社区所有的治理模式之后，像Foundation这样的类似平台很可能会选择类似的方法。\n\n空投策略：在基础上竞标/收集NFT，请记住，因为纯粹的投机原因而不要购买自己不喜欢的NFT。\n\n22、Zora 描述：Zora 是一个 NFT 铸造和市场协议。\n\n资源：网站|文档|推特|Discord\n\n理由：社区管理和治理是 NFT 平台的未来，因此如果 Zora 最终发行了自己的代币，我不会惊喜。\n\n空投策略：在 Zora 上铸造和收集 NFT。\n\n23、 Fractional 描述：Fractional 是一个 NFT 碎片化平台，例如，你将一个稀有的 1/1 NFT0 次 1,00 个碎片。\n\n资源：网站|\\[文档\\](  <https://docs.fractional.art/fractional/#:\\~:text=Fractional>是一个去中心化的协议，他们拥有的 NFT。)| [推特](https://twitter.com/fractional_art)| [不和谐](https://discord.com/invite/fractional)\n\n理由：如果我没记错的话，对未来发生的行动代币的立场表明了立场的态度。\n\n空投策略：在平台上收集NFT的碎片，或者自己拆分NFT。\n\n24、 Sudoswap 描述：Sudoswap 是一个交易 NFT 和 ERC20 代币的交易平台。\n\n资源：网站|推特|Discord\n\n理由：Sudo 团队富有创新精神和角色转换，他们可能会在某个时间进行一次深思熟虑、拍摄的空投。\n\n空投策略：通过Sudoswap应用程序进行一些NFT交易。\n\n25、OpenSea 描述：OpenSea 目前是全球的 NFT 市场。\n\n资源：网站|文档|推特|Discord\n\n理由：随着大型新玩家（例如Coinbase和Reddit）持续进入NFT领域，OpenSea可能会推出自己的代币以用户继续OpenSea上。\n\n空投策略：通过OpenSea技巧和收集NFT。\n\n其他可能会空投的项目还有没有发行自己的代币，我也无法在这篇文章中深入探讨其中的每一个。注意，以下这些项目也存在空投的可能，请记住，我对他们的代币发行计划没有直接的了解。\n\nArt Blocks Artion Fuji Finance Goldfinch Hashflow Horizo​​n Finance MetaMask Opyn Rabbithole Risk Harbor Rubicon Sablier Shell Protocol Sherlock Superfluid Teller 结论请务必记住，使用年轻的 DeFi 和 NFT 项目可能存在风险，它们本质上都是实验。\n\n因此，在深入探索这些协议之前，你需要做更多的研究。\n\n否则，Darren Lau 在推文之前的推文中相反的那样，即使是愿意的参与，也可以让你获得丰厚的空投回报。\n\n请不要忘记，我们最终可能会看到像 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 这样的汇总项目推出自己的自己代币。\n\n另外，你可以在项目试点像Hop Protocol之类的，你可以在其中与这些rollup网络进行交互，可能鸟你实现“一石二”。", "timestamp": 1635362805, "digest": "ae4QkT8rcAE5FMm-EnyEVZXu4pllgjc1BiNs5WpR8Ak", "contributor": "0x9E4977972cb8A95fDF2Cf9Bda269EBDB2DcaEa35"}

The trees in a constant state of producing  fruits in abundance at all times while the animals enjoy eternal youth and health.  \n\nFor the creator so loved his perfect creature that he dedicated the rest of all his marvelous creations to Adam. Everything above and below, inner and outer was given to him as gift to rule over, after all he was the exact replica of his creator.\n\nAnd a creator deserved his own mini kingdom to rule, and so the earth was to be both his domain and his home, together with all the other creations he was meant to rule.\n\nand yet to think that a man would still have the ability to be completely bored, thought Adam to himself while observing the nearby scenery. one most exquisite and perfect to behold, just like everything that existed in this paradise.\n\nAdam mostly spent his days helping the animals in the garden, naming them and discovering way of using his abilities given to him when he was created to help there day to day tasks. \n\nHowever in his spare time he would receive special teaching from the angels as part of his training, and boy did he learn quick. The secrets of the universe which each angel was assigned was slowly imparted to Adam.\n\nFor each angel can only be allowed to know particular secrets f heaven and was never allowed to share them except with Adam. Some angels taught him the secrets of stones, herbs, of the stars and many more and every thing was perfect.\n\nAnd although unknown to Adam not all the angels were happy with the authority which he was granted by the creator and with that they set out to try to trap him, and prove to the creator how unfit his son and chosen champion was.\n\none day while doing his usual custodian of the universe duty he observed a strange phenomenon which he had never paid attention to until now. Every creature in the garden had a partner. \n\neach animal had a male and female, from the greatest creature to the smallest ant everything had a partner everything except Adam. This perplexed adam, as this was the first time he had ever noticed it.\n\nAdam: samyaza, why does every other animal have a partner except me? he asked as he sat on the rock right next to the tree of tree. \n\nSamyaza: sadly i dont not have the answer to such a complex and profound question. i think it is a question best suited for the supreme being. For certain things are only privy to them and them alone. \n\nAdam: signs, indeed i shall do like wise when i see him next. for now am eager to learn about what you have to teach me today Our previous lesson was really exquisite and exciting. \n\nSamyaza: Today i shall divulge the secrets of the trees. all trees shall deliver there secrets to you as commanded by the creator, all except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. As it is forbidden to speak of its secrets.\n\nSamyaza: But like all stories we shall begin in the beginning when they were first created and spoken into existence the supreme creator. and so we begin, in the beginning………", "timestamp": 1635366170, "digest": "MWMVud41F1VtS04snH7eNjx6FyRkpN8gKjuaTS5IZAY", "contributor": "0xE3293A736d2BBe183F5C0A90cdb0fe0518f8834E"}

St. Martin’s Publishing Group\n\n## How pricing art is correlated with human insecurities\n\n\"Judging art is supposed to have less to do with the content of a work and more to do with an instinctive sense for what the artist has to say. Kirsten Ward, who is a physician and psychologist, says that art has the greatest impact when it makes the thinking part of the brain talk to the feeling part.\"\n\n\"They say publicly that prices are whatever someone will pay, and privately that ***art buying at the most expensive end is often a game played by the super-rich, with publicity and cultural distinction as the prize.***\"\n\n\"It simply means that for the wealthy, time is their scarcest resource. They are not willing to spend the time required to educate themselves to the point of overcoming insecurity. So, very often, the way the purchase decision for contemporary art is made is not just about art, but about minimizing that insecurity.\"\n\n## The art of branding and what it has to do with rich people\n\n\"Branding is the end result of the experiences a company creates with its customers and the media over a long period of time and of the clever marketing and public relations that go into creating and reinforcing those experiences.\"\n\n\"Money itself has little meaning in the upper echelons of the art world— everyone has it. What impresses is ownership of a rare and treasured work. The person who owns it is above the art crowd, untouchable. What the rich seem to want to acquire is what economists call ***positional goods;*** things that prove to the rest of the world that they really are rich.\"\n\n## Karl Marx's take on art and wealth\n\n\"Works of art, which represent the highest level of spiritual production, will find favor in the eyes of the bourgeois only if they are presented as being liable to directly generate material wealth.\" (Karl Marx, philosopher)\n\n\n---\n\n*This micro-essay is #005 of ship30for30 challenge.*", "timestamp": 1635359988, "digest": "B4k7Qs0RITe-cruGEXHQFwed-RZwcT4_3a3NQCL-pOk", "contributor": "0x25E0FBc652CfC890d308961b7D34c08d109A491B"}

While we have accepted that as an inherent part of the owner <-> user dynamic, what Web3 has taught us is that there is real impact in giving ownership into the hands of people that actively use the platform.

However, after stumbling upon the Web 3.0, and going down the crypto rabbit hole, I have to admit that there is no turning back. \n\nThis industry (movement?) is developing 5x faster than I am able to track it. This has kept me on my toes since the day I started investing in the space (back in March 2021). As an investor, getting into crypto even at the peak of its bull run has had its rewards. When the market subsequently crashed by \\~50%, I naturally asked: WTF am I invested in ? Each day I ask a new question, and each day I get rewarded for doing do. Despite entering the crypto investing scene at the worst possible time from a macro perspective, my crypto portfolio has fared better than my stock investments. That begs the question: Why leave my job to explore the industry full time?\n\nThe answer: I fundamentally believe in the vision Web 3.0 brings for all internet users. For those who are new to the term itself, Web 3.0 is the coming version of the Internet (hopefully!), that takes the best parts about Web 2.0 (the tech stacks, infrastructure, connectivity through mobile, social and cloud) and combines that with the open source and decentralized nature of Web 1.0 (individuals utilizing technologies and tools built by other creators). Web 2.0 created a closed-walls approach to software production and sales. Web 3.0 has created an open source model where everyone has the power to create and monetize tools, art, technology and experiences on an open, trustless and censor-resistant Web (“Web 3.0”). \n\nThe purpose of this blog is to keep me honest, help me contextualize my research into some cool Web 3.0 projects, track my progress as I learn something new in this space, and hopefully, inspire an individual or two to join the movement.

{"id": "0LtCRP3aTfLwUGSKRQlBJyGGFRr4FeYrt96dDNelNXc", "title": "We don't need music, all we need is a creative process", "body": "In the heyday of the CD age, it was hard to make it as an artist. But there was a blueprint for what needed to happen. All that changed with peer-to-peer file sharing. Recorded music revenues tumbled and execs across the world panicked. What happened in the aftermath of Napster was never about musicians, it was always about bringing the overall revenues back up again. Musicians were never a part of creating the new infrastructures to achieve this. Subsequently they’ve been left without control of the systems they work in. This has been a feature of new technological developments taking hold in the music industry. In the past years, new technologies have brought control of ownership to artists. However, has this gone at the expense of what we have for a long time considered the final product: finished songs and albums? \n\n## Direct-to-fan business\n\nMusicians have started to treat their fans as people they interact with on deeper, more personal, and more creative levels. This started with crowdfunding platforms, where fans could sign up for perks, special mentions, and unique merch if they paid the artist before they created their music. This trend grew with subscription models. Through these the artist extended the way they opened up to their fans. In the same breath, fans agreed to provide recurring revenues for their favorite artists. In between, we’ve seen the rise of micropayments and tipping features as musicians became part of a broader creator economy. The relationship between artist and fan deepened and the holy grail became [1000](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/), or [100](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/), superfans for each artist. \n\n## Artist-fan communities\n\nSuperfan groups in the 1980s would get together and create a fanzine that they distributed themselves to other fans. With the rise of the direct-to-fan tech stack those superfans could not only support their favorite artists directly, but also reach them more directly. Whether it’s through a **Twitch** channel or a **Patreon** page, artists have increasing had to reveal themselves to their fans to gain that valuable recurring revenue. In most cases, these communities center around the personality and the creative process of an artist. Say you subscribe to **Jamie Lidell**’s **[Hanging Out With Audiophiles](https://www.patreon.com/HOWA)**[ Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/HOWA), you care about the podcast and, if you take a Soul Science Crew subscription, you care enough to want to work with the audio from the podcast episodes. It’s all about the process though, it’s about creating together, however asynchronously, together with an artist you love. \n\n## Taking control of the container\n\nAnd then there were NFTs. What made major news headlines with big sales from crypto-connected artists has grown into a valuable way to do direct-to-fan business. Moreover, tokens more broadly are a great way to [empower fan communities](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/portugal-the-man-cryptocurrency-ptm-coin-1129477/) and create [reciprocal business models](https://rally.io/articles/for-colin-benders-rally-is-a-way-to-be-as-generous-as-possible) around music. Since artists themselves are fueling the innovation around NFTs, it means that for the first time they are in control of the technology. Not only is the revenue earned through NFTs, and tokens more generally, a very direct form of artist-fan relationship, the artist also doesn’t lose ownership. On top of that, and because artists can control the direction the technology develops in, NFTs have given way to new forms of artistic expression, mainly in the form of generative art. Take a platform like **Async** where artists can sell separate stems and differently layered pieces of a single work. In a sense, then, there isn’t a single finished piece of music anymore. Instead there’s hundreds of different pieces of music. \n\n## Where does this leave music?\n\nI keep going back to **John Cage**’s piece *4’33”* when I think about the developments I described above. In that piece Cage challenges the notion of what constitutes music. A pianist remains silent, but the composer, together with the performing artist, codified that silence into a music framework. Within that framework, the silence is no longer silence but a piece of music filled with serendipitous sounds. This is very similar to what’s happening to music in the latest iteration of our digital age. We don’t need songs that adhere the limitations of a physical format. Instead, we have music that adheres to the needs of artist-fan communities, who not always need final products to create value. Similarly, we have music that adheres to the possibilities of NFTs and related blockchain technologies. Why create a piece of music that lasts exactly 4’33” when you can also have a piece of music that evolves and changes in relation to certain triggers.

It generated 4x more volume than V2 with only half the TVL required.\n\nDespite the capital efficiency, why do people still keep their liquidity in V2? With the volume / TVL ratio of 2.79 in V3 and only 0.71 in V2, you should earn at least 3.8 times more if you migrate to V3 right?\n\nWell, the true story is not so simple.\n\n## V3 and Capital Efficiency\n\nTo understand how v3 works, let’s take a look at their unique mechanic: concentrated liquidity. \n\n“In Uniswap v3, LPs can concentrate their capital within custom price ranges, providing greater amounts of liquidity at desired prices. In doing so, LPs construct individualized price curves that reflect their own preferences.\n\nLPs can combine any number of distinct concentrated positions within a single pool. For example, an LP in the ETH/DAI pool may choose to allocate $100 to the price ranges $1,000-$2,000 and an additional $50 to the ranges $1,500-$1,750.” \n\nSource:  <https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/> \n\nMoreover,  “Swap fees are not automatically reinvested as they were in previous versions of Uniswap. Instead, they are collected separately from the pool and must be manually redeemed when the owner wishes to collect their fees.” \n\nSource: <https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/fees> \n\nOn V3 not only do you have to actively monitor and adjust your position to get the best yield, you also have to manually claim the rewards if you want to compound them. On v2, the only thing you need to do is deposit your funds into the LP pool.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gb5qXy04qvaUwqW0cM9gb.png?height=1404&width=2296)\n\n*Note: you can use this [Uniswap v3 Fee calculator](https://uniswapv3.flipsidecrypto.com/) to understand more on how different ranges affect your yield on V3.* \n\nThis effectively gives an edge to a small group of people who:\n\n* Have a working strategy and are hedging to battle against the high impermanent loss on concentrated position.\n* Have capital that is large enough to outweigh the high gas fee on each rebalancing position / claiming reward on Ethereum.\n\nIndeed this small group of people will see their capital efficiency increase by 4000x compared to others, but **the conclusion is still that rewards on V3 are heavily distributed to a disproportionately small group of people.**\n\n## What happens if I just provide liquidity to Uniswap V3 the same way I would on V2?\n\nTo see how much the impact is, let’s use [this Uniswap calculator](https://one-dash-yonas.herokuapp.com/uni_pool/0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8) and look at the USDC / ETH pool with a 0.3% swap fee. \n\n![Source: https://one-dash-yonas.herokuapp.com/uni_pool/0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QuYU6AiniyEXmPlDjEaWq.png?height=115&width=512)\n\nThe widest liquidity concentration in the last 30 days is around 20% - 30% with most of the day being only around 5%. Let’s use 20% as an example.\n\n![https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IQl1zgJPg_mb5IScsvj7p.png?height=670&width=1360)\n\nThere is a 10x difference between a user who actively adjusts their position inside the 20% range and a normal user who just provides liquidity in the 0 - infinity range (v2).\n\nThe fees you earn in a pool are distributed based on the ratio of your liquidity over total liquidity. \n\n**The top 10 LPs on V3 hold such a high concentration of the total liquidity that their effective liquidity will increase 10x without a range.** \n\n**Meanwhile retail users will earn 90% less fees if they don’t adjust their range accordingly.** \n\n## Retail investors will earn 4x more in rewards on V2 than on V3. \n\n![Uniswap v3 ETH-USDC 0.3% pool liquidity and fees: https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8 ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0YnlJp5Pal-ESAe9MB-vk.png?height=946&width=2508)\n\n![Uniswap v2 ETH-USDC pool liquidity and fees: https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0xb4e16d0168e52d35cacd2c6185b44281ec28c9dc](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EwGyV1mb42MvSh4jUhHSB.png?height=1078&width=2266)\n\n**Rewards for retail users:** \n\n* With the v2 pool, the fee/liquidity ratio is 184,461 / 218,728,477 = 0.000843. \n* The same ratio on v3 is 703,170 / 332,460,000 = 0.00211. However since you don’t provide liquidity in a tight range / actively manage your position, your actual ratio will be divided by 10 or 0.00021.\n\nV2 gives out 0.000843 / 0.00021, i.e. 4x more rewards than a v3 pool.\n\nMoreover, on some days, liquidity is only concentrated around the 10% range:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0xHu3_MWNk-TsLLHYG_3f.png?height=668&width=1326)\n\nIn this case v2 gives out 8x more reward than v3.\n\nTherefore, while v2 makes everyone receive the same reward per dollar deposited, v3 allows some small group of people to receive more rewards at the detriment of others receiving less. \n\n## Will retail users be able to enter V3 LPs in the future?\n\nWhile layer 2 might solve the gas problem on Ethereum, it won’t remove the technical barrier (the complexity of adjusting the range to maximize the profit). Unless someone can propose an optimized strategy that no one else can beat, there will always be a winner and a loser in this game.\n\nSomehow in the end, the liquidity provider’s job on a decentralized exchange is handled by a centralized group of people.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1635369167, "digest": "vPGowEfiOzJJ7xYyqjaOTEYGTrFg1DjfyL-r1UhvbkY", "contributor": "0xB551E3E62b14674C8dD6b0B173AC23D4e98Cb791"}

While my personal story, as does everyone’s, comes with its share of struggle and nuance, exploring that is not the intention behind my first attempt to break into this new environment that is Web 3.0. I am writing this after almost half a year of inquiry into this developing new world enabled by the apparent adoption of Ethereum as the primary network to Engineer our future as humans on this earth.\nI have always been different. I have thought in a way I perceived as more ‘grandiose’ than others. I was often ostracized for having larger than life visions and not focusing on the minutia and what ‘mattered’. I always thought the only way to truly think about what ‘mattered’, was to zoom out, to the largest scale, and start there. This may be why my religious proclivities have not waned, despite my deep respect and passion for the pursuit of truth, of which religion is now only an artifact, a remnant of our old-world methods of finding this truth. It is precisely this religious introduction that drove my interest to the study of Geology, and our history on this earth from non-life to life, and the seemingly infinite gulf that still lies between. I still, despite my passion for science, find our religious stories beautiful; and in fact, having spent the time I have learning about this bourgeoning Ethereum community, I am drawn to one specific story from my life that I find tremendously uncanny.\n\n![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/13/7e/8c/137e8c8ee47a632fb20843fd293a4f61.jpg)\n\n         This motif of a ‘city in the sky’ is something reincarnated in many forms from within the human experience. It’s likely the roots of this concept converge to our most primitive truth-seeking/trust-forming mechanism: Early human tribalism and its ultimate proliferation into religiosity. As we left the jungles and trees, we found the need to begin to manufacture trust. This is what makes us humans so, well, human. We have each other’s backs. We formed circles, looking outward into the darkness for harm, to protect the inside of the organism that was the foundational societal unit. As language matured, and societies took root, the developing world began to collect it’s most resolute, most coherent picture of the world in ancient scripts such as the Coran, the Bible, and so on. It is here we saw this motif begin to take form. This story of a great city waiting for us, Zion, a place for refuge and peace from the world beyond ourselves. One great example comes from the book of Hebrews:\n\n11: 13-16 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off were assured of them, embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 14 For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland. 15 And truly if they had called to mind that country from which they had come out, they would have had opportunity to return. 16 But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly country. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.\n\nOf course, the great thinkers of our modern age have never quite entertained the literal interpretations of such emphatic claims. Our philosophers dig into the beating heart behind the words that is the very core of our humanness; Our hunger to belong, to commune, and be accepted as the humble pilgrims and strangers of earth that we are; And our glimmering hope to walk celestial streets of gold in a ‘City in the Sky’.\n\n```\nBut did we ever think we would see it? Were these haughty claims rooted in real belief or was this language a proxy to inculcate generations thereafter to dream to actualize such a city. Have we now arrived? Have we all been witnessing the construction of this City in the Sky, streets bustling with code, and tokens trickling through the air? \n```\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dailyhodl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ethereum-breakout-1.jpg?fit=1365%2c800&ssl=1&resize=1280%2c720)\n\nLooking now to our current predicament in this western world - the real fuel behind the inception of this entire Decentralizing movement (of which I am still feeling quite late to the party, even though I keep hearing I’m still ‘very early’)- I see much to be desired. For decades our more centralized methods of operating have begun to show some very serious fatal flaws that have caused the dissolution of the founding missions of these institutions. In tech, for instance, we’ve seen artificial plays to aggregate/manipulate eyeballs; candy crush and flappy bird, to click bait and Instagram market. Across the board, the near Orwellian neology puts on full display our societal stratification: Influencer status and supply shortages, verified and 100k SUBS, inflation is transitory, flagged for misinformation, gain-of-function, and … the list goes on. Is this really it? This disperse, incoherent, random unfolding of independent events pushing and vying for more engagement, more ad space, and ultimately more institutional power over the once idealized sovereign individual? In my opinion, It is starting to look like we are rapidly approaching a panic button moment. A ‘break glass in case of emergency’, or perhaps several of these moments. We will see massive migrations to a decentralized world hosted on Web 3.0, and now in response to such migrations to these communities, it is only reasonable to expect an acceleration in the dissolving of our current institutions. What happens when our goals are met, and the central banking institutions realize their ultimate and inevitable subservience to the blockchain? I am not even remotely convinced that these migrations will all occur in lockstep, in one smooth sweep with little to no breaks in ‘uptime’ to our society moreover. Unless we can bring the Web 3.0 down to earth.\n\nThese are the things I imagine most individuals in this space already have on their plate. But I am still feeling left with the question:\n\nHow does this physically translate? Where is the real-world instantiation of this ‘City in the Sky’ we are building? And by we I of course mean you all. I have been just a mere observer thus far, looking for a way to zoom all the way out, and see the true trajectory of how this ‘City’ can maximize its ability to safehouse those seeking shelter from the debris of a collapsing institutional landscape. How do we bring the entry point into the metaverse offline, and into the physical world, and what would that even look like? Is it an educational institution? Is it the post-secondary educational alternative? Is it a country club for hodlers? Is it the workplace of the new age? is a bazaar, a cultural hub for artists and builders alike? Or is it a hybrid of all the above, much like a city?\n\n```\nIt is here where my thoughts become less in focus because, quite frankly, I am terrified. Despite having always considered myself technically inclined relative to most (especially being still only 25), I am constantly finding myself feeling far out of my depth in this space. I feel as though I’ve barely even made it thus far, and I know that fear might be emblematic of society writ large. For the short time I’ve been a working adult, in the central finance lending space - ironically enough, I am still concerned at the cost of acquisition for the laymen into Web 3.0. The only way I see a hope for this space to fully invoke it’s potential for good, to as many souls as it can, is to bring the barrier to entry as close to the mainstream as possible. And this, must certainly tether this ‘city in the sky’ to the place where the ‘mainstream’ lives, and thinks, and breathes: this physical, off chain earth. \nThe way I see it, there are two discrete outcomes that will only be realized after it is too late: we can continue to meta-develop this world while we watch the world around us crumble, A.K.A. software eats the world. Or, we build a physical apparatus, a chokepoint between the physical humans and nonphysical elements in the metaverse, to maximize the blockchains ability to proliferate our humanness. There must be a point where the blockchain pops up into the world and begins to re-establish our need for institutional order, and to meet the current model where it is to facilitate its reconstruction into the metaverse. \n```", "timestamp": 1635370277, "digest": "8a9ifh7Re2X1brzEXq9kmRywHSAkjXO2GWkVGLyODvk", "contributor": "0x95A04A8a4baC8e70D6985b19AF9efB6DA187BC5D"}
{"id": "YjDAcXtjJaYaB0SML-nHlBdg9xKtjM4PLpIAB0MDPV4", "title": "Cohort Update: Over the Hump with SC03", "body": "Although it seems somewhat impossible, the calendar suggests we’re already past the halfway point of SC03. It feels like just yesterday we had a bunch of baby ideas crawl into our discord, and we’re so proud of the projects they’re becoming 😭. Not really true, many were already off to the races, but you get the sentiment.\n\nWe’re lucky to have the support of some of the biggest brains in web3, and even luckier that they’re willing to spend time sharing their knowledge and experience with our projects. We’ve already had group sessions with Trevor McFedries, Cooper Turley, Denis Nazarov, Reuben Bramanathan, Alex Zhang, and more focused coaching sessions with many others.\n\nWe’re actively working on finding the right way to record and distribute all the knowledge that’s shared in these sessions with our broad community without hurting the intimacy of them, but aren’t quite there yet. So in the meantime here’s an overview of some of the big topics we’ve discussed so far, followed by some project updates, and finishing with a hot alpha leak.\n\n**Proof of Community**\n\nMany of our projects are either early in their community building phases, or have large existing communities on web2 platforms, so advice on how to kickstart and grow web3 communities is something we frequently discuss.\n\nWe typically advise projects to start very small, find a core group of people who are value-aligned with the community they’re trying to build, and focus on engagement and having quality conversations. Trying to attract a big name, or bringing your entire web2 audience over is often counterproductive to this.\n\nTrevor McFedries perfectly conveyed how scrappy this stage can often be. He recommended to start by just finding “some group chat that you’re into and then find more people that are having those same conversations in different places and get everyone together.”\n\nJess suggests pitching your community through the narrative of a huge adventure that you’re embarking on, and to make it so compelling that people can’t ignore. If you get that right and are able to bring together a group of people who are really bought into that adventure, then you’ll be in a great place to start figuring everything else out.\n\n**Community Building**\n\nOnce you have some semblance of community and a shared mission, your focus turns to building momentum towards a shorter term goal. Ideally you’re able to pull some early community members into this, but that often takes time so don’t be discouraged if your founding team is doing all the heavy lifting for a while.\n\nEven if community members aren’t stepping up it’s important to go out of your way to involve them. Alex Zhang told us that he was having individual conversations with 5 or 6 community members per day when he stepped in to lead FWB to gather input into the vision and roadmap. He dropped the gems that “community building is gardening not architecture” and that “being a good leader in a DAO is like being a good dinner party host” which we fully agree with.\n\nIt’s this type of leadership that will earn trust, encourage community members to start contributing, and attract new members. It also helped Alex identify the people that had potential to move into core contributor/leadership roles.\n\nA week later Denis dropped arguably the bomb of the cohort so far when he told everyone to “build for people to collectively lose their shit together”. That’s what we’re talking about.\n\n**Path to Tokenization**\n\nWe’re a tokenized community accelerator so naturally if and when to launch a token is something we explore deeply with our projects. While this is very contextual to the product and vision you’re building towards, our speakers shared some helpful lenses to help us explore the question.\n\nThe first thing we make clear is that you don’t need a token to build a community, and introducing a token won’t make a stale community vibrant. Tokens are used for governance, shared ownership, and rewarding contributions. If there’s nothing valuable to govern or nobody wanting to contribute to the mission, tokens aren’t going to help.\n\nMany of our speakers have also recommended using NFTs as membership as a stepping stone to launching a fungible token. If you don’t immediately need to reward contributions, or have the need for flexible governance, this can be a great way to introduce ownership (and raise money) without having to jump into a token model.\n\nBut all of this being said, as Cooper explained there’s “never a right time to launch a token because you have no idea what you’re going to need until you actually do it”. So we always tell teams to just go. Jess frequently reminds everyone that as long as you operate with transparency and earn credibility from your community, you’ll have the freedom to make adjustments to your token mechanics as your community and needs evolve.\n\nOnce you are ready to launch a token and planning a crowdfund or airdrop it’s important to take a step back and remember why you’re doing this. Alex told everyone to “get your token in the hands of people who are value aligned with what your building, aren’t price speculative at all, and will ride or die with the community”.\n\n**Maturing Your DAO**\n\nWe have a few projects that have already launched tokens and have communities really leaning in to contribute, so we’ve been exposing them to a lot of advice about maturing their DAOs. This includes topics like treasury diversification, legal, hiring for consistent roles, generating on-chain revenue, collaborating with other DAOs, etc.\n\nDiscussing these is beyond the scope of this article, but here are some treats for you to chew on.\n\n“Over-incentivize early contributions and make those people feel wanted and loved and let them really lean into the roles. The more they get to define the roles themselves the better.” - Cooper\n\n“As the leader of your DAO your fingerprints should be all over the project as well. If you’re too much of a researcher you’ll get stuck in this middle ground where you can’t make the decisions.” - Alex\n\n“When it became clear \\[that FWB was going to work\\] we took a few steps backwards to build the foundation and make sure it was built correctly. We wanted to weather proof it for a crypto winter because things change a lot when price go down.” - Trevor\n\n**Just Go**\n\nWhile all of this general advice can be helpful to give you the confidence to move, it’s the movement that will provide you with the answers. So much of the real progress is made in our office hours or intimate coaching sessions where we work directly with teams to clarify their next steps and then push them to take them. So if there’s one thing we want to leave you with, it’s to “just fucking go”. Or maybe it should be “join SC04”.\n\n## SC03 Project Milestones\n\nIt’s only been 3 weeks but we’ve been blown away by what these projects have been able to accomplish so far.

For the short time I’ve been a working adult, in the central finance lending space - ironically enough, I am still concerned at the cost of acquisition for the laymen into Web 3.0. The only way I see a hope for this space to fully invoke it’s potential for good, to as many souls as it can, is to bring the barrier to entry as close to the mainstream as possible. And this, must certainly tether this ‘city in the sky’ to the place where the ‘mainstream’ lives, and thinks, and breathes: this physical, off-chain earth. The way I see it, there are two discrete outcomes that will only be realized after it is too late: we can continue to meta-develop this world while we watch the world around us crumble, A.K.A. software eats the world. Or, we build a physical apparatus, a chokepoint between the physical humans and nonphysical elements in the Metaverse, to maximize the blockchains ability to proliferation our humanness. There must be a point where the blockchain pops up into the world and begins to re-establish our need for institutional order, and to meet the current model where it is to facilitate its reconstruction into the Metaverse.", "timestamp": 1635370713, "digest": "YyzKeh6mbXaomqnEL0oY0oBarvU8rwGXWIITPydoWCo", "contributor": "0x95A04A8a4baC8e70D6985b19AF9efB6DA187BC5D"}

The unleashing of Loot has caused ripples ripping a rift in the Metaverse. The opening of the Rift has created a new form of concentrated magic, known as Loot Crystals, constantly shifting and wildly chaotic.***\n\nThe first Crystals to coalesce bring with them forgotten magic and the ancient energy that powers it...**Mana.**\n\n## What are Mana Crystals?\n\nMana Crystals are the first Crystals that have come out of the Rift. They generate Mana over time, and can be leveled up to increase their traits (like Mana generation, mana capacity, and others). You will use your Loot bags, mLoot bags, or Genesis Adventurers to go into the Rift (our smart contract) to claim your Crystal. \n\n## How do Mana Crystals work?\n\n*When you first find your Crystal, it’s part of your bag… almost like it was always there.* Crystals are registered to the Loot, mLoot, or GA you used to claim it. \n\nCrystals have 6 main properties: Name, Color, Spin, Resonance, Slabs, and Level. As you level up your Crystal, they gain increased Spin, Resonance, and Slabs.\n\nA Crystal can be removed from your bag (minted into an ERC721) at any point. *We don’t do this by default cause it results in higher gas costs for playing the game.*\n\n### What do these traits do?\n\nThe intent is that anyone can build off Crystals and use the traits for whatever they’d like. On day one, we support using Crystals and their traits for Mana.\n\n### Mana\n\nIt’s an ERC20 token that is discharged from the Rift and Crystals. \n\n**Mana Generation:** Every day, Crystals generate Mana equal to their Resonance. The Mana is stored in the Crystal until the Mana is extracted at the Rift. Crystals can’t store more Mana than their Level \\* Resonance. Finally, we use Spin to determine the maximum amount of Mana a Crystal can produce at a given level. \n\n**Leveling up:** Crystals can be leveled up by waiting for them to fully charge up, and then sacrificing that Mana for a +1 to its level.\n\nAlthough all these interactions can be done by interacting with the Smart Contract directly. We built a dApp to make it as easy as possible.\n\n![We built a dApp to handle Crystal claiming, management, and Mana generation. \n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wh-Exhiq2xMeQJUhM6fvn.png?height=813&width=774)\n\n### Genesis Adventurer Offering\n\nWe’ve been working on figuring out a Genesis Adventure collaboration since we announced the Rift project. Huge shout out to @timshel for exploring ideas on how we can make something work. \n\nWe’re excited to announce, at launch GAs will be able to claim a Level 10 Crystal with their GA NFTs! \n\n### \n\n*We were inspired to come up with a new UX for NFTs, and have done that with Crystals. We hope you enjoy them! made by chris and tony*", "timestamp": 1635373239, "digest": "dIcv3yPIx7_aTloVXUcU9CPol21t7WDonsspC-RUHeI", "contributor": "0xF7c454Feb83b0886f21C2A1FEd78ecD246529789"}

He was an easy man to take advantage of in every way - in *every* way. It might've contributed to his death.\n\nLife pulled him hard. It broke all the blocks and locks that bind the dead to earth where they contemplate life as consciousness fades with decomposition. Some last longer than others. Few are given a second chance.\n\nWakes rarely wake the dead. His wake was no more or less different or the same as any other wake observed over time immemorial - a body in a corner, debauchery everywhere else. Hands in passion tore at the peeling cornflower blue wallpaper patterned with dark blue angels entwined with pale yellow mortals - wings and limbs covered the naughty bits. Upon closer inspection, it was difficult to determine if the angels were lifting the humans up, dragging them down, or if they were locked in coital embraces - maybe all, maybe none. Strips of wallpaper slumped into puddles of sick on the floor. He wouldn't have had it any other way.\n\nOne mourner close to release was the first to notice the wraith. Her scream brought other screams as they watched it walk from his body and out the door. It floated more than it walked. They followed in close pursuit.\n\nScreams pierced the night as a shadow of the dead walked. One scream cut-through all others. It was an old scream announcing new life. He was drawn to it like a mob to violence. They tried to stop him - how do you stop the dead? Some prayed, some begged, some watched.\n\nNature conspired against them by shrouding his journey in a milk white mist that swirled and waylaid his pursuers. It was a deadly conspiracy. Mourners stepped into traffic, fell from bridges, or stumbled into the river. Before each death, he tried the coil on for size. No surprise to him, not a one fit - a contract he must fulfill before taking the one he truly wanted. He wouldn’t have had it any other way.\n\nHe entered the gowl's home with blast and song - an old song known only to the most recently dead and no others. He walked past the stunned lodgers and locked eyes with the screaming newborn. It stopped. All was silent. The mist swirled about the room. The newborn cooed and as suddenly as it came, the mist dissipated. He looked at the ring finger of the last remaining mourner and gave her a smile as drool bubbled at the corners of his mouth. He wouldn’t have had it any other way.", "timestamp": 1635374561, "digest": "o3gAGkYxldzjkrsCnQCG8ecotQmSmeKDRAXwseR0ykg", "contributor": "0x137982EcBac7E95e2E12616D6305A43a5fF647A2"}

{"id": "GqqFlMeUa2K2M3gc8QWqVKN330xPCVZcXIcrzL1STzs", "title": "¿Cómo Hacer Trading de Cripto? ", "body": "## Juan Pablo Pisano es uno de los grandes expertos en inversiones en criptoactivos. En esta entrevista, da algunas pautas para operar en el mercado…\n\n## **¿Qué herramientas usas para tomar tus decisiones de trading?**\n\nHago algunas cosas básicas de análisis técnico como tendencias y canales.\n\nMe fijo si el precio va teniendo mínimos y máximos crecientes, en el caso de una tendencia alcista. O mínimos y máximos decrecientes, en una tendencia bajista.\n\nTambién trato de ver cuáles son las zonas importantes de soporte y resistencia. Y algunas medias móviles para limpiar un poco los gráficos.\n\nPero, más que análisis técnico, hago análisis cuantitativo y estadísticas.\n\nUtilizo bastantes indicadores de correlación porque **cripto es un mercado muy correlacionado**. En general, el volumen entra por el BTC. Sube el BTC y sube todo. Cae el BTC y se cae todo.\n\nA la hora de tomar decisiones, me fijo mucho en los ratios de correlación entre BTC, ETH y las diferentes monedas del ecosistema.\n\nPor ejemplo, **si se trata de un token de una Dapp o de un protocolo de DeFi, hay una alta correlación con el ETH**.\n\nTambién estudio la correlación con la bolsa en general como el NASDAQ y el S&P 500.\n\nAlgunos creen que no hay correlación entre la bolsa y el mercado cripto. Pero en marzo del 2020, en el comienzo de la crisis del coronavirus, esta relación quedó clara. La bolsa y el cripto se derrumbaron al mismo tiempo.\n\nA la hora de hacer un análisis, hay que tener en cuenta que **en cripto hay algunos comportamientos específicos que responden a la estacionalidad**.\n\nPor ejemplo, todos los martes, el exchange FTX da un airdrop a los tenedores de su token. Así que todos los lunes y días previos hay una demanda especial de ese criptoactivo. Todos los martes, hay un exceso de oferta del token de FTX debido a las ventas de los que compraron el lunes por el airdrop.\n\nOtro tipo de estacionalidad ocurre en relación con el vencimiento del vesting de los tokens de los fundadores de algún proyecto. Esto puede generar presiones a la venta.\n\nCon un buen análisis de estacionalidad, uno puede darse cuenta de este tipo de efectos. Esto sirve para definir el *timing* para comprar y vender.\n\nOtro tipo de análisis que uso son los **ratios de riesgo**. Aunque se usan mucho en la bolsa, no están tan extendidos en el mercado cripto. Y justamente es en cripto que son más relevantes porque sirven especialmente para entornos de alta volatilidad.\n\n**Si invierto en una moneda que tiene una volatilidad extrema: ¿cuál es el retorno que me va a dar a cambio?** Los ratios de riesgo ayudan a tomar esta decisión.\n\nTambién uso **métricas de flujo**. Por ejemplo, para ver si la tendencia de precio se correlaciona con la tendencia de volumen.\n\nPara esto, utilizo quantiles de volumen respecto a una ventana previa. Y también metricas de derivados, como interés abierto en futuros y opciones, tasa de funding de futuros, liquidaciones, y flujos y stocks en los principales exchanges de BTC y ETH.\n\n![Las herramientas de análisis técnico son muy populares entre traders de cripto.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*fVdxuGh6BR0hJus5WomgQw.jpeg)\n\n## ¿Qué tipo de estrategias usas para el swing trading?\n\nPrimero, el **trend following**, que es el que usa la mayoría. Se trata de entrar en una tendencia cuando empieza a subir.\n\nPara esto, hay que evaluar si la tendencia tiene potencia y tratar de entrar antes de que empiece la parte más fuerte. La clave es entrar cuando la tendencia empieza a tomar velocidad y salir antes de que se empiece a agotar.\n\nHay que ser muy fino con el *timing*.\n\nUna segunda estrategia es la **contrarian**. Esto es, operar en contra cuando vemos que el precio de un activo subió demasiado.\n\nA veces, un súbito aumento en el precio se explica por algún fundamental concreto. Otras veces, porque en medio de un bull market, la gente empieza a comprar cualquier cosa.\n\nAnalizar el market cap de una moneda nos permite entender si la gente está comprando a valuaciones exageradas. Y ahí opero en contra.\n\n## **¿Qué herramientas usas como fuentes de información para tu análisis?**\n\nUso [TradingView](https://es.tradingview.com/) para análisis de precio. Es una herramienta para dibujar gráficos, calcular porcentajes y realizar muchos otros tipos de análisis.\n\n[CoinGekko](https://www.coingecko.com/es), [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) y [Cryptorank](https://cryptorank.io/) para un seguimiento del precio y de otros indicadores clave sobre los proyectos. También [Cryptocompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/), que tiene muchos datos de redes sociales que en otros lados es más difícil de encontrar.\n\n[Glassnode](https://glassnode.com/) es muy bueno para análisis on-chain.\n\nPara estudiar protocolos de DeFi, uso [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/home), que tiene información de todos los protocolos y blockchains.\n\nTambién uso muchas herramientas de programación. Uso varias APIs, como las de [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/apis), y las de los exchanges [Binance](http://binance.com/) y [HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/es_).\n\nPor último, aplico herramientas de machine learning para ayudarme en mis decisiones. Tengo algunos modelos básicos de árbol de decisión. Incluso algunos modelos basados en deep learning y redes neuronales.\n\n## **¿Cuáles son las principales diferencias entre los mercados tradicionales y los mercados cripto?**\n\nLa principal diferencia es la volatilidad. **El cripto es cinco veces más volátil que la bolsa tradicional.** En sólo un minuto, la situación del mercado puede cambiar completamente.\n\n**El cripto además opera 24/7.** Son 168 horas por semana contra las sólo 30 horas por semana de una bolsa tradicional.\n\nSi uno se queda comprado una semana, son 168 horas expuesto a una volatilidad 5 veces más alta que la de la bolsa tradicional. Esto significa que **es 30 veces más riesgoso operar en cripto que en la bolsa**. Y si uno toma un criptoactivo que está del puesto 300 hacia abajo, la volatilidad puede llegar a ser 10 veces mayor.\n\nUna tercera diferencia es la **liquidez**.\n\nBTC y ETH son activos con tanta o más liquidez que las acciones de Apple. Pero son sólo estos dos.\n\nEn la bolsa de Estados Unidos, hay unas 500 acciones muy líquidas con las que uno puede operar. En cripto, sólo hay unas 200 monedas muy líquidas.\n\nEn estas monedas, uno puede comprar o vender 100 mil dólares sin mover el precio. En la bolsa tradicional, la liquidez es tan alta que uno puede operar 1 millón de dólares sin mover el precio. Esto es una gran diferencia.\n\nEn cuarto lugar, **la bolsa está muy regulada y las operaciones ocurren de manera más ordenada**.\n\nTodos saben a qué hora abren los mercados en Estados Unidos, Europa y China. Todo está muy coordinado.\n\nLos mercados cripto son mucho más desordenados. Como se opera 24/7, se generan sesgos horarios importantes. Hay diferencias de volumen importante por país debido a las diferencias de horarios.\n\nEn cripto, además hay días concretos en que se entregan airdrops. Por ejemplo, Binance lanza un launchpad y uno puede ganar ciertas recompensas haciendo staking de BNB. Entonces, en ese día o semana, aumenta tremendamente la demanda del token.\n\nEstas estacionalidades o sesgos son muy raros en la bolsa.\n\nEn los mercados financieros tradicionales, el pricing depende fuertemente de los fundamentals de los activos. No existen estas situaciones en las que uno puede obtener recompensas adicionales por tener cierta acción de Apple.\n\nEn cripto, estos eventos generan un aumento repentino de la demanda.\n\nEl mundo cripto tiene la ventaja de la transparencia. Desde un explorador de bloques como Etherscan, uno puede ver todo lo que está ocurriendo en tiempo real.\n\nIncluso hay cuentas de Twitter como [Whale Alert](https://twitter.com/whale_alert), que nos alertan cuando alguna cuenta hizo algún movimiento importante de fondos. Este tipo de transparencia no existe en los mercados tradicionales.\n\nPor último, **el mundo cripto está mucho menos regulado.**\n\nEn el mundo tradicional, las empresas salen a la bolsa con un IPO. Ponen a la venta cierta cantidad de acciones que los traders van a poder comprar y vender. Luego, estas acciones entran en el mercado secundario y se van distribuyendo.\n\nSi una empresa quiere ofrecer más acciones, tiene que seguir un largo procedimiento que involucra obtener una autorización del regulador, etc. Algo parecido ocurre cuando una empresa quiere recomprar sus acciones.\n\nEn el mundo cripto, esto es caótico.\n\nUn proyecto puede emitir y recomprar tokens sin ninguna autorización especial. Esto puede resultar sorprendente para gente que está acostumbrada al procedimiento tradicional.\n\n**En el mundo cripto, hay mucho inversor de retail**. Y esto genera un efecto muy grande cuando empiezan a comprar un token. Monedas de muy baja capitalización de mercado empiezan a ser bombeadas y suben muy rápido de precio.\n\nPor ejemplo, una moneda con un valor de mercado de 50 millones de dólares. De pronto, aparecen 50.000 nuevos compradores que compran de a 100 dólares cada uno. Esto aumenta muchísimo el precio en muy poco tiempo.\n\nEstas cosas no ocurren en la bolsa.

En esta entrevista, ofrece una serie de pautas para evaluar activos y tomar decisiones inteligentes…\n\n## **Para empezar, contame un poco sobre tu carrera. ¿Cómo fue que empezaste en el mundo cripto?**\n\nMi formación de base es como ingeniero industrial. Siempre me gustaron las matemáticas. Me dediqué mucho a dar clases.\n\nEn un momento, empecé a desarrollar webapps para business intelligence y sistemas de CRM y ERP. En el camino, fui aprendiendo a programar.\n\nEn 2011, mientras hacía unas investigaciones en criptografía, conocí a una persona que estaba minando Bitcoin desde su PC.\n\nEn aquel entonces, yo tenía una editorial. Tenía unas 20 computadoras en la oficina. Esta persona me dijo: “Con estos equipos, podrías minar una cantidad importante de Bitcoin”.\n\nPero en aquel entonces no me pareció mucho dinero. Tampoco creía que el cripto se volvería masivo. Así que no me metí.\n\nRecién volví a interesarme hacia 2016, cuando se estaban empezando a armar los primeros exchanges locales.\n\n## ¿Cuál es tu procedimiento para evaluar inversiones con una perspectiva de largo plazo?\n\nEl primer paso es identificar el tipo de proyecto. Diferentes categorías deben analizarse con métricas diferentes.\n\n* **Blockchains**\n\nDentro de esta categoría, tenemos las blockchains de primera generación como [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/es/), [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/) o [Zcash](https://z.cash/). En ellas, el caso de uso es la reserva de valor.\n\nLuego, está la subcategoría de blockchains de segunda y tercera generación. Estas permiten correr smarts contracts y aplicaciones descentralizadas.\n\nA la hora de analizarlas, me fijo en la seguridad, escalabilidad, descentralización, equipo, comunidad y roadmap, entre otras variables.\n\n* **Proyectos de infraestructura on-chain**\n\nEstos proyectos se dedican a construir infraestructura para resolver problemas de usabilidad o escalabilidad de blockchains. Por ejemplo, wallets, [oráculos](https://medium.com/astec/or%C3%A1culos-conectando-los-smart-contracts-con-el-mundo-9bcfda4ebffb) (ej., Chainlink, Band, WinkLink), interconectores (ej. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/)), SDKs y herramientas como Cosmos (y su token ATOM).\n\nAquí también entra [RSK](https://www.rsk.co/) (con su token RIF) que provee infraestructura para ampliar las capacidades de la blockchain de Bitcoin. También hay proyectos de infraestructura de lo que se conoce como capa 2 de Ethereum.\n\nEsta es una categoría altamente técnica. Para evaluar una inversión en estos proyectos, es necesario un conocimiento profundo del problema que buscan resolver, el “timing” y la proyección a futuro.\n\n* **Proyectos de infraestructura off-chain**\n\nLos proyectos de infraestructura off-chain incluyen aquellos que buscan construir infraestructura vinculada a la solución de problemas de la vida real, y no tanto de cuestiones específicas del blockchain.\n\nEsto incluye versiones descentralizadas de Spotify como [LivePeer](https://livepeer.org/), la version descentralizada de Google Drive como [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) o servicios de streaming de video descentralizado como [Theta](https://www.thetatoken.org/).\n\nAl analizar uno de estos proyectos, analizo sus interfaces, su comunidad e incentivos económicos. Una importante pregunta que me hago es: **“¿Yo usaría esta aplicación en lugar de su versión centralizada?”.**\n\n![LivePeer es un servicio de streaming de video construido sobre blockchain.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*DAFCpPxonjB9_X3ooPICoA.png)\n\n* **Tokens de exchanges**\n\nEstos son tokens que emiten diferentes exchanges y que ofrecen diferentes ventajas a la hora de usar sus servicios. Por ejemplo, el token de [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/bnb), de [FTX](https://ftx.com/), de [Huobi](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/) o de [Okex](https://www.okex.com/).\n\nAquí hay dos elementos principales a analizar.\n\nPrimero, el caso de uso: **¿para que le sirve a los usuarios de estos exchanges holdear esos tokens?**\n\nUn caso de uso importante son los “launchpads” que brindan a los holders la posibilidad de adquirir gratis (o por un precio muy bajo) los primeros tokens de proyectos que se lanzan por primera vez en esos exchanges en las ofertas conocidas como Initial Exchange Offering IEO.\n\nSegundo, evalúo los tokenomics. **¿Cuál es el suministro total, la distribución inicial, la quema mensual/trimestral/anual? ¿Cuál es la posible dinámica de oferta y demanda de tokens?**\n\n![El token BNB permite obtener una serie de beneficios dentro de todo el ecosistema de Binance.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*hKB0ckdD3SJqoNZJ_oq6Hg.png)\n\n* **DeFi**\n\nDentro de la categoría de DeFi, una parte está directamente vinculada a las finanzas.\n\nEsto incluye, por ejemplo, a exchanges descentralizados como [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) o [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/); a protocolos de lending como [Aave](https://aave.com/) o [Compound](https://compound.finance/); o agregadores de rendimiento como [Yearn Finance](https://yearn.finance/).\n\nLa otra subcategoría dentro del DeFi son los protocolos o Dapps que no están directamente vinculados con aplicaciones financieras. Por ejemplo, [Kleros](https://kleros.io/) y la justicia descentralizada.\n\nEn este tipo de protocolos, es muy importante evaluar el equipo, el marketing y la forma de vincularse con la comunidad. Muchas veces, estos proyectos llegan con propuestas muy nuevas y hasta revolucionarias. Muchos de estos proyectos son geniales y también sus equipos. Pero uno llega desde afuera y resulta muy difícil de entender.\n\nEn esta categoría, es muy frecuente ver proyectos terriblemente subvalorados porque no comunican bien la utilidad o los planes de mejora del protocolo. Los problemas de comunicación hacen que a los usuarios les cueste entender el potencial.\n\n![El exchange descentralizado Uniswap es una de las piezas fundamentales del ecosistema de finanzas descentralizadas.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*VVYRPV8dkiv50G9wW1JWvg.png)\n\n## ¿Cuáles son las variables a tener en cuenta a la hora de analizar un proyecto?\n\n* **¿Qué problema de la vida real soluciona?**\n\nEs importante entender cuál es el problema que busca resolver. Por ejemplo, conectar traductores freelancers con clientes que buscan traducciones.\n\nHay que indagar en el problema y la solución: ¿por qué este problema va a resolverse mejor con una solución on-chain? ¿Cuál es la ventaja sobre las soluciones off-chain?\n\n* **¿Cómo se compone el equipo?**\n\nPara esto, podemos ver el código que publican en Github y participar en sesiones de preguntas y respuestas con sus líderes. Queremos ver si el equipo se mueve para alcanzar la visión del proyecto.\n\n* **¿Cómo se compone la comunidad y cuál es la estrategia de comunicación del equipo?**\n\nPara que un proyecto funcione, necesita una buena comunidad y una buena comunicación. La web y materiales de comunicación tienen que ser claros y entendibles.\n\nEl white paper es como la carta de presentación de un proyecto: tiene que ser claro y estar actualizado. Debe seguir la realidad del proyecto a medida que este va evolucionando.\n\nMuchos proyectos son excelentes pero tienen white papers de muy baja calidad.\n\nCuando la gente hace preguntas en Discord, Twitter u otra red social, es importante ver que los miembros del equipo respondan bien. La forma de vinculación con la comunidad es muy importante.\n\n* **¿Cuál es el timing?**\n\nHay proyectos que son excelentes pero que se lanzan en el momento equivocado. Muchos están demasiado adelantados a su tiempo.\n\n* **¿Cuál es la función del token?**\n\nUn proyecto bien puede estar resolviendo un problema concreto y tener un equipo excelente. Pero si su token no tiene una utilidad clara, entonces es difícil ver cómo va a capturar ese valor.\n\nCuando estamos analizando un token de una Dapp, de un proyecto de infraestructura o de un exchange, es necesario tener clara la respuesta a la pregunta: **¿qué es lo que va a hacer que el usuario quiera holdear ese token?** ¿Qué beneficio obtendría al holdearlo?\n\nUn claro ejemplo es cuando el token nativo de una blockchain se usa para pagar los fees de transacción en esa misma blockchain. En este caso, el token captura todo el valor transaccional de lo que generen las dapps que corran en ella.\n\nOtro caso de uso común es la gobernanza: el token da a sus tenedores la posibilidad de votar en decisiones que afectan el futuro del protocolo. Pero, a veces, esto no es suficiente porque son muy pocos los usuarios que se involucran en esta clase de decisiones.\n\nUn modelo interesante es cuando la aplicación tiene algún tipo de fee de uso, y parte de esos fees se distribuyen a los holders, ya sea a través de una DAO o a través de programas de recompra y quema de tokens.\n\n* **¿Cuál es la distribución de los tokens y cuál es su período de bloqueo?**\n\nSi el proyecto tiene una gran cantidad de tokens pre minados (por ejemplo, por encima del 20%), esto puede ser una señal de alarma.\n\nPero también tenemos que entender cuál es el esquema de vesting.\n\nA veces, no es un problema que los fundadores o los inversores iniciales tengan una cantidad importante de tokens si el período de bloqueo es elevado. No es lo mismo que sea un año, a que sean cuatro años o que sean 10.\n\nSi el equipo tiene confianza en su proyecto, no debería tener problemas en hacer una apuesta de largo plazo y materializar su inversión a 5 o 10 años. Un período de vesting largo es un voto de confianza del equipo.\n\n* **¿Cuáles son los indicadores comparativos?**\n\nEl uso de indicadores comparativos nos permite entender el techo de crecimiento que puede tener un proyecto.\n\nDos protocolos que hacen cosas parecidas deberían tener aproximadamente el mismo valor de mercado. Si estoy estudiando un proyecto que hace streaming de audio descentralizado, me pregunto: ¿a cuánto market cap llegó el proyecto que alcanzó mayor valor de mercado? ¿Es posible que el proyecto que estoy analizando llegue a superarlo?\n\nPara esta evaluación, hay que utilizar el indicador de **capitalización de mercado diluida**.\n\nEl market cap es el resultado de multiplicar la cantidad de tokens en circulación por su precio. Pero en proyectos en etapa temprana, es posible que una parte de los tokens aún no se hayan emitido.\n\nPor ejemplo, en el caso del Bitcoin, ya se emitieron unos 18 millones de tokens de un total de 21 millones. En este caso, el market cap surge de multiplicar el precio por 18 millones. El resultado no es muy diferente del valor diluido, que sale de multiplicar el precio por los 21 millones que habrá emitidos.\n\nSin embargo, en el caso de proyectos en etapa temprana, la diferencia puede ser significativa.\n\nPensemos por ejemplo un proyecto que acaba de nacer y tiene 2 millones de tokens en circulación. Todos los meses, serán emitidos otros 2 millones.\n\nEsto significa que, en 10 años, tendremos 240 millones de tokens adicionales, lo que va a diluir seriamente el valor de los 2 millones de tokens actuales. Por eso, a la hora de evaluar el proyecto a largo plazo, es fundamental usar el indicador diluido.\n\nSi estoy comparando los proyectos A y B (ambos similares y con buena proyección), pero A tiene un market cap diluido de 20 millones mientras que en B es de 180 millones, prefiero comprar A, porque está más infravalorado.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*UNsDlo2DT3Xevw9NwdqEHQ.png)\n\nEn el caso del Bitcoin, como la mayor cantidad de las monedas ya han sido emitidas, no hay una diferencia significativa entre el market cap y el market cap diluido. Pero en el caso de otras monedas con una alta emisión por delante, la diferencia podría ser importante.\n\n* **¿Cuál es el nivel de innovación?**\n\nEs importante evaluar qué es lo nuevo que trae el protocolo. ¿Qué es lo que lo hace diferente al resto?\n\nNo es necesario que el proyecto busque reinventar la pólvora. Hay proyectos que hacen algo parecido a otros pero mejorando algún aspecto que le da una clara ventaja de innovación.\n\nPor ejemplo, [Solana](https://solana.com/) se planteó mejorar la escalabilidad sin sacrificar en forma excesiva la descentralizacion y la seguridad mediante la innovación del sharding. Aunque no fue tan revolucionario respecto a otros proyectos, igualmente le sirvió para escalar hasta el top 10 del ranking.\n\n* **¿Cuál es el grado de usabilidad?**\n\nAlgunos proyectos tienen propuestas excelentes, pero son prácticamente imposibles de utilizar. O sólo pueden usarlos personas con mucha experiencia en cripto.\n\nEs muy importante que el proyecto desarrolle un producto amigable y que sea entendible para el usuario común.\n\n* **¿En qué exchanges cotiza la moneda?**\n\nSi se trata de un proyecto nuevo, es normal que no cotice en muchos lugares. Pero los proyectos que ya están por encima de los 100 millones de market cap ya deberían cotizar en algún exchange.\n\nDe los 6 o 7 exchanges principales, si cotiza en uno o dos ya es suficiente. Pero si vemos que el proyecto cotiza únicamente en Uniswap, es una bandera amarilla.\n\n## ¿Cómo afecta el objetivo de plazo a la decisión de inversión?\n\nA la hora de tomar la decisión, es importante definir a qué plazo buscamos invertir.\n\nSi tenemos un objetivo relativamente corto, como de un año, podemos tratar de aprovechar el “momentum” de proyectos que trabajan en alguna temática de moda.\n\nPero, a la hora de tomar una decisión para el muy largo plazo, debemos tener una visión diferente. Por ejemplo, en lo personal, me gusta el planteo integral que hace un proyecto como [Cardano](https://cardano.org/).\n\nSu objetivo es construir una blockchain compatible con regulaciones, identidades, etc., a través de un planteo científico de revisión de pares. Aunque también es cierto que esto hace que los avances sean más lentos y curocráticos.\n\nSi invierto en ADA, no es para hacer una diferencia en un año. Es un hold a largo plazo. Pero claro, para esto, hay que estar dispuesto a no tocar esos tokens por 3 o 5 años. O incluso más…\n\nEn el otro extremo, tenemos proyectos que se la juegan a todo o nada con apuestas muy agresivas de muy corto plazo. Salen al mercado con el código aún en una etapa temprana de desarrollo y con la comunidad en las primeras etapas de formación. Esto es el caso de varios exchanges descentralizados con apuestas fuertes en lo que es farming.\n\nA veces, pueden terminar capturando una gran parte del mercado poco después de su lanzamiento, como fue el caso de PancakeSwap. Si uno acierta, puede ser una inversión de un rendimiento extraordinario. Pero la mayoría no lo logra. Así que son inversiones de muy alto riesgo.", "timestamp": 1635375552, "digest": "lI3fA0_yv5pk_qwiqia-8D4BW4nszD94dDefnyol7Gc", "contributor": "0xf12C67e80E309eaC0c4dc18Fb26e68F9672297E9"}
{"id": "62NWPmROFYbUEDKD17SxCApCRD8jNo-4rvaes9XIXok", "title": "NFTs y la Tesis de los Mil Fans Verdaderos", "body": "## En 2008, el escritor futurista Kevin Kelly propuso la tesis de que cualquier creador con al menos mil seguidores verdaderos podría ganarse la vida en Internet. Los NFTs podrían llevar esta visión a la realidad…\n\n*Esta es una versión traducida y adaptada del texto “[NFTs and a 1000 true fans](https://a16z.com/2021/02/27/nfts-and-a-thousand-true-fans/)” publicado por Chris Dixon en el blog del fondo de inversión Andreessen & Horowitz.*\n\nEn su clásico ensayo del 2008, “[1000 fans verdaderos](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)”, Kevin Kelly predijo que Internet transformaría la naturaleza de las actividades creativas.\n\nPara ser un creador exitoso, no se necesitan millones de dólares, de clientes ni de seguidores. **Para ganarte la vida como artesano, fotógrafo, músico, diseñador, autor, animador, desarrollador de apps, emprendedor o inventor, sólo necesitas algunos miles de fans verdaderos.**\n\nUn fan verdadero es alguien que comprará cualquier cosa que produzcas. Estos fans conducirán 300 kilómetros para verte cantar; comprarán la versión de tapa dura, blanda y en audio de tu libro; pagarán por la versión “lo mejor de” en DVD de tu canal de YouTube gratuito; y comerán en tu restaurante una vez por mes.\n\nLa visión de Kelly era que Internet era “el instrumento de conexión” perfecto, lo que permitiría el advenimiento del mecenazgo del siglo XXI. Cualquier creador, sin importar cuán de nicho pudiera parecer, ahora puede descubrir a sus fans verdaderos, quienes a su vez demostrarán su entusiasmo a través de un apoyo financiero directo.\n\n**Pero Internet tomó un desvío.**\n\nLas plataformas centralizadas de redes sociales se volvieron la forma dominante de conexión entre creadores y fans. Y estas plataformas utilizaron su poder para convertirse en los nuevos intermediarios — insertando publicidades y recomendaciones algorítmicas entre creadores y usuarios mientras se quedan con la mayor parte de los ingresos.\n\nLa buena noticia es que Internet está regresando a la visión original de Kelly. Muchos escritores top en Substack ganan más de lo que ganaban en sus trabajos asalariados. En Substack, con 1000 suscriptores a tu newsletter que paguen 10 dólares por mes, podrías ganar $100.000 por año como escritor.\n\n![Substack es una plataforma que permite a cualquiera crear y monetizar un newsletter.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Zg7UYDIWICJT8TYCudlYew.png)\n\nEl cripto, y específicamente los NFTs (tokens no fungibles) pueden acelerar la tendencia para que los creadores moneticen directamente a su base de fans.\n\nLas plataformas sociales seguirán siendo útiles para construir audiencias (aunque estas también probablemente debería ser reemplazadas por mejores alternativas), pero los creadores cada vez pueden confiar más en otros métodos como los NFTs para ganar dinero.\n\n**Los NFTs son registros realizados en un blockchain que representan alguna pieza de medios.** Estos medios pueden ser cualquier cosa digital: arte, videos, música, gifs, juegos, textos, memes y código.\n\nLos NFTs incluyen dentro de sí una documentación altamente confiable sobre su historia y origen, y pueden tener adosado un código que haga prácticamente cualquier cosa que sueñen sus desarrolladores (una características muy popular es unas líneas de código que permitan al creador original recibir regalías de las ventas secundarias).\n\nLa seguridad de los NFTs está garantizada por la misma tecnología que permitió al Bitcoin ser utilizado por cientos de millones de personas de todo el mundo y representar cientos de miles de millones de dólares de valor.\n\nRecientemente, los NFTs recibieron mucha atención por sus elevados volúmenes de ventas. En los últimos 30 días, hubo más de 300 millones de dólares de ventas de NFTs\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*LYv1hXuLMl_V1J4qWya4xg.png)\n\nEl cripto tiene un historial de ciclos de auge y derrumbe. Es muy probable que los NFTs también tengan sus alzas y bajas.\n\nSin embargo, hay tres razones importantes por las que los NFTs ofrecen condiciones mejores a las existentes para los creadores.\n\nLa primera, a la que nos referimos más arriba, es que **remueven a los intermediarios rentistas**. La lógica de las blockchains hace que, una vez que compraste un NFT, el control es tuyo, del mismo modo que cuando compras un libro o unas zapatillas en el mundo real.\n\nHay y seguirá habiendo plataformas y marketplaces de NFTs, pero estas tendrán limites en lo que pueden cobrar ya que la propiedad basada en blockchain pone el poder en manos de los creadores y de los usuarios. Si una plataforma cobra demasiado caro, los usuarios pueden mudarse fácilmente a otra, obligando al marketplace a reducir sus comisiones.\n\n(Nota que reducir las comisiones de intermediación puede tener un gran efecto multiplicador en el ingreso disponible del creador. Por ejemplo, si obtienes $100.000 en ingresos y tienes $80.000 en costos, reducir un 50% la comisión aumenta tu ingreso a $200.000, multiplicando tu ingreso disponible por 6, de $20.000 a $120.000).\n\nLa segunda forma en que los NFTs cambian la situación de los creadores es **habilitando la estratificación de precios de manera granular**.\n\nEn los modelos basados en la publicidad, los ingresos se generan de manera más o menos uniforme, sin importar cuál sea el entusiasmo del fan. Sin embargo, al igual que sucede con Substack, los NFTs permiten al creador “descremar” a los usuarios más apasionados, ofreciéndoles items especiales que son más caros.\n\nPero los NFTs van más allá que los productos del mundo no-cripto ya que pueden ser fácilmente divididos en una serie de estratos de precios decrecientes. Las tarjetas NBA Top Shot van de los $100.000 a unos pocos dólares.\n\n¿Eres fan del Bitcoin? Puedes comprar tanto o tan poco como quieras, hasta un nivel de detalle de 8 decimales, dependiendo de tu nivel de entusiasmo.\n\nLa granularidad fina del cripto permite capturar un área mucho más grande bajo la curva de demanda.\n\n![NBA Top Shot, un producto de la NBA que permite a los fans coleccionar jugadas históricas bajo la forma de NFTs.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*su7ETuFRNALht2b_nJu-ZA.jpeg)\n\nLa tercera forma (y la más importante) en que los NFTs cambian la ecuación de los creadores es **volviendo a los usuarios propietarios**, y reduciendo los costos de adquisición de clientes a casi cero. Las empresas tradicionales de Internet tienen grandes costos de adquisición de usuarios, que típicamente son gastos de publicidad o de equipos de ventas.\n\nEl cripto, por el contrario, ha crecido a más de un billón de dólares en capitalización de mercado prácticamente sin gasto de marketing. Bitcoin y Ethereum no tienen organizaciones detrás de ellos, y mucho menos presupuestos de marketing. Sin embargo, decenas de millones de personas los utilizan, poseen y aman.\n\nEl proyecto de NFT de mayores ingresos hasta la fecha, NBA Top Shot, ha generado $200 millones en ventas brutas solo el mes pasado, mientras que gasta muy poco en marketing. Ha sido capaz de crecer de manera tan eficiente porque los usuarios se sienten propietarios: tienen “la camiseta puesta”. Es un verdadero marketing de boca a boca, impulsado por la comunidad, el entusiasmo y la propiedad.", "timestamp": 1635375715, "digest": "l7gAsDcN98axczvWux0Lf-lTdFMouDBpxpIW62uO7Ww", "contributor": "0xf12C67e80E309eaC0c4dc18Fb26e68F9672297E9"}

Pensaba usarlo como depósito para una casa.\n\nUn día, cuando quiso revisar su wallet, hizo clic en un link fraudulento que lo condujo a un sitio de phishing. Un clon exacto del real.\n\nTenía 84 bitcoins y los estafadores transfirieron 83 de ellos. En aquel momento, en 2017, valían $475.000. Rastreamos los pagos en el blockchain. Vimos el dinero circulando entre diferentes wallets hasta que llegó a un monedero que tenía 15 millones de dólares en cripto.\n\nAunque no logramos identificar a los criminales, sí pudimos congelar las wallets. Al menos, les negamos el acceso a los fondos.\n\nNuestro cliente estaba furioso pero lo tomó con filosofía. Hoy, ese Bitcoin robado valdría £2,8 millones. Una vez que desapareció, se fue para siempre.\n\n## “Me compré un Bentley”\n\n*Javed Khan, trader independiente.*\n\nMi experiencia con el Bitcoin no empezó como una inversión. Al comienzo, fue una forma de transferir dinero más rápido que con los bancos.\n\nEn 2018, noté que el precio subía. Los restos de cripto que quedaban en mi wallet tras las transferencias habían llegado a un valor considerable. Esas ganancias me sorprendieron. Desde hacía tiempo sugería a mis amigos que utilizaran Bitcoin como herramienta para transferir dinero, pero nunca lo había pensado como una inversión.\n\nEn enero de 2020, retiré mis ganancias de Bitcoin y me compré un Bentley en Dubai, donde ahora vivo. Envié un video del showroom a mi madre. Estaba muy orgullosa.\n\nSólo invertiría dinero que pueda permitirme perder. Creo que el mejor momento para comprar Bitcoin es cuando nadie está hablando de él. Esperar que la euforia se calme.\n\n## “Mi factura de electricidad era de A$600 por mes cuando estaba minando Bitcoin’\n\n*Rohan Muscat, project manager e ingeniero eléctrico.*\n\nConocí el Bitcoin en 2010. Como soy un poco un geek del hardware, quise minarlo. A finales de 2016, me compré un par de tarjetas gráficas y me fue bien. Una startup para la que había hecho algo de consultoría me dio unos tokens Horizon State en parte de pago. En enero de 2017, esos tokens más los Bitcoin que había minado tenían un valor de unos A$40.000 (£22.000).\n\nDecidí hacer algo de trading y investigué el uso de bots, mientras me movía a minería de mayor escala. Al comienzo, me fue bien. Pero la rentabilidad empezó a caer hasta llegar al punto de equilibrio.\n\nMi factura de electricidad se disparó hasta A$500-A$600 por mes, porque el rig necesitaba mucha energía. Al final, terminé vendiendo los equipos de minería, y actualmente tengo unos A$2.000 en cripto.\n\nPodría haber ganado más si hubiese entrado y salido con frecuencia del mercado, pero no soporto los riesgos del trading.\n\n## “El Bitcoin me ayudó a comprar mi casa”\n\n*Daniel Crocker, comerciante.*\n\nEn 2012, estaba haciendo una pasantía en una empresa de tecnología. Durante el almuerzo, solíamos conversar sobre maneras de ganar algo de dinero adicional. Nadie había realmente escuchado sobre el Bitcoin pero decidimos intentarlo y estuvimos algunas semanas con él.\n\nNo duró mucho, pero afortunadamente no vendí lo mío. Los vendí finalmente el verano pasado y con eso conseguí la mitad del depósito para mi casa.\n\nTodavía tengo un poco. Igualmente, no es algo en lo que quiera apostar mi futuro. Conozco gente que se metió más a fondo. Pero yo creo que ya he tenido bastante suerte.", "timestamp": 1635375797, "digest": "tOIEs1JF9-ZVI9E277coHYrpLcre8qlcrwwJAUaV9B4", "contributor": "0xf12C67e80E309eaC0c4dc18Fb26e68F9672297E9"}

Esta diseñadora londinense de treinta y pico de años está £14.000 abajo en sus inversiones. A esto se suman otros £8.000 que ganó con bitcoin el año pasado, pero que luego perdió.\n\nNadie conoce las pérdidas de Noor. Por eso murmura.\n\n“Me siento tan estúpida”, dice. “No puedo hablar de esto con mis amigos. Ni con mi novio”. Noor no es su nombre real.\n\nEmpezó en noviembre de 2020, hacia la época de las elecciones presidenciales en Estados Unidos.\n\n“Todos esperaban una nueva victoria de Trump”, dice. “Era una época extraña, porque estábamos en medio de la pandemia”.\n\nEmpezó a leer sobre criptomonedas en línea. Mientras más leía, más avisos de plataformas de trading le aparecían en sus feeds de redes sociales. Por el Covid, Noor no había gastado mucho dinero ese año. Así que **compró £10.000 de bitcoin online, que a las pocas semanas se habían convertido en £18.700**.\n\n“Nunca había invertido antes”, dice.\n\nSe iba a dormir con el teléfono bajo la almohada y se despertaba en el medio de la noche para revisar el rendimiento de su inversión. (A diferencia de las acciones, los bitcoin pueden tradearse las 24 horas del día).\n\n“Me estaba friendo el cerebro”, dice. “Miraba el precio constantemente”. Lo único de lo que hablaba con su novio era de lo bien que estaba yendo su inversión.\n\n“Le decía: hoy gané £400”.\n\nNoor **empezó a fantasear con un futuro en el que no necesitaría una hipoteca ya que se volvería rica con sus inversiones**.\n\nCegada por el éxito, vendió su bitcoin y descargó la aplicación de bolsa Trading 212. Empezó a invertir en otras monedas y acciones: la criptomoneda Ripple; empresas de cannabis legal; Beyond Meat, un fabricante de sustitutos vegetales para la carne; BioNTech, una empresa alemana de biotecnología; negocios que desarrollan tecnología de edición de genes y medicina psicodélica.\n\nTras despertarse, miraba el canal de YouTube [FX Evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVTK81HQeAw), donde un trader australiano habla por horas de la actividad del mercado, mientras que inversores amateurs intercambian tips de trading en los comentarios.\n\nSe unió a un grupo de inversiones en la app de mensajería Discord. “Era una cosa social”, dice Noor. “Estar en ese grupo era el mejor momento de mi día”. Frecuentaba el foro de Reddit WallStreetBets (el mismo que, en enero, hizo subir la acción de GameStop, una cadena de videojuegos en graves dificultades financieras). Pero pasaba más tiempo en Twitter, que tiene una enorme comunidad de inversores. La totalidad de su feed se había vuelto sobre criptomonedas y acciones.\n\nAprendió el idioma de las “acciones meme”, la comunidad de inversores amateur que interactúan en plataformas de redes sociales para discutir sobre inversiones mientras intercambian memes: “a la luna”, seguido de un emoji de un cohete, que significa que el precio de una acción subirá; “manos de diamante” significa que hay que mantener una acción a pesar de la volatilidad del mercado.\n\n“Empecé a hablar como un mono”, dice. (“Mono” es lunfardo de internet para referirse a los inversores de retail).\n\nLlegó a un punto en que **ni siquiera podía leer un libro porque tenía que revisar su portafolios cada media hora**. “Tenía la mano derecha siempre junto al teléfono”, dice. “Mi novio la llama ‘mi mano de Wall Street’”.\n\nRápidamente, todo empezó a caerse a pedazos. Primero [Ripple se derrumbó](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-22/ripple-labs-executives-sued-by-sec-for-failing-to-register-xrp?sref=Xl91GI8N). Luego, en febrero, Noor entró demasiado tarde en la manía de GameStop y perdió aún más dinero.\n\n> *“Fue el peor momento”, dice. “No podía comer. Me lo pasaba mirando el teléfono”.*\n\nNoor pasaba aún más tiempo mirando recomendaciones de acciones online para tratar de recuperar algo del dinero perdido. Buscaba comprar lo que los demás estaban comprando en las apps de trading más populares. Para ese entonces, ya había dejado de jactarse de su éxito como inversora frente a su novio. Estaba demasiado avergonzada.\n\nParte del problema es que Noor no es una inversora por naturaleza. “No tengo paciencia”, dice. Pero más grave era el hecho de que **no tenía idea de lo que estaba haciendo**. Aunque podía utilizar palabras técnicas con fluidez, no entendía realmente su significado: vio la película [The Big Short,](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/21/the-big-short-review-steve-carell-ryan-gosling-2008-financial-crisis) pero no podía explicar qué era “shortear”. Tomaba sus decisiones de compra en base a lo que estaba de moda en el momento en Internet o en cómo se estaba sintiendo ese día.\n\nCuando hablamos, Noor había perdido su inversión inicial de £10.000, las £8.000 que ganó con el bitcoin y otras £5.000 más.\n\n**¿Ella lo percibe como especulación o inversión?** Tras una pausa, dice: “Lo veo como apostar”. Y, sin embargo, Noor todavía cree que puede encontrar un camino de salida. “Ahora creo que puedo invertir”, dice. “Pero no sé. Me costó mucho dinero. Si puedo recuperar algo, tal vez pueda encontrar la forma de salir”.\n\nParece desesperada. Por un lado, es consciente de su situación. Pero también sufre un autoengaño. **Como una jugadora de ruleta en una racha perdedora.**\n\nEl 2021 fue el año en que la gente común descubrió los mercados financieros. Una combinación entre el aburrimiento de la cuarentena, los generosos paquetes de estímulo que dieron algunos gobiernos y el evento de GameStop, **nunca hubo tanto dinero amateur en los mercados financieros**, ni tanto interés por las finanzas. Parece como si todo el mundo estuviera hablando de sus acciones y sus wallets de cripto.\n\nA la vanguardia de nueva comunidad de inversiones online están los jóvenes, las mujeres y las minorías.\n\nUn reciente informe de la [Financial Conduct Authority](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/23/new-breed-of-young-investors-taking-big-risks-warns-fca-bitcoin-foreign-exchange) encontró que las mujeres, los menores de 40 años y las minorías están alimentando este movimiento de “hágalo usted mismo”, invirtiendo en productos de alto riesgo como criptomonedas, forex y *contracts for difference* (CFD).\n\nEste último es un tipo de inversión donde uno apuesta sobre si un activo subirá o bajará entre el primer y el último trade del día (los CFD están prohibidos en Estados Unidos. Pero Noor también se atrevió a hacer trading de CFDs así como se atrevió a todo lo demás).\n\nEstos nuevos inversores, sigue el reporte, utilizan las redes sociales para buscar consejos, tienen exceso de confianza, invierten por la emoción del corto plazo más que por la ganancia del largo, y con frecuencia no entienden los riesgos que están corriendo.\n\nEl regulador está tan preocupado por el ingreso de estos inversores de retail al mercado de las criptomonedas que publicó una [advertencia](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/fca-warns-consumers-risks-investments-advertising-high-returns-based-cryptoassets) que avisa a los inversores de cripto de que “deben estar preparados para perder todo su dinero”.\n\n“Siempre es alentador ver a jóvenes inversores entrar al mercado y ganar una valiosa experiencia”, dice Susannah Streeter de la plataforma de inversiones Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\n> *“Pero me preocupa la combinación entre influencers de redes sociales y la facilidad con la que mucha gente puede usar apps de trading. Esto está haciendo que inversores novatos tomen decisiones especulativas de corto plazo, en lugar de pensar sus inversiones con un plan de largo plazo”.*\n\nStreeter dice que Hargreaves Lansdown experimentó un crecimiento de 57% en el uso de su app de inversiones en los últimos seis meses de 2020 comparado con el mismo período de 2019.\n\nSegún la firma de investigación de mercado Mintel, 11% de la Generación Z y 13% de los Millennials dicen que invertir en acciones será una prioridad una vez que termine la pandemia de Covid-19, comparado con solo 4% de la Generación X y 3% de los baby boomers.\n\n“Las criptomonedas y las plataformas de inversiones online se han convertido en íconos culturales”, dice Rich Shepherd de Mintel. “Esto y la naturaleza ‘primero digital’ de estos productos hace que resulten especialmente atractivos para los aficionados a la tecnología”.\n\nEl auge de app fáciles de usar como Trading 212 o eToro ha removido las barreras de entrada. Pero muchos de estos inversores están mal informados. “Escucho a mucha gente hablar de sus wallets de cripto”, me dice Streeter.\n\n> *“Yo les pregunto: ¿Qué hace esa moneda? ¿En qué blockchain está construida? ¿Cuál es su caso de uso? Me responden: ‘No lo sabemos. Pero está muy bien hecha’”.*\n\n![Trading 212. Una de las apps de trading de sencillo uso muy populares entre inversores de retail.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*DY32MRDqKqPrs-d5Xd1JWA.png)\n\nCuando hablo con Shane Blake, 26, un experto en marketing digital de Brighton, no está de buen humor. “Me siento mal por lo que hizo Elon”, dice. “Él sabe cómo sacar dinero directo de mi bolsillo. No es bonito despertarse, revisar tu balance y ver que has perdido £3.000”.\n\nSe refiere a un post en redes sociales en el que Musk [declara](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1392602041025843203%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fbusiness-57096305) que Tesla ya no aceptará pagos en bitcoin debido al alto uso de combustibles fósiles consumidos en transacciones con criptomonedas (la cantidad de electricidad utilizada tiene la misma [huella de carbono](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/27/bitcoin-mining-electricity-use-environmental-impact) que Argentina). Con ese mensaje, Elon Musk borró de un plumazo £7.000 del precio del bitcoin.\n\nBlake comenzó a invertir en bitcoin y en la criptomoneda Ether en enero. “Un amigo me contó cuánto dinero había ganado con bitcoin”, dice. “Cuando ves eso, te subes al tren. Puse los ahorros de toda mi vida en esto”.\n\nComo todos los jóvenes con quienes hablo, Blake trata de impresionarme con su conocimiento de términos técnicos financieros. Insiste en que sabe lo que está haciendo y que elige cuidadosamente sus inversiones.\n\n“Soy un inversor de Ethereum porque creo en el proyecto y sus fundamentals”, dice. Blake me pide no divulgar el valor de su portafolios, porque “el cripto puede convertirte en un objetivo” para hackers. Solo me dice que tiene más de £5.000 en inversiones.\n\nPor el momento le va bien. **“Tengo la garantía de que voy a ganar alrededor de £1.500 por semana por un tiempo indefinido”**, dice Blake con confianza. “Es sobrecogedor porque nunca había tenido tanto dinero en mi vida”. La semana después de que hablamos, el mercado global de cripto se derrumbó, en parte debido al endurecimiento de medidas por parte de los reguladores chinos.\n\n> *¿Adónde van estos jóvenes a buscar consejos de inversiones? A las redes sociales, por supuesto.*\n\nTikTok está lleno de “gurúes de las finanzas” que muestran gráficos de trading mientras escupen rápidamente palabras técnicas de finanzas. Inversores amateur se agrupan en comunidades de YouTube o pagan para entrar en grupos privados de Discord, donde se intercambian “señales” de qué acciones comprar.\n\nNinguna de esas comunidades ni influencers respetan las reglas de la FCA sobre dar asesoramiento financiero. “Hay un montón de tontos en un montón de apps hablando estupideces”, dice Banks.\n\nA los 20 años, este estudiante de la Universidad de Nottingham tiene 327.000 [seguidores en TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@pokubanks?lang=en), donde comparte videos sobre emprendedores, marketing de afiliados e inversiones. Banks siempre advierte en sus videos que no es un asesor financiero calificado y aconseja a sus seguidores a que hagan su propia investigación antes de invertir.\n\n“Mi principal ambición es que se enseñe finanzas personales en las escuelas” dice. “Esa es la razón por la que empecé a hacer contenido online”.\n\nBanks cree que la obsesión de su generación con las inversiones financieras es parcialmente resultado del Covid. “Cuando empezaron las cuarentenas, la gente aprendió que su trabajo no estaba seguro, y que debía generar una fuente alternativa de ingreso. Además, el cripto estaba en un boom y se estaban obteniendo rendimientos extraordinarios”.\n\nBanks también advierte sobre las manzanas podridas que proliferan en esta industria. “Hay gente que sirve platos que solo son información regurgitada de internet o que muestra un estilo de vida lujoso solo para obtener más vistas”.\n\nEn las redes sociales, traders de forex **posan con autos de lujo, con bolsas de dinero o con carteras de diseño en sus brazos**, promocionando cursos que prometen dar a sus seguidores las habilidades para volverse fabulosamente ricos como ellos.\n\nPero es muy difícil para un inversor de retail amateur darse cuenta de qué influencers tienen buenas intenciones y conocimiento, y cuáles son unos charlatanes.\n\nSon frecuentes los [esquemas de “pump and dump”](https://medium.com/astec/esquemas-de-pump-and-dump-una-nueva-ola-de-fraudes-en-cripto-5aca5a5a9dd1) donde “gurúes” de las inversiones compran acciones sin valor y luego buscan que sus seguidores inviertan en ellas para que suba el precio. Muchos de estos “gurúes” ganan su dinero vendiendo cursos en lugar de invirtiendo en el mercado.\n\n“Cada uno es responsable de sus decisiones. El que pone su dinero en la bolsa conoce los riesgos. Si no los conoces, es tu culpa”, dice [Stock Lizard King](https://twitter.com/StockLizardKing), un gurú de las inversiones online con 125.000 seguidores de Twitter y un servidor de Discord privado pago con 22.000 miembros. (Este trader de 25 años de Boston se niega a decirme su verdadero nombre).\n\nEn su comunidad, alienta a la gente a “jugar el juego lo mejor que puedas así no estás financieramente atrapado por toda tu vida”. Sin embargo, no tiene ninguna calificación para dar asesoramiento financiero ya que estudió marketing en la universidad.\n\n“Hay riesgos y tienes que ser consciente de ellos”, dice. “No puedes solo volcar los ahorros de tu vida en la bolsa y esperar ser rico al final del día. Tienes que desarrollar habilidades”.\n\nLo que está llevando a tantos jóvenes a abrazar la volatilidad de los mercados de cripto y acciones es la misma fuerza que hace que sus vidas sean incontrolables y caóticas. **Cuando tu futuro parece incierto e impredecible, con los sistemas financieros globales confabulados en tu contra, y con el fin de la promesa de movilidad social ascendente, ¿por qué no abrazar el riesgo?**\n\n“Es muy difícil prepararse para el futuro hoy en día”, dice Blake. “Nunca había sido tan difícil. La competencia es feroz. Todo el mundo tiene un título universitario, así que los títulos se han vuelto inútiles. Es muy difícil comprar una casa”.\n\nThe Lizard King ve a la educación universitaria como una estafa. “Me siento estafado por el sistema universitario”, dice. “Me gradué, pero todo este sistema está concebido para tenerte esclavo con deuda de estudios y deuda de tarjeta de crédito”.\n\nHay otro factor en la base de este interés especulativo por los mercados de criptomonedas: vivimos en una sociedad donde la recompensa monetaria se ha vuelto cada vez más desconectada de nuestro trabajo.\n\nLos freelancers trabajan 16 horas por día sin beneficios, mientras que el 1% se vuelve cada vez más rico. De acuerdo a la [Resolution Foundation](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2020/12/The-UKs-wealth-distribution.pdf), le tomaría más de 400 años al hogar mediano del Reino Unido ahorrar lo suficiente para alcanzar la riqueza promedio del 1% más rico de la población.\n\nLos miembros de comunidades negras, asiáticas y de otras minorías (la gente con mayor probabilidad de invertir en productos financieros riesgosos) ganan en promedio menos [que sus pares blancos](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/ethnicitypaygapsingreatbritain/2019), es [menos probable](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/housing/owning-and-renting/home-ownership/latest) de que sean dueños de sus casas y tienen una mayor probabilidad de [estar endeudados](https://www.ippr.org/blog/minority-ethnic-groups-face-greater-problem-debt-risk-since-covid-19). No es difícil entender por qué se sienten atraídos por las inversiones. Sus probabilidades de conseguir un trabajo bien pago y de comprar una casa son muy bajas.\n\nMientras tanto, las redes sociales abrieron las puertas del estilo de vida de los súper ricos. Una nueva ola de influencers de alto perfil como [Charli D’Amelio](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-9543861/TikToker-Charli-DAmelio-thanks-Gemini-Bitcoin-birthday-gift-celebrating-17th.html) en TikTok y [Jake Paul](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/02/17/exclusive-youtube-star-jake-paul-discussed-creating-own-cryptocurrency-as-bitcoin-and-dogecoin-mania-spreads/) en YouTube hablan de comprar cripto. “La cultura del influencer tuvo un fuerte impacto. La gente muestra sus vidas y riquezas en las redes y esto hace que todos quieran ser parte de eso”.\n\nAunque critica algunos aspectos de este “movimiento de hazte rico”, Banks en general lo aprueba. “Estoy a favor de la cultura de trabajar duro”, dice. “No voy a mentir: quiero ser rico”.\n\nAsí como las redes sociales crean una nueva mentalidad aspiracional, impulsando a los jóvenes a adquirir riquezas, también alimenta las decisiones de inversión arriesgadas. Estos inversores amateur ven tweets sobre una acción “yendo a la luna” y saltan a bordo.\n\n> *“Se trata del FOMO \\[el miedo a quedarse afuera\\]”, dice Streeter. “Algunos disfrutan de la emoción de la montaña rusa. Si es dinero que pueden permitirse perder, allá ellos. Pero el problema es que están invirtiendo dinero que no pueden permitirse perder”.*\n\nEl FOMO es parte del diseño mismo de las apps de inversión. Estas proveen foros donde los usuarios pueden intercambiar tips. En eToro, las acciones flashean en verde y rojo como las luces de un árbol de navidad, dependiendo cuál sea su rendimiento. “La experiencia de usuario de las apps te hace pensar: OK, todos están comprando esto. Así que quizá yo también debería comprarlo” dice Noor.\n\nEsto alimenta **la toma de decisiones de inversión más riesgosas y gobernadas por las emociones**.\n\nDe acuerdo a Streeter, “las plataformas de inversión más antiguas, como la nuestra, no ofrecen comunidades de chat que puedan alimentar un comportamiento de trading de corto plazo”.\n\nLa gamificación de las apps y de las plataformas de inversión genera un comportamiento parecido al de las apuestas. “En los últimos años, hemos visto una difuminación de los límites entre jugar, apostar e invertir”, dice [Matt Zarb-Cousin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/matt-zarb-cousin) de la Campaña por Apuestas Más Justas.\n\n“Las apuestas convencionales son más accesibles que nunca a través de los smartphones. Y también hay una línea borrosa entre las apuesta y esta versión gamificada de las inversiones a través de nuevas plataformas que han hecho muy sencillo que cualquiera se involucre en actividades como el day trading”.\n\n[Robinhood](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/30/does-robinhood-owe-too-much-to-its-rich-backers), una de las apps de trading más populares, actualmente [enfrenta una demanda judicial](https://www.ft.com/content/0e451231-fa4c-4686-bf2f-a5e107f337b9) en Massachusetts. El regulador argumenta que la plataforma alienta a traders sin experiencia a tomar decisiones riesgosas a través de la gamificación, enviando mensajes con emojis para estimular la compra de acciones y presentando sus productos de tal manera que generan una mentalidad de FOMO.\n\nBlake ha visto a varios de sus amigos volverse adictos al day trading, una forma de inversión de muy alto riesgo donde se busca ganar dinero comprando y vendiendo activos a medida que su precio cambia múltiples veces en un día, tratando de conseguir una pequeña ganancia en cada trade.\n\n“Yo no hago day trading” dice. “Es realmente adictivo: te crea hábitos parecidos a los de los jugadores. Tengo amigos cuyas vidas se vieron seriamente afectadas porque no podían despegarse de los gráficos”.\n\nTony Marini es un psicólogo en la clínica de rehabilitación Castle Craig de Peeblesshire, Escocia. Tres años atrás, empezaron a tratar gente con adicción a las criptomonedas. Desde aquel entonces, Marini trató a unos 30 clientes, la mayoría varones jóvenes, que se habían vuelto adictos al cripto.\n\n> *“Empieza como algo social”, dice Marini. “La gente se jacta del dinero que está ganando frente a sus amigos. Pero, por la culpa y la vergüenza, nunca cuentan cuando están perdiendo dinero”.*\n\nMarini recientemente trató a un hombre que perdió £1,5 millones en criptomonedas que se robó de su empresa. Otro paciente perdió casi £2 millones.\n\n“Conozco algunos traders cuyas parejas les sacan el teléfono y empiezan a temblar” dice. “Es el síndrome de abstinencia. No pueden no tener su teléfono delante de ellos”.\n\nLa volatilidad del cripto alimenta un comportamiento adictivo de una manera que las inversiones en bolsa no lo hacen. “Como sube y baja tanto, libera endorfinas, y funciona como un disparador emocional”, dice Marini.\n\nCuando a los inversores les está yendo bien, entran en lo que Marini llama “etapa ganadora”. “Y empiezan las fantasías: voy a pagar mi hipoteca, comprar una casa más grande, ayudar a mi familia y amigos…”. Muchos meten más dinero y se endeudan para invertir.\n\n“Luego empiezan a perder dinero”, dice. “Empieza el aislamiento. Empiezan a mentir. No pueden parar de apostar, así que se endeudan más, o hacen algo ilegal. Dejan de pagar las cuentas de la casa. Tienen sentimientos de culpa, verguenza o resentimiento. Empiezan a culpar a otros y a entrar en pánico”.\n\nPienso en Noor, unas semanas después de que hablamos. Para mi alivio, su situación parece haber mejorado: “Ya recuperé la mayor parte”, dice. Todavía tiene una deuda de £6.500, pero ha logrado evitar mayores pérdidas.\n\nEstá murmurando de nuevo — su novio no lo sabe. “Se supone que estamos ahorrando para una casa”, explica.\n\nAhora invierte en oro, plata y empresas farmacéuticas. Ha salido por completo del mercado de criptomonedas.\n\nEs muy franca sobre su experiencia. “No estoy enojada”, dice. “Es mi culpa”. Pero Noor sí culpa a las apps de inversiones por volverla adicta. “No voy a usar esas apps nunca más. Tienen costos ocultos y si mantienes las notificaciones activadas, te conviertes en su esclavo”.\n\nTambién abandonó la comunidad de [YouTube](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/youtube) tras desilusionarse con la habilidad del trader al que estaba siguiendo. “Siempre decía: sé de lo que estoy hablando. Me dijo que comprara más oro… justo antes de que se derrumbara”.\n\nNoor piensa quedarse con su actual portafolios por un largo tiempo, invertir en empresas en las que cree y dejar de revisar sus inversiones constantemente. En otras palabras, se ha vuelto una inversora, en lugar de una especuladora. “No creo que lo haya dominado” dice. “No creo que nadie pueda dominarlo. Pero mi error fue escuchar a gente que decía que lo había dominado”.\n\nPor cada Noor que abandona la fiebre del oro para buscar ganancias más lentas y estables, hay incontables jóvenes que entran en cripto siguiendo la promesa de un atajo para salir de la carrera de ratas, de un trabajo aburrido y de la deuda de estudios.\n\nQuieren hacerse ricos en los mercados de bolsa digitales.\n\nLa rueda de la ruleta gira y las notificaciones hacen “ping”.

Brian, un trader de 33 años que nos pide que usemos solo su nombre de pila, reacciona rápidamente, ingresando su análisis en un grupo de chat de la aplicación de mensajería Telegram.\n\nHa identificado el giro descendente distintivo de una “formación de cuña descendente”. Para los que están en el negocio, esto significa: *El precio está cayendo a una tasa decreciente, y ahora debería dirigirse hacia la luna.*\n\nUn breve boletín con este pronóstico aparece en las pantallas de los teléfonos móviles de los aproximadamente 300 traders del grupo de trading VIP de Brian, “WhaleTank”. Cada uno de sus miembros paga mucho dinero para recibir los consejos de Brian las 24 horas del día y, literalmente, seguir cada uno de sus movimientos.\n\nPor un precio de 0,1% de Bitcoin por mes (unos $90, al momento de escribir este artículo), los miembros de WhaleTank pueden programar sus bots de trading para copiar las operaciones de Brian. Él es la marea que levanta todos los barcos… o, si se equivoca, el remolino que los hunde.\n\nAfortunadamente, es un “muy buen trader”, dice un seguidor conocido solo como “Adrenalin”.\n\nBrian pertenece a un grupo clandestino, en gran parte anónimo, de traders de criptomonedas de alto calibre que buscan fortuna en los mercados de cripto escasamente regulados y muy manipulados.\n\nSi bien las grandes tendencias del precio son marcadas por los grandes fondos, miles (o millones) de traders existen en los márgenes, trabajando desde casas en Miami Beach, sombrías habitaciones de Glasgow o torres en Kiev, en un mundo financiero lejos de Wall Street.\n\nEn lugar de mantener sus posiciones en el largo plazo, estos traders operan con las alzas y bajas, obteniendo ganancias cuando el mercado sube y también cuando baja.\n\n> Si eres un trader talentoso, ¿por qué molestarte con un banco de inversión o un hedge fund cuando puedes tradear con un apalancamiento de 100x (léase: muy peligroso) en BitMEX y obtener todos tus consejos de trading en Discord?\n\nLas reglas normales no aplican en el mundo de las criptomonedas. En los mercados bursátiles, los traders hacen predicciones analizando los “fundamentals”, la realidad detrás de la valuación de una compañía. Siguen las noticias, llaman al CEO y duermen con el pasante. No se puede hacer eso con el Bitcoin, o en los mercados de “altcoins” descaradamente no regulados, donde monedas inservibles con nombres como “morguecoin” se crean ad infinitum.\n\nLa creencia entre muchos traders es que los movimientos de precios en estos mercados rara vez reflejan una realidad más profunda: sólo revelan los movimientos frenéticos de los traders.\n\n“Nadie puede observar la P y la L de ‘The Bitcoin Company’”, dice Scott Melker, un DJ de 43 años devenido en trader bajo el nombre de “Wolf of all Streets” en Twitter, donde tiene más de 70.000 seguidores. Las criptomonedas suben y bajan porque la gente las compra y las vende, dice. ¿Y por qué la gente las compra y las vende? Porque otra gente las compra y las vende. “Es la máxima profecía autocumplida”, dice.\n\nEste ritmo salvaje de compra y venta comienza a formar patrones predecibles, que pueden entenderse a través del **análisis técnico**, o TA, la práctica de leer gráficos.\n\n![“Análisis Técnico de los Mercados Financieros”, el tradicional libro introductorio de John Murphy.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*3FJeX6TndeuIDb8oK3B1gQ.jpeg)\n\nMelker es un ávido fanático: todas las noches, después de un día de vida relativamente normal, haciendo rondas en el circuito de conferencias de criptomonedas (ahora relegado en gran medida a Zoom), escribiendo artículos en newsletters, publicando en Twitter, relajándose con sus hijos — busca un gráfico en su computadora y comienza a buscar patrones, especialmente aquellos que lo alertan sobre “las emociones humanas en los traders: dónde van a ser codiciosos y dónde el dinero inteligente se aprovechará de su miedo”.\n\nPodría tratarse de cualquier moneda, no importa. “Podrían estar curando el cáncer o podría estar dando cigarrillos a niños en África”, se ríe. “No lo sabría”.\n\nMelker se pasea por Discord, Twitter y Reddit, buscando señales. Los patrones que rastrea todos los días están en garabatos superpuestos frenéticamente en gráficos con nombres que suenan a tácticas militares: “formación de cuña móvil”, “doble techo”, “formación de copa y asa”.\n\nCuando descubre una oportunidad (digamos que Thorecoin está en una tendencia alcista más allá de su precio de soporte de $0,00034) planifica una operación y activa una alarma.\n\nA veces, toma las predicciones del gráfico al pie de la letra. Pero normalmente no le gustan las predicciones astrológicas. (“El patrón no funciona porque sea el ‘flujo natural de la naturaleza’”, dice. “Esos patrones funcionan porque todos los están mirando”).\n\nLo más probable es que participe en una especie de metajuego: hacer predicciones basadas en la credulidad de aquellos que creen que el análisis técnico habla de algún tipo de principio cósmico inefable. Si todo el mundo está mirando la misma línea en un gráfico, dice: “Se convierte en algo real, el precio se dispara, y dices ‘¡Dios mío! El análisis técnico funciona muy bien’”.\n\nSi tiene suerte, entonces cobrará en dólares.\n\n“No me interesa tener decenas de millones de dólares en bitcoins”, dice Melker, quien cree en la promesa de la tecnología pero no es un evangelista. “Tengo que vender mis bitcoins por dólares reales. Mucha gente piensa que son traders profesionales, pero no obtienen beneficios en dólares. La parte más importante de ser un trader es que tienes que hacer sonar la caja registradora”.\n\nTradeando solo diez minutos al día, Melker vive la vida un poco más plenamente que algunos otros.\n\n![Una figura de Cruz Dorada, típica del análisis técnico.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*f1RyQe70WtVI22-LKpABIw.jpeg)\n\n“Young Tilopa”, un trader con sede en Glasgow, se levanta todos los días a las 7am, se ducha, pasea a su perro, se toma un café, abre una aplicación llamada Sierra Charts y se pasa el resto del día mirando gráficos sin pestañear.\n\nLa mayoría de los gráficos son de color negro o gris opaco, atravesados por zig-zags blancos salvajes que pulsan de forma arrítmica, como señales en un monitor de latidos.\n\n“Es una profesión lamentable”, dice, y comenta que muchos de sus colegas traders son hombres solteros y bastante solitarios de entre veinte y treinta años. (Muchos de ellos son estudiantes de su curso de trading, uno de sus pocos respiros del… trading).\n\nLos operadores a menudo son súper inteligentes y afilados, dice, pero a la manera tragicómica de Internet: sus bromas desmienten la desolación esencial de sus vidas.\n\n“Esencialmente, eres un trader independiente sentado en tu habitación todo el día, mirando gráficos y, a veces, piensas: ‘¿Qué diablos estoy haciendo?’”, dice. “A veces no tiene sentido, no estás interactuando con nadie”. (El COVID-19, como podrá imaginar, no ha hecho mucha diferencia en sus vidas).\n\nTilopa, cuyo seudónimo remite al de un monje budista del siglo XI, tiene un enfoque zen del trading. Analiza los “eventos técnicos”, cambios de mercado determinados por idiosincrasias en las plataformas de trading. A diferencia de otros, no se limita a predecir: busca comprender la “microestructura del mercado, cómo se mueve el mercado”, dice.\n\nDurante años, Tilopa absorbió volúmenes de artículos académicos sobre la dinámica del mercado. Uno de sus “eventos técnicos” favoritos para explotar involucra el *stop-loss*. Cuando un trader coloca un stop loss, le está diciendo al exchange: “¡Oye, si el precio cae por debajo de X, vende todas mis tenencias! ¡No quiero ser aniquilado si el mercado se derrumba!”.\n\nEs una cosa puramente técnica: un comando para un algoritmo. Pero el uso de stop-loss, dice Tilopa, es traicionado por la codicia: en momentos de gran optimismo, los traders ávidos de ganancias reducen sus stop-loss cada vez más… y luego, si es su día desafortunado y los mercados entran en caída libre, los stop-loss se activarán y sus activos serán vendidos.\n\nTilopa simplemente navega por entre las olas que se levantan a raíz de estos movimientos. Mientras tanto, las “ballenas” acechan en las profundidades, haciendo temblores. Son traders inmensamente ricos, caprichosos y anónimos. Tienen una cuota de mercado tan grande que pueden doblegarlo a voluntad.\n\nSe dice que muchos de ellos viven en un inframundo criminal y que usan una criptomoneda denominada en dólares llamada “Tether” porque no pueden acceder a dólares reales. Y se aprovechan de los débiles.\n\nAl observar una gran cantidad de stop-loss, por ejemplo, una ballena puede estrellar deliberadamente el mercado por debajo del umbral y beneficiarse de la derrota resultante. Este movimiento se conoce como la “cacería de stop-loss”. Ciertamente depredador.\n\nCon tantas ballenas dando vueltas, los traders deben tener cuidado. Joe McCann, un ejecutivo de Microsoft que opera de noche como trader de criptomonedas, sabe que bajar la guardia podría costarle caro. Para defenderse, ha diseñado y programado un sistema de gestión de riesgos totalmente automatizado que “supervisa mis posiciones cuando no estoy en el exchange”, dice. “Si mi portafolios alguna vez explota, entonces es 100% culpa mía”.\n\nEn el trading de cripto, la disciplina es clave. “La mejor forma de saber qué técnicas usar es estudiar pacientemente tu carácter, emociones y maneras de pensar”, dice Luis J. Sarmiento, de 23 años, basado en Venezuela y cofundador de AltSignals, un grupo de trading de Telegram que cobra $107 por mes a sus más de 40.000 miembros.\n\nSarmiento dice que ha obtenido ganancias de 529% desde comienzos de 2018. Aprendió “El Camino” de un veterano que, una vez que terminó su entrenamiento, simplemente se desvaneció en el aire, como Yoda. (“Conocí a mi maestro de trading en un foro en 2016”, dijo. “Nunca supe su nombre. Y en 2017, simplemente no se volvió a conectar al chat”).\n\nPara los pocos que son lo suficientemente disciplinados/afortunados (un número cada vez más pequeño de personas) como señalan los traders, la rareza de los mercados de criptomonedas también puede hacer que el día a día sea emocionante, aunque financieramente letal.\n\nLos traders hablan con especial cariño de lo que ellos llaman oportunidades “criptográficas nativas”, operaciones que serían imposibles en los principales mercados financieros. McCann, por ejemplo, está intrigado por los **préstamos flash basados en criptomonedas que se originan y reembolsan instantáneamente**. Un trader con la suficiente confianza en sí mismo puede pedir uno de estos préstamos, usarlo para tradear, obtener ganancias y devolverlo inmediatamente. Tal cosa es inconcebible en los mercados financieros tradicionales.\n\nImagina la situación: pides prestado, digamos, $1 millón de Wells Fargo. Lo inviertes todo en la bolsa y luego, de alguna manera, en unos pocos milisegundos, generas suficiente dinero para devolverlo todo y obtener una ganancia masiva. Imposible.\n\nSin embargo, en el mundo cripto, un trader realmente consiguió esto, absorbiendo $350.000 del exchange descentralizado BZX, en cuestión de segundos. ¿La parte más increíble? **Si el trade hubiese fracasado, el préstamo nunca se habría producido.** La cadena de bloques simplemente no lo habría registrado.\n\n“Realmente no existe una analogía del mundo real” para los flash loans, señala Nic Carter, socio de Castle Island Ventures. “Quizás es por eso que la gente está tan fascinada con ellos”.\n\nSi bien el trading de cripto es un negocio arriesgado, para algunos es simplemente… un negocio. Vestido con una camisa blanca impecable y pantalones sin arrugas, Brian llega todos los días a su oficina de Kiev.\n\nCon su equipo de analistas, utilizan complicados modelos estadísticos elaborados a partir de una variedad de fuentes: datos históricos, indicadores secretos e información sobre los traders competidores. (Incluso los traders de segunda categoría pueden ofrecer valiosas “contra señales”, dice. “Para ser lo más preciso posible, hay que tener en cuenta todos los factores y analizar todos los indicadores”).\n\nLas paredes de la oficina están amarillentas y gastadas; una computadora con seis pantallas de 3,6 gigahertz mira fijamente a los traders, parpadeando con actualizaciones de nanosegundos.\n\nLa “salsa secreta” es recopilar todos los datos crudos que sea posible. Brian se jacta de una precisión asombrosa en sus predicciones, de más del 90 por ciento. “Nuestras predicciones de precios son correctas hasta el dólar de precisión”, dice. Su análisis “va mucho más profundo que el del trader promedio: retrocedemos mucho en el tiempo en el gráfico, años, décadas”.\n\nLos máximos son altos, los mínimos son bajos. Brian recuerda una semana excelente en la que convirtió $15.000 en Bitcoin en $60.000. “Acerté en todos y cada uno de los trades esa semana”, recuerda. (Aunque, agrega, “lo perdí todo en los meses siguientes”).\n\nA veces no funciona del todo. Como aquella vez en que convirtió $200.000 en $30.000 en cuestión de días. Aunque esto, explica, fue mucho antes de que la curva en forma de palo de hockey del Bitcoin llegara a $20.000 en 2017, cuando la mayoría compraba y mantenía el activo. Eso los dejó a merced de las fuerzas del mercado, dice. “Solo holdeabamos bitcoin como creyentes, no era tan inmune como lo soy hoy”. (Aunque el registro muestra que la gente estaba haciendo análisis técnico de bitcoin al menos desde 2011).\n\nAhora, Brian juega con el mercado… de manera obsesiva. Aunque está operando su negocio con una pérdida del 100% (aproximadamente $10.000 por mes de ingresos y $20.000 de gastos, la mayor parte en marketing), opera tan cerca a 24/7 como es humanamente posible. Lo mueve la pasión y, a diferencia de la bolsa tradicional, los mercados no cierran nunca. “Para obtener buenos resultados debes amar el activo y seguirlo 24/7” dice. “Mucha gente se enamoró del Bitcoin y abre su gráfico de precio cada 10 minutos. Nunca vas a ver algo así con las acciones tradicionales”.\n\nActualmente, Brian está trabajando en un trade altamente complejo vinculado con el evento de “halving” previsto para el 11 de mayo. Se espera que ese evento (tras el cual la emisión de nuevos Bitcoin caerá abruptamente) cause un fuerte crecimiento en la demanda y un aumento de precio en el largo plazo.\n\nLos creyentes respaldan su convicción con elaboradas teorías de oferta y demanda, y señalan que aumentos similares siguieron después de los halvings anteriores. Y parece bastante esperanzador: el precio de Bitcoin ha aumentado constantemente durante los últimos días, como si la emoción aumentara constantemente…\n\nPero Brian miró los gráficos y llegó a una conclusión muy diferente. Probablemente será un caso de “comprar con el rumor, vender con las noticias”, imagina: un frenesí breve y autocumplido, causado por personas que compran lo que creen que será un \\*rally \\*impulsado por los fundamentals, seguido de una caída en picada a medida que los ganadores liquidan sus ganancias.\n\nNo solo los datos sobre los halvings anteriores respaldan esta hipótesis, dice (a las 3 de la madrugada de un miércoles), sino que los patrones en los gráficos que siguen el prodigioso aumento actual del precio del Bitcoin tampoco presagian nada bueno.\n\nBrian me entrega este diagnóstico:\n\n“*Estoy viendo divergencias bearish en los gráficos de 4H, sobrecomprado en el gráfico de 1D… Y la nube de Ichimoku sólo va a darnos esa cruz bullish una vez que el precio haya hecho la corrección… Por lo tanto, puedo decir que vamos a tener una corrección, lo más probable, hasta 0.3fib…”*\n\n\\*\\*Traducción: \\*\\*Brian se refiere a dos marcos temporales diferentes en el gráfico, uno que muestra los movimientos de precios en conjuntos de 4 horas (4H) y otro que los muestra en conjuntos de un día (1D).\n\nCada uno de esos marcos temporales da un sentido diferente a la trayectoria: el marco de 4H muestra una “divergencia bearish”, evidencia de que el aumento de precio no va tan bien como se esperaba, y que podría haber una reversión pronto.\n\nEl marco de 1D señala que la tasa a la que está subiendo el precio es demasiado alta en comparación con \\*rallies \\*históricamente exitosos. Eso es lo que significa “sobrecomprado”: un gran número de gente compró, y ese aumento de precio podría no durar demasiado.\n\nTras analizar analizar esas señales, Brian dibujó dos líneas y coloreó la figura que se formó. Si el precio cae por debajo de esa figura (conocida como “nube de Ichimoku” en honor al periodista japonés que la inventó en la década de 1930) espera que cualquier tendencia emergente bullish tenga una duración limitada.\n\nEsto, desafortunadamente, es lo que está ocurriendo. Pero, crucialmente, también tiene la intuición de que en \\*este \\*halving los fundamentals son más fuertes que de costumbre — esto es, los cambios en la vida real detrás de los movimientos de precios son lo suficientemente tangibles como para que la mera lectura de los gráficos sea insuficiente.\n\nPor una vez, Bitcoin está sujeto a un cambio cuantificable y fácilmente visible en su emisión. Eso ha provocado que las predicciones de Brian fallen con más frecuencia de lo habitual en las últimas semanas. Hay fuerzas externas en juego.\n\n![Un ejemplo de la “nube de Ichimoku”, un indicador técnico que se utiliza para evaluar tendencias y futuras zonas de soporte y resistencia. Fuente: Investopedia.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*jU-JwOOWMS9u6YwiflqC0A.png)\n\nEl análisis técnico está lejos de ser infalible. Los traders admiten que esta disciplina es más útil como una “herramienta de gestión de riesgos”, una forma de evitar las pérdidas más dramáticas. Pero considerar la lectura de gráficos como una ciencia exacta, en general, es controvertido.\n\nLos científicos “duros” señalan una distinción epistémica entre los modelos económicos que emplean los traders de criptomonedas y los que utilizan los físicos o químicos. Estos últimos basan sus predicciones en modelos cuidadosamente controlados con el objetivo de aproximarse a la estructura de la realidad.\n\nLos analistas técnicos, por el contrario, solo pueden utilizar la “inducción pura”, modelos basados en tendencias pasadas cuyos resultados futuros no pueden garantizarse: el hecho de que una formación de Cruz Dorada haya dado lugar a un repunte alcista las últimas doce veces no significa que sucederá de nuevo.\n\nEs como conducir su automóvil “usando solo el espejo retrovisor”, como lo puso una persona en Reddit.\n\nEl escritor y ex trader de opciones Nassim Taleb, en su libro “*¿Existe la Suerte?*”, argumentó que los analistas técnicos son víctimas de la lógica circular del “sesgo de supervivencia”: **dicen que es útil porque les funciona. ¿Y aquellos para quienes no funciona? ¡No lo están haciendo correctamente!**\n\nPor desgracia, muchos terminan en la indigencia. Escribe Taleb: “Se dice que los vendedores de opciones comen como pollos y van al baño como elefantes”: pequeñas ganancias, inmensas y ruinosas pérdidas.\n\n![“¿Existe la Suerte?”, del ex trader de opciones Nicholas Nassim Taleb.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*18cSt_YfxzeEnxHgJPmc5A.jpeg)\n\nDe manera similar, Brian observa la prevalencia del “sesgo de confirmación” entre los traders. “Es fácil encontrar señales bajistas y alcistas en los gráficos, y los operadores a menudo eligen la que está más alineada con sus emociones”, dice.\n\nPeor aún, a través del mismo proceso del mercado, los traders de criptomonedas a menudo terminan disrumpiendo los mismos sistemas que están tratando de observar. Sus propias intervenciones, a diferencia de las de los científicos, no se pueden controlar y se propagan a un sistema caótico que responde al mismo acto de intentar predecirlas.\n\nPero estas críticas no atraviesan la gruesa piel de los traders de cripto; de hecho, existe un amplio consenso de que, aunque estas preocupaciones son legítimas, difícilmente son terminales.\n\nComo ocurre con muchas otras cosas en el mundo de las criptomonedas, los mismos elementos que hacen al trading tan atractivo para los especuladores (volatilidad salvaje) también lo hacen atractivo para personas con escasa conciencia ética.\n\nMelker cita un ejemplo de un fraude frecuente en los grupos pagos de Telegram.\n\n“Hay jugadores que literalmente manipulan los gráficos con sus órdenes”, dice. “Un líder \\[del grupo de Telegram\\] dice: ‘Estoy siguiendo esta moneda, está a punto de estallar’. Y luego estalla, porque él la compró”.\n\n“Es dinero garantizado, siempre”.", "timestamp": 1635376165, "digest": "m0rFtODKdjbBP3cQCwhcPTRRKr_5sHz9O8UFgvPkybQ", "contributor": "0xf12C67e80E309eaC0c4dc18Fb26e68F9672297E9"}

Pero eso no significa que irán a ningún lado…\n\n*Esta es una versión traducida y adaptada del artículo “[What Will Happen to Ethereum Miners After ETH 2.0?](https://decrypt.co/74262/what-happens-ethereum-miners-after-eth-2)” publicado por Jeff Benson el 25 de junio de 2021 en Decrypt.*\n\n[Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/crypto-news/ethereum), como el [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/crypto-news/bitcoin), utiliza un proceso intensivo en energía conocido como “minería” para crear y distribuir nuevas monedas. Las [miles de personas](https://www.ethernodes.org/) de todo el mundo que lo hacen posible, conocidas como *mineros*, operan millones de dólares en equipos en una carrera por resolver problemas computacionales y ganar ETH, la criptomoneda nativa de la red.\n\nSin embargo, en algún momento del próximo año, Ethereum sufrirá una actualización que cambiará drásticamente la forma de operación de la red y el mecanismo de creación del ETH. Cuando esto ocurra, la minería de Ethereum se volverá algo del pasado.\n\nPero, ¿adónde irán todos los mineros de Ethereum?\n\n## La Prueba\n\nCuando el paper del Bitcoin fue publicado en 2008, proponía el uso de un concepto criptográfico para lograr que una red descentralizada fuese segura para enviar fondos: el [Proof of Work](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-proof-of-work-how-the-bitcoin-network-is-maintained) (PoW).\n\nEl [blockchain](https://decrypt.co/resources/blockchain-basics-what-is-blockchain) de Ethereum, lanzado en 2015, utiliza el mismo protocolo de consenso.\n\nEs una forma de asegurarse de que las computadoras lleguen a un acuerdo permanente sobre las transacciones y el estado de la base de datos. Esto permite evitar ataques en que los mismos fondos sean gastados más de una vez.\n\nLa utilización del poder de cómputo para asegurar la red consume mucha electricidad. Y esta es una crítica que los grupos ambientalistas habitualmente esgrimen contra las criptomonedas.\n\n\\*\\*Los core developers de Ethereum trabajaron en cambiar el protocolo de consenso de la red desde el Proof of Work (PoW) al **[Proof of Stake](https://decrypt.co/resources/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)** (PoS). \\*\\*Este último requiere una cantidad de electricidad considerablemente menor mientras que también permite una escala muy superior de transacciones.\n\nEsa red, llamada [Ethereum 2.0](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-2-0), mantendrá su seguridad gracias a que los usuarios depositarán sus tokens en garantía. Los ataques son prevenidos porque los agentes maliciosos o ineptos perderán sus tokens depositados.\n\nCuando la actual cadena de PoW se “fusione” con la cadena de PoS y nazca Ethereum 2.0, la minería será apagada. El core developer Tim Beiko dijo a Decrypt, “Los mineros deberían intentar lograr su rentabilidad antes de eso”.\n\n¿Pero donde irán después?\n\n## La Fusión\n\nMichael Carter, un minero de cripto y anfitrión del canal de YouTube [BitsBeTrippin’](https://www.bitsbetrippin.io/), no cree que haya una disminución sustantiva de la minería antes de “la fusión”.\n\nCarter ha corrido algunos números para calcular la rentabilidad de la minería de Ethereum en los próximos meses con 10 escenarios distintos (alto precio y alto volumen, alto precio y bajo volumen, etc.). Aunque, en líneas generales, es un legal seguidor de Ethereum, está dispuesto a cambiar sus recursos de minería a otra cadena si esto resulta más rentable.\n\nPero no tiene apuro. Los mineros con un buen flujo de caja también pueden permitirse jugar el juego de largo plazo holdeando Ether y esperando a que suba.\n\nTras la fusión, cree que los mineros “agnósticos entre blockchains” tendrán dos opciones sencillas: “Ahora, parece que las opciones son Ethereum Classic o Ravencoin”, dijo a Decrypt.\n\nEthereum Classic, que tenía una capitalización de mercado de $4,7 mil millones el 22 de junio, es la otra cadena que emergió del hard fork de la red de Ethereum en 2016. Ravencoin, que tenía un valor de mercado de $436 million el 22 de junio y un precio de $0,05, es el activo nativo de una red que permite transferir activos tanto físicos como digitales.\n\nNinguna es tan conocida o utilizada como Ethereum. Pero no importa. Lo importante es que, como en Ethereum, sus tokens puedan minarse con equipos que utilizan unidades de procesamiento gráfico (GPUs). Los mineros de ASIC, o circuitos integrados de aplicación específica, son más potentes, pero Ethereum utiliza un algoritmo que elimina casi toda su ventaja.\n\nDe esta forma, los mineros de GPU tienen una estrategia de salida. Los mineros de ASIC, por el contrario, tienen un camino más duro por delante.\n\n“Hay una cantidad importante de mineros de ASIC en Ethereum que tienen todo por perder”, dice Carter. “No tienen ningún lado adonde ir”.\n\nComo lo puso un comentarista de [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lm83xd/what_will_happen_to_asic_miners_after_eth_20/): “Van a ser INÚTILES”.\n\n## La Resistencia\n\nAunque Carter y otros no necesariamente vayan a saltar del barco antes de Ethereum 2.0, esto no significa que todos los mineros estén felices.\n\nEn julio, el blockchain de Ethereum atraviesa una actualización importante que altera cómo (y cuánto) se les paga a los mineros. **El “London Hard Fork” incluye el [Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559](https://decrypt.co/73997/ethereum-upgrade-reduce-eth-supply-moves-final-stages)**, que automatiza la cantidad de gas (léase: comisiones) que pagan los usuarios de la red… y la quema.\n\nLos fees de transacción en ETH ya no irán a los mineros sino que se transformarán en cenizas de dinero digital al ser enviados a una dirección a la que nadie puede acceder.\n\nDesde este cambio, los mineros sólo obtienen como recompensa el ETH recientemente creado. Mientras que quienes apoyan al EIP-1559 sostienen que esto beneficia a todos porque la reducción en la oferta de ETH aumentará el precio, no todos los mineros lo ven de esta forma.\n\nDistintos pools de minería han llegado a diferentes conclusiones. Algunos lo apoyan y otros lo rechazan.\n\nEl EIP-1559 es el comienzo de la cuenta regresiva hacia Ethereum 2.0 porque es el punto a partir del cual los mineros podrían empezar a abandonar la red. Pero, al hacerlo, también podrían perder mucho dinero.\n\n“Si los mineros se van antes de la fusión, entonces el hashrate sería más bajo y los otros mineros serían más rentables” Beiko dijo a *Decrypt*. En otras palabras, si hay menos gente minando, se volvería más fácil obtener el ETH para aquellos que se queden.\n\nDada la escala de la minería, que debe estar bien distribuida para mantener la seguridad de la red, esto no representa necesariamente un riesgo.\n\n“Necesitamos *algunos* mineros hasta el momento de la fusión, pero no es necesariamente un riesgo de seguridad si la cantidad empieza a reducirse lentamente antes de ese momento”, dijo Beiko. “La mayoría de los mineros ya han pagado por su infraestructura, así que tienen un incentivo a minar hasta el último bloque, dado que su costo fijo ya ha sido gastado”.\n\nAunque es posible que algunos grupos de minería con equipos anticuados “salten del barco” a medida que se acerque la fusión, según Will Foxley de [Compass Mining](https://compassmining.io/): “Muchos creen que en realidad habrá una gran actividad de minería antes de la fusión porque los mineros van a querer conseguir cuanto Ether sea posible antes de que la fusión ocurra, sabiendo que la fusión aumentaría el precio del Ether”.\n\n## ¿Quién Está Listo?\n\n“Todos saben que esto va hacia el Proof of Stake”, dijo Carter. Pero algunos han hecho más que otros para prepararse.\n\n“Los pools de mayor performance se han estado preparando para este evento desde hace años”, dijo Foxley. Por ejemplo, [F2Pool](https://www.f2pool.com/), el segundo pool de minería más grande de Ethereum, ya puso en marcha un pool de validación para Ethereum 2.0.\n\nTal vez no sea sorprendente que F2Pool haya apoyado la propuesta EIP-1559 en enero, apuntando al precio creciente del ETH a lo largo del tiempo, incluso aunque las recompensas de bloque se hayan reducido.\n\nAdemás, “JK”, de F2Pool, [escribió](https://f2pool.io/mining/insights/20210225-staying-on-the-bright-side-of-history-eip-1559/#:\\~:text=For%20applications%20and%20users%2C%20EIP,the%20hopes%20of%20getting%20included.): “Ya nos han dado una costosa lección de las ramificaciones de no ponernos del lado de los usuarios y de los desarrolladores clave. Tras el hard fork de The DAO, los principales desarrolladores y colaboradores han estado consistentemente construyendo sobre la blockchain de Ethereum actual, ayudándola a prosperar y crecer hasta su estado actual”.\n\nEthereum Classic, por el contrario, tuvo un desarrollo mucho más lento. Y no quiere ser dejado de lado de nuevo.\n\n[SparkPool](https://www.sparkpool.com/intro), que controla alrededor de un cuarto del hashrate (esto significa que es capaz de minar uno de cada cuatro bloques), se opone al EIP-1559, al que acusa de “distribución de la riqueza” y “tiranía de la mayoría”.\n\nDe acuerdo a Foxley, SparkPool también está “agresivamente contra” la fusión. Pero, dice: “No creo que haya mucho que puedan hacer para evitarlo, y creo que lo saben”.\n\nEsto es verdad, pero no del todo. Según Beiko, los mineros de ETH podrían simplemente crear un fork de Ethereum que no se convierta en Proof of Stake y crear “Ethereum Classic 2”.\n\nPero es más probable que SparkPool y otras, con el tiempo, acaben adaptándose a los nuevos cambios del protocolo de Ethereum. Si no lo hacen, probablemente quedarán rezagadas.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*nsFLej7HfE2g80C77T4BJQ.png)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635376222, "digest": "WbQsEqEGfpmIkLkzo1kpE3S7YVwiIWAIcwFL8lbHdFY", "contributor": "0xf12C67e80E309eaC0c4dc18Fb26e68F9672297E9"}

En la versión cinematográfica de Scorsese sobre sexo, drogas y acciones, se llama “pump and dump”. En la industria actual de las criptomonedas, se conoce como “rug pull”.\n\nMaxamus cree que sufrió un rug pull hace unos meses en un dudoso activo digital llamado Safe Heaven. Como tantos otros soñadores en los mercados memeificados de hoy, estuvo apostando $50 aquí, otros $100 allí en lo que se conoce como Shit Coins, oscuras monedas digitales que se emiten de a miles todos los días.

La cuenta de Twitter de Safe Heaven no se actualiza desde el 28 de mayo.\n\n![Safe Haven, uno de los tantos proyectos de cripto que acabaron resultando estafas.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*VyGbXlC8Qu4vRGick1nqbg.png)\n\n“Todos los que conozco han sufrido algún rug pull”, dice Titus, un carnicero de 38 años de Salem, Oregon. “A veces ganas. A veces pierdes. Con suerte, ganarás más de las que pierdes”.\n\nHay mucho dinero en juego. Miles de millones son robados todos los años a través de diferentes estafas de criptomonedas. Y, por como van las cosas, esto se va a poner peor.\n\nEn Wall Street, esta clase de estafas solían ocurrir en casas de bolsa de dudosa reputación como la que describe la película de Scorsese. En ellas, los empleados intentaban vender acciones ridículas a los crédulos.\n\nEn el mundo cripto, la mayoría de los que han sido estafados sólo pueden encogerse de hombros. Lo atribuyen al riesgo intrínseco de operar en cripto, el precio a pagar por un ticket de lotería que podría sacar el premio mayor.\n\nTitan Maxamus dice que no se da por vencido. Tiene entre $20 y $1.000 de docenas de diferentes monedas meme.\n\n“La gente tiene miedo de quedarse afuera de la próxima gran cosa, así que ponen dinero en diferentes proyectos”, dice Maxamus. Admite que su propio FOMO lo hizo caer en tres rug pulls. “Nunca sabes”, reflexiona. “Es el riesgo que corres”.\n\nLa lista en Tokensniffer.com es cada vez más larga. Hace una hora, MoonMiner. Tres horas antes, GoldenShiba. Cuatro horas antes, EverRise. Y así sigue, hora tras día, tras semana, tras mes, en una especie de TripAdvisor de malas experiencias en cripto. Todos aparecen bajo el mismo encabezado: “Las últimas estafas y hackeos”.\n\n[Tokensniffer](https://tokensniffer.com/) sostiene haber realizado un seguimiento de 42.071 tokens y 2.250 estafas o hackeos. Eso fue hasta el 16 de junio. Más de 200 supuestas estafas fueron cargadas por usuarios sólo en las primeras dos semanas de junio.\n\n![TokenSniffer, un sitio web que recopila denuncias de estafas con cripto.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*xlkcTMboJSgjCyQZqHsQxQ@2x.jpeg)\n\nEs difícil saber cuántas de esas monedas fueron realmente un rug pull. El website fue desarrollado en octubre de 2020 por un ingeniero en software y trader de cripto. Tiene 44 años y vive en el oeste de Estados Unidos. Como muchos otros inversores en cripto, prefiere mantener el anonimato.\n\nLa idea de Tokensniffer le vino tras ser víctima él mismo de rugpulls. Su sitio extrae datos de nuevos tokens meme de distintos canales de redes sociales y analiza el código fuente. A veces, los usuarios también reportan tokens que no están en el sistema.\n\nTokensniffer funciona un poco como un escáner de virus para patrones maliciosos en el código. Un programa que “olfatea” vulnerabilidades. Clones de monedas existentes son con frecuencia una alerta roja. La mayoría de los fraudes más recientes (el sitio descubrió 450 en los últimos 30 días) eran del tipo “honeypot” (estafas donde los usuarios depositan sus fondos en un smart contract donde pueden ser robados por el creador). Los honeypots suelen ser más fáciles de descubrir analizando su código. Los rug pulls son más complicados.\n\nCada vez más gente está siendo víctima de estafas. En lo que va de este año, más de 2.600 millones de dólares fueron robados, de acuerdo a [Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/), una firma de investigaciones de blockchain de Nueva York. Y esta cifra no incluye el gigante esquema Ponzi descubierto recientemente en Sudáfrica. Las autoridades estiman que se robaron 3.600 millones de dólares en bitcoin. Aunque parezcan elevadas, las cifras igualmente representan una reducción marcada respecto de 2019, cuando los estafadores se marcharon con unos 9.000 millones.\n\nPero hay una diferencia clave: la cantidad de gente que está siendo estafada. Con algunas excepciones, la mayoría de los fraudes de cripto parecen estar haciéndose más pequeños. Esas son las buenas noticias. Las malas noticias es que hay más estafas y más gente está siendo perjudicada.\n\nDe 2019 a 2020, la cantidad de víctimas creció a un estimado de 7,3 millones, una cifra parecida a la población de Hong Kong. Entre los últimos tres meses de 2020 y los primeros tres meses de 2021, la cantidad de estafas únicas creció aproximadamente 18% hasta 1.335, de acuerdo a Chainalysis.\n\nLa mayoría de los fraudes son tan pequeños que ni siquiera son registrados por las autoridades. Los reguladores suelen priorizar a los casos que involucran grandes cantidades de dinero o violaciones que parecen especialmente graves. Casos por menos de 100.000 dólares suelen ser ignorados, y las víctimas tienen poco incentivo para buscar a los perpetradores por su cuenta. La mayoría de los estafadores simplemente desaparecen.\n\nAlgunos lobos del cripto trabajan solos. Otros en manada. Y casi todos usan seudónimos online. Incluso aquellos que forman parte del mismo grupo estafador muchas veces no conocen las verdaderas identidades de sus cómplices.\n\n“No puedes extraer sangre de una piedra”, dice Paul Sibenik, director de gestión de casos en [CipherBlade](https://cipherblade.com/), una compañía de investigaciones de blockchain, sobre tratar de recuperar tu dinero. “Si ya no queda nada o si la pérdida no era tan grande, capturar a la gente detrás de estos fraudes es muy difícil”.\n\nCipherBlade, fundada en 2018, aún no tomó ningún caso de monedas meme. Sibenik espera que este negocio crezca a medida que más gente se meta en monedas meme y pierdan su dinero, y esto dé origen a un aumento de los casos.\n\n“Habrá consecuencias”, dice Sibenick, “pero esto no ocurrirá rápido”.\n\nSibenik sigue: “Hay tantas oportunidades de ganar dinero... No es una sola persona ni un grupo de gente. Están por todo el mundo”.\n\nLas noticias corrieron rápido por Twitter: Safetrade era un proyecto supuestamente a prueba de rug pulls. La persona o personas detrás del proyecto no podían salir corriendo con el dinero. Una cuenta que promociona monedas meme, Crypto Gems, urgía a sus seguidores a entrar… y hacerlo rápido. (Crypto Gems no respondió a mensajes de Bloomberg; quien sea que esté a cargo, no pudo ser ubicado).\n\nEra el sábado 10 de abril y Safetrade tenía *buzz* en todas las redes sociales. La gente decía que era LA próxima gran moneda. Robert Turner colocó $50 en Safetrade a través de PancakeSwap, uno de los exchanges descentralizados más populares para meme coins.\n\nUn par de días después, la estafa ocurrió. O al menos, eso es lo que Turner cree que pasó. Estaba monitoreando Safetrade en Poocoin.com, una plataforma de cripto con nombre escatológico, cuando el precio cayó a cero en menos de un minuto. Revisó el grupo de Telegram de Safetrade group. Había sido borrado. Todos los miembros habían sido expulsados.\n\nAhí es cuando las cosas se pusieron extrañas. Minutos después, Turner recibió un mensaje privado en Telegram. Un individuo le estaba ofreciendo recuperar su dinero. Todo lo que Turner tenía que hacer era transferir los tokens restantes de su wallet a la de ellos.\n\n“Tienes que enviar los fondos restantes de Safetrade a la wallet que te vamos a asignar”, le escribió el usuario anónimo. “Esto es un asunto profesional. No voy a estafarte. Estoy aquí para resolver el tema”.\n\nTurner, un ingeniero de software de 42 años de Melbourne, Australia, se olió los problemas. No lo hizo. Sus tokens valían centavos en aquel momento. Pero los centavos pueden sumarse. “Si esta persona lograba juntar los centavos de suficiente gente, podrían valer algo”, dice sobre el supuesto Buen Samaritano.\n\nLuego está Mooncharge — lo que parece como un “soft rug”. Esto significa que el creador del proyecto abandona el barco y deja de trabajar en promocionar su creación. Con frecuencia, esto hace que la moneda se vuelva inservible. Turner compró $50 de Mooncharge en abril después de leer sobre la moneda en Reddit. Al poco tiempo, perdió su dinero. Esto es lo que ocurrió.\n\nEl administrador del grupo de Telegram, presumiblemente el creador de Mooncharge, en abril anunció a los miembros que estaba trabajando en una nueva versión de la moneda. “Vamos a tenerlos a todos informados de Mooncharge v2. Prepárense. Esto va a ser demencial”, escribió.\n\n“V2?”, preguntaron, confundidos, los miembros de la comunidad en Telegram.\n\n“¿Alguien puede explicarme qué está pasando? ¿Fuimos estafados?”, alguien preguntó.\n\n“Estoy abajo $600 desde hace 20 o 30 minutos. ¿Qué pasó?”, preguntó otro.\n\nA comienzos de mayo, el administrador del grupo seguía insistiendo que la versión 2 estaba por llegar. “No cambien de canal”, escribió. Pero no pasó nada. Al primero de julio, todavía no había novedades.\n\n“El token perdió todo su valor después de eso”, dice Tuner. Se quedó durante un tiempo, con la esperanza de que la v2 llegara a materializarse, y luego vendió lo que le quedaba de Mooncharge. “Todos perdieron su dinero”, dice.\n\nBen Ghrist sabe todo sobre estafas de cripto. Vive en la casa de sus padres en Roanoke, Texas, y por el momento se dedica a comprar y vender meme coins a tiempo completo. A los 35 años, Ghrist es un millonario en Safemoon, un billonario en Kishu Inu y Sanshu Inu y un trillonario en Keanu Inu. Tiene inversiones en al menos unas 15 monedas diferentes, con alrededor de un cuarto de su portafolios de $25.000 en Dogecoin, una moneda creada como una broma en 2013 en honor al Shiba Inu.\n\nGhrist sospecha que sufrió rug pulls, soft rugs e incluso que fue víctima de un honey pot — como se llama la situación en que una moneda aparentemente legítima resulta ser una trampa. Ghrist cuenta que quería vender la ganancia momentéa de 1000% que había conseguido tras el lanzamiento de una moneda llamada Space Jupiter. Pero las ventas estuvieron bloqueadas por unos 20 minutos. Dice que los creadores de la moneda eventualmente volvieron a activar las ventas pero sólo una vez que el precio se había derrumbado, y luego de que, Ghrist sospecha, hubieran tomado las ganancias para ellos mismos.\n\n“A veces tienes suerte y a veces no”, dice Ghrist, quien típicamente trabaja desde su cama con dos laptops. Dice que suele quedarse toda la noche e incluso que ha trabajado hasta 48 horas seguidas en la búsqueda del oro de las meme coins.\n\nA la hora de elegir sus inversiones, considera una serie de factores para minimizar el riesgo.\n\nUno es la cantidad de cuentas de redes sociales que tiene la moneda (las monedas legítimas, dice, suelen tener más que las dudosas). Otro es si esas cuentas son públicas o privadas (dice que las cuentas públicas son más seguras que las privadas). También cuánto tiempo los administradores de esas cuentas pasan chateando con los inversores (más es mejor que menos).\n\nLuego, mira a lo que está pasando en los grupos de Telegram, conocidos en la jerga de las meme coins como “grupos de promoción”. Cuando todo parece hecho demasiado a las apuradas, es una mala señal, dice.\n\n> *“A veces pierdo mi dinero en una estafa”, dice. “Pero esto es compensar por el hecho de que, en otras ocasiones, multiplico mi inversión entre 3 y 5 veces. A veces, uno hasta puede ganar hasta 30 veces o más”.*\n\nLa estafa récord en el mundo cripto no fue un rug-pull, un soft-pull o un honeypot. Fue un viejo Ponzi. En abril, dos hermanos de Sudáfrica dijeron que su plataforma de inversiones en cripto había sido hackeada. Luego desaparecieron con un 3.600 millones de dólares en Bitcoin.\n\nEl récord anterior lo tenía la wallet y exchange de cripto china PlusToken. Según las autoridades chinas, los usuarios PlusToken fueron estafados en más de 2 mil millones de dólares en otro esquema Ponzi. El último noviembre, los responsables fueron condenados a entre 2 y 11 años de cárcel.\n\n![Ameer y Raees Cajee, los hermanos sudafricanos que cometieron la mayor estafa cripto de la historia hasta 2021.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*fytfOUNQWu9KFLKFuGD15w.png)\n\nA lo largo del mundo, las autoridades están intentando ponerse al día. Una década después de la creación del Bitcoin, los reguladores todavía están intentando descifrar cómo ejercer poder de policía sobre las criptomonedas, dado que operan sin gobiernos ni bancos centrales.\n\nA medida que más instituciones e inversores de retail llegan al mundo cripto (y muchos más lo harán en el futuro) aparecerán nuevas estafas.\n\n“Las criptomonedas están entrando en una nueva etapa” dice Kim Grauer, director de investigación de Chainalysis. “La tecnología está mejorando. El trading se está haciendo más sencillo. Instituciones e inversores comunes, que en otra época nunca se habrían acercado a cripto, quizá lo intenten en algún momento”.\n\nEl Bank for International Settlements, el banco central de los bancos centrales, hace poco estableció ciertos lineamientos duros para bancos que quieran hacer operaciones en Bitcoin. Fue la aceptación de algo obvio: el Bitcoin es riesgoso pero también un reconocimiento del nuevo lugar que ocupa en el orden financiero mundial.\n\nLos Lobos del Cripto también saben todo esto. Allá afuera, el Canto del Dinero sigue sonando.\n\nDurante la pandemia en Estados Unidos, el aburrimiento, la vieja codicia hizo que mucha gente llegara al cripto y las acciones meme. Elon Musk twittea y los precios se disparan o se derrumban.\n\nMichael Burry, de “The Big Short”, ha estado advirtiendo que esto puede terminar terriblemente mal. Se estima que unas 10.000 nuevas monedas han sido creadas este año. ¿Quién sabe cuántas terminarán siendo estafas?\n\nHay tantas nuevas monedas dando vueltas y los precios pueden ser tan volátiles, que mucha gente ni siquiera se da cuenta si ha sido estafada. Los estafadores muchas veces cubren sus rastros mezclando criptomonedas conocidas con otras anónimas, una vieja maniobra de lavado de dinero conocida como “mixing” o “blending”. Roban un poco de cripto aquí y otro poco allá, y lo canalizan a diferentes wallets digitales de diferentes exchanges.\n\nJason Gottlieb es socio en la firma legal Morrison Cohen de Nueva York, especializada en aspectos regulatorios y criptomonedas. Dice que algunas personas tratan de ensuciar a monedas particulares persiguiendo sus propios fines.\n\n“Hay gente puramente maliciosa que va y siembra noticias de que el proyecto X es una estafa porque ellos están trabajando para el proyecto Y, que es un competidor”, dice.\n\n**Sólo una cosa es segura: nadie se queja cuando está ganando dinero.** Es sólo cuando empiezan a perder dinero (y últimamente, esto ocurrió a muchos) que gritan que fueron engañados.\n\n“Cuando el precio sube, la gente no hace demasiadas preguntas”, dice Tyler Moore, un profesor de ciberseguridad en la Universidad de Tulsa que estudió las estafas con criptomonedas. “Sólo ves la parte negativa cuando las cosas van hacia abajo”.\n\nEl Canto del Dinero del Lobo de Wall Street.", "timestamp": 1635376038, "digest": "qw_q8wuJBME-k-tS3xg7FmI9GGNPHUwWa8FdMWsmVRs", "contributor": "0xf12C67e80E309eaC0c4dc18Fb26e68F9672297E9"}

{"id": "RVcYQPOPfDwEE1_nCSHXaJzEsXZMuZK9h9iS0lNj1j8", "title": "La Curva J del Cripto", "body": "### Cómo funcionan los ciclos de crecimiento, derrumbe y nuevo crecimiento de los criptoactivos…\n\n*Esta es una versión traducida y adaptada del artículo “[The Crypto J-Curve](https://medium.com/@cburniske/the-crypto-j-curve-be5fdddafa26)” publicado el 12 de agosto de 2017 por Chris Burniske.*\n\nA medida que los mercados de criptoactivos se desarrollan, veremos muchos booms y derrumbes como resultado del aumento y la caída del entusiasmo del mercado. Esto es parte inevitable del camino que tiene que recorrer el cohete que nos lleva a la luna.\n\nEl Bitcoin ya atravesó varios de estos ciclos. A finales de 2013, superó por primera vez los 1000 dólares. A esto le siguió un doloroso derrumbe que duró hasta enero de 2015, en el que el Bitcoin cayó a un piso de $175. Luego volvió otro período de entusiasmo en que el Bitcoin superó por primera vez los $4,000.\n\n> En el caso de criptoactivos que tienen un valor de utilidad, este patrón de crecimiento y caída crea un gráfico de precio que se conoce como Curva J.\n\nEn el mundo de las inversiones, la Curva J se utiliza para describir los cashflows de los portafolios. En economía, los efectos de una devaluación sobre el déficit de un país. En cripto, nació una nueva Curva J.\n\nLa idea básica de la Curva J se refiere a cómo el mercado valúa un criptoactivo a lo largo del tiempo.\n\nEl precio de un criptoactivo se compone de dos formas de valor: el **valor actual de utilidad** (current utility value, CUV) y el **valor de utilidad presente descontado** (discounted expected utility value, DEUV). A este último, muchos lo llaman **valor especulativo**.\n\nEn los primeros tiempos que siguen a su oferta al público, suele haber un alto entusiasmo por un criptoactivo. Durante este período, el CUV del activo es mínimo (o inexistente, si el protocolo no ha sido lanzado).\n\nEl precio se compone mayormente de DEUV. Por lo tanto, está expuesto a los caprichos del Sr. Mercado. Este período inicial de alto entusiasmo es el primer (pequeño) pico de una Curva J, como se muestra en el gráfico que sigue.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*fuWvQP-56E_8Vx9Y)\n\nEn mi [trabajo](https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/868825324078813185) valuando diferentes criptoactivos, he encontrado que, en los primeros tiempos, no es extraño que la composición del valor se parezca al gráfico siguiente: un precio inicialmente alto, y un DEUV inicialmente inflado.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ygYcZBIpjgg4cqI4)\n\nA medida que pasa el tiempo, el equipo de desarrollo y la criptorred inevitablemente encuentran obstáculos imprevistos. Construir sistemas descentralizados es difícil, y también manejar la gente dentro de ellos.\n\nA medida que el proyecto se encuentra con obstáculos, el entusiasmo del mercado se disuelve, y esto impacta en el DEUV. Matemáticamente, la caída del DEUV puede entenderse como el resultado de distintas variables:\n\n* Un aumento en la **tasa de descuento**, ya que las chances de éxito se perciben como más pequeñas y por lo tanto el activo se vuelve más riesgoso.\n* Una reducción en el \\*\\*porcentaje de penetración en el mercado objetivo \\*\\*del activo, ya que se teme que el protocolo no logre conseguir tantos usuarios como se creía inicialmente.\n* Un recorte en el **tamaño total de mercado**, a medida que algunos componentes del roadmap y las funcionalidades planificadas se vuelven poco realistas.\n\nYa sea como queramos explicarlo, cuando los tiempos se ponen duros, los especuladores corren a la salida, el DEUV se ve aplastado, y como hay poco CUV, el precio del token se derrumba. Pregúntele a cualquier Bitcoiner sobre 2014. No fue un año divertido.\n\nSin embargo, un equipo de desarrollo dedicado mantiene la cabeza baja y sigue haciendo su trabajo indiferente a los caprichos del Sr. Mercado. Como resultado, el protocolo mejora y más usuarios (no especuladores) empiezan a llegar.\n\n> Con un aumento en el uso, el CUV del criptoactivo sube lentamente.\n\nEl CUV puede empezar a crecer incluso aunque el DEUV del token siga cayendo. Si el mercado está muy pesimista, el DEUV podría incluso llegar a cero. El mercado incluso podría descontar el activo hasta el punto de que su precio caiga por debajo del CUV, algo similar a cuando una acción cotiza por debajo de su valor de libros.\n\nA pesar del derrumbe, el equipo de desarrollo, los usuarios, los miembros de la comunidad y un pequeño “núcleo duro” de inversores mantiene sus tokens. Esto representa una pequeña parte del DEUV que se había alcanzado previamente (ver abajo).\n\nEsto es lo que pasó con el Bitcoin en los primeros tres trimestres del 2015, cuando el precio estaba poco por encima de $200. Fue el piso de la Curva J.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Fgi9BeTBHZkJiP0D)\n\nEl crecimiento desde el fondo de la Curva J puede ser lento. De aquí la forma de pendiente suave del gráfico. La curva sólo se vuelve más inclinada cuando el Sr. Mercado se da cuenta del CUV creciente del activo e inyecta más DEUV nuevamente en el precio.\n\nEste proceso es la reversión de los tres puntos anteriores: quizá se reduzca la tasa de descuento, aumente la penetración esperada del mercado objetivo, o suba el optimismo sobre el tamaño total del mercado.\n\nMás allá de cómo uno decida interpretarlo, el DEUV se expande a medida que aumentan las expectativas sobre la utilidad futura, basado en el crecimiento del CUV.\n\nEl gráfico que sigue nos muestra cómo ocurrió este proceso para el Bitcoin entre 2013 y 2017.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*AGSDFXBxCYG5KvBf)\n\nLa velocidad de este proceso puede variar radicalmente. Idealmente el CUV y el DEUV se expandirán en conjunto y encontrarán un equilibrio saludable.\n\nSin embargo, si el bull market es muy fuerte, es posible que el crecimiento del DEUV supere al del CUV. Los especuladores vuelven a colocar su dinero, el DEUV crece de manera acelerada y nuevamente los aspectos financieros se divorcian de la realidad del uso del protocolo.\n\nEsta es la razón por la que la Curva J suele volverse más inclinada en las últimas fases.\n\nEn este punto, el ciclo ha dado una vuelta completa:\n\n* En su lanzamiento, el precio del criptoactivo estaba casi completamente compuesto de DEUV.\n* En las profundidades del bear market, se derrumbó hasta encontrar un soporte en su CUV.\n* El precio volvió a subir hasta volver a estar compuesto principalmente por DEUV.\n\nEl siguiente gráfico muestra la composición del precio del activo a lo largo de las diferentes etapas.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ntqz6KxkiXTouhSg)\n\nLa Curva J es una manifestación de cómo el sentimiento del mercado y el valor de utilidad de un criptoactivo impactan en el precio.\n\n* Inicialmente, cuando las expectativas son altas, también lo es el precio. Pero este se compone mayormente de DEUV.\n* Cuando las expectativas se derrumban, también lo hace el precio, incluso aunque el CUV crezca.\n* Por último, a medida que el DEUV vuelve a expandirse, el precio del activo debería superar su máximo anterior, porque ahora también está respaldado por más CUV.\n\nY luego el ciclo se repite de nuevo, y de nuevo… y de nuevo.\n\nEspero que haya muchos ciclos de Curva J a escala macro y micro. Por patrones macro, me refiero a escalas de tiempo con una duración de décadas. Cada pico anterior de DEUV va a empalidecer en comparación con el siguiente, creando una nueva Curva J.\n\nEsa Curva J estará compuesta por muchas pequeñas Curvas J, cuya periodicidad está por determinarse.\n\nAl final del día, en una situación de equilibrio, un criptoactivo debería componerse mayormente de CUV, con algo de especulación en el margen.\n\nEn este punto, la Curva J de múltiples décadas debería menguar, para parecerse finalmente a una curva en forma de S. La cantidad de especulación sobre la utilidad futura dependerá de cuánto del mercado objetivo ya haya sido capturado,y cuánto se haya osificado el protocolo.\n\nPor supuesto, esto es una teoría, y no espero que los patrones en la realidad sean perfectos. Pero mientras la utilidad aumente en el largo plazo, igualmente llegaremos a la luna.", "timestamp": 1635377340, "digest": "o248ajChD6BX5tL0LbwmuAyytUA-QmZ3u6E-f7WQAcE", "contributor": "0xf12C67e80E309eaC0c4dc18Fb26e68F9672297E9"}

DAOs 자체는 1800년대의 프랑스 공무원 겸 귀족출신 알렉시스 드 토크빌(Alexis de Tocqueville)이 미국을 여행하면서 발견한 현상을 연상시킨다. 새로운 국가의 개인들이 모든 종류의 자발적인 단체를 형성할 거라는 것이다. 그들은 단체나 협회가 민주주의를 강화하고 서로 공통의 이익을 공유하는 사람들에게 민주주의를 끌어 내려줌으로서 공적 기구들의 범위를 넘어서까지 그것을 확대한다고 믿었다. DAO는 토크빌 관찰의 현대 화신이다.\n\n현재 모든 종류의 DAO가 존재하고 있으며, 소셜 DAO, 벤처 DAO, 그리고 임팩트 DAO 등을 포함한 캄브리아기 생물대폭발(Cambrian explosion, 다양한 종류의 동물화석이 갑작스럽게 출현한 지직학적 사건)이 DAO세계에 형성되고 있다. 더 많은 사람들이 DAO에 가입함에 따라, DAO 내부에서는 물론, 다른 DAO간 그리고 소비자 혹은 정부조직과 DAO간 대화를 효율적으로 조정할 수 있는 도구가 마련되어야 한다.\n\n외부 DAO간 커뮤니케이션의 측면에서, 다오이스트(DAOist)는 크립토 커뮤니티에 있는 이들을 외부와 연결해 DAO 교육의 자원 역할을 하는 것을 목표로 하는 조직이다. '초등 복잡성(Elementary Complexity)'으로 더 잘 알려진 다오이스트 설립자 펠리페(Felipe Duarte)는 DAO가 합법적인 수용의 트로이 목마가 될 수 있다고 확신하면서, 만약 한 국가의 15%가 DAO에 고용된다면, 정부와 규제 당국이 DAO에 대해 조치를 취할 것이고 그들의 유권자들을 소외시키는 것이 훨씬 더 어려워질것이라고 지적했다.\n\nDAO는 아직 초기 단계지만 업계에서는 웹3 세계에서 활동하는 이들의 1차 고용 수단이 될 것이라는 베팅이 많다.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kY3lbExUnjZF_sqTLaQIB.png?height=576&width=768)\n\n리스트콘에서 발표하고 있는 케빈 오워키(Kevin Owocki)\n\n**DAO의 진화**\n\nDAO라는 용어는 이더리움의 초기로부터 크게 진화했다.\n\n노시스 길드(Gnosis Guild)의 케이(Kei Kreutler)는 인터뷰에서 DAOs 이전에 분산형 조직을 묘사할 때 가장 많이 사용된 용어는 DAC, 즉, 분산형 자치 조직이었다고 설명했다. 2016년 악명 높은 'DAO' 해킹 사건이 발생한 후 찾아온 DAO의 겨울(DAO winter)동안 DAO들은 그들이 할 수 있는 것을 다시 한 번 재조명하고 셸링 포인트를 찾아 다시 한 번 집결하는 시간을 가졌다. \n\n거의 보편적으로 합의되는 DAO의 진정한 전환점은 레이지큇 기능(ragequit function)을 통해 근본적인 자금모금 문제를 해결한 교부금(grant) 기부 단체인 몰록다오(Moloch DAO)의 부상이다. 몰록다오의 모델은 여러 차례 포크됐으며(forked, 소프트웨어 소스코드를 통째로 복사하여 독립된 새로운 소프트웨어를 개발한다는 개발자 용어에서 유래) 메타카르텔 벤쳐스(MetaCartel Ventures)와 마케팅다오(Marketing DAO)를 포함한 여러 다른 DAO들을 소환했다. 더 말할 것도 없이 '몰록 퇴치(defeating Moloch)'에 대한 서사는 이더리움 커뮤니티에서 끊임없이 등장하는 밈(meme)이었다. 케이는 시간이 지나면서 DAO들이 조정 문제와 교착상태를 해결하려는 선의의 정신으로 진화해 왔다고 언급했다.\n\n케빈(Kevin Owocki)은 \"DAO는 몰록으로의 후퇴를 조율하기위해 경제 중력의 법칙을 재설계하는 것\"이라고 말했다.\n\n이런 관점에서 케이(Kei)는 앞으로 오와키가 언급한 신흥 경제 중력 법칙을 더 잘 반영하기 위해 DAO의 의무를 더 잘 구현하는 새로운 토큰 표준이 만들어질 것으로 추측하고 있다. 예를 들어, 이벤트의 결과나 참여 빈도에 따라 가치가 결정되는 토큰 표준이 만들어질 수 있다. 이러한 토큰 표준을 가능케 하는것은 바로 ERC-20대신에 \"ERC-2000 기반”의 유니스왑(Uniswap)같은 AMMs에서 제공될 수 있는 유동성이다.\n\n케이(Kei)는 향후 DAO가 단순한 토큰 투표에서 벗어나 세분화된 거버넌스 프로세스를 통해 적응력이 높은 조직이 될 것이라는 이론을 내세우고 있다. 하위 DAO들은 개인성 증명, 참여 증명 등과 같은 자신들만의 의사결정 방식을 가진 DAO들 내부에서 존재 할 수 있고 그 후 그 선택지들을 핵심 DAO에 가져갈 수 있다.\n\n**\\*\\*더 많은 펑크 \\*\\***\n\n리스트콘에서 명백하게 드러난 두 가지 프레임워크들은 사이버펑크 정신의 두 가지 포크인 솔라펑크와 루나펑크였다. 이 둘은 실제 대부분의 사람들이 알고 있는 것 이상으로 서로를 보완한다.\n\n예를 들어, 두 이념적 프레임워크는 디파이(DeFi)와 DAO가 개개인의 근본부터 힘을 실어주는 이상적인 상향식 조직 시스템이라는 것에 대해 완전한 합의에 있다. 그리고 둘 다 데이터가 불길한 조직들에 의해서 추출되는 것 보다 개인에 의해 소유되는 세상을 보고자 한다는 점에서 완전히 동의하고 있다. 또한, 양쪽 모두 Web3의 궁극적인 목표가 개인이 진입할 수 있는 평행 시스템을 구축하고 현재 권력구조에 대한 실행 가능한 대안이 되는 것이라는 데에도 동의한다.\n\n언급된 목표를 어떻게 실행할 것인가에 대해서는 의견의 차이가 있지만, 의견의 다양성은 인간성 스택(humanity stack)의 다양한 영역에서 광범위한 실험을 가능케 한다.\n\n**다크파이(DarkFi)의 라이징**\n\n루나펑크(lunarpunks)의 사고방식을 대변하는 것은 아미르 타아키(Amir Taaki)와 다크파이(DarkFi)에 속한 그의 팀이다. 다크파이는 개인 머니 레고(money legos) 네트워크를 창출하는 영지식 증명(zero-knowledge proofs)을 활용하는 익명의 디파이 네트워크다.\n\n아고리즘(Agorism)에 기반한 지적 토대를 가진 루나펑크는 개인과 DAO를 고압적이고 적대적인 행위자들로부터 보호하기 위해 익명성을 최고가치이자 절대 필요 덕목으로 꼽는다. 타아키는 디파이가 불가피하게 둘로 나뉠것이라고 주장한다. 규제금융이나 레그파이(RegFi)는 디파이(DeFi)의 심각하게 희석된 버전으로, 오늘날 전통금융(TradFi)와 크게 다르지 않다. 그런 후에 상호 작용에서 주권을 원하는 사람들은 어둠의 금융으로 내몰릴 것이다.\n\n그는 오늘날 크립토 공동체가 직면하고 있는 가장 큰 문제는 “가치의 인터넷”이 자본과 권력에 너무 크게 의존하고 있으며, 현 지배적 금융 기반 시스템에서 이익을 얻는 사람들로부터의 순응하라는 압력때문에 그 혁명적 잠재력이 완전히 부응하지 못하는 것이라고 말한다.\n\n다크파이는 4년째 개발 중이지만 트위터에서 코비(Cobie), 크립토 맥케나(Crypto McKenna) 등 눈에 띄는 계정들이 팔로워들에게 이 용어를 트윗하면서 최근에 들어서야 다크파이의 밈이 화제에 올랐다.\n\n리스콘의 다크파이 팜플렛\n\n**개인들의 플레이투언(Play-to-Earn)**\n\n웹3에 사람들을 탑승시키기 위한 메타버스 깔때기가 형성되듯이 '어둠의 메타버스 깔때기(dark metaverse funnel)' 또한 만들어 질 것이다. 타아키와 그의 팀이 극복해야 할 과제는 \"웹3 안에서 획득한 이 금융적 권력을 어떻게 지역 경제공동체의 지역 경제 영역으로 연결시키고 그 경제력이 실현된 후에 또 어떻게 정치권에 연결시켜 의미 있는 변화를 제정할 수 있는가\"이다.\n\n이에 대한 가능한 해결책은 액시 인피니티와 유사한 프라이버시 기반의 플레이투언(Play-to-earn)게임을 다크파이(DarkFi)로 만들어 타아키가 권한부여에 필수적이라고 보고 있는 개발도상국의 지역사회를 웹3에 끌어들이는것에 도움을 주는 것이다. 타아키는 이런 과정에서 새로운 기술계급이 등장할 수 있다고 결론지었다. \n\n**오픈소스 맥시멀리즘**\n\n깃코인의 오워키는 자신을 사이버펑크(또는 루나펑크)보다는 솔라펑크라고 표현하며 우리가 어떻게 조정과 합의의 문제를 더 잘 해결할 수 있는지에 대한 관점에서 웹3의 솔루션 구축에 접근하고자 한다.\n\n그는 스스로를 \"오픈 소스 맥시멀리스트\"라고 부르며, 깃코인의 주요 임무는 최초의 주요 성공 사례 중 하나로 나오는 2차적 자금 지원과의 조정의 실험에서 인큐베이터가 되는 것이라고 말한다. 오워키는 이러한 조정 문제를 해결하는 것은 기후변화, 인프라 개발, 공공재의 자금 지원 등 더 큰 문제의 해결을 의미할 수도 있다고 본다. 그는 조정의 실패를 극복하기 위한 도전자체를 궁극적으로 메타버스(metaverse)를 정의하는 거대한 '스스로의 모험을 선택하는 게임'으로 정의한다. 어떻게 게임을 플레이할지의 선택은 바로 사람들에게 달려있는 것이다.\n\n이 게임에서 플레이어가 갖는 선택은 더 나은 세상을 만들기 위해 조정을 최적화할 것인지와 벽으로 둘러싸인 정원과도 같은 개인의 유토피아로 후퇴할 것인지이다.\n\n오워키는 DAO를 통해서 이제 보다 개방적인 금융 시스템을 구축하기 위해 투명하고 불변적인 방식으로 의사소통할 수 있는 더 나은 메커니즘이 마련됐다고 말한다. 덕분에 우리는 그 어느 때보다도 훨씬 강건한 재화의 배분을 조율할 수 있는 기반을 갖추었다. 이러한 시스템에서 그는 솔라펑크와 사이버펑크가 힘을 합쳐 가능한 한 많은 개인에게 힘을 실어주리라는 그들의 비전에 맞는 세상을 구축할 수 있다고 믿는다.\n\n리스콘 참석자들이 집으로 돌아와 크립토 메타버스로의 여행을 이어가면서, DAO가 무엇이며 웹3 스택을 구축하는 방법이 무엇인지에 대한 대화는 앞으로도 계속될 것이다. 크립토 내외부를 포함해 인기있는 내러티브, 규제 등등 많은 요소들이 우리가 어떤 미래 결과를 내다 볼 수 있는지에 영향을 미칠 것이다. 웹3는 전세계 인구의 상당수의 일상에서 계속적인 증강력이 될 것이다.", "timestamp": 1635378960, "digest": "7SNgjmAYNzxkxRSBJSzFs1Kk-tBzmKwLyBjIuoL-tDw", "contributor": "0x4E2572d9161Fc58743A4622046Ca30a1fB538670"}

{"id": "bebF22nBshUvc01oM43NC3SqxfjYXu1vkNh8hCEAQJw", "title": "5 Ways Blockchain Will Improve Your Life in the Future", "body": "While most people only see blockchain as a system that enables cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, researchers, entrepreneurs and governments are working “behind the scenes”, leveraging blockchain technology to change the world. In just a few short years since the launch of Bitcoin, thousands of research papers have been written in a race to explore the uses and impacts of this exciting technology. With an array of emerging tech such as AI, VR and IoT going through the “hype cycle” on an evermore regular basis, one can be forgiven for failing to grasp the enormity of blockchain’s potential to shift the world order and revolutionize the way we live.\n\n**Trust in blockchain**\n\nThere is no need to understand the technical details of how blockchain works to see how the technology’s main feature can impact us. \n\nThe blockchain represents an evolution in the way information can be stored, accessed and used. Ledgers have been an integral part of everyday life even if we don’t necessarily see them. They confirm our identity, our ownership of assets, our status and our authority among other things (Berg, Davidson, Potts 2017). This data is managed in ledgers by organisations and individuals to coordinate, verify and validate transactions. As members of society, we need to trust in the ledgers and the organisations that control them and we do so thanks to government regulations and structures.\n\nThe most important feature of blockchain as represented in this article is its ability to provide trust regardless of the parties involved in a transaction and without the need for any intermediary, whether governmental or otherwise (Oh, Wallsten 2018). Its decentralised nature has the inbuilt ability to gain consensus which makes it almost impossible for data to be deleted or corrupted.\n\n**Institutional Cryptoeconomics**\n\nAlthough the term may seem academic, the underlying concepts of institutional cryptoeconomics are simple to fathom and provide the theory that supports the claim that blockchain will be a disruptive force in our world. Institutional cryptoeconomics is based on institutional economics, a school of economics made popular by Ronald Coase and Oliver Williamson in the last century. They posit that it is more than supply and demand that dictate the price of goods and services as there are inherent costs within each transaction of the supply chain. The two main transaction costs are information and trust.\n\nThese costs arise because actors engaging in a trade are by nature opportunistic and self-serving. They want to get the best price or value and will take advantage of any situation to obtain it. To keep these costs at a manageable level, we have built institutions and societal structures to minimise our need to trust the other party in a transaction. We use banks, escrow agents, brokers, auditors, lawyers and countless other systems to allow us to trade. We have set up these expensive centralized entities because we can’t inherently trust others - and despite their expense, these systems do reduce the transaction costs and the price of goods and services. \n\nBut what if all of a sudden, we had a new way to establish trust? A transaction method that didn’t need banks, lawyers, brokers or auditors? What would that mean for our way of life? Yes, it could mean a huge shift in the labour market and the end of many institutions and structures but what would it mean to our everyday lives? What would it actually look like when blockchain technology has matured and is part of our world?\n\n**1. A world without banks**\n\nAs can be seen from the interest in Bitcoin and its ilk, the idea of a world without banks is appealing to many. Banks have been a vital element in society ever since there was trade. They have allowed us to form our way of life and become a highly advanced civilization. Banks have not only enabled the supply of capital, they have enabled trust and facilitated local, national and international transactions through their systems of rules and regulations.\n\nDespite banks’ current importance in our world, they add a huge cost to our transactions. This means that blockchain’s ability to allow parties to transact without the need for trust or intermediaries will become an existential threat to financial institutions everywhere.\n\nNo more bank queues, no more ATMs, no more financial collapses or scandals. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is becoming the new way for people to borrow and lend money with dozens of apps and companies launching in the last year alone. It remains to be seen how central banks will continue to regulate economies as new methods of trade appear but many of them are already on the case and exploring their options.\n\n**2. Cheap, renewable energy**\n\nWith climate change policy and renewable energy production being issues of global importance, everyone will welcome the idea that all the energy we need can be produced in our own neighborhoods for a fraction of the cost of the current supply. Advancements in small scale renewable energy plants and energy storage solutions mean that more and more, homes, businesses and communities are producing their own electricity. Most people still depend on connection to the main grid to guarantee supply however this need could be eradicated with the implementation of smart local grids that are powered by blockchain technology. \n\nSmart contracts will create a localised energy marketplace where consumers can also be suppliers and only pay if they use more than they produce. The loss of dependence on a huge supply chain obviously means massive cost savings for household budgets and the environment.\n\n**3. Cheaper, fresher products and services**\n\nAs consumers in the global economy, we are usually the end of the line for extensive supply chains for all manner of goods and services. The more complex the supply chain, the higher the transaction costs, which are of course passed on to us, the consumer.\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](//:0)\n\nIn fact, new forms of organisations will form that can out-compete traditional business structures which necessarily have many layers of trust-enabling functions (Davidson et al, 2018). In “*Trustless architecture and the V-form organisation”, *Berg, Davidson and Potts (2020) describe a V-form organisation as an “outsourced, vertically integrated organisation tied together not by management and corporate hierarchy but by distributed ledger technology” (p7). Whereas there are currently cost savings for a business to vertically integrate, the trust provided by the blockchain allows non-related businesses to share the benefits without the need for additional hierarchies.\n\n**4. Less crime and corruption**\n\nWhen implemented well, blockchain technology will make it very difficult to get away with fraud, theft, embezzlement or corruption. It might be still possible to commit these crimes but with the greater transparency, traceability and trackability afforded by blockchains, it becomes pointless to try as it is a sure thing that you will be caught.\n\nThe higher level of security and safety again reduces the cost of transactions as each stage of a supply chain no longer needs to factor in losses from crime to their price. Furthermore, the need for security systems, guards, police and legal structures are drastically minimized. Not only a saving for consumers but to society as a whole.\n\n**5. Lower taxes!**\n\nYes, I’ve saved the best for last. The purpose of government is to organise our societies through creating and enforcing regulations. As the greatest providers of trust, governments also add huge costs to our lives. Even the most ardent anti-capitalist would find it hard to disagree with reducing the size of government if we had technology to replace it. Of course we will not stop needing some form of government but one can hardly refute the amount of money to be saved if we have no further need for a large proportion of the government services we have now.\n\nRegulations will still be needed but can be built into the code of smart contracts on a blockchain. This means that it is not possible to act in contradiction to the regulation. Without the need for policing, investigating and auditing among many other activities, and along with the assets and management involved with the coordination of it all, a decrease in costs of government would obviously lead to the reduction of taxes (Davidson et al, 2018).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo even though it might be a number of years before blockchain has matured and is part of our world in this way, the potential benefits are too compelling for them to be ignored. You can be assured that thousands more research papers are being written, countless entrepreneurs are exploring opportunities and even governments, at risk of total transformation, are investigating how they can take advantage of blockchain technology.\n\nBlockchain’s potential impact has been compared with the digital transformation that has occurred with the advent of the Internet. In the early years of the world wide web, the Internet was described as an “information superhighway”. I also like the road analogy for blockchain and think it could be referred to as a “transaction superhighway”. If you can picture our current societal structures as regular city streets with endless intersections and obstacles, you can see that the cost of moving goods from one place to another is slow and expensive. Although it would be a huge investment to build a superhighway and it would involve knocking down houses and reorganising other existing infrastructure, the benefits to be gained will be there forevermore.\n\n**References**\n\nAllen, DWE, Berg, C, Markey-Towler, B, Novak, M & Potts, J 2020, “Blockchain and the evolution of institutional technologies: Implications for innovation policy,” Research Policy, vol. 49, no. 1, p. 103865, viewed 16 April 2021, \\<https\\://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/science/article/pii/S0048733319301842>.\n\nBerg, A, Markey‐Towler, B & Novak, M 2018, “Blockchains = Less Government, More Market,” SSRN Electronic Journal.\n\nBerg, C, Davidson, S & Potts, J 2017, “The Blockchain Economy: A beginner’s guide to institutional cryptoeconomics,” Medium, viewed \\<https\\://medium.com/cryptoeconomics-australia/the-blockchain-economy-a-beginners-guide-to-institutional-cryptoeconomics-64bf2f2beec4>.\n\nBerg, C, Davidson, S & Potts, J 2018, “Ledgers,” papers.ssrn.com, viewed \\<https\\://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3157421>.\n\nBerg, C, Davidson, S & Potts, J 2019, “Blockchain Technology as Economic Infrastructure: Revisiting the Electronic Markets Hypothesis,” Frontiers in Blockchain, vol. 2, viewed 16 April 2021, \\<https\\://www\\.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2019.00022/full>.\n\nBerg, C, Davidson, S & Potts, J 2020, “Trustless Architecture and the V-Form Organisation,” SSRN Electronic Journal, viewed 28 March 2021, \\<https\\://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3612419>.\n\nBoucher, P 2017, How blockchain technology could change our lives, European Parliament, viewed \\<https\\://www\\.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2017/581948/EPRS_IDA(2017)581948\\_EN.pdf>.\n\nDavidson, S, Novak, M & Potts, J 2018, “The Cost of Trust: A Pilot Study,” SSRN Electronic Journal.\n\nDemir, M, Turetken, O & Mashatan, A 2020, “An Enterprise Transformation Guide for the Inevitable Blockchain Disruption,” Computer, vol. 53, no. 6, pp. 34–43, viewed 15 April 2021, \\<https\\://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/document/9107300>.\n\nDuy, PT, Hien, DTT, Hien, DH & Pham, V-H 2018, “A survey on opportunities and challenges of Blockchain technology adoption for revolutionary innovation,” Proceedings of the Ninth International Symposium on Information and Communication Technology - SoICT 2018.\n\nHeister, S & Yuthas, K 2020, “The blockchain and how it can influence conceptions of the self,” Technology in Society, vol. 60, p. 101218, viewed 16 April 2021, \\<https\\://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/science/article/pii/S0160791X19301745>.\n\nHo, S., Wallsten, S.
