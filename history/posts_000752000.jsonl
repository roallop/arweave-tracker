They deserve to share in the that upside.\n- **Transparency.** This means being open about everything we do at Catalog, from our backers to our treasury to our product decisions.\n\n\n## Closing thoughts\nWe need new forms of curation, attention distribution, royalty structures, and attribution that simply don't exist in music today.

We made a lot of lifelong friends along the way as well.\n\nThe vibes are high. The momentum is palpable. We're ready for Season Two.\n\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8225cdac-6d0d-45f0-b435-1c65b9ecb13c.png?height=593&width=2260)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunch House has always straddled two worlds  -  SF & LA, Silicon Valley & Hollywood, tech & culture. Season Two extends this further through atoms and bits - the intersection of IRL and URL worlds and new ways to play within them.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/56296ec5-b9c5-4e23-a0b3-657b995001ae.png?height=97&width=713)\n\nSunny Los Angeles has treated us well. The weather is perfect and the energy is unmistakable. While we can't take the weather with us, after 8 months in LA, we've learned what it takes to create the energy and we're bringing it to New York City.\n\nOf course, we had to do it our way. We secured a beautiful 7-story mansion in the heart of Chelsea that our New York Residencies and community will call home.\n\nIn the coming months, we'll also be uploading the Launch House vibes into the cloud with the launch of our first Metaverse location. Over the long term, we anticipate this virtual third space to be the primary location for our members to gather.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1a77f843-0ca0-41db-9eb4-d5d54c019601.png?height=96&width=524)\n\n\nWe believe the future of work looks a lot like gaming - dynamic, fun and with proper game mechanics. We started Launch House to make being a founder more fun and now with Season Two, we're introducing new dynamics to the game with the first being themed Residencies.\n\nIn the Fall, we'll be launching 7 themed residencies corresponding to different spaces (web3, creator economy, fintech, B2B SaaS), geographies (Los Angeles and New York) and stages (launch). Each Residency will feature leaders in each area as speakers and participants, and drive the collaboration and connection among them quintessential to Launch House. These new Residencies will help onboard new members and give existing members fun new ways to play in the Launch House community.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e8c384a0-091a-44cb-b978-bd4dc2f9d3fa.png?height=463&width=1257)\n\n\n\nWe are also transitioning to an annual membership model and constantly finding new ways to make it the most valuable business subscription for any founder. Our members will get access to the most perks/discounts of any community, a robust directory featuring individuals, companies, and homes to stay in, a handful of services like launch and fundraising support, exclusive events and programs, and more.\n\nThe creator side of our community will also see some exciting new initiatives focused on helping them explore new monetization models, invest in startups, level-up as a creator and build deeper connections.\n\nThe greatest communities throughout history have lasted hundreds (even thousands) of years. It's audacious, but we aim to do the same. In Season Two, we'll be breaking ground on new web3 infrastructure to create a decentralized, self-reinforcing ecosystem that be believe will endure.\n\n---\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a381b47a-1616-435a-a0ca-38382b571f16.png?height=650&width=1218)\n\n\nThe networks we belong to are [highly determinative](https://www.nfx.com/post/your-life-network-effects/) of how our lives will turn out. And while we can't choose the country or city or life circumstances we are born into, the freedom of the open internet provides us unlimited choice with regards to the communities we want to belong to.\n\nWe believe sovereign individuals within collectives with shared values will change the world. \n\nOur collective values are these:\n\n* **LIFT EACH OTHER UP**. Collective action is infinitely more powerful than individual. We can accomplish anything together.\n* **GO DEEP**. Making friends makes you richer than networking. Dig beneath the surface and you'll find wealth and happiness.\n* **ALWAYS BE LAUNCHING (ABL)**. The future belongs to those who take action and launch, not those who stagnate and squander opportunities.\n\nIt's time to launch .

{"id": "t4HvXRNZM2L5xt9sf6cPXGHZ6qwnG31BYYP5G0Be5eU", "title": "The Dawn of Consumer Crypto", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0cb1cc1d-7d94-446b-8481-05dd3c9c6f41.jpg?height=4000&width=6000)\n\nBrowsers, applications and platforms are how consumers live online. Today, new digital lives are being led in different corners of the internet on top of the blockchain. But for all the media coverage of crypto, users will only start to care about this revelatory infrastructure shift when it is showcased through the services they use most. It’s hard to see things in the dark, and consumers show up when these products and applications turn on the lights.\n\nHistorically on the web, consumer opportunity followed emerging infrastructure. Web1 server structures put individuals online, gave the masses access to the internet to consume and communicate and made it all accessible by way of the browser, search and chat. But it took Netscape, Google, AOL & others to really show consumers what that infrastructure could do. Web2 presented the cloud and introduced a new wave of scalability and the emergence of the social web. All of a sudden people could connect online, purchase online, trade online, catalog their life online… everything together online. The web was cheaper to consume and accessible to anyone who was able to find a connection. Now we have the acceleration of Web3 infrastructure. Billions of dollars of investment and treasury sitting in the foundational layer of the next internet (Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, etc.). Web3 promises a new gateway for billions of users to live even more online through self sovereignty, portability and ownership. But today, there is really only one breakout consumer experience that has reached far beyond the crypto community; Coinbase. \n\nLiving online relies on infrastructure. But that doesn’t mean consumers care about the infrastructure itself. They care about what it can unlock for their online lives: status, entertainment, financial gain, etc. When was the last time you used Spotify and thought “this is great because it’s hosted on AWS!”? You use Spotify because of the entertainment it provides you as an individual, brought to you by the infrastructure it showcases. Consumers care if things work and benefit them as individuals over all else. Web3 is presenting entirely new behaviors and business models to the web, now it’s up to us to show consumers what that can do and how it can benefit their digital lives.\n\nThese new forms of living online are starting to materialize in several specific ways:\n\n**Culture, Status and Community**: Now that digital ownership is exploding by way of NFTs, people are seeing bigger financial and status opportunities online than offline. This is the biggest catalyst for living online we’ve seen to date. Individuals are building status and identity in the virtual world the way that they do in the physical world. Why own a Gucci bag to impress a few hundred people in your town when you can own a digital one to impress millions? The way you dress, accessorize and socialize online is now directly tied to your identity and status, where consumers are taking Crypto Punks or Bored Apes and making them their profile picture (PFP). This signal drives identity, status and community in an entirely new way.\n\n**24/7 Markets for Everything**: Coinbase turned markets into a 24/7 industry and that is spilling over into other industries where consumers are at the forefront. The role of the consumer has shifted from spectator to participant, meaning more individuals are able to contribute to the passions and products they love most. For example, Zed Run (in which an affiliate of TCG Capital Management, LLC holds an investment) is a virtual horse racing game that lets individuals purchase, breed and race horses. It’s not limited by physical space or time, it’s completely up to the owners: consumers. There are [media markets being built around this](https://zedgazette.com/) and DAOs structured to allow communities to pool together to purchase and raise horses as a collective — all of which exists online unbounded by physical constraints. \n\n**New Business Models**: Web3 inverts the internet’s business models by giving more value and ownership to both creators and consumers. Traditionally, platforms developed online have been driven by advertising and subscriptions. This is because Web2 took a consumer first approach to platforms, protocols and applications with the platforms as intermediaries. Web3 puts value back into the hands of creators while giving new opportunities to consumers. Web3 platforms like Mirror and Foundation introduce new revenue streams to participants, allowing for crowdfunding, collaborating and equity ownership between producers and their customers. Programmable royalties will change the way every piece of media is created, traded and exchanged. Play-to-earn games will create new jobs on the internet, letting people truly live online.\n\nIt’s important to note that it’s still early days. The best crypto applications for consumers are still limited compared to Web2 experiences. Consumer adoption requires a shift in mindset, talent and user on-ramps to welcome those outside of the crypto space. And that means building valuable tools and experiences that benefit those building lives online, showcasing the power of Web3 and unlocking opportunities for those participating directly in products on top of the blockchain. \n\nThe dawn of consumer crypto is here. We now need to shine a light on it. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The views and opinions set forth herein are those of the author and not of TCG Capital Management, LLC or any of its affiliates.

{"id": "THsl74Z_igRdGrbaA_yhkgcqlvfHYOOd1fQA9d6U3PU", "title": "Tutorial: How to Vote in DAO Governance Using Snapshot", "body": "## What is Governance? 🏛️\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) typically rely on democratic voting mechanisms to facilitate coordination. Token holders are able to express their position on a variety of governance proposals by using their tokens to vote. \n\nAs important as voting is to the proper functioning of a DAO, participation is notoriously limited. While this is typical of many democratic institutions, voting on Ethereum is unique in that it requires a transaction to complete. This means a voter will typically be required to pay gas to signal their opinion on a proposal. This leaves many smaller token holders left out of governance since voting on every proposal can quickly become prohibitive due to gas costs.\n\nSo how do we lower expenses to ensure that anyone who wants to vote on a proposal can do so? \n\nOne solution is Snapshot. \n\n# What is Snapshot? 🗳️\n[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) is an off-chain multi-governance client that enables gasless voting for DAOs. Anyone can create a proposal or vote on an existing one with a simple signature stored on IPFS rather than an on-chain transaction, making DAO governance more affordable and accessible to the average community member. \n\nSnapshot is entirely open-source, and it has become one of the de facto voting methods for DAOs.\n\n# Vote on Snapshot Tutorial 📖\nIn this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to cast a vote using Snapshot. You’ll need:\n- **A Web3 Wallet** (e.g. MetaMask)\n- **Governance tokens of a DAO that uses Snapshot**\n- **Voting power** (more on this below)\n\nFirst, login to your wallet and head to https://snapshot.org/#/. \n\nNext, search for a DAO with a proposal you would like to vote on. DAOs with active proposals will have a green badge on the corner of their logo. Once you find one, click on the logo. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b2de4346-8ebb-4e7d-bb70-47ee4740a08b.jpeg?height=276&width=613)\n\nYou’ll be greeted with a list of current and past proposals for that specific DAO. Select the active proposal from the list that you'd like to vote on. In the example image below, you can see that Gitcoin has an active proposal called ‘Decentralize Gitcoin Allocation’ that ends in 2 days. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff400a9-7941-4296-a4b2-768875d9e7a0.jpeg?height=324&width=593)\n\nAfter clicking on the link, you will be redirected to a page that displays the specific details for that proposal. Before going any further, let’s review the information on this page:\n- **Strategies:** The default strategy is to calculate the balance of an ERC20 for each voter, but there are other strategies as well. For example, Gitcoin includes a delegation strategy.\n- **Author:** The individual or entity that authored the proposal.\n- **IPFS:** The IPFS link for the proposal. This is how the vote information is stored. \n- **Voting System:** The specific voting methodology being used. In our example, Gitcoin is using ‘Single choice voting’ which means the voter can only elect one outcome: ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. There are also the approval voting, quadratic voting, ranked choice voting, and weighted voting methodologies. \n- **Start Date:** The date/time in which voting goes live.\n- **End Date:** The date/time that voting ends.\n- **Snapshot:** Voting power is calculated at the \"snapshot\" of the proposal which occurs on the specific block number listed here. If you didn’t have any governance tokens as of this block number, you will not have any voting power for this specific proposal.\n- **Current Results:** The breakdown of votes thus far. In the example, you can see 1.45m $GTC have voted in favor of the proposal and 779.49 $GTC tokens have voted against it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5a85bbbb-847d-402f-9038-24c92dbe099c.jpeg?height=434&width=626)\n\nOnce you are ready to cast a vote, click **‘Connect wallet’** in the corner of the page and follow the prompts.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8840e594-5326-4b17-89e2-b4e282b38fca.jpeg?height=69&width=230)\n\nNow that your wallet is connected, select how you would like to vote in the ‘Cast your vote’ section of the page. Once ready, click **‘Vote’**.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8ae01ba7-ff1c-4bb4-a111-906cce168940.jpeg?height=283&width=617)\n\nYou’ll be prompted to confirm your vote. On this confirmation screen, you’ll be able to see which option you selected, the snapshot block, and your voting power. Click **‘Confirm’** after reviewing.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3e7c760d-9e83-42c9-a8dc-f18ad0e384fc.jpeg?height=408&width=429)\n\nYou will need to sign the transaction with your web3 wallet. No gas will be required as this is just a signature transaction. \n\nAfter you've voted, you will be able to see your name in the list of voters toward the bottom of the page. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7e249f5c-c254-4bf8-b0b4-7cc1122f0356.jpeg?height=467&width=607)\n\n# Congratulations! ✨\n\nIf you've followed this guide, you've now successfully voted in the governance of a DAO. Be sure to hop into the Discord or forums of the projects you're interested in so that you can stay up to date on upcoming proposals. \n\nInformed and engaged community members are the lifeblood of decentralized organizations. Participate, contribute, and vote for the future of Web3. \n\n", "timestamp": 1629436331, "digest": "6_ktnT68o9LyIbgnJdFzaNijiZDS-JIujkyVsktfmPs", "contributor": "0xC714a62A4BF7ff475C8dc3E589e1388342A38BB8"}

Of course you do.\n\nFirst, some context. We are [mCLUB](https://mclub.mirror.xyz/DqjMfZyjGbmwPFOA2cIzGV2OAXefdisSzAZee7-EOEg), a DAO focused on supporting creators and communities using the Mirror platform. We’re newly formed and have spent the past month figuring out who we are, how we want to operate, and what we care about. As of this Monday morning this week, we had collectively decided to make our first grant.\n\nThe timing was perfect for us to consider an imminent [music NFT drop](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/4pkg2xeNL6BlC-fya7CQ-HPG5FbY2o7Cx3FYQWHWvbI) from [Songcamp’s](https://twitter.com/songcamp_) second experiment, [Elektra](https://elektra.camp/#/). Songcamp exhibits everything that excites us about web3 projects. They’re wildly experimental, and they're brilliantly utilizing web3 tools to unlock latent creativity, art forms, collaboration structures, and business models that were impossible in the world of exploitative web2 platforms and institutions.\n\nAfter some internal discussion, our DAO overwhelmingly agreed to back this project with up to 5 ETH from our treasury. You can read the grant proposal we voted on [here](https://snapshot.org/#/m.club.eth/proposal/QmNncBiesgCvsMWNN15iDmUYc1W67JQQFrJ4hzvJcWsjbH).\n\nThere were three separate NFTs being auctioned off, and in line with our community-focused ethos, we decided to participate in Elektra-sanctioned [PartyBids](https://www.partybid.app/) for each song instead of trying to own them exclusively. In fact, our contributions pushed each PartyBid above the reserve threshold of 2 ETH, guaranteeing support for each creation and kicking off the 24 hour auctions.\n\n[https://twitter.com/mClubDAO/status/1427430673183281158](https://twitter.com/mClubDAO/status/1427430673183281158)\n\nShortly after, [BlockchainBrett](https://twitter.com/web3brett) raised the stakes by suggesting that he was going to start a music-focused DAO with anyone who bid on these songs.\n\n[https://twitter.com/web3brett/status/1427381444037459970?s=20](https://twitter.com/web3brett/status/1427381444037459970?s=20)\n\nAs if it wasn’t already cool enough, things got even more interesting the next day. [\"Don’t Worry\" by Water Signs](https://zora.co/watersigns/4555) was the first auction ending, and our PartyBid was in a bidding war with [Beets DAO](https://www.beetsdao.com/), a music NFT-collecting DAO. The price climbed above an amount they were able to spend themselves, and instead of joining our PartyBid, they decided they wanted more ownership and started their own. This kicked off the first PartyBid vs PartyBid auction in history (yes, something that has only existed for two weeks can have historical milestones).\n\n[https://twitter.com/prtyDAO/status/1427758523115610116?s=20](https://twitter.com/prtyDAO/status/1427758523115610116?s=20)\n\nLuckily, our party was more poppin', and with the support of BlockchainBrett and 15 others, we were able to outlast the other party and secure the first grant for mCLUB.\n\nThe remaining two auctions proceeded in similar fashion with our PartyBids facing off against BeetsDAO. In the end, we split the NFTs, with us winning [\"Outer Boroughs\" by Finch-3S](https://zora.co/finch3s/4554) and them winning [\"Crash Desire\" by AME RA](https://zora.co/amera/4556).\n\n[https://twitter.com/songcamp_/status/1427818054453547012](https://twitter.com/songcamp_/status/1427818054453547012)\n\nIt was a fun day for our DAO and many of the others who were participating, but ultimately what matters is that 12.3 ETH is being distributed directly to the creators of these three songs and the Elektra DAO treasury, of which they’ll also have ownership.

{"id": "tzL83ftbn7ZKcgT-NRLtF8GaTgm-7Oja5tS2MNNQDyg", "title": "Making PartyBid History with Songcamp Elektra and Beets DAO", "body": "\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/nft/e53b4555-e5e7-4b57-b55a-fb4c02eeedb8.jpg)\n\n\n\n*Written by [Josh Cornelius](https://twitter.com/joshcrnls), image by [Songcamp](https://twitter.com/songcamp_)*\n\nWant to read a story about two DAOs engaged in a partybidding war over music NFTs that unlock access to a third metaverse-building DAO, which will eventually lead to a tangentially related, music-focused DAO for all bidders on these auctions? Of course you do.\n\nFirst, some context. We are [mCLUB](https://mclub.mirror.xyz/DqjMfZyjGbmwPFOA2cIzGV2OAXefdisSzAZee7-EOEg), a DAO focused on supporting creators and communities using the Mirror platform. We’re newly formed and have spent the past month figuring out who we are, how we want to operate, and what we care about. As of Monday morning this week, we had collectively decided to make our first grant.\n\nThe timing was perfect for us to consider an imminent [music NFT drop](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/4pkg2xeNL6BlC-fya7CQ-HPG5FbY2o7Cx3FYQWHWvbI) from [Songcamp’s](https://twitter.com/songcamp_) second experiment, [Elektra](https://elektra.camp/#/). Songcamp exhibits everything that excites us about web3 projects. They’re wildly experimental, and they're brilliantly utilizing web3 tools to unlock latent creativity, art forms, collaboration structures, and business models that were impossible in the world of exploitative web2 platforms and institutions.\n\nAfter some internal discussion, our DAO overwhelmingly agreed to back this project with up to 5 ETH from our treasury. You can read the grant proposal we voted on [here](https://snapshot.org/#/m.club.eth/proposal/QmNncBiesgCvsMWNN15iDmUYc1W67JQQFrJ4hzvJcWsjbH).\n\nThere were three separate NFTs being auctioned off, and in line with our community-focused ethos, we decided to participate in Elektra-sanctioned [PartyBids](https://www.partybid.app/) for each song instead of trying to own them exclusively. In fact, our contributions pushed each PartyBid above the reserve threshold of 2 ETH, guaranteeing support for each creation and kicking off the 24 hour auctions.\n\n[https://twitter.com/mClubDAO/status/1427430673183281158](https://twitter.com/mClubDAO/status/1427430673183281158)\n\nShortly after, [BlockchainBrett](https://twitter.com/web3brett) raised the stakes by suggesting that he was going to start a music-focused DAO with anyone who bid on these songs.\n\n[https://twitter.com/web3brett/status/1427381444037459970?s=20](https://twitter.com/web3brett/status/1427381444037459970?s=20)\n\nAs if it wasn’t already cool enough, things got even more interesting the next day. [\"Don’t Worry\" by Water Signs](https://zora.co/watersigns/4555) was the first auction ending, and our PartyBid was in a bidding war with [Beets DAO](https://www.beetsdao.com/), a music NFT-collecting DAO. The price climbed above an amount they were able to spend themselves, and instead of joining our PartyBid, they decided they wanted more ownership and started their own. This kicked off the first PartyBid vs PartyBid auction in history (yes, something that has only existed for two weeks can have historical milestones).\n\n[https://twitter.com/prtyDAO/status/1427758523115610116?s=20](https://twitter.com/prtyDAO/status/1427758523115610116?s=20)\n\nLuckily, our party was more poppin', and with the support of BlockchainBrett and 15 others, we were able to outlast the other party and secure the first grant for mCLUB.\n\nThe remaining two auctions proceeded in similar fashion with our PartyBids facing off against BeetsDAO. In the end, we split the NFTs, with us winning [\"Outer Boroughs\" by Finch-3S](https://zora.co/finch3s/4554) and them winning [\"Crash Desire\" by AME RA](https://zora.co/amera/4556).\n\n[https://twitter.com/songcamp_/status/1427818054453547012](https://twitter.com/songcamp_/status/1427818054453547012)\n\nIt was a fun day for our DAO and many of the others who were participating, but ultimately what matters is that 12.3 ETH is being distributed directly to the creators of these three songs and the Elektra DAO treasury, of which they’ll also have ownership. In the old world, it would have taken over 10 million Spotify streams for them to realize this value.\n\nWe were hanging out in the Songcamp Discord with some of the artists while this was all developing, and many of them were in utter disbelief at what was happening.

If I don’t respond to an email, text, or tweet, well that’s because I’m celebrating.\n\nI’ve been told that turning 60 is a big one and to expect to feel a lot. I will make sure to do that but as many know, it is not my nature to do that. So I will have to work at it.\n\nI have cut back on blogging a lot in the last year. Four posts a week on AVC is now a lot. Many weeks there are only three. I’m hoping that the quality has gone up as the quantity has come down. At least that is the goal.\n\nI’ve caught a second (or maybe third or fourth) wind with my work in the last year. It is a combination of covid, climate, and crypto. The world is changing and there is so much energy being released from these changes that draws me back. At sixty, it is a different kind of work; less hustle and more conviction. I like that.\n\nAs the Gotham Gal and I enter our fifth decade together, I am struck by how much we have become one. We often say the same thing to each other at the same moment. A mind meld.\n\nAs I told my partner Albert this morning on text, I am a very fortunate person. Life has given me many blessings.

Palmer welcome to PaperclipDAO! 🖇\n\nWe weighed several factors in making a final decision on which trade to accept. We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well. We also had to make a hard call about whether to honor the past or push towards the future. Our final poll after hours of discussion was a dead heat:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7af0279e-a154-4986-9893-743dee2c21c1.jpeg?height=756&width=1169)\n\nIt wasn’t easy, but we ultimately decided to go with a trade that highlighted the future of NFTs. \n\nPaperclipDAO now owns a 1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card, which can be used in [Parallel](https://www.parallel.life/), a sci-fi collectable game composed of digital collectible cards that can be combined into decks that dictate the game (think Magic at the Gathering or Pokemon). The Earthen Concept Art NFT was given only to early supporters of Parallel, and it's gratifying to see people taking the opportunity to recount [the NFT's unique history](https://twitter.com/GarretteDVF/status/1425657844414746629?s=20). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/69760d51-7aa0-4025-be9e-15367b4fee13.jpeg?height=1620&width=1080)\n\nIt’s a promising future for digitally scarce, playable cards, and since the purchase of these NFTs funds the development of the game itself, it also demonstrates the wide range of utility of NFTs. Who knows, maybe the team will let us bestow some magical paperclip power? 💫\n\nThis decision wasn’t easy; we were blown away by the offers we received and quickly realized that the hardest part would be parting with the incredible NFTs that we couldn’t accept. Check out the full [Round 1 offer thread](https://twitter.com/PaperclipDAO/status/1425117547251343369) to see all the amazing offers. \n\nGiven the quick turnaround, we only have time to highlight a few of our favorites. In no particular order, here is our homage to the ones that got away in Round 1: \n\n- Our very first offer came from JPG’s [Maria Paula Fernandez](https://twitter.com/MPtherealMVP/status/1425118535857156101), who just plain got it and proposed a trade for [simulacra](https://opensea.io/assets/0x8644053aadb0df38e7734f5010fef643316bbb92/28) before we had explained the project at all. Legend. **EDIT:** There was actually a tie for the first offer, with [@AdrianLeb](https://twitter.com/adrianleb) offering a lovely [BlockArt](https://opensea.io/assets/0xb80fbf6cdb49c33dc6ae4ca11af8ac47b0b4c0f3/2544) at the exact same time as MP, making them co-legends. \n- Adam Cochran offered this [Cool Cat](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425206741084610566), complete with sunglasses and a great story. As competition heated up, he increased the offer to [4 Cool Cats](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425249645253496832). Adam later put forth an offer that absolutely blew his first two away! [He proposed a collection of 14 historic NFTs](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425487421895057408), in a collection titled Moments in Our History. This collection represents unique fists, influential artists, and rare defunct collectibles that helped shape the NFT space and have led to the NFT renaissance we're living right now. It’s an excellent read.\n- [A $HASH of the @paperclipDAO UNIv3 NFT](https://twitter.com/blasteasy/status/1425181303767543815) was also minted and proposed. Proof of Beauty is stunning. Just look at them. And to honor our project with a mint of the $PAPER/$CLIP NFT floored us. [Sisyphus](https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus) also offered [an original Proof of Beauty](https://opensea.io/assets/0xe18a32192ed95b0fe9d70d19e5025f103475d7ba/57896044618658097711785492504343953927315557066662158946655541218820101244980), for Beeple's first Everydays mint on-chain in another historic NFT moment offered for the first trade. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/826bf6cf-b6d7-420c-bade-3d6420592cfa.jpeg?height=1800&width=1125)\n\n- [MoonCatRescue](https://mooncatrescue.com/) is absolutely one of the great NFT stories, with a community rediscovering and rescuing these Mooncats that have been “trapped” since the project began in 2017 (!!!). No way to do it justice here--[you have to read about it](https://mooncatrescue.com/).

There’s nothing else like it--it’s a permanent NFT that will never leave your wallet. When you send it to someone it mutates and they get their own, permanent, NFT.

Creator Matt Furie is well known for creating Pepe the Frog back in 2005 for a comic called “Boys Club,” which subsequently went on to become the Internet meme that we all know and love. \n- [@JordanLzG](https://twitter.com/JordanLzG/status/1425259957658824709) splashed the pot by offering [The Title Open Edition by Pak](https://niftygateway.com/collections/pakopen). Pak is an anonymous creator at the forefront of experience-based art. His work was recently auctioned by Sotheby’s and his collection The Title (from which The Cheap hails) was one of the best NFT-based experiences in 2020. We were also offered 3 in Pak’s [The Flipper](https://opensea.io/assets/0x090c53bac270768759c8f4c93151bd1a808a280e/18700020009) series.\n- In a very special offer, [devops199fan](https://twitter.com/cjliu49/status/1425235759934541829) offered [#404/420 of the EthereumFilm Infinite Garden Bloom NFT](https://twitter.com/devops199fan/status/1425257222364295174) in collaboration with the one and only [pplpleasr](https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1) 🤩 . Each NFT is tied to select on-screen credits in the film, which will be the first feature-length Ethereum documentary and the first documentary funded via NFTs. \n- [Astrocryptids](https://twitter.com/CoffeeTimesTW/status/1425254256563482627?s=20) is a charming little project where a twitter transmission bot “beams” mysterious code to an artist who then creates algorithmic sprites with a unique star code. [We were offered 7](https://twitter.com/CoffeeTimesTW/status/1425293234381541381). \n- Artblocks is the premier name in abstract NFT art, and among several Artblocks curated pieces we were offered was a gorgeous [Rinascita](https://artblocks.io/token/121000845).\n- [Jonathan Mann](https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1425431457053487104), the [songadaymann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dgSLSe4qsY) himself, wrote us a song about the man that did/didn’t invent the paperclip! This ranked the highest in paperclip-iness! Truly the one that got away. He’s since started [an auction for the song](https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1425773677581324296?s=21) on Zora.\n- For the real OGs, we were offered a very rare [5x symmetrical clover](https://opensea.io/assets/0xb55c5cac5014c662fdbf21a2c59cd45403c482fd/226854885927226686664340372062743472810) (from Clovers.Network) of which only 55 were ever found. It has symmetry in both diagonals, x & y axes, and rotationally. It’s also a very lucky four leaf clover! \n- We were offered a [Pudgy Penguin](https://opensea.io/assets/0xbd3531da5cf5857e7cfaa92426877b022e612cf8/2581), [a Meebit](https://opensea.io/assets/0x7bd29408f11d2bfc23c34f18275bbf23bb716bc7/10204), and a [baby Bored Ape](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/56725515187736557735990102071773169311374405330094350701016781023838914740225) - a nod to the many emerging icons of the NFT world.      \nOne interesting offer included all three NFT standards: an ERC-20 ([an $XMON](https://etherscan.io/token/0x3aada3e213abf8529606924d8d1c55cbdc70bf74)), ERC-721 ([an Artblocks](https://opensea.io/assets/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/44000143)), and ERC-1155 ([a Parallel](https://opensea.io/assets/0x76be3b62873462d2142405439777e971754e8e77/10247)) \n- [Pixel Portraits](https://twitter.com/thepxlportraits) is a fun project with portraits of interesting people in the cryptopunks style.

Paperclip DAO has swapped one $PAPER/$CLIP NFT for the [1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card](https://opensea.io/assets/0x76be3b62873462d2142405439777e971754e8e77/42) offered by [@bitcoinPalmer](https://twitter.com/bitcoinPalmer/status/1425273580749742081). Palmer welcome to PaperclipDAO! 🖇\n\nWe weighed several factors in making a final decision on which trade to accept. We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well. We also had to make a hard call about whether to honor the past or push towards the future. Our final poll after hours of discussion was a dead heat:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7af0279e-a154-4986-9893-743dee2c21c1.jpeg?height=756&width=1169)\n\nIt wasn’t easy, but we ultimately decided to go with a trade that highlighted the future of NFTs. \n\nPaperclipDAO now owns a 1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card, which can be used in [Parallel](https://www.parallel.life/), a sci-fi collectable game composed of digital collectible cards that can be combined into decks that dictate the game (think Magic at the Gathering or Pokemon). The Earthen Concept Art NFT was given only to early supporters of Parallel, and it's gratifying to see people taking the opportunity to recount [the NFT's unique history](https://twitter.com/GarretteDVF/status/1425657844414746629?s=20). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/69760d51-7aa0-4025-be9e-15367b4fee13.jpeg?height=1620&width=1080)\n\nIt’s a promising future for digitally scarce, playable cards, and since the purchase of these NFTs funds the development of the game itself, it also demonstrates the wide range of utility of NFTs. Who knows, maybe the team will let us bestow some magical paperclip power? 💫\n\nThis decision wasn’t easy; we were blown away by the offers we received and quickly realized that the hardest part would be parting with the incredible NFTs that we couldn’t accept. Check out the full [Round 1 offer thread](https://twitter.com/PaperclipDAO/status/1425117547251343369) to see all the amazing offers. \n\nGiven the quick turnaround, we only have time to highlight a few of our favorites. In no particular order, here is our homage to the ones that got away in Round 1: \n\n- Our very first offer came from JPG’s [Maria Paula Fernandez](https://twitter.com/MPtherealMVP/status/1425118535857156101), who just plain got it and proposed a trade for [simulacra](https://opensea.io/assets/0x8644053aadb0df38e7734f5010fef643316bbb92/28) before we had explained the project at all.

As competition heated up, he increased the offer to [4 Cool Cats](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425249645253496832). Adam later put forth an offer that absolutely blew his first two away! [He proposed a collection of 14 historic NFTs](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425487421895057408), in a collection titled Moments in Our History. This collection represents unique fists, influential artists, and rare defunct collectibles that helped shape the NFT space and have led to the NFT renaissance we're living right now. It’s an excellent read.\n- [A $HASH of the @paperclipDAO UNIv3 NFT](https://twitter.com/blasteasy/status/1425181303767543815) was also minted and proposed. Proof of Beauty is stunning.

[Sisyphus](https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus) also offered [an original Proof of Beauty](https://opensea.io/assets/0xe18a32192ed95b0fe9d70d19e5025f103475d7ba/57896044618658097711785492504343953927315557066662158946655541218820101244980), for Beeple's first Everydays mint on-chain in another historic NFT moment offered for the first trade. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/826bf6cf-b6d7-420c-bade-3d6420592cfa.jpeg?height=1800&width=1125)\n\n- [MoonCatRescue](https://mooncatrescue.com/) is absolutely one of the great NFT stories, with a community rediscovering and rescuing these Mooncats that have been “trapped” since the project began in 2017 (!!!). No way to do it justice here--[you have to read about it](https://mooncatrescue.com/). We were lucky to be offered several Mooncats ([this one](https://opensea.io/assets/0xc3f733ca98e0dad0386979eb96fb1722a1a05e69/1549), [this one](https://opensea.io/assets/0x7c40c393dc0f283f318791d746d894ddd3693572/2223), and [this one](https://opensea.io/assets/0xc3f733ca98e0dad0386979eb96fb1722a1a05e69/18995)). \n- [Folia](https://twitter.com/foliafoliafolia/status/1425172915889266693)’s Kudzu virus is the genius brainchild of Billy Rennekamp, one of the NFT OG’s ([with the NFT to prove it](https://opensea.io/assets/0x72148fcae1d77eebcd9486af7e656bb736c213ef/3?embed=night)).

Pak is an anonymous creator at the forefront of experience-based art. His work was recently auctioned by Sotheby’s and his collection The Title (from which The Cheap hails) was one of the best NFT-based experiences in 2020. We were also offered 3 in Pak’s [The Flipper](https://opensea.io/assets/0x090c53bac270768759c8f4c93151bd1a808a280e/18700020009) series.\n- In a very special offer, [devops199fan](https://twitter.com/cjliu49/status/1425235759934541829) offered [#404/420 of the EthereumFilm Infinite Garden Bloom NFT](https://twitter.com/devops199fan/status/1425257222364295174) in collaboration with the one and only [pplpleasr](https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1) 🤩 . Each NFT is tied to select on-screen credits in the film, which will be the first feature-length Ethereum documentary and the first documentary funded via NFTs. \n- [Astrocryptids](https://twitter.com/CoffeeTimesTW/status/1425254256563482627?s=20) is a charming little project where a twitter transmission bot “beams” mysterious code to an artist who then creates algorithmic sprites with a unique star code. [We were offered 7](https://twitter.com/CoffeeTimesTW/status/1425293234381541381). \n- Artblocks is the premier name in abstract NFT art, and among several Artblocks curated pieces we were offered was a gorgeous [Rinascita](https://artblocks.io/token/121000845).\n- [Jonathan Mann](https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1425431457053487104), the [songadaymann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dgSLSe4qsY) himself, wrote us a song about the man that did/didn’t invent the paperclip! This ranked the highest in paperclip-iness! Truly the one that got away. He’s since started [an auction for the song](https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1425773677581324296?s=21) on Zora.\n- For the real OGs, we were offered a very rare [5x symmetrical clover](https://opensea.io/assets/0xb55c5cac5014c662fdbf21a2c59cd45403c482fd/226854885927226686664340372062743472810) (from Clovers.Network) of which only 55 were ever found.

Paperclip DAO has swapped one $PAPER/$CLIP NFT for the [1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card](https://opensea.io/assets/0x76be3b62873462d2142405439777e971754e8e77/42) offered by [@bitcoinPalmer](https://twitter.com/bitcoinPalmer/status/1425273580749742081). Palmer welcome to PaperclipDAO! 🖇\n\nWe weighed several factors in making a final decision on which trade to accept. We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well. We also had to make a hard call about whether to honor the past or push towards the future. Our final poll after hours of discussion was a dead heat:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7af0279e-a154-4986-9893-743dee2c21c1.jpeg?height=756&width=1169)\n\nIt wasn’t easy, but we ultimately decided to go with a trade that highlighted the future of NFTs. \n\nPaperclipDAO now owns a 1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card, which can be used in [Parallel](https://www.parallel.life/), a sci-fi collectable game composed of digital collectible cards that can be combined into decks that dictate the game (think Magic at the Gathering or Pokemon). The Earthen Concept Art NFT was given only to early supporters of Parallel, and it's gratifying to see people taking the opportunity to recount [the NFT's unique history](https://twitter.com/GarretteDVF/status/1425657844414746629?s=20). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/69760d51-7aa0-4025-be9e-15367b4fee13.jpeg?height=1620&width=1080)\n\nIt’s a promising future for digitally scarce, playable cards, and since the purchase of these NFTs funds the development of the game itself, it also demonstrates the wide range of utility of NFTs. Who knows, maybe the team will let us bestow some magical paperclip power? 💫\n\nThis decision wasn’t easy; we were blown away by the offers we received and quickly realized that the hardest part would be parting with the incredible NFTs that we couldn’t accept. Check out the full [Round 1 offer thread](https://twitter.com/PaperclipDAO/status/1425117547251343369) to see all the amazing offers. \n\nGiven the quick turnaround, we only have time to highlight a few of our favorites. In no particular order, here is our homage to the ones that got away in Round 1: \n\n- Our very first offer came from JPG’s [Maria Paula Fernandez](https://twitter.com/MPtherealMVP/status/1425118535857156101), who just plain got it and proposed a trade for [simulacra](https://opensea.io/assets/0x8644053aadb0df38e7734f5010fef643316bbb92/28) before we had explained the project at all.

As competition heated up, he increased the offer to [4 Cool Cats](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425249645253496832). Adam later put forth an offer that absolutely blew his first two away! [He proposed a collection of 14 historic NFTs](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425487421895057408), in a collection titled Moments in Our History. This collection represents unique fists, influential artists, and rare defunct collectibles that helped shape the NFT space and have led to the NFT renaissance we're living right now. It’s an excellent read.\n- [A $HASH of the @paperclipDAO UNIv3 NFT](https://twitter.com/blasteasy/status/1425181303767543815) was also minted and proposed. Proof of Beauty is stunning. Just look at them. And to honor our project with a mint of the $PAPER/$CLIP NFT floored us. [Sisyphus](https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus) also offered [an original Proof of Beauty](https://opensea.io/assets/0xe18a32192ed95b0fe9d70d19e5025f103475d7ba/57896044618658097711785492504343953927315557066662158946655541218820101244980), for Beeple's first Everydays mint on-chain in another historic NFT moment offered for the first trade. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/826bf6cf-b6d7-420c-bade-3d6420592cfa.jpeg?height=1800&width=1125)\n\n- [MoonCatRescue](https://mooncatrescue.com/) is absolutely one of the great NFT stories, with a community rediscovering and rescuing these Mooncats that have been “trapped” since the project began in 2017 (!!!).

Paperclip DAO has swapped one $PAPER/$CLIP NFT for the [1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card](https://opensea.io/assets/0x76be3b62873462d2142405439777e971754e8e77/42) offered by [@bitcoinPalmer](https://twitter.com/bitcoinPalmer/status/1425273580749742081). Palmer welcome to PaperclipDAO! 🖇\n\nWe weighed several factors in making a final decision on which trade to accept. We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well. We also had to make a hard call about whether to honor the past or push towards the future. Our final poll after hours of discussion was a dead heat:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7af0279e-a154-4986-9893-743dee2c21c1.jpeg?height=756&width=1169)\n\nIt wasn’t easy, but we ultimately decided to go with a trade that highlighted the future of NFTs. \n\nPaperclipDAO now owns a 1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card, which can be used in [Parallel](https://www.parallel.life/), a sci-fi collectable game composed of digital collectible cards that can be combined into decks that dictate the game (think Magic at the Gathering or Pokemon). The Earthen Concept Art NFT was given only to early supporters of Parallel, and it's gratifying to see people taking the opportunity to recount [the NFT's unique history](https://twitter.com/GarretteDVF/status/1425657844414746629?s=20). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/69760d51-7aa0-4025-be9e-15367b4fee13.jpeg?height=1620&width=1080)\n\nIt’s a promising future for digitally scarce, playable cards, and since the purchase of these NFTs funds the development of the game itself, it also demonstrates the wide range of utility of NFTs. Who knows, maybe the team will let us bestow some magical paperclip power? 💫\n\nThis decision wasn’t easy; we were blown away by the offers we received and quickly realized that the hardest part would be parting with the incredible NFTs that we couldn’t accept. Check out the full [Round 1 offer thread](https://twitter.com/PaperclipDAO/status/1425117547251343369) to see all the amazing offers. \n\nGiven the quick turnaround, we only have time to highlight a few of our favorites. In no particular order, here is our homage to the ones that got away in Round 1: \n\n- Our very first offer came from JPG’s [Maria Paula Fernandez](https://twitter.com/MPtherealMVP/status/1425118535857156101), who just plain got it and proposed a trade for [simulacra](https://opensea.io/assets/0x8644053aadb0df38e7734f5010fef643316bbb92/28) before we had explained the project at all.

As competition heated up, he increased the offer to [4 Cool Cats](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425249645253496832). Adam later put forth an offer that absolutely blew his first two away! [He proposed a collection of 14 historic NFTs](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1425487421895057408), in a collection titled Moments in Our History. This collection represents unique fists, influential artists, and rare defunct collectibles that helped shape the NFT space and have led to the NFT renaissance we're living right now. It’s an excellent read.\n- [A $HASH of the @paperclipDAO UNIv3 NFT](https://twitter.com/blasteasy/status/1425181303767543815) was also minted and proposed. Proof of Beauty is stunning.

[Sisyphus](https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus) also offered [an original Proof of Beauty](https://opensea.io/assets/0xe18a32192ed95b0fe9d70d19e5025f103475d7ba/57896044618658097711785492504343953927315557066662158946655541218820101244980), for Beeple's first Everydays mint on-chain in another historic NFT moment offered for the first trade. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/826bf6cf-b6d7-420c-bade-3d6420592cfa.jpeg?height=1800&width=1125)\n\n- [MoonCatRescue](https://mooncatrescue.com/) is absolutely one of the great NFT stories, with a community rediscovering and rescuing these Mooncats that have been “trapped” since the project began in 2017 (!!!).

There’s nothing else like it--it’s a permanent NFT that will never leave your wallet. When you send it to someone it mutates and they get their own, permanent, NFT.

Pak is an anonymous creator at the forefront of experience-based art. His work was recently auctioned by Sotheby’s and his collection The Title (from which The Cheap hails) was one of the best NFT-based experiences in 2020. We were also offered 3 in Pak’s [The Flipper](https://opensea.io/assets/0x090c53bac270768759c8f4c93151bd1a808a280e/18700020009) series.\n- In a very special offer, [devops199fan](https://twitter.com/cjliu49/status/1425235759934541829) offered [#404/420 of the EthereumFilm Infinite Garden Bloom NFT](https://twitter.com/devops199fan/status/1425257222364295174) in collaboration with the one and only [pplpleasr](https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1) 🤩 . Each NFT is tied to select on-screen credits in the film, which will be the first feature-length Ethereum documentary and the first documentary funded via NFTs. \n- [Astrocryptids](https://twitter.com/CoffeeTimesTW/status/1425254256563482627?s=20) is a charming little project where a twitter transmission bot “beams” mysterious code to an artist who then creates algorithmic sprites with a unique star code. [We were offered 7](https://twitter.com/CoffeeTimesTW/status/1425293234381541381). \n- Artblocks is the premier name in abstract NFT art, and among several Artblocks curated pieces we were offered was a gorgeous [Rinascita](https://artblocks.io/token/121000845).\n- [Jonathan Mann](https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1425431457053487104), the [songadaymann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dgSLSe4qsY) himself, wrote us a song about the man that did/didn’t invent the paperclip!

He’s since started [an auction for the song](https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1425773677581324296?s=21) on Zora.\n- For the real OGs, we were offered a very rare [5x symmetrical clover](https://opensea.io/assets/0xb55c5cac5014c662fdbf21a2c59cd45403c482fd/226854885927226686664340372062743472810) (from Clovers.Network) of which only 55 were ever found.

{"id": "4CNIFZbmu3AYaaII-7N9Te76GibqI7M9WXBHmEULAYo", "title": "BanklessDAO Bounty Board: An Upgrade for all Crypto", "body": "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are community-led organizations. They are built around a common [mission, vision, and values](https://www.notion.so/bankless/Mission-Vision-and-Values-05d66a9089d643d4981ffcad9e446163), which then translate into products and services that execute the core mission.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1428131199176773636\n\nA helpful [mental model](https://frogmonkee.substack.com/p/coordinating-labor-in-daos-the-dao) to use is that while startups source talent, by way of job boards, interviews, and a robust hiring pipeline, DAOs crowdsource talent from their community. People self-organize into niches based on what excites them and collectively begin to explore those ideas collectively. It is the DAO’s responsibility to enable new entrants to contribute and execute their ideas.\n\nBut this raises a question: Without any top-down delegation, **how does anything get done**?\n\n## Enter the Bounty Board\nThe toolkit for decentralized coordination is varied. One powerful tool is the Bounty Board - a centralized repository of discrete tasks with an associated price tag. Bounties are typically issued when the bounty creator does not have the time or skill to execute the requested task. \n\nIn a traditional organization, these tasks are delegated by a manager to their constituents; but when talent is crowdsourced, the task can be picked up by anyone based on their availability, interest, skillset, and compensation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f62ff5ef-3c38-424b-bfe6-28d930930ad5.jpg?height=653&width=1126)\n\nBanklessDAO began to implement an ad-hoc bounty system and even spun up a #bounty-board channel, but the flurry of Discord activity would often leave bounties unseen by many. Attempts to further organize have been made, like Forefront’s [bounty spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pAgFGj9qcY-7SUI7dhyL5_4affPQXosz_5z8U7vl68k/edit#gid=196077105), but it’s a more burdensome, manual process with no integration with the tools that crypto-natives are used to.\n\nAnd so, [IcedCool](https://twitter.com/Church_0x), [BrianPatino](https://twitter.com/BrianPatino_ETH), [Behold](https://twitter.com/0xBehold), [Paulapivat](https://twitter.com/paulapivat), Oktal, [Nonsensetwice](https://twitter.com/nonsensecodes), [BPetes](https://twitter.com/BryanPetes), and others embarked on a project to build a better solution.\n\n## Introducing the BanklessDAO Bounty Board\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6c625a9e-d897-495b-9b1c-fd5a6eef9832.png?height=903&width=1852)\n\nWe created the [BanklessDAO Bounty Board](http://bountyboard.bankless.community/) with the intention of turning it into a staple tool in any crypto organization’s coordination stack. It’s designed with Web3 in mind and already integrates with Discord. Let’s walk through a sample workflow.\n\nIntegrated with BanklessDAO’s native [DEGEN bot](https://www.notion.so/bankless/DEGEN-The-BanklessDAO-Discord-Bot-f5e1c8e3e9b546ce83025a8359f98da8), members can create a bounty with a simple `/bounty create new` command:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c3c4f9b9-7c43-4059-8d54-282d00dd83b7.png?height=227&width=887)\n\nAfter selecting the command, you are prompted to define the title, scope of work, success criteria, and incentive for completion. Once the command is submitted, you can now manage the rest of the flow via the URL that is passed to you from DEGEN via direct message, or via a series of emoji reactions. Furthermore, there are numerous commands available to assist in editing, listing, claiming, and removing bounties.\n\nHaving created the bounty, DEGEN bot populates a [website interface](http://bountyboard.bankless.community/) with the details, providing a clean central repository for all ongoing bounties.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ee722bca-aa55-4423-a2d5-99738980a9f8.jpeg?height=671&width=932)\n\nThe current iteration of the Bounty Board is limited in scope, requiring that claims be managed manually by the creator, rewards paid through the [Collab Land](https://collab.land/) tipping mechanisms, and payment denominated in $BANK.\n\nFor a detailed explanation of the workflow and an overview of the commands, please visit the DEGEN wiki at [The Bounty Board Commands and Workflow](https://bankless.notion.site/The-Bounty-Board-Commands-and-Workflow-7f15bbc3f2c744afab1cb5f90daac4a2).\n\n## The Future of Bounty Boards\nThe Bounty Board is in its early stages of evolution. However, understanding the insane level of development happening in the cryptosphere, it isn’t too difficult to consider what bounty boards may become. From soliciting work and connecting creators and builders, to deeper and richer relationships between DAOs and protocols, bounty boards may one day become the de facto form of labor organization. \n\nOur future plans include ways to automate payment smart contract escrows for any ERC20 token, allowing external organizations to create bounties for BanklessDAO members, multi-user claiming, dispute resolution, and [much more](https://www.notion.so/bankless/60fc57a6e8874e708575419976eb6dc2?v=12e44e4b946f4120ac908df662a3cb00).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e588ea23-0475-424d-a995-550c9346c653.jpeg?height=560&width=888)\n\nAs bounty boards become more blockchain native, it may not be too long before we see freelancers making a living on-chain via bounty hunting, and employment offers being made and picked up via a worker’s wallet history. We’ve talked about the [future of work](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-future-of-work) and [on-chain resumes](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/your-wallet-is-your-resume) before; this is the next step in its realization.\n\n## Bounty Boards as a Service \nGoing into this project, BanklessDAO knew that other crypto-organizations would benefit from a Discord and Web3 integrated bounty board. Having only released a primitive version, we’re very much in the product discovery phase. If your organization may benefit from having a Bounty Board of its own, we invite you to fill out the [form](https://tally.so/r/wAdey3) below. The entire Bounty Board project can be replicated and branded to your specification!\n\nLet’s #gobankless!\n\nhttps://tally.so/r/wAdey3", "timestamp": 1629469092, "digest": "sie3cTas4AaZ0xzRuAYIUvOyTBLqQ_ABOxVLJ_osJ2U", "contributor": "0xE71eFd5865A42Cb0f23146Dc8E056dBA4E67e9b7"}

Backers with at least 10 $PARTY tokens can now join the [PartyDAO Discord](https://discord.gg/uMJxGZ6emD).*\n\n[crowdfund://0x402eb84d9cb2d6cF66Bde9B46D7277d3f4a16B54?network=homestead](crowdfund://0x402eb84d9cb2d6cF66Bde9B46D7277d3f4a16B54?network=homestead)\n\nAn amazing community coordination paradigm called PartyBid has emerged this week. I want to capture it in this post and invite you to get involved in PartyDAO.\n\nBut first, PartyBid’s backstory is essential.\n\nIn a recent deep [dive into web3](https://www.notboring.co/p/unwitting-collaboration-and-web3), Packy McCormick cited Chris Dixon’s 2013 post “What the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years”, signaling readers to pay attention to what people are doing with web3 after hours. Appropriately, PartyBid was spawned from a Twitter thread by Dave White that began “It’s friday night, let's build a mechanism together!”\n\nAn hour and a half later, I replied with the following:\n\nIn short, a PartyBid is a pop-up DAO whose sole purpose is to win an NFT auction.\n\nThe idea was a response to a few drawbacks I see in NFTs. On the positive side, NFT auctions have found a clear product market fit over the past few months as a new, crypto-native way for creators to monetize their work, inspiring a wave of new people to wade into crypto. But I’d argue there's still an anti-social element to NFT bidding and ownership, for instance:\n\n* Only one person can win an NFT auction, excluding all other collections put forth from supporters who might have wanted to get involved with a work. Obviously, that also means only one person can own an NFT.\n* When you’re bidding, you’re bidding on your own. NFT auctions are single-player.\n* Crypto whales have an enormous edge over more humble patrons in these auctions.\n\nPartyBid aims to solve both the single-ownership and whale-dominance issue of NFT auctions by allowing bidders to pool their assets and bid as a collective. I see it working like this:\n\n1. A PartyBid (or multiple PartyBids) can be deployed for any NFT auction.\n2. Anyone can deposit ETH into the PartyBid, in return for a proportional stake represented by an ERC-20 token. They become partiers.\n3. The contract can be called to bid on the auction if it has enough ETH in the pool to place the highest bid.\n4. If it gets outbid, partiers can deposit more ETH into the PartyBid to make another bid.\n5. If the PartyBid wins, the DAO takes custody of the NFT. Token holders can vote on what to do with the NFT.\n6. If the PartyBid loses, funds are returned to the partiers.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a2b3f80b-56be-475d-8d79-765d88955d37.jpeg?height=1138&width=2024)\n\nThe idea took off. Only a few days later, @_anishagnihotri built an initial implementation of PartyBid.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1384372491053846531\n\nA testament to the power of sharing ideas online—where they’re only ever a retweet away from a talented developer bringing it to life—PartyBid had attained minimum viable meme status. Enough people shared it. Someone built it. Now, Anish’s build is already evolving, boosting the idea’s viability in the memepool.\n\nYesterday, Anish and company deployed the PartyBid code to bid on Colin and Samir's auction.\n\nThe success story even got its fairytale ending. The first PartyBid—deployed by Anish—won the auction for 9.70 ETH!\n\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2962](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2962)\n\nIt’s insane what the internet can do with an idea in two weeks, but we can take it even further. PartyBid could use a lot more work. Improved and generalized contract code. An audit by experienced solidity engineers. An interface that’s easy to use. Integration with popular NFT platforms, where all the action’s happening. Even Mirror integration!\n\nMeme power only gets an idea so far. To get to a production-ready smart contract or product, we need funding and coordination.\n\n### Introducing PartyDAO\n\nWhat if a DAO could form around PartyBid with the mission to get PartyBid production-ready and into the world?\n\nThe PartyDAO experiment starts now with the $PARTY crowdfund. Here’s how I see it playing out:\n\n* Backers can support the crowdfund with ETH in return for $PARTY tokens\n* $PARTY tokens represent membership in PartyDAO\n* The first feature of PartyDAO will be a tokenized Discord, gated by $PARTY. Backers will immediately be able to join the PartyDAO Discord.\n* $PARTY holders will coordinate in the Discord to decide on a plan for governance, development roadmap, and how to allocate the raised funds\n* 50% of $PARTY supply will be held back to airdrop on quality community members who'd like to participate but may not be able to back the project with ETH\n\nThe crowdfund will target a fundraise of 25 ETH, which will be deposited into a multisig governed by the backers. With PartyDAO, I imagine we could hire solidity developers to ensure PartyBid contracts are production-ready, hire designers and product engineers to build a web app and hire artists to create marketing materials, memes, and NFTs.\n\nThose are just some initial thoughts, and anything’s possible. Ultimately, $PARTY holders will decide.

Normally, I’d just [use personal signatures](/post/server-authentication-for-web3), but in this case, the data has a specific format, and I wanted to get the wallet signature prompt looking a little bit nicer than usual.\n\n## The World of Ethereum Signatures\n\nWhen signing some data with an Ethereum wallet, there are multiple signature types you can choose from. You can use the “regular” one, which will sign any string (this is what’s used to sign transactions); you can use personal signatures, which add a prefix to the signed message; or you can use typed data signatures, which allow you to define a format for the message the user will sign (and display it nicely on the signature prompt).\n\n## Let’s Type some Data\n\nFor this project, I decided to go with typed data signatures (or EIP-712 signatures). To start, you need to define your `types` (the structure the message will be using) and your `domain` (some information about your app).\n\n```js\n// Let's assume we're signing an email message\nconst message = {\n    from: {\n        name: 'Miguel Piedrafita',\n        wallet: '0xE340b00B6B622C136fFA5CFf130eC8edCdDCb39D'\n    },\n    to: {\n        name: 'Alex Masmej',\n        wallet: '0xD3e9D60e4E4De615124D5239219F32946d10151D'\n    },\n    contents: 'We need more NFTs.'\n};\n\n// Our domain will include details about our app\nconst domain = {\n    name: 'Ether Mail',\n    version: '1',\n};\n\n// Here we define the different types our message uses\nconst types = {\n    Person: [\n        { name: 'name', type: 'string' },\n        { name: 'wallet', type: 'address' }\n    ],\n    Mail: [\n        { name: 'from', type: 'Person' },\n        { name: 'to', type: 'Person' },\n        { name: 'contents', type: 'string' }\n    ]\n};\n```\n\nOnce we have our `domain` and `types`, we can use the `ethers.js` library to get our signature.\n\n```js\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers'\n\nconst web3 = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(provider)\n\nconst signature = await web3.getSigner._signTypedData(\n    domain, types, message,\n)\n```\n\n## The Verificathon\n\nNow we just need a way of verifying the signature in our server. For this, we’ll need the signature we just generated and the wallet address of the signer, as well as our `domain` and `types` from the last step.\n\n```ts\nimport { verifyTypedData } from 'ethers/lib/utils'\n\nexport const verifySignature = (signature, message, address): boolean => {\n    return verifyTypedData(\n        domain, types, message, signature,\n    ).toLowerCase() === address.toLowerCase()\n}\n```\n\n## In Summary\n\nThis took me quite a while to figure out (+2h 😅), so I thought I’d write it down for the next person that decides to go down this rabbit hole. Hopefully, it’ll help!", "timestamp": 1629477406, "digest": "lgIDdfbeDSElr0g7kaP0TZLkkjAqkQGPriauuYSrLlI", "contributor": "0xE340b00B6B622C136fFA5CFf130eC8edCdDCb39D"}

I want to capture it in this post and invite you to get involved in PartyDAO.\n\nBut first, PartyBid’s backstory is essential.\n\nIn a recent deep [dive into web3](https://www.notboring.co/p/unwitting-collaboration-and-web3), Packy McCormick cited Chris Dixon’s 2013 post “What the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years”, signaling readers to pay attention to what people are doing with web3 after hours. Appropriately, PartyBid was spawned from a Twitter thread by Dave White that began “It’s friday night, let's build a mechanism together!”\n\nAn hour and a half later, I replied with the following:\n\nIn short, a PartyBid is a pop-up DAO whose sole purpose is to win an NFT auction.\n\nThe idea was a response to a few drawbacks I see in NFTs. On the positive side, NFT auctions have found a clear product market fit over the past few months as a new, crypto-native way for creators to monetize their work, inspiring a wave of new people to wade into crypto. But I’d argue there's still an anti-social element to NFT bidding and ownership, for instance:\n\n* Only one person can win an NFT auction, excluding all other collections put forth from supporters who might have wanted to get involved with a work. Obviously, that also means only one person can own an NFT.\n* When you’re bidding, you’re bidding on your own. NFT auctions are single-player.\n* Crypto whales have an enormous edge over more humble patrons in these auctions.\n\nPartyBid aims to solve both the single-ownership and whale-dominance issue of NFT auctions by allowing bidders to pool their assets and bid as a collective. I see it working like this:\n\n1. A PartyBid (or multiple PartyBids) can be deployed for any NFT auction.\n2. Anyone can deposit ETH into the PartyBid, in return for a proportional stake represented by an ERC-20 token. They become partiers.\n3. The contract can be called to bid on the auction if it has enough ETH in the pool to place the highest bid.\n4. If it gets outbid, partiers can deposit more ETH into the PartyBid to make another bid.\n5. If the PartyBid wins, the DAO takes custody of the NFT. Token holders can vote on what to do with the NFT.\n6. If the PartyBid loses, funds are returned to the partiers.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a2b3f80b-56be-475d-8d79-765d88955d37.jpeg?height=1138&width=2024)\n\nThe idea took off.

Now, Anish’s build is already evolving, boosting the idea’s viability in the memepool.\n\nYesterday, Anish and company deployed the PartyBid code to bid on Colin and Samir's auction.\n\nThe success story even got its fairytale ending.

PartyBid could use a lot more work. Improved and generalized contract code. An audit by experienced solidity engineers. An interface that’s easy to use. Integration with popular NFT platforms, where all the action’s happening. Even Mirror integration!\n\nMeme power only gets an idea so far. To get to a production-ready smart contract or product, we need funding and coordination.\n\n### Introducing PartyDAO\n\nWhat if a DAO could form around PartyBid with the mission to get PartyBid production-ready and into the world?\n\nThe PartyDAO experiment starts now with the $PARTY crowdfund. Here’s how I see it playing out:\n\n* Backers can support the crowdfund with ETH in return for $PARTY tokens\n* $PARTY tokens represent membership in PartyDAO\n* The first feature of PartyDAO will be a tokenized Discord, gated by $PARTY. Backers will immediately be able to join the PartyDAO Discord.\n* $PARTY holders will coordinate in the Discord to decide on a plan for governance, development roadmap, and how to allocate the raised funds\n* 50% of $PARTY supply will be held back to airdrop on quality community members who'd like to participate but may not be able to back the project with ETH\n\nThe crowdfund will target a fundraise of 25 ETH, which will be deposited into a multisig governed by the backers.

And all DAOs start as small groups. Then as these groups grow they get more serious about how they organize and share value. That's what Web3 tools are here for: organizing resources and distributing ownership.\n\n![design by @nicogsworld](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c7fccbe4-da1b-46c2-8255-67fee6f4a161.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n[Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) describes DAOs as \"Telegram or Discord chats with a bank account\". And indeed in most cases DAOs today are *performed* more than they are actually decentralized or autonomous. And that's ok. We’ll see the new more sophisticated iterations of tokenized communities emerge in the next couple of months and years. But for now DAOs are still at the bank account or treasury stage, the first step in a multi-stage process.\n\n**In this post I’ll unpack how you may start growing an engaged community for your DAO.**\n\n## The DAO Community Growth Cycle\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49c2345b-b19f-483c-972a-8cffa580a67d.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nIn any organization people are the most important resource. Even if DAOs look to rely as much as possible on technology they follow this same rule. In order to succeed you’ll need to figure out how to *attract* talent and create a culture. You'll have to *recruit* the right people and keep them *engaged*.\n\n### Attract\n\nThe *attraction* phase is all about making yourself **visible to the right people** on Web2 platforms like Twitter.\n\nIn recent years content creators have accrued massive audiences by creating content that 1. their community enjoys and 2. complies with platform algorithms. The same rules for success apply to you here. Attention is scarce and content is your elbows in the crowd. Make sure to incorporate it as a core component of your community's culture.\n\nNext, another powerful leverage to attract people \\*\\*\\*\\*is your community members themselves. Members of a group share a piece of their identity. This **collective identity is one of your strongest selling points**.\n\nHave you seen how people in the Web3 space display exclusive NFT avatars as their profile pictures? How they display such or such community in their Twitter bio? We’re all [“status seeking monkeys”](https://twitter.com/packyM/status/1424715346976595972) and we’re always on the hunt for things to enhance our individual identities. This is part of the hidden value your community can provide.\n\nCryptopunks are a typical example of an [identity signalling](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/18/figma-ceo-dylan-field-talks-cryptopunks-nft-beeple-metaverse/) tool. Having a Punk as a pfp sends a very clear message: \"I'm a Crypto OG”, “I'm wealthy\", “I know people\". The result is that Jay-Z now has joined the CryptoPunk party.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7d5d1670-1d0d-454a-8129-a26b62277dcf.png?height=367&width=598)\n\nIn the early days and through your journey you'll need to understand what your typical \"community member [persona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience))\" is. Who are your most engaged followers and what they are looking for. The point is to understand what your collective identity is. i.e. How members may distinguish themselves from the rest of people.\n\nIn the Attract phase, pick your favorite social platform and engage with the people who get your vibe. There's no secret to it. **Some successful creators I know sometimes spend up to 80% of their time on Twitter**. Beware of not getting burned though because it's very easy to do so. Here is a fairly blunt tweet on growing visibility on Twitter.\n\nOnce you've created meaningful relationships over socials (yes, internet frens’!) you can open a more private Telegram or Discord chat and start recruiting the most promising people.\n\n### Recruit\n\n**Having people who care and participate is the most precious thing for your community.** A \"high quality\" member is one who is intrinsically motivated and provides support over a sustained period of time. Those who contribute time instead of capital tend to be the most valuable and rarest contributors.\n\nIn the early days, curation of new members will happen organically. through the process of getting to know and feeling \"attracted\" to each other. In the longer run as communities grow to dozens, then hundreds of members, curation can become more of a challenge. To deal with this you can put in place more formal filtering systems.\n\n**Some member curation processes are centralized while others are more community driven.** Be pragmatic with your initial choice. At SuperRare we’ve bootstrapped with a manual and centralized selection process which has helped make curation consistent. [FWB](https://fwb.help/), one of the most [successful tokenized communitiy](https://forefront.news/creators/friends-with-benefits-pro) out there uses a community-led committee to review and select applications. Holding the $FWB token now is only a prerequisite to having your application reviewed.\n\nFor even more advanced communities, one curation system that has proven successful in the recent past is the Mirror [Write Race.](https://mirror.xyz/race) A weekly on-boarding event where people campaign to get upvoted by $WRITE holders and gain access to the blogging platform. I’ve tried to break it down [here](https://twitter.com/albiverse/status/1365716128069267463) back in February. Every week the Write Race is a community rendez-vous that generates interactions and a sense of belonging among members. Weekly participation sits at 30% which is way above industry average when it comes to token voting mechanisms.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/acac2c0d-af35-416f-aa7d-942a272a8823.png?height=496&width=722)\n\n*See the excellent in depth analysis by [Andrew Hong](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297/status/1415054747778920456).*\n\n*Note on token distribution*: **in early stages of community building, illiquid tokens with some status attached seem to do best at retaining members**. If you look at engaged or successful communities like Mirror or CryptoPunks, tokens have either 1) high barriers to entry 2) or have been fairly illiquid for most of their history. On the contrary most fungible tokens tend to be 1) low barrier to entry especially in the early days 2) and fairly liquid. Make sure to take that into account when leveraging tokens to recruit community members.\n\n### Engage\n\n**A successful community is a \"many-to-many\" social environment**. This means turning a community member's experience from a single player to a multiplayer one.\n\nFind the right activity. The thing that resonates with your peers and that is better done as a group. But do not lose focus. Your goal as a community builder is to have community members engage with each other, the activity itself is a secondary concern. That can be a weekly mix contest if you’re a music oriented community (the Disclosure community does it!) or a weekly on-boarding event like the Write Race if you’re a fairly advanced community with a token. There are other cases of communities gathering around [NFT curation](https://whale.me/), [gaming](http://discord.gg/rnglife), [P2E](https://twitter.com/YieldGuild), [business courses](https://twitter.com/beondeck) etc.\n\n**The choice of the activity depends on your community member persona and community purpose**. See it as a first step towards a longer term goal. See it as a way to get members acquainted with each other. Over time It'll help the community move and work better together. Above all, see activities as a way to accrue energy and **momentum** in your Discord and Telegram. The more community members interact, the higher the chances for magical and unexpected things to happen.\n\n### Next: organizing and tooling\n\nThat’s the very first step. You’ll know that you are mastering the *-Attract*, *Recruit* and *Engage-* cycle once you have a core group of people engaging on a recurring basis and growing traffic in chats and socials. I see those things as the primary signs of a healthy community. Now, as[ Alex Zhang](https://twitter.com/alexxzzhang) likes to say: community building is more akin to gardening than it is to architecting. Remember to be open to unexpected projects or ideas. Consider embracing whatever emerges from interactions among members.  \\n  \\n In upcoming posts we’ll chat more about tooling and **how Web3 can be leveraged to *retain*, *align* and *organize* your community** in more or less sophisticated ways. Thanks for reading!\n\n[https://twitter.com/albiverse/status/1385532694902288385](https://twitter.com/albiverse/status/1385532694902288385)\n\n*Without waiting, jump in SeedClub's [Discord](https://discord.gg/uKckDPD99H) to chat, ask questions and tell us where you'd need help.

Pudgy Pengins (not a typo) [was just featured](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/penguin-nft-club.html) in the NYT, the cheapest CryptoPunk to buy is now $145K, and OpenSea—with $775M in volume this month after just 13 days—is on pace to do more volume in August than all other months combined.

This can be overwhelming at times, so to help investors make a bit more sense of it all, I decided to aggregate a list of my favorite indicators that I personally use to evaluate NFT projects:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/spencernoon/status/1426187363609456645?s=20\n\nIf you’re interested in the NFT space, I’d love to hear your feedback on the indicators listed here.

These use-cases include lending (Kashi), IDOs (Miso), and an upcoming NFT marketplace (Shoyu), thusshowcasing SushiSwap’s ambitions to become a DeFi super app. In terms of its core DEX product, activity across several key indicators has recovered, and it’s also soon to launch a new capital efficient DEX called Trident.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4d89234-47b4-4602-bebf-42320c2ea7f7\\_1600x844.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4d89234-47b4-4602-bebf-42320c2ea7f7\\_1600x844.png)\n\n*   SushiSwap’s liquidity between its two main chains (Ethereum and Polygon) has rebounded by over 50% in the past month.

We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well. In Round 1, we picked the future.

Range tokens can be incredible tools for treasury diversification as it is an on-chain option that is customizable for DAO needs. Success tokens are a new incentive-aligned way for VC funds to effectively invest in a “Series B” for DAOS. UMA is working closely with teams, and is also organizing leads from VCs interested in taking the other side of these deals.\n\n![Source: Token Terminal](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9389fa4a-4b86-4e66-bb91-1b9e7898023d_1600x1076.png)\n\n* UMA has $45M in total minted value, which represents assets created against collateral.

{"id": "2RlLFYnHvG-GGpLPvO48unzFXn3tnT1TMw6FDAkA2Yo", "title": "Algorithmic Insurance", "body": "The idea of Decentralized Insurance has been one of the classic examples for ideal use-cases of blockchain applications. Insurance providers may have incentives to withhold claims for as long as possible, and users have little transparency into the process — leading to an overall poor user experience. The idea of putting these insurance processes on-chain is an appealing one: insurance claims can be programatically & immediately paid out if some conditions are met, and everyone has full transparency on the state of the entire system at all times. For example, someone could buy travel insurance for their flight, and a smart contract could automatically payout if Google Flights reports that the flight was delayed.\n\nMany attempts at decentralized insurance have been tried over the years, but anything that touches the real world has not gotten much traction at all. Firstly, there are many concerns around getting *trustworthy* data on-chain — if a contract can be maliciously fed data that says a hurricane happened when it didn't, that on-chain weather insurance market is as good as useless. Secondly, the current set of Ethereum/DeFi users are not generally looking for vehicle/household/travel insurance on-chain — they are looking for something more *crypto-native*.\n\n# Smart Contract Insurance\n\nThe immense growth of DeFi in the last two years has single-handedly revived market demand for decentralized insurance products. Many individuals or funds have significant amounts of capital in these DeFi protocols, and *actually* want protection against smart contract exploits. Hence, a new wave of decentralized insurance protocols have sprung up in the last year, mostly focused on smart contract insurance.\n\nMost of these projects tend to innovate along two main axes — Payout Mechanism and Pricing:\n\nProjects like Nexus Mutual rely on a set of humans to determine if a smart contract exploit actually happened or not, and hence if payouts should happen. Others like Cozy Finance and Risk Harbour rely purely on specific on-chain conditions to be met to determine if a payout should happen.\n\nOn the pricing axis, some projects use Bonding Curves based on utilization rates to price insurance — e.g some formula that prices the cover based on the demand & supply for that insurance market. Others rely on a team of human experts to determine the \"fair\" value of coverage for a protocol based on information such as track record of the protocol not getting hacked, audits, and so on.\n\nThis post will focus on the Payout Mechanism of decentralized insurance protocols.\n\n# Algorithmic Payouts\n\nIn traditional finance, there would need to be all sorts of trusted intermediaries to verify if some event happened or not before an insurance company can pay out a claim. However, because smart contract exploits are purely on-chain events, we should be able to write programs on-chain that determine if the other on-chain events happened or not — zero trust assumptions required.\n\n<https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus/status/1415294150333841408>\n\nAs builders and investors in this space, we should always be on the lookout for things that blockchains uniquely enable which cannot be done in traditional finance — algorithmic insurance could be one of them.\n\n# How do they work?\n\nThe easiest way to think about how these systems work is that they are a prediction market on whether or not a certain condition within a smart contract is met. For example, if you lend USDC on Compound, your USDC balance should monotonically increase over time as interest is accrued — if you are suddenly unable to claim less USDC than you originally deposited, one could infer that a smart contract exploit has occurred. Since we can check this on-chain reliably, we can then create a prediction market as to whether or not `getPricePerFullShare() > 1` returns true or false.\n\nBecause Compound has never been exploited, we can imagine that most people would prefer to take the \"true\" side of the market — skewing the odds of the prediction market significantly. This creates attractive odds for the \"false\" side of the market — if by some chance Compound does get exploited they will get a huge payout, otherwise they will lose a small amount of capital. You can see how this starts to look like an insurance market, where the \"false\" bettors are paying a premium to the \"true\" bettors for a chance of a big payout if the prediction market resolves in their favor.\n\nFor more complicated DeFi protocols, we may want to define more complex payout conditions  than simply checking if a deposit token can claim sufficient underlying asset. For example, we could combine multiple conditions together, such as `totalAssets() > x && getPricePerFullShare() > 1`  or even define a condition that checks the contract state over some time period, such as `totalAssets` must not decrease by more than 50% within a 10-minute window or the condition will return true. The beauty of programmable finance is that we can create arbitrarily complex payout conditions because we know for sure that the on-chain checks will execute deterministically. Furthermore, since all these payout conditions are defined on-chain, we can *always* know when a market will pay-out, no matter how complex the conditions get — it is impossible to obfuscate the risk through legal \"terms and conditions\".\n\n# Potential Pitfalls\n\nWhen users buy smart contract insurance, they simply want to get covered if a protocol gets exploited. However, it can be potentially difficult to define through code *what* an exploit actually is. For example, a classic \"rug pull\" where the creator of a liquidity pool removes all the liquidity could lead to a user holding a bag of tokens that are worth $0. Is this an exploit, or is this expected behavior for providing liquidity in an AMM?\n\nOne \"solution\" to this problem is by simply letting the free market determine which markets are the canonical insurance markets for various protocols. For example, we may be able to create two different insurance markets for Compound: the first pays out if cTokens cannot claim >1 underlying, the second pays out if cTokens cannot claim >0.5 underlying. In my opinion, it is likely that the market will naturally converge around one of the two as the \"canonical\" insurance market for Compound, maybe through Schelling points like the Compound team advocating for one or the other — letting most of the liquidity stay within one market. It could be much less \"obvious\" which market should be the canonical market for a protocol if the complexity of it is high, but this free market approach assumes that the market will sort itself out.\n\nIn this model, it matters *a lot* which specific insurance market you are a buyer or seller of. It is possible that a protocol was obviously (to the human eye) maliciously exploited, but the payout condition that your market resolves on does not get triggered. Conversely, it is possible that insurance sellers may be \"unfairly\" forced to pay out a claim if an edge case in the protocol causes the payout condition to trigger even in the absence of a malicious exploit.\n\nHence, accurate communication about what the payout conditions entail are extremely important so that insurance buyers and sellers know exactly what they are signing up for. This is mostly a UX challenge, and translating the payout conditions from code into words is a non-trivial task. Teams may be tempted to obfuscate the risks of insurance selling as \"risk-free yield\" to attract TVL, or present the products to buyers as all-encompassing smart contract insurance to boost their volumes.\n\n# Beyond Insurance\n\nAlthough the market for smart contract insurance is huge, this type of protocol can also be used to create markets for exotic swaps aimed towards speculators. Changing the payout condition from things that \"should never happen\" to \"should *rarely* happen\" makes it much more interesting for speculators who are looking for asymmetric opportunities.\n\nComposability also allows developers to combine these markets in arbitrary ways, for example rehypothecating the collateral used to sell insurance in one market as collateral in a different market, letting one pool of capital sell insurance on multiple (hopefully uncorrelated) things at the same time.\n\nAlgorithmic Insurance opens up the design space significantly for interesting financial products on-chain because it is purely self-contained and does not rely on human decision making to payout. This accelerates the rate of the creation of new products, as well as allows unlimited composability/programmability — which is why we are building in DeFi in the first place.", "timestamp": 1629496670, "digest": "72Oo_gd-e_XxyX7q8R88wQeoTXh69YZ9nXJYIwmMEDU", "contributor": "0xe16c0E1Bf3B75F67E83C9e47B9c0Eb8Bf1B99CCd"}
