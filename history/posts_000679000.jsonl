The BauDAO paradigm includes many novel software mechanisms that 1) reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of various urban assets, 2) enable multi-tier governance protocols for determining and modifying ‘program’, and 3) sharply decreasing capital barriers to ownership status by several orders of magnitude via smart contract crowdfunding mechanisms. Eventually, the BauDAO becomes an Operating System which is applicable to the breadth of architectural typologies, including residential buildings, creative collectives, schools, and co-ops. Lastly, we argue that architects are uniquely positioned to redefine these socio-economic parameters of ownership and governance (Form follows Finance) by removing parasitic developers and the rentier system.

A team of visual artists + project operatives were also formed to provide the visual and rollout support of the resulting songs. \n\nOn **Monday April 19** — one week into camp — a sponsorship NFT called *“The Unlock”* was minted to raise the funds necessary to distribute the songs. [Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq) won the auction, and are forever etched into the Songcamp story as the first ever on-chain supporters of the project. \n\nOn **Monday April 26**, the two-week camp came to a close. All teams delivered their final masters + cover artwork. \n\nOn **Monday May 3** (*aka today*), the 3 songs were minted as 1/1 NFTs on Catalog and are now up for auction here on Mirror. \n\n# The Songs\n\n### “[Static Twist](https://beta.catalog.works/thelunarveil)” by Lunar Veil\n\n*The Lunar Veil is Thys, Hvdson and Samsonite*\n\nA nocturnal dissociative narrative, twisting through sharp corners, from low fidelity analog machines to maximalistic digitalistic bordering the hystericalistic, via a strictly mature age appropriate noise fetish, carrying the naive hope to bring it all home in one piece.\n \n### “[Hold On Hope](https://beta.catalog.works/driftwoodtx)” by Driftwood TX\n\n*Driftwood TX is Gavin Slate, Kevin Paris and Rowan Spencer*\n\nDriftwood: shaped by rough waters, wind, light and shadow.

We are using Mirror’s Splits tool in order to instantaneously and trustlessly split all auction proceeds to their rightful recipient. *To see this breakdown in action, scroll down to the Split blocks below.*\n\nBecause Mirror, Catalog, and the Zora protocol take zero transaction fees — **100% of the funds from these three NFT auctions flow directly to those involved in the project**.\n\n### The Creator Fee Routing\nThe creator fee — which was setup on Catalog’s front-end at the time of minting — is set at 25% for each of these songs. The creator fee will also be shared by all contributors in the same relative proportions as above.\n\nCurrently, the Zora protocol does not support the separation of a Creator Fee from the Creator’s wallet. This means that the creator fee will go directly to the wallet that minted the NFT. Because of this, our plan is as follows: once the auction closes and the creator fee flows into the band’s wallet, that wallet will manually send the creator fee to its respective Split block address. This way, all 100% of the auction proceeds will end up in that song’s Split.\n\n# The Splits\n\nThese are the split blocks that are plugged into the 3 NFT auctions above. Each one is broken down amongst the contributors to each specific song + the project as a whole.\n\nOur musicians are denoted above in the “Songs” section.

We played with the idea of Songcamp being this *“lower layer”* that spins up collectives, and the participants within each collective receiving all proceeds resulting from the creations.\n\nIn that way we start to see two distinct layers here:\n\n1) the Songcamp base “protocol” layer, and;\n2) this first sprint within Songcamp\n\nRight now, in that this is the first project, those two layers feel pretty flush. And to keep things simple, we concluded on a share of 10% of each auction to go towards the Songcamp treasury and its future projects.\n\nThat said, we are excited to continue this conversation.

I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn’t meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you’d think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend’s living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn’t just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it’s not just a technology. It’s a philosophy. It’s a belief system. It’s a way of viewing the world. It’s about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you’re batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the “aha moment” when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn’t have to sign up for Stripe. I didn’t have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn’t have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas. But a couple months ago I read a [manifesto](https://cryptomedia.wtf/) by [Zora](https://zora.co/) that changed how I thought about crypto.\n\nIt described a world where crypto could be used to give any digital media file (eg an image, a song, an essay, digital art, etc.) property rights. It explained how cryptonetworks could turn digital media into liquid financial assets, secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.\n\nAlthough the individual ideas weren’t new, they were combined and articulated in a way that just made sense. And not just to me.\n\n[Digital artists](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9), [athletes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html), [social media influencers](https://cryptoslate.com/logan-paul-nfts-sell-3-5-million-worth-on-first-day-of-release/), [tech executives](https://scottbelsky.medium.com/the-furry-lisa-cryptoart-the-new-economy-of-digital-creativity-6cb2300ea081), [media executives](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI), and [journalists](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1366554892035219462) that never took the crypto weirdos seriously, seem to be taking notice.\n\nBut let’s be real. Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there’s been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it’s a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it’s a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn’t just a technological revolution. It’s also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I’m old and senile, I believe we’ll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that’ll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it’s at least worth trying.", "timestamp": 1620084480, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

It is called The New Builders and it came out this week. You can purchase it at all the places [listed here](https://thenewbuilders.com/#buy).\n\nThis bit from [the book’s Amazon page](https://www.amazon.com/New-Builders-Face-Future-Business-dp-1119797365/dp/1119797365/) explains The New Builders’ message:\n\n> The dominant image of an entrepreneur as a young white man starting a tech business on the coasts isn’t correct at all. Today’s American entrepreneurs, the people who drive critical parts of our economy, are more likely to be female and non-white. In fact, the number of women-owned businesses has increased 31 times between 1972 and 2018 according to the Kauffman Foundation (in 1972, women-owned businesses accounted for just 4.6% of all firms; in 2018 that figure was 40%). The fastest-growing group of female entrepreneurs are women of color, who are responsible for 64% of new women-owned businesses being created.\n>\n> In a few years, we believe women will make up more than half of the entrepreneurs in America.\n\nSeth sent me a manuscript about six months ago and I read with interest the stories of these women of color starting businesses of all kinds. This is not the entrepreneurship that I tend to write about here at AVC, but in many ways it is more important, more courageous, and more powerful.\n\nIf you want to be inspired and encouraged, [pick up The New Builders](https://thenewbuilders.com/#buy) give it a read.\n", "timestamp": 1620123466, "digest": "5zApBy_wUi6BNG_2p29x9nHi8cTkcNWsrNY2VqtTBZE", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn’t meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you’d think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend’s living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn’t just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it’s not just a technology. It’s a philosophy. It’s a belief system. It’s a way of viewing the world. It’s about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you’re batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the “aha moment” when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn’t have to sign up for Stripe. I didn’t have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn’t have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas.

Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there’s been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it’s a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it’s a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn’t just a technological revolution. It’s also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I’m old and senile, I believe we’ll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that’ll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it’s at least worth trying.", "timestamp": 1620143199, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

Read through the end to find out why.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/82237053-7e22-484b-a906-4eb1bd7c8417.png?height=1626&width=2376)\n\n\n[1](about:blank#fn1)\n\nFrom the internet’s beginnings, we were promised that it would be the great equalizer. Analysts and tech prophets of the early 2000s wrote think pieces about how tech would transform the power dynamics of modern life and erode the hierarchies of society.\n\nBut the bright-eyed optimism of the early 2000s has been almost universally replaced by a techno-dread, a feeling that technology is creating more problems than it’s solving.\n\nToday's digital spaces, rather than democratizing wealth and access, amplify the inequities of the physical world.\n\n[One study](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/02/why-almost-no-one-is-making-a-living-on-youtube/) found that making it to the top 3.5% of YouTube channels—which means about 1 million views each month—only gets you $12,000 to $16,000 a year, right around the federal poverty line.\n\nFor all the talk about the democratization of the creator economy, thus far, it’s become a superstar-driven, winner-take-all affair, where a small number of people do incredibly well, while the rest struggle.\n\nSherwin Rosen attributes this to [joint consumption technologies](https://www.uvm.edu/pdodds/files/papers/others/1981/rosen1981a.pdf). Despite the internet giving everyone the same access, the best performers - even if marginally more ‘talented’ than the rest - can also now reach an internet-scale audience and serve a much bigger market, reaping an even greater share of wealth. In [The Rise of the 10x Class](https://www.drorpoleg.com/rise-of-the-10x-class/), Dror Poleg argues this dynamic is now carrying over to all parts of knowledge work, as the Internet makes it possible for people to work from anywhere and earning potential is no longer capped by geography.\n\nIn her seminal piece, [The Creator Economy Needs a Middle Class](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class), Li Jin argues that it is up to us to build platforms that strengthen the creator middle class and lays out design decisions that can help make success attainable by many.\n\nOut of the turmoil of the last twenty years, new and hopeful possibilities are emerging. Today, we’re seeing the confluence of a few major cultural and technological trends that make us optimistic that the vision of the Internet we had decades ago - creative, quirky, diverse, accessible, democratic - is making a comeback:\n\n1. A renaissance of individualism on the Internet that changes the definition of talent\n2. A shift away from ad-funded models towards creator empowerment\n3. Web3 technologies that unlock infinite remixability and more granular distributions of value\n\n### A Renaissance of Individualism on the Internet that Changes the Definition of Talent\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/29efa833-5753-4514-b7c9-6afd3fce6635.png?height=866&width=2256)\n\nThe assumption underlying the winner-takes-all market dynamic relies on creators being judged simply by a talent or excellence standard. However, we ignore that taste and talent are co-determined. Talent is the name we give to people who best deliver what we prefer. So if we disagree on what’s “best”, we disagree on who is most talented.\n\nEvery sport that uses ‘mechanical judges’, like stopwatches, instead of human ones are judged solely against an excellence standard. These athletes conform to a taste-free talent vector. We see the entry of a taste vector in Olympic sports that have human judges, such as gymnastics, figure skating and freestyle skiing. To become good at these sports, one must also move towards “connoisseurship”. This requires the development of a “[discriminative faculty to judge and express taste according to the aesthetic principles of a consumption domain](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/18-107_582d03d9-92fd-4290-8cc3-d720848ef6a8.pdf)”. For a long time, internet content was at the behest of the rigid mechanical judge that is “number of subscribers” or “view count”.\n\nTo demonstrate the phenomenon of taste distribution more practically, any walk down the supermarket aisles will show that the assortment needed to cater for a diversity of tastes broadens as one moves from say paper towels to soups to wines - products of increasing hedonic value. There is not much dispersion of preferences for paper napkins on any dimension other than price/sturdiness. But that is not true for even the subset of wines that sell in supermarkets. The same applies on the internet.\n\nBut what do people end up preferring? [Holbrook](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/3039/aaa-JCR-Publication-October-2007.pdf) theorizes that people, as a whole, are much more dispersed in what they prefer than is the ‘expert consensus’. Holbrook’s work draws from [Bordieu’s](https://web.stanford.edu/class/think53/bourdieu17.pdf), who famously discussed that those with the highest volume of “cultural capital” dictate what’s deemed “good taste” - and therefore “what’s best”.\n\nBut how do you accumulate the “cultural capital” to dictate “what’s best”? Bordieu, whose work is rooted in the study of the French bourgeoisie, describes how “the working-class ‘aesthetic’ is a dominated aesthetic...obliged to define itself in terms of the dominant aesthetics”. Holbrook argues that in more individualistic contemporary cultures, this gets distorted and we end up with more heterogeneous tastes.\n\nWinner-take-all outcomes happen in cultural markets under the influence of received expert opinion. But that’s at odds with the internet’s promise to “democratize everything” and to allow us to express our individuality - a culture that flourishes when we can each define what “talent” means to us and that is antagonistic to forced standards and received opinion.\n\nThus far, platforms as well as a select few “influencers” have taken on the role of “expert” taste-making and that has had a profound effect on what has social and cultural value.\n\nAnd so, we introduce “Jad’s Theory” (of talent & taste on the Internet). We’re witnessing a renaissance of individualism on the internet - a breakup with institutions and the rise of the individual and, with that, an unbundling of internet communities. For the creator middle class to rise, we need to see higher resolutions of taste preference and a breakup with singular, discriminatory platform algorithms and the opinion of the ‘few’ that arbitrate taste and force today’s dominant aesthetic. With that, individuals can decide on “what’s best” for themselves, allowing for the talent power law to play out across more taste vectors and spreading the opportunity to be perceived as “the best” - and, with that, spreading the opportunity to profit from that.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b8fb77c9-8409-4da6-9a59-7aa9014e35a0.png?height=988&width=2282)\n\n\n### A shift away from ad-funded models towards creator empowerment\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/50128c84-ac67-4904-982a-0c0abe7c5a85.png?height=1074&width=2094)\n\nWe’re currently living through a shift in the business model of the Internet, from ad-revenue to direct-to-creator monetization. We can’t underscore enough how profoundly this alters incentives - platforms are now less focused on driving eyeballs and more focused on building tools that make creators money.\n\nAd-funded models require content to be managed at scale, and as advertisers are the main customer, they start to fill the role of the “expert” that defines what is valuable. This causes content to naturally hew to what’s deemed ‘advertiser-friendly’ and the more popular becoming even more popular.\n\nThis also means that in an ad-driven world, monetizing your social presence is only accessible to popular creators, and the size of your fanbase is the single metric that matters.\n\nNew, creator-centric business models enable monetization based on intensity of fandom, not size. [Swipehouse](https://swipehouse.co/) & [Pearpop](https://pearpop.com/), for instance, allow fans to pay for interactions, something that makes sense for creators with 10,000 followers or 10 million followers.\n\nWhether it’s Substack leading the charge on newsletters, Clubhouse [announcing plans for creator payments](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/clubhouse-announces-plans-for-creator-payments-and-raises-new-funding-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/), Soundcloud introducing [fan-powered royalties](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/soundcloud-is-about-to-revolutionize-streaming-payouts-launching-user-centric-royalties-for-100000-indie-artists/), Twitter [unveiling Super Follow](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers), or Snapchat Spotlight distributing over $1m to creators every day, we’re seeing platforms offering a slew of on-platform revenue options, with a renewed focus on aligning their business models with creators of all sizes. This puts the onus on the user to decide “what’s best”.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4afdcea-75cb-41f8-88a3-2184daa3d2ac.png?height=920&width=1278)\n\nHigh willingness to pay creators, along with better methods to monetize creative output is a potent combination that will lead to a massive rise in the number of people making money online, and new ways to scale income without scaling time. The opportunities around passive income will become a new keystone of the user experience of these platforms, pulling many creators out of the labor stack and into the capital stack. The mom-and-pop businesses of tomorrow will be the Clubhouse hosts, Substack writers, Twitch streamers, Discord Community Managers, Shopify dropshippers, TikTok stars, etc.\n\n\n### Web3 technologies unlock infinite remixability and more granular distributions of value\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/90d89a70-f3e9-4d8f-96d2-6fe7c98ecdb8.jpg?height=1324&width=2184)\n\n\nTikTok is proof that ease of remixing drastically lowers the barrier to creativity. When everything becomes a base from which you can create new content, the creative affordances are infinite. Usually, the original creator’s work is stolen and the distributor wins. [Stories](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/jalaiah-harmon-renegade-creator-viral-dance) like the [creator of the Renegade dance](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/the-original-renegade.html) that took off when Charli D'Amelio did it getting “frustrated because they weren’t tagging me or giving me credit” wouldn’t exist if everyone “on-chain” saw the financial reward from the rise of a remix.\n\nEvery idea, every project, every piece of content is just a remix of ideas that came before it. In the past, it hasn’t been possible to track the provenance of these ideas or to compensate their originators when they are being used. But technology is on the cusp of enabling us to compensate people for all instances in which their work ends up being useful.\n\n**The true power of Web3 technologies is the potential to reshape how value is created, shared, and distributed on the Internet, making distributing value as easy as sending and receiving an email. That’s a fundamental technology unlock that makes it possible for creators on the internet to earn more of the value they create.**\n\nAn underexplored undercurrent of Web 2.0 monetization tools is that creators have been incentivized to publish *good enough* content frequently vs. *great content* sporadically.\n\nOn Substack, for example, you’re paid monthly, creating pressure to write consistently. The problem is not just the inevitable burnout that comes from having to churn out 1-2 posts a week. The problem is this heavily skews towards pumping out bland and mediocre half-baked thoughts you’ve had a day to work on, not evergreen content that will still be valuable in five years.\n\nBut what if your back-catalog wasn’t stagnant, but rather an ever-evolving source of passive income? What if the value of your work was driven by the number of references and citations, and more references meant more dollars? What if the ROI of an essay that took hundreds of hours to write was orders of magnitude higher than those designed for virality or disposability?\n\nWe’re particularly excited about a web that can route economic value to sources of inspiration, one that can lead to a revival of the back-catalog resulting in a renewed focus on quality over quantity,and one **where *win and help win*** is the guiding philosophy.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a66ec04-ee51-4d22-ae10-ea029979fe4c.png?height=1626&width=2376)\n\n\n**NFTs give us a way to honor, in perpetuity, the people who’ve influenced our work.**\n\n### With that spirit in mind, this essay will be an experiment in **‘Attribution+’ -** where we not only attribute sources of inspiration but route economic value to them.\n\nIn practical terms, this means we are minting this essay as a NFT, and the proceeds of the NFT sale will be split between the authors AND the individuals that have influenced the **work.**\n\n\n### Acknowledgments\n(thought partners + people whose work we referenced directly in the essay)\n\n[Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18)\n[John Deighton](https://twitter.com/HBSmktg)\n[Leora Kornfeld](https://twitter.com/lk617?lang=en)]\n[Brandon Baraban](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonbaraban/)\n[Gabriel Nessim](https://twitter.com/wacko_gabriel)\n[Dror Poleg](https://twitter.com/drorpoleg)]\n[Patrick Rivera](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera?lang=en)\n[Balaji](https://twitter.com/balajis)\n[Josh Nissenboim](http://joshnissenboim.com/)\n[Tanay Jaypuria](https://twitter.com/tanayj)\n[Caroline Nguyen\n](https://twitter.com/spacexponential?lang=en)\n\n\n### **How will the proceeds of the NFT be split?**\n\n- 60% of the proceeds will be split between the authors, Sari and Jad\n- 30% of the proceeds will go to the pool of thought partners we reference above, whose ideas and feedback were instrumental in shaping our own.\n- 5% will go towards [Josh Nissenboim](http://joshnissenboim.com/), the man behind the graphics.\n- 5% will go to readers (like you) that share the essay.\n\n### **What are the benefits of owning this NFT?**\n\n- Be a proud owner of an experiment that honors the original ideals of the Internet - users and creators, unconstrained by intermediaries, sharing ideas and economic upside\n- A powerful signal to the world that you support the “win and help win” worldview, and are, unabashedly, an **Internet optimist.**\n- The prospect of turning a profit by reselling the NFT down the line (Patronage+)\n- Own the underlying illustrations we created for the essay.\n- We’ll also send you physical prints of the four illustrations (one of a kind because this is the only time we’ll ever print or sell them) which, TBH, we’d hang in our powder rooms - they’re great dinner conversation starters for the intellectually inclined.\n- A 1hr Zoom call with Sari and Jad to dive deeper into the thesis (for anyone who bids over 0.1ETH is invited to participate)\n- A lifetime [Startupy](https://startupy.world/) membership and early access to [koodos](http://koodos.com/) (for anyone who bids over 0.5ETH)", "timestamp": 1620145333, "digest": "etHY_neWXosxDJpGOhzuwi-cB0qOvMco_iwO5yJ1Ai0", "contributor": "0xF9875C1544f2C9AeACEc50feD687D984dDAa9D00", "nft": "{\"nftTransactionHash\": \"0x952422b30153269a7a48094aa506b9cd62faf011cd99355a2c2f1468a7c7e84d\"}"}

Special thanks. Instagram tags. These are a few ways we incentivize and credit names and works that have contributed to or influenced our work—whether an old idea that sparked a new one or a hair and makeup artist who worked on a model’s latest cover shoot. These citations come with their own benefits. They reinscribe a thinker’s influence in academia. They loosely attach an intellectually generous friend to another friend’s project. They drive followers from one social account to another—yielding dividends of clout.\n\nSplits, Mirror’s latest feature, present a truly exciting alternative to involving people in your work. From a monetary perspective, collaborators typically have to divy up their earnings manually. That process relies on trust, manual coordination, and sometimes a ton of paperwork and legal overheard. Split’s crypto-native approach replaces a social contract with code-enforced rules that can’t be fudged.\n\nOn a crazier level, splits redefine what collaboration is. Traditionally, it involves a group of people getting together and churning something out. You’ve got to get people in the same space—whether that be a remote vacation home or a shared Google doc—and there’s usually a common objective. Splits make the citation and incentivization of participants so easy that the nature of one’s participation could be as ephemeral as a conversation shared on a late night subway ride from three years ago. The participant might barely remember.\n\nCollaboration then extends to who inspired your idea and to what extent. Who originally gifted you your *Finite and Infinite Games* paperback? Who’s always been there to lend their opinion or retweet your post? Who appeared in your dream last night? Which charity do you feel could benefit from your work? And because crypto allows economics to route between any smart contracts, split value can flow beyond just people to entities like DAOs, crowdfunds or NFTs.\n\nSplitting is the new tagging, and it’s just as easy. If Web2 was about social graphs—where a tagged photo connects each participant who attended last night’s dinner party—Web3 is about economic graphs, connecting entities whose influence is baked into a work. It’s not only cool that those entities get money, but that it begins to create a fascinating ledger of where ideas from different sources intersect.\n\nTo help inaugurate this new feature, Jack Butcher (aka [@visualizevalue](https://twitter.com/visualizevalue) on Twitter) has minted a single edition NFT titled Infinite Players and will use Mirror’s split feature to evenly route proceeds between ETH addresses who have supported his work in the past.\n\n[Token #3039](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3039)\n\nStay tuned for our technical breakdown of splits tomorrow and check out splits in action elsewhere on Mirror:\n\n- [Power to the Person](https://notboring.mirror.xyz/SPV_-bchriVn_ncDj8OgnLccSb5qAsU0sXNpg9y_UTk)\n- [Stem III](https://j.mirror.xyz/qnvV6hGoxq6gIO2anZ4KLi-kXz3RDZh6qFS78QDSM0Y)\n- [Songcamp](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM)", "timestamp": 1620147633, "digest": "mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw", "contributor": "0x9651B2a7Aa9ed9635cE896a1Af1a7d6294d5e902"}

When we make assumptions, we state them. Otherwise, we presume that the future could unfold in many directions. \n\n\n\nThe state of contemporary affairs has borne out a widening, often uncanny, set of directions. As the paths forward continue to branch, legacy institutions are losing their claims to legitimacy. While such institutions are resource-rich, their engagement with the future amounts to impoverished PR, or the maintenance of a holding pattern that prevents the rapid changes that needs to happen.  \n\nCope sees crowdfunding as an opportunity for young professional researchers to break from think tanks, universities, and strategy firms. We take the future too seriously to agree to institutional constraints. Too many important discussions are off limits. We know it’s possible to break from legacy institutions, but it requires the careful development of feedback from a distributed set of supporters who find our lines of inquiry valuable to their own paths.

This report outlines a sequence of BauDAO phases that begins with a collectively crowdfunded building project and moves towards a novel vision for an urban operating system. The BauDAO paradigm includes many novel software mechanisms that 1) reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of various urban assets, 2) enable multi-tier governance protocols for determining and modifying ‘program’, and 3) sharply decreasing capital barriers to ownership status by several orders of magnitude via smart contract crowdfunding mechanisms. Eventually, the BauDAO becomes an Operating System which is applicable to the breadth of architectural typologies, including residential buildings, creative collectives, schools, and co-ops. Lastly, we argue that architects are uniquely positioned to redefine these socio-economic parameters of ownership and governance (Form follows Finance) by removing parasitic developers and the rentier system. As opposed to commodity service providers, architects become fractional owners of built works alongside the distributed communities that own their architecture.*\n\n\n\n**[BauDAO DIAGRAM IMAGE]**\n\nThis is how the Splits will be divided for this Report.\n\n[Cope #01 Split](split://0xaa9Db6448c78Ba0e14c45dB0f70a14DA81E7A8bC?network=mainnet)\n\n\n**The Problem of Memory in Digital Minds** \n-James Douglas Boyd\n\nDigital minds will differ from human ones in that they will be both intelligent agents and products of the engineering designs of others.

Organizations claiming the title exhibit a broad range of variance when it comes to decentralization and autonomy. \n\nMany DAOs exhibit higher degrees of centralization than what the term theoretically indicates. While degrees of centralization are necessary for the evolution of such early networks there’s no standard analysis for the variance between systems.\n\nDAOs will slowly (or not so slowly) take the center stage of cryptocurrency network development and product entrepreneurship as every token project begins to implement strategies to move toward a self-propelled, community built, owned, and operated system. All DAOs aim to reach a state of *Sufficient Decentralization* in part to satisfy regulatory scrutiny. This concept loosely [coined by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418) in 2018 describes the state in which a token network has sufficient activity to no longer rely on a specific group or individual to “carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts”. \n\nToday [progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/) stands as the defacto playbook to approach DAO development, but new frameworks for finding the path leading a project from idea to sufficiently decentralized network continue to emerge. This article offers a high level framework to analyze the range of autonomy and decentralization within these new global coordination mechanisms.\n\n## Calculating Autonomy\n\nAutonomy holds multiple definitions in relation to DAO systems. In one form, autonomous indicates **independent and self-executing**. This type of autonomy refers to the way something is technically automated. On the other hand, autonomous also indicates **political autonomy**. This refers to the freedom of an organization to coordinate autonomously from outside influence.\n\nThe degree to which a DAO exhibits autonomy depends on the decentralization of the system’s **technical** and **cultural** layers. \n\n> *autonomy(DAO) = decentralization(tech + culture)*\n\nIncreased decentralization results in an increase of censorship resistance and longevity, and every DAO fingerprint leverages a variety of technical and cultural tools during different stages of development in an effort to build a robust, self-propelled organization. \n\n## Technical Decentralization\n\nThe degree of technical decentralization is defined by the **tools used to automate power distribution** across participating agents within the system. In general, liquid token economies provide a stronger technical means of decentralization than a multisig because liquid economies allow for permissionless network ownership and participation. \n\nPermissioned systems have less autonomy and decentralization, while permissionless systems generally have more autonomy and decentralization. With this in mind, consider the difference between a decentralized organization (digital, crypto-based permissioned coordination) and a decentralized autonomous organization (digital, crypto-based permissionless coordination).\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F327392f6-b1d6-49e8-a085-eaadef8fd29f\\_4291x1549.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F327392f6-b1d6-49e8-a085-eaadef8fd29f\\_4291x1549.png)\n\nCharacteristics differentiating the two types of structures on a technical level stem from the extent to which the management system automates decisions and distributes ownership. Below we organize examples of more technically permissionless systems with more technically permissioned systems.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252fde1c-ba3c-4b8d-82ea-287916fa973a\\_4291x2635.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252fde1c-ba3c-4b8d-82ea-287916fa973a\\_4291x2635.png)\n\n**On the left** of this graph we see a variety of dao frameworks (Gnosis Multisig, Colony, DAOHaus, DAOstack, Aragon). These tools offer various degrees of decentralization based on their configuration (learn more from [this article](http://kronosapiens.github.io/blog/2019/06/16/aragon-daostack-colony-moloch.html)).\n\n**On the right** we see the Bitcoin and Ethereum token economies, both of which can be considered DAOs. As far as technical decentralization goes, Bitcoin might be considered more technically decentralized due to the immutability of the code. Ethereum on the other hand, leverages some centralized coordination to update the underlying protocol.\n\n**The middle** symbol represents 1Hive, a community that has a liquidity token $HNY and organizes resources at the edges of their protocol via a variety of the frameworks presented on the left. \n\nTools continue evolving rapidly to create more sophisticated mechanisms for distribution of ownership and management within these new organizational structures. While the technical footprint might appear decentralized, **the way in which these tools are used by their community** defines the degree to which they actualize decentralization.\n\n## Cultural Decentralization\n\nAn organization's cultural decentralization comes from the way **power is distributed across the humans** interacting with the system. This layer carries more nuance than the technical layer, as it is not a technical assessment but an anthropological analysis of community development, information sharing, and decision making.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48172b86-9f90-4865-bea4-59561771fe4c\\_4291x1549.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48172b86-9f90-4865-bea4-59561771fe4c\\_4291x1549.png)\n\nHere is a first take at the cultural characteristics exhibited on both ends of the decentralized organizational spectrum. Again, the extent to which a DAO’s culture is decentralized is defined by the manner in which the community building and interacting with the system exhibits properties of permissionless self-propagation vs permissioned and curated management.\n\nTo better understand cultural decentralization, let’s dig into some examples of the differences between a few token networks (XRP, EOS, ETH, and BTC).\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fead64ab1-da24-4fa4-9fb6-2c24e50012a5\\_4291x2285.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fead64ab1-da24-4fa4-9fb6-2c24e50012a5\\_4291x2285.png)\n\nPutting aside the technical differences between the consensus systems used in each network, let’s take a broad strokes analysis of their strategy and path for decision-making.\n\nOn the left, EOS and XRP generally rely on coordinated marketing efforts and investment in developers to build applications on top of their blockchain architecture. These decisions come from a system that looks very similar to a corporate structure of management.\n\nOn the right, Bitcoin and Ethereum both rely heavily on open source development generated by communities of individuals who coordinate via forums and blog posts largely driven by research and intellectual curiosity (eg. [Ethresearch](https://ethresear.ch/)). \n\nThis scale of decentralization can be further illuminated by looking at the activity of contributions to the network development. Albeit outdated, [an analysis by Electric Capital](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-h1-2019-7d836d68fecb) from 2019 provides nice context to the differences in cultural decentralization.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F110fd6e9-505a-4f91-b36c-cc1bf95f22be\\_1354x708.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F110fd6e9-505a-4f91-b36c-cc1bf95f22be\\_1354x708.png)\n\nWith this added information, it is relatively clear that Bitcoin and Ethereum stand as outliers in organically attracting human contributions to network development. Zooming in on the previous scale to analyze the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin from a contribution standpoint advances the argument for Ethereum as a more decentralized and self-propagating system (*which is contradictory to the decentralization noted in the technical analysis section*).\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa80dae43-291c-4b7b-b345-01a9eba22b3b\\_4291x2285.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa80dae43-291c-4b7b-b345-01a9eba22b3b\\_4291x2285.png)\n\nDAO systems that facilitate a high level of engagement from a large variety of people and initiatives naturally hold higher degrees of self-propagation in design and direction, as well as theoretically higher “bus factors” (ie. more decentralized points of failure). \n\nTaking this back to the initial stated goal of networks reaching Sufficient Decentralization as defined by no specific entity carrying out “managerial or entrepreneurial efforts”, Ethereum might reasonably be more decentralized than Bitcoin as a DAO.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDAOs are gaining a lot of steam as groups begin launching their own governance tokens. A variety of [offchain and onchain tooling](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-a-dao-mapping-out-the-ecosystem/) continue to advance the ability for these systems to elegantly distribute ownership and management. These systems offer the latest method of human coordination and a path for thousands of governance experiments to run concurrently. \n\n*More research needs to be done to further detail the extent to which specific DAOs are technically and politically decentralized and autonomous.* It will be particularly interesting to continue comparing and analyzing the difference in technical and cultural decentralization exhibited by projects of a specific category. All will demonstrate a mix of centralized and decentralized characteristics throughout their development lifecycles.\n\nAs the ecosystem continues to develop and harden core use cases, every project will implement some form of DAO structure to distribute network ownership. The most successful systems will define new design patterns for global coordination.\n\n## Glossary\n\n**Autonomous** - holds two definitions: 1. autonomous defines the degree to which a system or entity acts automatically on protocol changes, resource allocation, and membership systems. 2. autonomous used in reference to political autonomy.\n\n**Cultural Layer** - the layer of humans assisting in the productivity and coordination for the resources, membership, and protocol of a DAO.\n\n**Decentralized** - defines the degree to which the network of operating participants is resistant to a single point of failure. \n\n**Decentralized Organization (DO)** - a network of digital actors coordinating in a permissioned way.\n\n**Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** - a network of digital actors coordinating in a permissionless way.\n\n**Operating Agent** - humans, computers, or blockchain addresses that function as members or nodes of a DAO.\n\n**Permissioned** - defines an exclusive system that requires human input to curate the management of membership, resources, or protocol changes.\n\n**Permissionless** - defines an open system that leverages code, market activity, or knowledge to automate management of membership, resources, or protocol adjustments.\n\n**Sufficient Decentralization** - a term loosely [coined by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418) in 2018 describes the state in which a token network has sufficient activity to no longer rely on a specific group or individual to “carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts”.\n\n**Technical Layer** - the layer of code defining the way operating agents coordinate to manage the resources, membership, and protocol of a DAO.\n\n## Reference Literature\n\n[Analyzing Network Ownership](https://blog.curvelabs.eu/ownership-in-cryptonetworks-96f13f4a113e)\n\n[An Analysis of ETH and BTC Governance](https://spacemesh.io/spacemesh-governance/)\n\n[Aragon, DAOstack, Colony, and Moloch](http://kronosapiens.github.io/blog/2019/06/16/aragon-daostack-colony-moloch.html)\n\n[Concentric Circles of Governance](https://medium.com/abridged-io/the-spectrum-of-decentralization-124c8ea6d045)\n\n[Conceptual Models for DAO2DAO Relations](https://medium.com/primedao/conceptual-models-for-dao2dao-relations-ac2b2d3cc84d)\n\n[Crypto Anarchist Manifesto (something DAOs empower)](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html)\n\n[Electric Capital’s Developer Report 2019](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-h1-2019-7d836d68fecb)\n\n[ETHresearch](https://ethresear.ch/)\n\n[Failed Decentralized Governance During the Women’s Social Movement ](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm)\n\n[Meditations on Moloch (a commentary on the tragedy of the commons)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TxcRbCYHaeL59aY7E/meditations-on-moloch)\n\n[Original DAO Thoughts from Vitalik Buterin ](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)\n\n[Progressive Decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/)\n\n[Pitfalls of Progressive Decentralization](https://gardens.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-pitfalls-of-progressive)\n\n[Sufficient Decentralization](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418)\n\n[Squad Wealth](https://otherinter.net/squad-wealth/)\n\n[What is a DAO?](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-a-dao-mapping-out-the-ecosystem/)\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nThanks to [Michael Zargham](https://twitter.com/mathemagicianMZ) for your rigorous precision of language in the discussion around autonomy.

This report outlines a sequence of BauDAO phases that begins with a collectively crowdfunded building project and moves towards a novel vision for an urban operating system. The BauDAO paradigm includes many novel software mechanisms that 1) reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of various urban assets, 2) enable multi-tier governance protocols for determining and modifying ‘program’, and 3) sharply decreasing capital barriers to ownership status by several orders of magnitude via smart contract crowdfunding mechanisms. Eventually, the BauDAO becomes an Operating System which is applicable to the breadth of architectural typologies, including residential buildings, creative collectives, schools, and co-ops. Lastly, we argue that architects are uniquely positioned to redefine these socio-economic parameters of ownership and governance (Form follows Finance) by removing parasitic developers and the rentier system. As opposed to commodity service providers, architects become fractional owners of built works alongside the distributed communities that own their architecture.*\n\n\n\n**[BauDAO DIAGRAM IMAGE]**\n\nThis is how the Splits will be divided for this Report.\n\n[Cope #01 Split](split://0xaa9Db6448c78Ba0e14c45dB0f70a14DA81E7A8bC?network=mainnet)\n\n\n**The Problem of Memory in Digital Minds** \n-James Douglas Boyd\n\nDigital minds will differ from human ones in that they will be both intelligent agents and products of the engineering designs of others.

A variety of [offchain and onchain tooling](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-a-dao-mapping-out-the-ecosystem/) continue to advance the ability for these systems to elegantly distribute ownership and management. These systems offer the latest method of human coordination and a path for thousands of governance experiments to run concurrently. \n\n*More research needs to be done to further detail the extent to which specific DAOs are technically and politically decentralized and autonomous.* It will be particularly interesting to continue comparing and analyzing the difference in technical and cultural decentralization exhibited by projects of a specific category. All will demonstrate a mix of centralized and decentralized characteristics throughout their development lifecycles.\n\nAs the ecosystem continues to develop and harden core use cases, every project will implement some form of DAO structure to distribute network ownership. The most successful systems will define new design patterns for global coordination.\n\n## Glossary\n\n**Autonomous** - holds two definitions: 1. autonomous defines the degree to which a system or entity acts automatically on protocol changes, resource allocation, and membership systems. 2. autonomous used in reference to political autonomy.\n\n**Cultural Layer** - the layer of humans assisting in the productivity and coordination for the resources, membership, and protocol of a DAO.\n\n**Decentralized** - defines the degree to which the network of operating participants is resistant to a single point of failure. \n\n**Decentralized Organization (DO)** - a network of digital actors coordinating in a permissioned way.\n\n**Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** - a network of digital actors coordinating in a permissionless way.\n\n**Operating Agent** - humans, computers, or blockchain addresses that function as members or nodes of a DAO.\n\n**Permissioned** - defines an exclusive system that requires human input to curate the management of membership, resources, or protocol changes.\n\n**Permissionless** - defines an open system that leverages code, market activity, or knowledge to automate management of membership, resources, or protocol adjustments.\n\n**Sufficient Decentralization** - a term loosely [coined by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418) in 2018 describes the state in which a token network has sufficient activity to no longer rely on a specific group or individual to “carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts”.\n\n**Technical Layer** - the layer of code defining the way operating agents coordinate to manage the resources, membership, and protocol of a DAO.\n\n## Reference Literature\n\n[Analyzing Network Ownership](https://blog.curvelabs.eu/ownership-in-cryptonetworks-96f13f4a113e)\n\n[An Analysis of ETH and BTC Governance](https://spacemesh.io/spacemesh-governance/)\n\n[Aragon, DAOstack, Colony, and Moloch](http://kronosapiens.github.io/blog/2019/06/16/aragon-daostack-colony-moloch.html)\n\n[Concentric Circles of Governance](https://medium.com/abridged-io/the-spectrum-of-decentralization-124c8ea6d045)\n\n[Conceptual Models for DAO2DAO Relations](https://medium.com/primedao/conceptual-models-for-dao2dao-relations-ac2b2d3cc84d)\n\n[Crypto Anarchist Manifesto (something DAOs empower)](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html)\n\n[Electric Capital’s Developer Report 2019](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-h1-2019-7d836d68fecb)\n\n[ETHresearch](https://ethresear.ch/)\n\n[Failed Decentralized Governance During the Women’s Social Movement ](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm)\n\n[Meditations on Moloch (a commentary on the tragedy of the commons)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TxcRbCYHaeL59aY7E/meditations-on-moloch)\n\n[Original DAO Thoughts from Vitalik Buterin ](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)\n\n[Progressive Decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/)\n\n[Pitfalls of Progressive Decentralization](https://gardens.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-pitfalls-of-progressive)\n\n[Sufficient Decentralization](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418)\n\n[Squad Wealth](https://otherinter.net/squad-wealth/)\n\n[What is a DAO?](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-a-dao-mapping-out-the-ecosystem/)\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nThanks to [Michael Zargham](https://twitter.com/mathemagicianMZ) for your rigorous precision of language in the discussion around autonomy.

Organizations claiming the title exhibit a broad range of variance when it comes to decentralization and autonomy. \n\nMany DAOs exhibit higher degrees of centralization than what the term theoretically indicates. While degrees of centralization are necessary for the evolution of such early networks there’s no standard analysis for the variance between systems.\n\nDAOs will slowly (or not so slowly) take the center stage of cryptocurrency network development and product entrepreneurship as every token project begins to implement strategies to move toward a self-propelled, community built, owned, and operated system. All DAOs aim to reach a state of *Sufficient Decentralization* in part to satisfy regulatory scrutiny. This concept loosely [coined by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418) in 2018 describes the state in which a token network has sufficient activity to no longer rely on a specific group or individual to “carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts”. \n\nToday [progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/) stands as the defacto playbook to approach DAO development, but new frameworks for finding the path leading a project from idea to sufficiently decentralized network continue to emerge. This article offers a high level framework to analyze the range of autonomy and decentralization within these new global coordination mechanisms.\n\n## Calculating Autonomy\n\nAutonomy holds multiple definitions in relation to DAO systems. In one form, autonomous indicates **independent and self-executing**. This type of autonomy refers to the way something is technically automated. On the other hand, autonomous also indicates **political autonomy**. This refers to the freedom of an organization to coordinate autonomously from outside influence.\n\nThe degree to which a DAO exhibits autonomy depends on the decentralization of the system’s **technical** and **cultural** layers. \n\n> *autonomy(DAO) = decentralization(tech + culture)*\n\nIncreased decentralization results in an increase of censorship resistance and longevity, and every DAO fingerprint leverages a variety of technical and cultural tools during different stages of development in an effort to build a robust, self-propelled organization. \n\n## Technical Decentralization\n\nThe degree of technical decentralization is defined by the **tools used to automate power distribution** across participating agents within the system. In general, liquid token economies provide a stronger technical means of decentralization than a multisig because liquid economies allow for permissionless network ownership and participation. \n\nPermissioned systems have less autonomy and decentralization, while permissionless systems generally have more autonomy and decentralization. With this in mind, consider the difference between a decentralized organization (digital, crypto-based permissioned coordination) and a decentralized autonomous organization (digital, crypto-based permissionless coordination).\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F327392f6-b1d6-49e8-a085-eaadef8fd29f\\_4291x1549.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F327392f6-b1d6-49e8-a085-eaadef8fd29f\\_4291x1549.png)\n\nCharacteristics differentiating the two types of structures on a technical level stem from the extent to which the management system automates decisions and distributes ownership.

Zooming in on the previous scale to analyze the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin from a contribution standpoint advances the argument for Ethereum as a more decentralized and self-propagating system (*which is contradictory to the decentralization noted in the technical analysis section*).\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa80dae43-291c-4b7b-b345-01a9eba22b3b\\_4291x2285.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa80dae43-291c-4b7b-b345-01a9eba22b3b\\_4291x2285.png)\n\nDAO systems that facilitate a high level of engagement from a large variety of people and initiatives naturally hold higher degrees of self-propagation in design and direction, as well as theoretically higher “bus factors” (ie. more decentralized points of failure). \n\nTaking this back to the initial stated goal of networks reaching Sufficient Decentralization as defined by no specific entity carrying out “managerial or entrepreneurial efforts”, Ethereum might reasonably be more decentralized than Bitcoin as a DAO.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDAOs are gaining a lot of steam as groups begin launching their own governance tokens. A variety of [offchain and onchain tooling](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-a-dao-mapping-out-the-ecosystem/) continue to advance the ability for these systems to elegantly distribute ownership and management. These systems offer the latest method of human coordination and a path for thousands of governance experiments to run concurrently. \n\n*More research needs to be done to further detail the extent to which specific DAOs are technically and politically decentralized and autonomous.* It will be particularly interesting to continue comparing and analyzing the difference in technical and cultural decentralization exhibited by projects of a specific category. All will demonstrate a mix of centralized and decentralized characteristics throughout their development lifecycles.\n\nAs the ecosystem continues to develop and harden core use cases, every project will implement some form of DAO structure to distribute network ownership. The most successful systems will define new design patterns for global coordination.\n\n## Glossary\n\n**Autonomous** - holds two definitions: 1. autonomous defines the degree to which a system or entity acts automatically on protocol changes, resource allocation, and membership systems. 2. autonomous used in reference to political autonomy.\n\n**Cultural Layer** - the layer of humans assisting in the productivity and coordination for the resources, membership, and protocol of a DAO.\n\n**Decentralized** - defines the degree to which the network of operating participants is resistant to a single point of failure. \n\n**Decentralized Organization (DO)** - a network of digital actors coordinating in a permissioned way.\n\n**Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** - a network of digital actors coordinating in a permissionless way.\n\n**Operating Agent** - humans, computers, or blockchain addresses that function as members or nodes of a DAO.\n\n**Permissioned** - defines an exclusive system that requires human input to curate the management of membership, resources, or protocol changes.\n\n**Permissionless** - defines an open system that leverages code, market activity, or knowledge to automate management of membership, resources, or protocol adjustments.\n\n**Sufficient Decentralization** - a term loosely [coined by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418) in 2018 describes the state in which a token network has sufficient activity to no longer rely on a specific group or individual to “carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts”.\n\n**Technical Layer** - the layer of code defining the way operating agents coordinate to manage the resources, membership, and protocol of a DAO.\n\n## Reference Literature\n\n[Analyzing Network Ownership](https://blog.curvelabs.eu/ownership-in-cryptonetworks-96f13f4a113e)\n\n[An Analysis of ETH and BTC Governance](https://spacemesh.io/spacemesh-governance/)\n\n[Aragon, DAOstack, Colony, and Moloch](http://kronosapiens.github.io/blog/2019/06/16/aragon-daostack-colony-moloch.html)\n\n[Concentric Circles of Governance](https://medium.com/abridged-io/the-spectrum-of-decentralization-124c8ea6d045)\n\n[Conceptual Models for DAO2DAO Relations](https://medium.com/primedao/conceptual-models-for-dao2dao-relations-ac2b2d3cc84d)\n\n[Crypto Anarchist Manifesto (something DAOs empower)](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html)\n\n[Electric Capital’s Developer Report 2019](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-h1-2019-7d836d68fecb)\n\n[ETHresearch](https://ethresear.ch/)\n\n[Failed Decentralized Governance During the Women’s Social Movement ](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm)\n\n[Meditations on Moloch (a commentary on the tragedy of the commons)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TxcRbCYHaeL59aY7E/meditations-on-moloch)\n\n[Original DAO Thoughts from Vitalik Buterin ](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)\n\n[Progressive Decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/)\n\n[Pitfalls of Progressive Decentralization](https://gardens.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-pitfalls-of-progressive)\n\n[Sufficient Decentralization](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418)\n\n[Squad Wealth](https://otherinter.net/squad-wealth/)\n\n[What is a DAO?](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-a-dao-mapping-out-the-ecosystem/)\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nThanks to [Michael Zargham](https://twitter.com/mathemagicianMZ) for your rigorous precision of language in the discussion around autonomy.

A team of visual artists + project operatives were also formed to provide the visual and rollout support of the resulting songs. \n\nOn **Monday April 19** — one week into camp — a sponsorship NFT called *“The Unlock”* was minted to raise the funds necessary to distribute the songs. [Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq) won the auction, and are forever etched into the Songcamp story as the first ever on-chain supporters of the project. \n\nOn **Monday April 26**, the two-week camp came to a close. All teams delivered their final masters + cover artwork. \n\nOn **Monday May 3** (*aka today*), the 3 songs were minted as 1/1 NFTs on Catalog and are now up for auction here on Mirror. \n\n# The Patron House 🏩\n\nAlong with these NFTs, each auction winner will also receive one (1) invitation to Songcamp’s Patron House. \n\nThe Songcamp Patron House is being built with the intention of offering a dedicated space for our patrons to receive deep + intimate access into the growing Songcamp community and activities. \n\nWe value the interest and support you bring to this newborn community, and we see this NFT collection as the beginning of our relationship together. Our on-chain bond will go much further than this first transaction, and the value you are bringing to Songcamp is only the opening line in a much longer two-way dialogue between us. \n\n**The Patron House will begin as a closed-access set of channels on the Songcamp Discord**, with plans to grow from there. We foresee a real Patron House one day, designed + built by us in the Metaverse. :)\n\n# The Songs\n\n### “[Static Twist](https://beta.catalog.works/thelunarveil)” by Lunar Veil\n\n*The Lunar Veil is Thys, Hvdson and Samsonite*\n\nA nocturnal dissociative narrative, twisting through sharp corners, from low fidelity analog machines to maximalistic digitalistic bordering the hystericalistic, via a strictly mature age appropriate noise fetish, carrying the naive hope to bring it all home in one piece.\n \n### “[Hold On Hope](https://beta.catalog.works/driftwoodtx)” by Driftwood TX\n\n*Driftwood TX is Gavin Slate, Kevin Paris and Rowan Spencer*\n\nDriftwood: shaped by rough waters, wind, light and shadow. Driftwood TX: a place where lakes can sing at night and the sound reverberates in caves and off walls of stone. Three itinerant strangers meet there to capture these songs at that moment when the fire burns at its lowest but the first sign of sunrise shows.\n \n### “[Antid0t3](https://beta.catalog.works/rainbowpunch)” by Rainbow Punch\n\n*Rainbow Punch is MAiWORLD, Snacks.xyz and Matthew Chaim*\n\nSmashing sounds together in a multi-coloured kaleidoscope of subconscious dreams, sure to kick your socks off and send you sprinting up the honey-covered hills of the cartoon world that we're pulling you into.\n\n# The Auction\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/332f272b-2a66-4944-aee0-d4559b417429.jpg?height=757&width=1320)\n\n### Auction + Revenue Flow \n\nThe winning bids from these three auctions will be split amongst the musicians, visual artists, project operatives, and Songcamp’s treasury. We are using Mirror’s Splits tool in order to instantaneously and trustlessly split all auction proceeds to their rightful recipient. *To see this breakdown in action, scroll down to the Split blocks below.*\n\nBecause Mirror, Catalog, and the Zora protocol take zero transaction fees — **100% of the funds from these three NFT auctions flow directly to those involved in the project**.\n\n### The Creator Fee Routing\nThe creator fee — which was setup on Catalog’s front-end at the time of minting — is set at 25% for each of these songs. The creator fee will also be shared by all contributors in the same relative proportions as above.\n\nCurrently, the Zora protocol does not support the separation of a Creator Fee from the Creator’s wallet. This means that the creator fee will go directly to the wallet that minted the NFT. Because of this, our plan is as follows: once the auction closes and the creator fee flows into the band’s wallet, that wallet will manually send the creator fee to its respective Split block address. This way, all 100% of the auction proceeds will end up in that song’s Split.\n\n# The Splits\n\nThese are the split blocks that are plugged into the 3 NFT auctions above. Each one is broken down amongst the contributors to each specific song + the project as a whole.\n\nOur musicians are denoted above in the “Songs” section. The visual team consists of Peace Node and Gian Ferrer. The project operatives are Quiet Theory and Mark Redito. And lastly is the Songcamp treasury.\n\n**Once the auctions conclude, each recipient can navigate to the respective Split block and claim their share.** \n\n[\"Static Twist\" by The Lunar Veil](split://0xD5a7f09d6DeAadB11Bb23d4d59622CC74736a476?network=mainnet)\n\n[\"Hold On Hope\" by Driftwood TX](split://0x142Ca9EDac4726B4BB6c5Bb0451eFC1D88F32bb4?network=mainnet)\n\n[\"Antid0t3\" by Rainbow Punch](split://0x5183Ee697C9BA7f70D6913C5fE4c26C9544b9840?network=mainnet)\n\n# The Future\n\n### Is Songcamp an open protocol?\n\nWe spoke at length about what Songcamp’s role is, and what cut if anything the treasury should receive. We played with the idea of Songcamp being this *“lower layer”* that spins up collectives, and the participants within each collective receiving all proceeds resulting from the creations.\n\nIn that way we start to see two distinct layers here:\n\n1) the Songcamp base “protocol” layer, and;\n2) this first sprint within Songcamp\n\nRight now, in that this is the first project, those two layers feel pretty flush. And to keep things simple, we concluded on a share of 10% of each auction to go towards the Songcamp treasury and its future projects.\n\nThat said, we are excited to continue this conversation. We'd love for you to come join us as we navigate the beginnings of this experiment!\n\nCome get involved → here's our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songcampdotband) + [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wHsJD2sTpc).\n\nThanks for being here. 🕊", "timestamp": 1620163333, "digest": "xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM", "contributor": "0xfC4852B5e3aF65058CdfE1D1dce26946c0C1975f"}

This report outlines a sequence of BauDAO phases that begins with a collectively crowdfunded building project and moves towards a novel vision for an urban operating system. The BauDAO paradigm includes many novel software mechanisms that 1) reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of various urban assets, 2) enable multi-tier governance protocols for determining and modifying ‘program’, and 3) sharply decreasing capital barriers to ownership status by several orders of magnitude via smart contract crowdfunding mechanisms. Eventually, the BauDAO becomes an Operating System which is applicable to the breadth of architectural typologies, including residential buildings, creative collectives, schools, and co-ops. Lastly, we argue that architects are uniquely positioned to redefine these socio-economic parameters of ownership and governance (Form follows Finance) by removing parasitic developers and the rentier system. As opposed to commodity service providers, architects become fractional owners of built works alongside the distributed communities that own their architecture.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2cae884a-674b-4145-bb9e-0a87e35fcc97.png?height=2500&width=2500)\n\n\n\n## **The Problem of Memory in Digital Minds** \n-James Douglas Boyd\n\nDigital minds will differ from human ones in that they will be both intelligent agents and products of the engineering designs of others. It may not always be easy for a digital mind to differentiate the aspects of its intelligence that are autonomous and those that are features of others’ designs. Memory is one such aspect. We consider an experiment that a digital mind can conduct and two measures that it can estimate for choosing among hypotheses regarding the origins of its memories.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e42a92f8-2e95-463b-b022-d32d4726fbba.png?height=1084&width=2388)\n\n\n\n### *Going Forward*\nAs Cope grows, the issues will include more reports from a diversity of future thinkers.
