What happens when we do? \n\nThe release of this project aims to rip open some of those deeply held beliefs we have around music ‚Äî what music is, how we value it, and how it‚Äôs ‚Äúsupposed to be‚Äù distributed. \n\nThis release is broken down into 3 sections: **The Canon, The Collectibles, and The Copies**. *To learn more about my thoughts behind this release mix, [read my previous essay](https://chaim.mirror.xyz/0SRGluR6sYweDWV0qmgF6V1wsN0BvEKsvCVOZCFX7yU).* \n\n### Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:\n\n- There are 5 one-of-one *canon*ical NFTs on auction **below**\n- There are 9 NFT *collectibles* now [**available on Rarible**](https://rarible.com/chaim), which are walked through in detail below \n- There are 1000 album bundle *copies* [**now available on my online shop**](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac), also walked through below \n\n### All collectors of any of the above will receive: \n\n- a private download of the *Textures Of A Long Forgotten Assumptions* album's songs and artwork\n- one (1) invitation into the *Homemade Universe* discord server ‚Äî my private online community. \n- one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest*.

Paint (unfinished)\n9. Untitled (unfinished)\n\nAs you can see, **three of the nine songs are unfinished**. I need your help to finish them, and you can see how in the *Collectibles* section below. \n\nLet‚Äôs begin...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea6822c5-8411-43a4-a093-c485fa6ca32e.jpg?height=1486&width=1486)\n\n\n# THE CANON\n\nOn auction are 4 one-of-one [Catalog NFTs](https://beta.catalog.works/chaim) for tracks 3 thru 6 ‚Äî *Sand*, *Red Balloons*, *Crazy* and *Island*. There is also a one-of-one Zora NFT for the official *Form* music video, auctioning off on Zora. \n\nYou can see who the recipients are for each of the 4 Catalog NFTs being auctioned below. These are the collaborators (writers, producers, engineers) I created this music with. \n\n## Track No. 3 ‚Äî Sand\n\n*Sand* is written by Danny Majic + myself, and produced by Danny Majic.\n\nThis was the first song Danny and I ever wrote together, the very day we met each other. This was also the very first song I wrote after a 10-day cross-country solo drive from Montreal, Canada to Los Angeles, California. \n\n[Token #3166](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3166)\n\n## Track No. 4 ‚Äî Red Balloons\n\n*Red Balloons* is written by Hayley Gene Penner, Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\n\nThis is the first song I've ever released with a co-written top-line. I've always found it difficult to write lyrics and melody with others, but Hayley is a great friend and we truly found a shared energy on this one. And Rabitt always brings the goods. \n\n[Token #3167](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3167)\n\n## Track No. 5 ‚Äî Crazy\n\n*Crazy* is written by Danny Majic + myself, and produced by Danny Majic.\n\nWe wrote this song together at a songwriting camp in Nashville, Tennessee. It was the first ever *Really Fun Camp* organized by Rabitt. \n\n[Token #3168](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3168)\n\n## Track No. 6 ‚Äî Island\n\n*Island* is written by Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\n\nWe wrote this song together in Jason's studio in Silverlake, Los Angeles. Attached to said studio was the very house we were both living in at the time. This was the last song we wrote together, before I left for Montreal when the pandemic began. A version of the song was first released on streaming platforms in May 2020, on a charity album raising money for MusiCares' Covid Relief Fund. \n\n[Token #3169](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3169)\n\nAs you can see in the auctions above above, **5% of funds received are going towards my private community *Homemade Universe*‚Äôs shared treasury**. These funds will be used in future co-creative projects together. Since all collectors + purchasers gain access to *Homemade Universe*, 5% of this project‚Äôs proceeds are funnelling into a community that you are co-creator and co-owner of. \n\n## Form ‚Äî The Official Music Video \n\nThe official music video for \"Form\" is [**now up for auction on Zora**](https://zora.co/chaim/3172), filmed + edited by myself while stuck in a quarantine hotel in Montreal in May 2020. ü•Ω\n\n*Form* is written by Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\n\nThe reserve bid is 0.5 ETH. You can [**bid here**](https://zora.co/chaim/3172). \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3172)\n\n# THE COLLECTIBLES\n\nThere are 9 collectible NFTs ‚Äî one for each song on the album. \n\n### **Tracks no. 1 thru 6 ‚Äî *Form, Tear, Sand, Red Balloons, Crazy, Island***\n\nThe collectibles for the 6 finished songs can be [viewed and collected here](https://rarible.com/chaim).

We started writing this song on my birthday. It was the first time Matt and I had ever worked together. \n\nThe song is nearly finished, but has an empty second verse that needs a feature. Hence, the ***Flavors Feature Contest***. Anyone who collects an NFT or purchases an album bundle copy receives one (1) entry into the contest. \n\nAfter your purchase and/or collection, you‚Äôll receive a private download of the album. Included will be an mp3 of Flavors with an open second verse. You can use that file to start writing your verse. You will also gain access to the Homemade Universe discord server, where you will be able to submit your version of Flavors. Submissions will close on June 20 2021. \n\nA winner will then be chosen to be the official feature of Flavors. The final version of the song with your verse on it will then be released as a 1/1 Catalog NFT and, eventually, on the Textures OF A Long Forgotten Assumption album release on streaming platforms. \n\n**The winner will also receive this 1/1 collectible NFT of Flavors, as well as 10% of the master‚Äôs future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012987:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n### **Track no. 8 ‚Äî *Paint*** + the *Silent Auction*\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/1012935)\n\nThe song *Paint* is still in a very early demo stage. In fact, I don‚Äôt yet have a chorus for it. I wrote the beginnings of this song with Danny Majic, and have always loved the first verse and pre-chorus. But there is still a ways to go on this song, and I am looking for 1 partner to join along for the ride. \n\nThis partner will be the ***creative director*** for the song *Paint* ‚Äî and this role can look many different ways. Perhaps you‚Äôre a musician and can help with the songwriting or production of the song, perhaps you‚Äôre visual artists and can help on the visual side. Perhaps you don‚Äôt consider yourself an artist whatsoever, but can help on the outreach and marketing side. Perhaps you just want to get a closer look into the makings of a song, and just want to take pictures of the process on your disposable camera. Whatever it may be! This creative director position is yours to fill however you choose, should you win it of course. \n\nNow, how do you win it?\n\nThe *Paint* collectible is a 1/1 NFT on Rarible, and is up for **Silent Auction**. \n\nYes, that‚Äôs correct. Silent Auction. \n\nTo win this auction, you must email me your bid. \n\nThat‚Äôs correct. Email me your bid at paintauctionbid@gmail.com. \n\nYour bid can be in ETH, it can be in USD, it can be in CAD, or DOGE or WRITE or any other currency on the planet. It can also be a non-currency bid! It can be a barter of some kind ‚Äî maybe a good or maybe a service. Anything! Get creative! \n\nThis is for the role of creative director on the song. So show me your creativity. And show me how much you want it. :)\n\nOnce the first bid is in, a 24-hour countdown will commence. I will announce updates on the Silent Auction in real-time on [twitter](https://twitter.com/matthewchaim). \n\n**The winner will be the official creative director for *Paint*, win this 1/1 collectible NFT, and receive 10% of the master‚Äôs future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012935:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n### **Track no. 9 ‚Äî *Untitled*** + the *Untitled Creative Director DAO*\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430/572927)\n\nGrab your [**entry NFT into the *Untitled Creative Director DAO* here**](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details).\n\n1 creative director is great. But what about 100? \n\nYes, that‚Äôs correct. 100 creative directors. \n\nThat is what I am in search of for this last song on the album, which does not yet even have a name. As you can see, we have our work cut out for ourselves. \n\nIn fact, I‚Äôm not even sure which demo on mine should be the 9th and final song on the project. There are a few options that I really love, but I need your help to decide on which one to pursue. That is where we will start our collective decision making. Here‚Äôs how it works:\n\nThe Untitled collectible is a **100 edition** NFT on [Rarible](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details), with each edition priced at **0.03 ETH**. I ask that you purchase a maximum of **1 edition per wallet**. \n\nThe Untitled collectible NFT will act as the access token into a gated set of channels on the Homemade Universe discord, where this community of 100 people will convene and begin the creative direction of the song. \n\n**Each edition represents 1 vote in the *Untitled Creative Director DAO* that will be formed to govern the completion of this final song of the album, as well as 0.1% of the master‚Äôs future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties, etc). This means that 100 people will together own 10% of the song‚Äôs final master.**\n\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\n\n# THE COPIES\n\nThe final form this album is being released today is with **1000 album bundle copies**, [available for purchase on my online shop here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac). \n\nThis bundle comes with:\n1. the first 7 tracks off the album, including *Flavors* with the empty second verse\n2. 8 pieces of album artwork\n3. one (1) invitation to *Homemade Universe*\n4. one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest* (more info in the Collectibles section above\n\nAfter your purchase, you will receive an access card into the Homemade Universe discord ‚Äî which will give you access to the private set of channels available to members. \n\nThe album bundle will be available for up to two weeks or up to 1000 copies, whichever comes first. \n\n**You can [purchase an album bundle copy here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac).**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f29b829a-3e2e-4aba-aee9-2ab41f399355.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n# A Final Thought \n\nIn building this release out, I realized I missed one more word in my cute little alliteration. \n\nThe full phrase should go ‚Üí Canon, Collectibles, Copies, and *Community*. \n\nThis project in some ways only *begins* today, in that it is the first page in our story of exploring collective creation together. For the final 3 songs, we will begin a new journey of seeing what it is like for a community to create together in 3 very different ways ‚Äî one as a contest, one as a 1-to-1 relationship, and 1 as a DAO making decisions together. It is also the beginning of exploring the possibilities around sharing in the equity of our co-creations in this way. \n\nThe other thing you may notice in the splits delineated in the *Canon* NFTs above, is my private community Homemade Universe is receiving 5% of all auction revenues. Those funds will go into a shared treasury controlled by the community, which we will use for future co-creative projects together. \n\nI‚Äôm incredibly excited to go on this new journey with you. And learn what it means to bring together like-minded individuals around my art, and create real value together. \n\nThis is just the beginning. \n\nThanks for being here. üåª", "timestamp": 1622923754, "digest": "9EAsxtkQD6hIQJLDID5w8Jn6o_m9Bw4XnDdTwOVHttA", "contributor": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448"}

They are 19 pangram haikus; a tricky combination of formats that grew to mean the world to me. A haiku is a poem of 3 lines, containing 5, 7, and 5 syllables. A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet. At first, I wasn't sure if I could even complete a single one that satisfied both constraints. One grew to 19 that form a single, sprawling journey through my hopes and fears of this moment, of language, code and time.\n\nThe 19 are the foundational point of my graphic practice ‚Äì the reason I began to draw type, create typefaces, as a component of every work I made. Reading a pangram haiku is a war between two modes of recognition; the part of the viewer that wants to parse the image and meaning from the text and read it as a poem, and the part that can‚Äôt help but count the syllables in each line, or count out each of the 26 letters to make sure they are present, and check it as data. Somehow separate from these is a third mode; a voice, encoded in the type form. We‚Äôve yet to truly quantify how any of these elements work. Perhaps in the 40 year lifespan of the work, we will. The fact we haven‚Äôt yet makes these fundamental elements of language feel secretly high-tech to me.\n\nThey were written about a rubicon [I felt our generation would cross in our lifetime; that I think we are crossing now](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/primacism-david-rudnick-on-the-struggle-for-primacy-type-and-poetrys-unique-value-in-an-age-of-digital-and-physical-conflict-and-percy-shelleys-mont-blanc-cwpBIPGY). Where the collective dream of the default bedrock of our world is no longer infinite, experiential, but finite; code-based. An exchange of a soft sublime for a new, hard, incompatible one. \n\nWhat pushes us across this line that the texts attempt to speak of is simply time. The inevitable point where more people exist for whom the dominant weight of value in their lives is no longer physical, but tied to a digital source. Where their default notions of identity, value, community, image, text, currency, ideas of past and future, are drawn from digital space. Many of you will already be reading this text.\n\nOur moment is one of flux as a result. All texts and all art offer themselves before two readers, two value systems, perhaps incompatible, and struggle to make sense of our time and how to move forward. I've wanted to find ways for over a decade now to find what language might exist that allows work to feel valuable to both those viewers, to function as a site of exchange and dialogue between them.\n\nI was born in 1986 ‚Äì in one of the gaps in human history where reality was not assumed to have a universal ledger ‚Äì after God but before the blockchain ‚Äì and grew up with defaults from before a persistent digital realm. Therefore I feel the excitement the new, but also a dread, as the clock races forward and things of once of deep value suddenly seem obsolete, or uninteresting to a new generation of viewer. One thing is certain; we cannot call a time-out, we do not have liberty to pause to take stock of what we stand to lose. New viewers are born every moment whose defaults are the defaults of the age we have built. The future is theirs and the generations after them. *Clock only go one way.* All we can do is try place work in front of them in the timeline to come.\n\nYou can read these works as a string of data; all the letters in the alphabet, arranged in the haiku, encoded onto the blockchain, units of information, atomized. A data sculpture, all units visible.\n\nOr you can read them as a poem; their nostalgic mode, what the language was once used for; components becoming invisible in service of an imaginary other; myths, images, meaning.\n\n\nThe poems are a time gambit. They sit at lenticular flux of the point between the two generations, between nostalgia and the future. Maybe some themes and motifs will become more recognisable in time to some readers. Or maybe they are on a doomed voyage; they will grow boring and irrelevant, or some aspect of the underlying tech will never reach their final unlock, crashing. What technological defaults are readily accessible today that survived the last 40 years? Who reading this will still be here to read the last unlock, let alone care to do so?\n\nIts more in the hands of the reader and collector than mine now. The chain and contract carries the work from this point, to their next destination. I hope to some they or individual parts of them will become oracles, charms, familiar companions on their journey, strange signifiers of our strange days. On the site there is a Calendar link in the top right. It will automatically populate a google calendar with the unlock dates that will send you the text of each poem as it unlocks between now and 2061.\n\nThe contract has been written to open the unlocks 8:24PM EST 2021. Tonight, sunset. Sunset tonight is the end of the day of the 25th Sivan, in the year 5781, in the Jewish calendar. For the entire work to complete, the Ethereum blockchain only has to survive for 40 more years, which is a humble target for a supposedly highly advanced technology when compared to the numbers on the board of rudimentary text-based protocols like Judaism, which is claiming 5781 and counting.\n\nAt the final unlock, on June 5th, 2061, I will be 75 years old. It is a fair estimate of the terminus point of my lifespan. I chose the 25th Sivan 5781 and the 5th June 2021 as the start date to coincide with the reading of the text of parsha *Shelach Lecha*, from the book of Numbers. In it, God condemns the Israelites to wander the desert aimlessly for 40 years. *Spoiler warning:* they don't survive, but the protocol and the text they carry does.\n\n\nD\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": 1622927969, "digest": "YiO9pjPQpfdF4481qTyLA6Qobjex9lsfvjFR9JEBVx4", "contributor": "0x4a61d76ea05A758c1db9C9b5a5ad22f445A38C46"}

The fact we haven‚Äôt yet makes these fundamental elements of language feel secretly high-tech to me.\n\nThey were written about a rubicon [I felt our generation would cross in our lifetime; that I think we are crossing now](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/primacism-david-rudnick-on-the-struggle-for-primacy-type-and-poetrys-unique-value-in-an-age-of-digital-and-physical-conflict-and-percy-shelleys-mont-blanc-cwpBIPGY).

All texts and all art offer themselves before two readers, two value systems, perhaps incompatible, and struggle to make sense of our time and how to move forward.

One thing is certain; we cannot call a time-out, we do not have liberty to pause to take stock of what we stand to lose. New viewers are born every moment whose defaults are the defaults of the age we have built. The future is theirs and the generations after them. *Clock only go one way.* All we can do is try place work in front of them in the timeline to come.\n\nYou can read these works as a string of data; all the letters in the alphabet, arranged in the haiku, encoded onto the blockchain, units of information, atomized. A data sculpture, all units visible.\n\nOr you can read them as a poem; their nostalgic mode, what the language was once used for; components becoming invisible in service of an imaginary other; myths, images, meaning.\n\n\nThe poems are a time gambit. They sit at lenticular flux of the point between the two generations, between nostalgia and the future. Maybe some themes and motifs will become more recognisable in time to some readers.

What implications (good, bad, hypothesized, actualized) do Web3 and blockchain technologies have on the practice of designing and distributing typefaces at large?\n\nWhat are opportunities ahead of us that:\n- Protect the integrity of the industry from bad faith actors and monopolizing forces?\n- Allow for more novel ways to share resources and profits between type designers, foundries, and users of typefaces that subvert the traditional designer / foundry split?\n- Allow for more fairness and equitable inclusion for emerging type designers?\n- Introduce new and novel methods and incentives to fund future type design projects and type design careers?\n- Introduce frictionless bounties for language support, non-latin scripts, and other features that extend the inclusivity and range of any given typeface\n- Allow for better protections against unwanted intellectual property theft? *While* ushering a new culture of consensual remixes, covers, and homages where everyone is compensated and credited fairly?\n- Allow for more streamlined and novel ways to distribute typefaces beyond the current licensing models?\n- Allow for productive and meaningful organizing strategies to enact larger change?\n\nI'll start with that for now.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/_EricHu/status/1380516219204292609\n\n## While You're Waiting: Some Further Reading\n\n[A Beginner's Guide to DAOs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o)\n\n[Introducing Splits](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw)\n\n[Creator DAOs: An OS for Participation](url)\n\n[Platform Cooperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_cooperative)\n\n[Eight Qualities of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations](https://www.ourmachine.net/writing/eight-qualities-daos/)\n\n[The Ownership Economy\n](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/)\n\n[Now open: ERC-1155 marketplace](https://medium.com/opensea/now-open-erc-1155-marketplace-816257ab0da7)\n\n### Papers\nDigital Social Contracts: A Foundation for an\nEgalitarian and Just Digital Society [[PDF]](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2781/paper5.pdf)\n\n### Contact\nTwitter: [@_erichu](http://twitter.com/_erichu)\nEmail: [mail@erichu.info](mailto:mail@erichu.info)\n\n*Special Thanks to Eugene Angelo, and the rest of [FWB](http://fwb.help)* for all the conversations leading up to this.\n\n", "timestamp": 1622929033, "digest": "cuJ-6Ksevx9QuV5peOcw5lpDYVLbPEY5pumZprr8L1Y", "contributor": "0x4628D77ba8fCc7a7F2B6bd4A0363061a06E7a20F"}

They are 19 pangram haikus; a tricky combination of formats that grew to mean the world to me. A haiku is a poem of 3 lines, containing 5, 7, and 5 syllables. A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet. At first, I wasn't sure if I could even complete a single one that satisfied both constraints.

Reading a pangram haiku is a war between two modes of recognition; the part of the viewer that wants to parse the image and meaning from the text and read it as a poem, and the part that can‚Äôt help but count the syllables in each line, or count out each of the 26 letters to make sure they are present, and check it as data. Somehow separate from these is a third mode; a voice, encoded in the type form. We‚Äôve yet to truly quantify how any of these elements work. Perhaps in the 40 year lifespan of the work, we will.

The coming of the inevitable point where more people exist for whom the dominant weight of value in their lives is no longer physical, but tied to a digital source. Where their default notions of identity, value, community, image, text, currency, ideas of past and future, are drawn from digital space. Many of you will already be reading this text.\n\nOur moment is one of flux as a result. All texts and all art offer themselves before two readers, two value systems, perhaps incompatible, and struggle to make sense of our time and how to move forward. I've wanted to find ways for over a decade to find what language might exist that allows work to feel valuable to both those viewers, to function as a site of exchange and dialogue between them.\n\nI was born in 1986 ‚Äì in one of the gaps in human history where reality was not assumed to have a universal ledger ‚Äì after God but before the blockchain ‚Äì and grew up with defaults from before a persistent digital realm. I feel the excitement of the new, but also a dread, as the clock races forward and things of once of deep value suddenly seem obsolete, or uninteresting to a new generation of viewer. One thing is certain; we cannot call a time-out, we do not have liberty to pause to take stock of what we stand to lose. New viewers are born every moment whose defaults are the defaults of the age we have built. The future is theirs and the generations after them. *Clock only go one way.* All we can do is try to place work in front of them in the timeline to come.\n\nYou can read these works as a string of data; all the letters in the alphabet, arranged in the haiku, encoded onto the blockchain, units of information, atomized. A data sculpture, all units visible.\n\nOr you can read them as a poem; their nostalgic mode, what the language was once used for; components becoming invisible in service of an imaginary other; myths, images, meaning.\n\n\nThe poems are a time gambit. They sit at lenticular flux of the point between the two generations, between nostalgia and the future. Maybe some themes and motifs will become more recognisable in time to some readers. Or maybe they are on a doomed voyage; they will grow boring and irrelevant, or some aspect of the underlying tech will never reach their final unlock, crashing. What technological defaults are readily accessible today that survived the last 40 years?
