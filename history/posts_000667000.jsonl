They are now 29-27 and have a fighting chance of being a .500 team this season with only 16 regular season games left.\n\nThis is essentially the same team that went 21-45 last year. Elfrid Payton, RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson, Taj Gibson, and Reggie Bullock were all on that 21-45 team.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nThe coach is what changed. Tom Thibodeau came in and has instilled an entirely different approach and culture. The Knicks are the league’s best defensive team, allowing the least points per game. Last year, they were 18th in defense.\n\nThis Knicks team is competitive in every game, even if they don’t win them all. Last year, we would regularly walk out of the Garden down 20 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nI am going to the Garden on Sunday for the first time in fourteen months and I am excited at the opportunity to be at a game that will hopefully be competitive down the stretch.\n\nWatching Thibs at work is a lesson in leadership. He sets the tone, expectations are high, players that don’t put in the effort don’t play, no matter who they are. Everyone knows what is expected of them.\n\nI have seen this in companies too. The same team, with the same product, in the same market, can be completely transformed by a new leader. Leadership matters.

{"id": "SYcVN2BXWMepddp8-Pzqjy-opqJHvkxaFtP_ceUqF0I", "title": "Server Authentication for web3", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/50f170fa-7368-4f99-86e0-3d8adf85cd08.jpg?height=640&width=1280)\n\nOne of the big appeals of dApps is that the user owns their data. However, for this to be true, we need to authenticate the user with their web3 identity (their wallet). This is easy to do client-side (since they can submit all their tx's themselves using Metamask) but gets harder when we need to verify their identity from a server.\n\nIn this article, I’ll be outlining the technical implementation of a “Login with wallet” button, similar to the ones provided by [Showtime](https://tryshowtime.com) or [Foundation](https://foundation.app).\n\n## From wallet to server\n\nThe first implementation for this is pretty simple. We have the user connect their wallet to our frontend, and make an API request to our server with the retrieved wallet address.\n\nThe issue here is that anyone can send an API request with anyone else’s address to our API, and we have no way of verifying if that address matches the one connected to the frontend.\n\n## Crypto stands for Cryptography\n\nIt’s easy to forget that, in essence, crypto wallets are just a cryptographic key pair (a combination of a private and public key). When you create a transaction, you’re just signing the parameters of your transactions (to mathematically prove you’re the creator) and broadcasting it to the ETH network.\n\nLuckily, transactions aren’t the only thing wallets can sign. We can create an arbitrary message (like `Please sign this message to connect to Foundation.`), and verify the signature to make sure the wallet trying to authenticate was the one that signed our message.\n\nEthereum signatures are Keccak (SHA-3) hashes that start with `Ethereum Signed Message:`. This allows us to perform our verification with a Keccak and an ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) library on any programming language.\n\nTo make this work we’ll need three things: the address that we’re trying to authenticate, the message that we signed, and the signature, which we can get using any web3 library (`ethers.js` in this example):\n\n```js\nimport axios from 'axios'\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers'\n\n// Note: on production, you should use something like web3Modal to support additional wallet providers, like WalletConnect\nconst web3 = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)\n\nconst message = \"Sign this message to log in to our app\" \n\nawait axios.post('/api/auth/login', {\n\taddress: await web3.getSigner().getAddress(),\n\tsignature: await web3.getSigner().signMessage(message),\n})\n```\n\nOn the server, we can then use `eth-sig-util` to verify the message was signed by the submitted wallet, and authenticate it via a cookie or API token.\n\n```js\nimport { recoverPersonalSignature } from 'eth-sig-util'\n\nconst message = \"Sign this message to log in to our app\" \n\nif (! address.toLowerCase() === recoverPersonalSignature({ data: data, sig: signature }).toLowerCase()) {\n\tthrow new Error('Authentication failed')\n}\n\n// wallet address has been verified\n```\n\nIf you want to get a better grasp at how this verification works behind the scenes, you can check [my PHP implementation of the signature verification code](https://github.com/m1guelpf/laravel-web3-login/blob/f1d370f790fa7e81d88bb0c5e794eb313ed50849/src/Signature.php#L16-L34).\n\n## Protecting against replication attacks\n\nWe have a system that allows anyone to log in with their wallet, and a way to make sure you can’t authenticate as other people. But there’s an issue. Since we’re always signing the same message, any of those signatures serve as a perpetual key to our account, which never expires.\n\nThis means that, if someone were to intercept it via a MITM attack or by tricking us into signing that same message on a different site, they’d get non-revokable access to our account.\n\nTo prevent this, we need to make sure the message is different each time. The easiest way to do this is by generating a random string (nonce) and including it on the message.\n\nWe’ll first need to generate our nonce server-side and store it on the session (since we’ll need it to verify the signature later):\n\n```js\nimport crypto from 'crypto'\n\nexport default async function(req, res) {\n\treq.session.nonce = crypto.randomInt(111111, 999999)\n\t\n\tres.end(`Hey! Sign this message to prove you have access to this wallet. This won't cost you anything.\\n\\nSecurity code (you can ignore this): ${req.session.nonce}`)\n}\n```\n\nThen, instead of hardcoding the message to sign, we retrieve it from the server via AJAX:\n\n```js\nimport axios from 'axios'\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers'\n\n// Note: on production, you should use something like web3Modal to support additional wallet providers, like WalletConnect\nconst web3 = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)\n\nconst message = await axios.get('/api/auth/nonce').then(res => res.data)\n\nawait axios.post('/api/auth/login', {\n\taddress: await web3.getSigner().getAddress(),\n\tsignature: await web3.getSigner().signMessage(message),\n})\n```\n\nFinally, before checking the signature we’ll need to reconstruct the message by pulling our nonce from the session.\n\n## 📦\n\nAs with everything, there are a few packages that can take care of this process for you.

However, for this to be true, we need to authenticate the user with their web3 identity (their wallet). This is easy to do client-side (since they can submit all their tx's themselves using Metamask) but gets harder when we need to verify their identity from a server.\n\nIn this article, I’ll be outlining the technical implementation of a “Login with wallet” button, similar to the ones provided by [Showtime](https://tryshowtime.com) or [Foundation](https://foundation.app).\n\n## From wallet to server\n\nThe first implementation for this is pretty simple. We have the user connect their wallet to our frontend, and make an API request to our server with the retrieved wallet address.\n\nThe issue here is that anyone can send an API request with anyone else’s address to our API, and we have no way of verifying if that address matches the one connected to the frontend.\n\n## Crypto stands for Cryptography\n\nIt’s easy to forget that, in essence, crypto wallets are just a cryptographic key pair (a combination of a private and public key). When you create a transaction, you’re just signing the parameters of your transactions (to mathematically prove you’re the creator) and broadcasting it to the ETH network.\n\nLuckily, transactions aren’t the only thing wallets can sign. We can create an arbitrary message (like `Please sign this message to connect to Foundation.`), and verify the signature to make sure the wallet trying to authenticate was the one that signed our message.\n\nEthereum signatures are Keccak (SHA-3) hashes that start with `Ethereum Signed Message:`. This allows us to perform our verification with a Keccak and an ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) library on any programming language.\n\nTo make this work we’ll need three things: the address that we’re trying to authenticate, the message that we signed, and the signature, which we can get using any web3 library (`ethers.js` in this example):\n\n```js\nimport axios from 'axios'\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers'\n\n// On production, you should use something like web3Modal\n// to support additional wallet providers, like WalletConnect\nconst web3 = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)\n\nconst message = \"Sign this message to log in to our app\" \n\nawait axios.post('/api/auth/login', {\n\taddress: await web3.getSigner().getAddress(),\n\tsignature: await web3.getSigner().signMessage(message),\n})\n```\n\nOn the server, we can then use `eth-sig-util` to verify the message was signed by the submitted wallet, and authenticate it via a cookie or API token.\n\n```js\nimport { recoverPersonalSignature } from 'eth-sig-util'\n\nconst message = \"Sign this message to log in to our app\" \n\nif (address.toLowerCase() !== recoverPersonalSignature({ data: data, sig: signature }).toLowerCase()) {\n\tthrow new Error('Authentication failed')\n}\n\n// wallet address has been verified, set a cookie (or return a token)\n```\n\nIf you want to get a better grasp at how this verification works behind the scenes, you can check [my PHP implementation of the signature verification code](https://github.com/m1guelpf/laravel-web3-login/blob/f1d370f790fa7e81d88bb0c5e794eb313ed50849/src/Signature.php#L16-L34).\n\n## Protecting against replication attacks\n\nWe have a system that allows anyone to log in with their wallet, and a way to make sure you can’t authenticate as other people. But there’s an issue. Since we’re always signing the same message, any of those signatures serve as a perpetual key to our account, which never expires.\n\nThis means that, if someone were to intercept it via a MITM attack or by tricking us into signing that same message on a different site, they’d get non-revokable access to our account.\n\nTo prevent this, we need to make sure the message is different each time. The easiest way to do this is by generating a random string (nonce) and including it on the message.\n\nWe’ll first need to generate our nonce server-side and store it on the session (since we’ll need it to verify the signature later):\n\n```js\nimport crypto from 'crypto'\n\nexport default async function(req, res) {\n\treq.session.nonce = crypto.randomInt(111111, 999999)\n\t\n\tres.end(`Hey! Sign this message to prove you have access to this wallet. This won't cost you anything.\\n\\nSecurity code (you can ignore this): ${req.session.nonce}`)\n}\n```\n\nThen, instead of hardcoding the message to sign, we retrieve it from the server via AJAX:\n\n```js\nimport axios from 'axios'\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers'\n\n// On production, you should use something like web3Modal\n// to support additional wallet providers, like WalletConnect\nconst web3 = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)\n\nconst message = await axios.get('/api/auth/nonce').then(res => res.data)\n\nawait axios.post('/api/auth/login', {\n\taddress: await web3.getSigner().getAddress(),\n\tsignature: await web3.getSigner().signMessage(message),\n})\n```\n\nFinally, before checking the signature we’ll need to reconstruct the message by pulling our nonce from the session.\n\n## 📦\n\nAs with everything, there are a few packages that can take care of this process for you.

A lot.\n\nOn the Internet, the way in which we position ourselves is highly dependent on the world we are thrust into. On LinkedIn, we don a cartoonish caricature of our professional selves, only to throw it all away on TikTok. Instagram rewards our perfectionism, while Twitter is the home for the unhinged and clinically depressed.\n\nBut there isn't a home for us to be our true selves. Before this moment in time, there was Tumblr and Myspace, both of which encouraged users to create their own digital worlds by making profiles fully customizable. By doing so, they gave users the tools to create a holistic identity on the Internet. Most profiles were pretty poorly designed, in the objective sense, but what lacked in user experience was made up in pure expression and joy.\n\nThese days, the running joke is that there are only 5 websites on the Internet. Most of them force their own narrative and constraints onto us: Instagram's punishing algorithm is, by far, the most egregious example. Our infinite-scroll feeds lend to a [well-documented](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly) [sameness](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification), reflective of the mashed-potato bland Silicon Valley office parks where these 5 websites are made (the engineers are all on antidepressants, and so should you).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e4b62de7-b8a8-4bf1-b4e5-ce4387b7b1b3.jpeg?height=1618&width=1040)\n\nI believe we're still in the very early stages, but NFTs have the potential to smash our dependence on those platforms into bits. A NFT itself is just metadata - it is completely up to choice how and where that data is presented. However, the patronage model that NFTs encourage naturally lend themselves to fully-contextualized worlds. In other worlds, NFTs will usher a resurgence in the weird parts of the Internet that made it fun to be here, in the first place.\n\nIn order to keep the Internet weird, we need to democratize not just the tools of creation but also the tools of financialization. Community does not scale as well as technology; the sauce behind the most successful NFT marketplaces is that they've scaled slowly, and have created a unique sense of identity and belonging. The downside is that most people are locked out of creating their own slice of Internet that they can choose to monetize if they wish.\n\nThe timing of NFT-mania couldn't have come any better: today, making an incredible digital experience is easier now than it has ever been. In the not-so-distant future, the home for NFTs will be dictated by creators themselves: on a no-code site built in Webflow, in a game, within a Discord community, or something new entirely. Novel forms of interaction are no longer a nice-to-have but an indispensable tool to elevate and complement a NFT. The possibilities are only limited by our collective imagination.", "timestamp": 1618624263, "digest": "84GkEAmAHfhCyYSv6pHy7SNVA-_92R11_BEhFR6Oz0I", "contributor": "0xf7B2C2eb58A5F801119dF7e9bF9f9b66C62bB011"}
