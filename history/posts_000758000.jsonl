Stepping out of his brother [A$AP Ferg’s](https://ps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASAP_Ferg) shadow, Delly is focused on bringing Harlem back to the limelight once again.\n\nHe is preparing a series of three NFT drops on [Glass](https://www.glass.xyz):\n\n1. **FLYGUYS** - a series of **27** NFTs on **August 27** at 3:27 PM EST\n2. **EXCLUSIVITY** - another series of NFT editions on **August 29**\n3. **FLASHY** - Delly is **deleting the music video off of ~~YouTube~~** for his most streamed song on Spotify to mint as an NFT on **September 7**\n\nFrom his origins to his NFT debut, the story of his rise is inspiring to say the least.\n\n![AYE!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2c49d24a-443f-4241-b600-8c32e3e393b2.JPG?height=552&width=828)\n\n## The Come Up\n\nDelly was raised in Uptown, New York between the Bronx & Harlem. His father was the late “D-Ferg,” a pioneer of Harlem culture. His mother, Cheri Lezama, was raised to the sounds of the steel pan, ringing from Trinidad to New York. Delly lost his beloved father at the age of 5, followed by his cousin and grandfather.\n\nThrough those losses, Delly persevered. He began to work for a brighter tomorrow and never failed to fill each room he entered with an irreplaceable energy. An energy that reminds you that you are here, you are alive, and you have **power**.\n\nVisually inclined and astute to his surroundings, Delly has always been involved in the creative arts. As early as 6 years old, he was enrolled in the Harlem School of Arts and found himself immersed in music and art. He learned several different instruments, including the violin, viola, and many percussion instruments.\n\n> *I had a very bounce-around childhood. I was enrolled in a school for the arts as a child, and that’s where I was formally introduced to all these different instruments. Before that, I learned how to play **djembe** from my extensive time spent with my grandmother at her African dance class. It was there that I learned to play bongo, djembe and lots of other types of African instruments.*\n\n![Energy rising.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9507eb77-51cf-4014-b138-a2c9c49c154e.jpeg?height=1410&width=940)\n\n## Dream Chasing\n\nDelly dropped out and chased his passion for music. From the gritty streets of Uptown to the trendy scene of SoHo, Delly began to leave his mark on the city working for the [VFILES Foundation](https://www.vfiles.org/), a non-profit providing the next generation of cultural innovators with the resources they need to reimagine and redefine the world.\n\n> *Aside from music, I just want to use my platform to benefit those around me. It should be cool to know where your City Council is located, or how to be involved in local politics. It just isn’t advertised to the youth in that manner. If we strive towards these things as opposed to fame, the retention rate of the music will only grow.*\n\nHe eventually released his first EP at 19 - “Twenty7” - which has accumulated over 5+ million streams and counting. And Delly’s just getting started.\n\n![A man of the people.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/500b4211-b947-4282-9995-f4e82286071f.jpeg?height=574&width=768)\n\n## Fly $ince Birth\n\n> *Being fly is a mentality and state of mind. It's tangible, but not purchasable. It starts from within and I'm showing you an unlimited currency we all got within.*\n\nDelly’s highly anticipated debut tape “Fly Since Birth” will be his second project and a staple to his music legacy.\n\nWith 10 effervescent tracks that will shake the room, the music on the tape ranges from the some of the dirtiest “[Frankie P](https://twitter.com/frankiep325?lang=eu)” 808’s you can find to the jiggiest Uptown bounce. The tape already features two smash singles - “Bonita” and “Flashy.”\n\n> *Fly Since Birth is to fill in those who are on this journey with me now as to where I’m at in life. How I’m feeling, the confidence, the spiritual journey that I’m on. I have a few official songs out but I’ve been making music for years, so I’m learning a lot of people don’t know a lot about me, so I think it’s time to show people how I think.*\n\n![Up and stuck.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/da8ebeec-c5b0-4fda-8faf-3b41f3cb7ec8.jpeg?height=1500&width=1000)\n\nFor listeners looking for an artist who is showing great promise early on in his career, 27Delly is definitely someone to keep your eye on for the rest of the year.\n\n## VISIONS OF GLASS\n\nDelly wanted to accompany his upcoming album “Fly Since Birth” with a one-of-a-kind visual experience - to extend his image from the block to the blockchain. Now it’s here.\n\n> *The music I make is transparent, and I think transparency and how real you’re keepin’ it is important because no then no one can question you, you just stay ten toes down.*\n\n![Transparency.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3bad2710-1a2c-4140-ae79-ccc5ed6a9b57.jpeg?height=1600&width=1255)\n\nLike Delly’s music, the mission of Glass is rooted in the idea of **transparency** - a video platform transparent to who and how everyone benefits in a new economy for digital media.\n\nEach of the coming drops acts as an audiovisual time capsule, minting the spirit of Harlem forever on the blockchain.\n\nDelly is bringing parties to the blockchain…\n\nCall that a ***BLOCKPARTY.***\n\n## The First Drop: FLYGUYS\n\nDelly will drop his first series of **27** NFTs on Glass on **August 27, 2021** at **3:27 PM EST**. The NFT is a 3D audiovisual experience - taking Delly’s artistic vision to the clouds.\n\n![Ready for takeoff.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a6ad6397-ec00-4ee5-9da1-fae950f0c1d2.png?height=2198&width=3120)\n\nStay tuned for the release of another series of **NFT editions “Exclusivity” on August 29**, followed by the release of his **1/1 “Flashy” Music Video NFT on September 7**.", "timestamp": 1630161762, "digest": "pWO8VOCLR0J_dkPiwygdDd4Im9UPY4p_T3JlpGNJR1w", "contributor": "0xDb6c1a8aF1883262aaD221A25816468ef693D4A2"}

Earlier this week, we launched the [“Heavy is the HVND” crowdfund initiative](https://blvkhvnd.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930) to raise funds standup our HVND DAO and aggressively acquire assets of the most anticipated crypto-native trading card game [Parallel](https://parallel.life) before their card holding snapshot. **We could not have been more lit.** Within the first 1 minute we reached our funding goal of 100 ETH. Within hours, we eclipsed 200 ETH. In the final stretch, we ended with **337.75 ETH—a $1m seed round.**\n\nOur raise told us a few things, but the most glaring fact was the recognition that the gaming industry needs something different. Something that blends culture + gaming, something that equitably distributes value through competition, content creation, and career pathways that touch all areas of the gaming industry. They are betting on BLVKHVND’s success and we know that we’ll make it because of our community and partners like [Lemniscap](https://lemniscap.com/) whose impact in crypto and gaming is well established.\n\nAs we kick off our first season, we want to thank each and everyone of our backers, supporters, and fans looking forward to seeing our community grow. Nothing is done in a silo and we are forever grateful—we could not have written a better story.\n\n## Season 1 - Roadmap + Immediate Actions\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/02f32681-6e80-484f-aa47-6b05e82fc3b8.jpg?height=1001&width=2000&&&&&size=large)\n\n### August 2021\n\n**Parallel Asset Acquisition**\n\nImmediately after the crowdfund’s closing we went to work purchasing roughly 130 ETH of Parallel Assets to complete 4 Parasets to obtain Galaxy Keys before the set snapshot. Our treasury is now sitting on over a half a million in asset value. With the addition of the Galaxy Keys and new Rug Poll \\[SE\\] assets, we are squarely positioned to make an impact in the Parallel community.\n\n[https://zapper.fi/account/blvkhvnd.eth/nft](https://zapper.fi/account/blvkhvnd.eth/nft)\n\n> *Please note that Zapper.fi does not account for multiples, so for a more accurate account, we will release a spreadsheet in the coming days for a better look into our asset pool.

These NFTs were minted on Zora from our BLVKHVND proxy address (the same address that created this mirror publication). We will also like to take this opportunity to reveal that the largest contribution was made by [Lemniscap](https://lemniscap.com/), a forward looking venture fund, and we are proud to have their support. We are excited and welcome their involvement with BLVKHVND as we strive to radically change esports, one HVND at a time!\n\n**NFT Drop**\n\nWe’ve gotten such a positive response to the crowdfund that more of you want in! While we do not have an active crowdfund, on Sunday Aug 29, we will be dropping our “HVND OF ACCESS” NFT. This NFT is an edition of 200, available first come, first serve,  never to be minted again. Supporters will receive the NFT, access to our discord role *“The HVND”*, a reward of 100 $HVND tokens, and a special thanks for being an early supporter of BLVKHVND.\n\n> *Unfortunately we cannot recover any other NFTs that were lost during the crowdfund. As such, the ACCESS NFT will be airdropped to the 7 backers who did not receive a HVND OF AFFLUENCE.*\n\nFor those who did get NFTs from the crowdfund, we will mint and airdrop S*pecial Edition* versions of the claimed number of NFTs. A snapshot will be taken Sunday morning at 9am EST to determine who gets these SE NFTs. We are excited to see all of our holders rock their favorite pieces. In due time, we will display a collection of our NFTs in a virtual gallery.\n\n**LP on Uniswap**\n\nOn August 31st, any participant in the crowdfund or purchases the ACCESS NFT on Sunday will be eligible to become a LIQUID HVND. Liquid Hvnds are liquidity providers that help give the token an open market to be bought, sold, traded amongst community members and speculators.\n\n### September 2021 — October 2021\n\n**Player Recruitment + Coaching Staff**\n\nTeams are more than just the *players*, good teams have coaches, analysts, and trainers at the highest competitive level. For us, serving casual, amateur, and pro-level players is no easy task, but one we are eager to tackle. Our focus will be recruiting for enthusiastic, coachable players that have the propensity to learn and experiment with their gameplay. Knowledge and experience of the game titles a player is interested in forming a team is important as is some level of competitive experience.\n\nWe will issue two signup forms in our discord on September 3rd for players and coaches with tryouts slated for September 15th.\n\n**The New BLVKHVND Web3 Setup**\n\nIn the coming weeks as we enter September, three bounties will be released:\n\n* Support for Stream Animations + Interactions\n* Support for BLVKHVND main site + auction house\n* Support for Intra-team Branding\n\nWe have many of the moving pieces to get us geared up for pushing consistent live and async content, but it’s not as fun if the HVND community doesn’t get involved. This is an opportunity to earn HVND by doing and putting your touch on what will be a global brand. More information will be released soon in our discord.\n\n**BLVKHVND Monster Mash Invitational**\n\nOur goal is to host our first tournament of the year and bring a mixture of crypto-native games like Axie Infinity to our community to discover and play with the communities they are apart of. We also want to test our newly formed dSports team and compete. More information related to this tournament will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n## LIQUID HVND: Introducing $HVND\n\n$HVND will launch on August 31st, 2021.\n\n**The [contract address](https://etherscan.io/token/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930) of $HVND is 0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930**\n\nThe supply of $HVND is 1,350,620 tokens, with 337,655 in circulation from the initial crowdfund.\n\n*Please exercise extreme caution when interacting with this token and triple check that the contract address matches the one above. $HVND represents membership in the BLVKHVND gaming community and should not be regarded as an investment.*\n\nBelow lists everything you need to know about $HVND:\n\n* 100 $HVND is required for full membership into the BLVKHVND gaming community\n* Voting rights can be delegated to other community members, and 25-50% of a strategic partner or outside capital (VC, Angel, etc) is required to delegate to the broader community.\n* Governance is done through Snapshot and will employ delegation and quadratic voting toward proposals.

Chan from @jgcfyi! @jgcfyi gets our beloved paperclip punk ([CryptoPunk #3744](https://opensea.io/assets/0xb7f7f6c52f2e2fdb1963eab30438024864c313f6/3744)) and 9999 DSMB, part of the [fractionalized dissected Meebit](https://opensea.io/assets/0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88/113567), plus 300 $CLIP in return. We’ll miss the paperclip punk but are excited to welcome @jgcfyi to PaperclipDAO! 🖇**\n\nMitchell Chan's Digital Zone of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility (IKB) is a 2017 NFT project that would be mindblowing even if it was released today. It can be thought of as a digital homage to a famous conceptual artwork by Yves Klein. Homage is artistic tradition---[Van Gogh’s beloved tributes to Hiroshige’s work](https://twitter.com/michikokakutani/status/789622118455644160) were a way to honor and celebrate the connection he saw between Japanese art and Impressionism. Chan saw the striking connection between Yves Klein and NFTs and created IKB.\n\nIKB draws on an exhibition by Yves Klein in 1958, in which patrons paid in pure gold to view empty spaces (*Zones*) that Yves imbued with the sensibility (but not the physical appearance) of the color blue. That an artist can “imbue” a space with their art was a radical concept in 1958, **but here in 2021’s NFT Summer we are happy to let artists imbue even a digital space with value.**\\[1\\] Digital Zones understood and predicted this in 2017 and it took the rest of us four years to get it.\n\n![IKB was playing with this idea before ERC-721 even existed.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b1a37edf-e6b8-41b8-8827-e327b909b51d.png?height=842&width=1058)\n\nIn Klein’s 1958 exhibition, a collector who wished to purchase a *Zone* had to pay in solid gold. They were then issued a paper receipt to serve as proof of transaction. Klein also designed a ritual meant to empower the purchaser to obtain the true immaterial sense of the artwork, enabling the sensibility of the artwork to become part of the owner in a spiritual sense. During this ritual, the purchaser would burn this receipt and Klein would throw half the gold into the River Seine. There are three documented instances of this ritual being performed. \n\nThe 101 IKBs represent a fascinating extension of Klein’s ritual on-chain (**including a smart contract function that will reproduce the effects of the ritual…**) across 7 series, minted starting in 2017. There’s much more to this project than we can cover here--for instance, IKB’s contract is a very early instance of a bonding curve. But you can learn more about this fascinating series by reading the [Blue Paper](https://github.com/mitchellfchan/IKB/blob/master/Digital-Zones-Of-Immaterial-Pictorial-Sensibility-Blue-Paper.pdf) or watching this [short video series](https://editorial.superrare.com/2021/03/10/63-years-ago-a-non-fungible-token-was-an-art-world-sensation-4-years-ago-it-went-on-chain/). \n\n![The color of the each IKB wrapper (right) uniquely corresponds to a color on the horizon along the north coast of Prince Edward Island, three hours before civil twilight.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1164708a-346e-41f0-9c7c-d5972d475075.png?height=740&width=1473)\n\nNeedless to say, we were floored to receive an offer for an IKB, a historic NFT and trade for Paperclip.  \n\n### The ones that got away: Round 3 Edition\n\nWe received many other notable offers, and as in previous rounds, we were sad to part with all the NFTs that we couldn’t accept.

We’ll miss the paperclip punk but are excited to welcome @jgcfyi to PaperclipDAO! 🖇**\n\nMitchell Chan's Digital Zone of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility (IKB) is a 2017 NFT project that would be mindblowing even if it was released today. It can be thought of as a digital homage to a famous conceptual artwork by Yves Klein. Homage is artistic tradition---[Van Gogh’s beloved tributes to Hiroshige’s work](https://twitter.com/michikokakutani/status/789622118455644160) were a way to honor and celebrate the connection he saw between Japanese art and Impressionism. Chan saw the striking connection between Yves Klein and NFTs and created IKB.\n\nIKB draws on an exhibition by Yves Klein in 1958, in which patrons paid in pure gold to view empty spaces (*Zones*) that Yves imbued with the sensibility (but not the physical appearance) of the color blue. That an artist can “imbue” a space with their art was a radical concept in 1958, **but here in 2021’s NFT Summer we are happy to let artists imbue even a digital space with value.**\\[1\\] Digital Zones understood and predicted this in 2017 and it took the rest of us four years to get it.\n\n![IKB was playing with this idea before ERC-721 even existed.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b1a37edf-e6b8-41b8-8827-e327b909b51d.png?height=842&width=1058)\n\nIn Klein’s 1958 exhibition, a collector who wished to purchase a *Zone* had to pay in solid gold. They were then issued a paper receipt to serve as proof of transaction. Klein also designed a ritual meant to empower the purchaser to obtain the true immaterial sense of the artwork, enabling the sensibility of the artwork to become part of the owner in a spiritual sense. During this ritual, the purchaser would burn this receipt and Klein would throw half the gold into the River Seine. There are three documented instances of this ritual being performed.\n\nThe 101 IKBs represent a fascinating extension of Klein’s ritual on-chain (**including a smart contract function that will reproduce the effects of the ritual…**) across 7 series, minted starting in 2017. There’s much more to this project than we can cover here--for instance, IKB’s contract is a very early instance of a bonding curve. But you can learn more about this fascinating series by reading the [Blue Paper](https://github.com/mitchellfchan/IKB/blob/master/Digital-Zones-Of-Immaterial-Pictorial-Sensibility-Blue-Paper.pdf) or watching this [short video series](https://editorial.superrare.com/2021/03/10/63-years-ago-a-non-fungible-token-was-an-art-world-sensation-4-years-ago-it-went-on-chain/).\n\n![The color of the each IKB wrapper (right) uniquely corresponds to a color on the horizon along the north coast of Prince Edward Island, three hours before civil twilight.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1164708a-346e-41f0-9c7c-d5972d475075.png?height=740&width=1473)\n\nNeedless to say, we were floored to receive an offer for an IKB, a historic NFT and trade for Paperclip.\n\n### The ones that got away: Round 3 Edition\n\nWe received many other notable offers, and as in previous rounds, we were sad to part with all the NFTs that we couldn’t accept. As always, we weighed several factors in making a final decision on which trade to accept. We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well.\n\n**We only have time to highlight a few of our favorites, but you can check out the [Round 3 offers](https://discord.gg/c6qrRPVz) to see them all.

We will establish a Discord channel for holders to swap slots based on their time preferences.**\n* **Regardless of the time of your minting slot, we strongly encourage you to be present for the Friday and Sunday dinners.**\n\n### \n\n**AARON PENNE**: RITUALS enables collectors to connect with their artwork in a meaningful way at the moment of its creation. Each output of this project gives a distinct window into the same parametric universe, a reminder that each of us are unique while fundamentally the same. The visuals and music are carefully constructed to weave an infinitely shifting experience, permanently etched into the blockchain.\n\n**BORETA**:  I have been creating generative ambient music for psychedelic therapy and meditation over the last few years. Aaron’s visual world enchanted me immediately. Just like the music; it’s calm, expansive, and immersive. There is an ineffable overlap in our creative worlds. I have been touring around the world playing live music for over a decade, and I have great reverence for the power of ritual to something larger than ourselves.\n\n**SCHEDULE**:\n\n* ***Before***:  Friday, Sep 24, 4pm PT: Prior to minting, we will host a late afternoon meal on the Windward Ave patio for the 200 holders of GTRV.  Everybody will have a name tag that displays which slot they will be minting (ie #1 is Friday 6pm… #100 Saturday 3am… #200 Sunday 7:45pm, etc…). Food by Travis Lett (Gjusta, Gjelina, MTN), music by Carlos Niño.\n* ***During***: Friday, Sep 24, 5p - Sunday, Sep 26, 7pm PT Continuous series of 200, 15-minute live minting experiences.  During each session, visitors will have an intimate, meditative opportunity to relax, set their intention and generate a unique audio / visual experience that is revealed to them in the gallery, and which they will collect an ArtBlocks NFT in their ETH wallet. There will be tea and fruit available for visitors in the gallery, and light food and drinks for visitors and their guests on the patio.\n* ***After***: Sunday, Sep 26, 7pm PT Upon the final mint, we will reconvene on the Windward patio, having all experienced RITUALS in the gallery, and all of us  changed somehow by it.  We will also experience the 800 online RITUALS being minted in real time by others online across the world. Food by Travis Lett (Gjusta, Gjelina, MTN), music by Carlos Niño.\n\n*Note on Group Rituals:  for groups of four who wish to pool 4 GTRV and share their Ritual experiences over the course of an hour, we will help you pool your minting slots, and the four NFTs that you each generate, into a single contract that is fractionalized four ways ([along lines of PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/about)).*", "timestamp": 1630191100, "digest": "G13gPtKyusEoZi02vYw2-71iIuHG7O4ieNxQMntDrG4", "contributor": "0x467aadC88d99B4E978A8d3d4f0A9017DCAECaAbF"}

The importance of this change goes way beyond the kinds of things that are currently popular in the crypto space. It’s not contained to art markets, collectibles, or even gaming. The existence of programmable, interoperable digital objects will fundamentally change the logic of the Internet.\n\nIt’s true that many digital objects will be purely cosmetic, like a rare avatar or piece of art you can display within different applications. But if digital objects are as versatile as physical objects (how many different things can “objects” do?), many NFTs will provide functional benefits to their owners. Digital items will move with their owners across the Internet and allow them to perform special actions across independent pieces of software.\n\nAs the implications of this reorganize how people use the Internet, many valuable companies will be created and destroyed. This doesn’t mean companies need to “get into NFTs” by selling digital collectibles or buying them. It means they need to build their companies on a mental model of the Internet that acknowledges all of the second order effects of digital objects.\n\nFor entire broad categories of software, if an application doesn’t recognize that people hold inventories, it won't be compelling to users. As we move into the future, more people on the Internet will be accumulating their own inventories of digital objects and won't want to spend time in software that forces them \"start over.”\n\nSome of the most valuable software of the coming years will be software that grasps and quickly adapts to the logical combination of scarcity and interoperability that NFTs bring to the Internet.", "timestamp": 1630202856, "digest": "k0yCgq0bjgn2X0AujhwjKIYk4SDBpdNayjU5_E8Wm4I", "contributor": "0xB0623C91c65621df716aB8aFE5f66656B21A9108"}

Before I explore why I think this is the case let’s define some terms.\n\nNon-fungible tokens are a type of crypto asset that represent unique (or “non-fungible”) digital goods like pieces of art or video game items. As with Bitcoin or Ether, these crypto-assets are held in a non-custodial and censorship resistant manner where proof of ownership exists on public blockchains.\n\nCryptoPunks are a set of 10,000 digital characters that have a variety of attributes with different levels of rarity based on their type (alien, ape, zombie) and attributes like tiaras, luxurious beards, hoodies, and so on. As one of the original NFT collectibles, punks were a seminal step in the development of the ERC-721 standard, which is the “file type” most NFT projects use today.\n\n![CryptoPunk 8348](https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/1\\*c8thAfkcYI4Y-aXE2QhEew.png)\n\nInitially, it may seem crazy that there are people willing to pay big money for what critics say are just PNG files of pixel art. If someone likes one of these punks, can’t they just right click and save the image? While I understand people who hold this view, it misses some important nuance around how art is valued. Let’s consider “real” art for a minute as a comparison.\n\nPaintings by Vincent van Gogh are expensive and many of his pieces have sold for millions of dollars over the past decade. At the same time, I grew up with a printed copy of one of van Gogh’s Sunflowers hanging above my kitchen table… and even though *I* think it’s beautiful, I wouldn’t be able to sell it. It’s worthless, it’s a print.\n\nWhat this shows is fine art has value — at least financially speaking — based on verifiable ownership of an original, not because of aesthetic beauty alone. If someone owns an original work by a famous artist, they gain a level of status. Wealthy people store value in fine art based on the assumption that this will hold true. That status persists. This is in part why so much art sits in freeports around the world and gets traded without the owners ever bothering to go see the pieces in person.\n\n![Side-by-side copies of Sunflowers, Fourth Version, Vincent van Gogh, 1888](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4eccbe08-e960-492e-9687-3c57b66163b2.png?height=404&width=642)\n\nOk, back to CryptoPunks. What is novel about CryptoPunks is they are among the first pieces of digital art on Ethereum that have a built in means of verifying unique ownership. This is done through cryptographic hashing such that a wallet address on Ethereum can have ownership rights over a CryptoPunk in a secure manner. As people have caught on to this, there has been a surge of interest in buying punks. In the last quarter of 2020 and the first few months of 2021 there have been tens of millions of dollars in sales volume surrounding CryptoPunks and a few purchases of over one million dollars each for the rarest ones. See below for a visual of the price action over the past three months from nonfungible.com:\n\n![CryptoPunk trading data from nonfungible.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*aKyoylvmGHXsN7ZA)\n\nSeveral people have laid out investment theses around why punks will hold value over time. A good one to read if you’re interested in exploring this further can be found [here](https://punk.substack.com/p/cryptopunks-digital-collectibles). To me, the value proposition comes down to two things. Punks as a store of value and punks as a reflexive asset with a great narrative. On the store of value side, there are only 10,000 punks and with all the new money in crypto there aren’t enough to go around. It’s a supply-side crisis. On the narrative side, punks have a great story: they had a fair launch so anyone could claim them for free back in the day, the founders behind the project are brilliant, they’re the rookie card of NFTs, etc.\n\nWhile some people see the current run up in punk prices as a bubble — and it may be, in part — I see it more as the repricing of an asset that many people (myself included) missed for a long time. Further, I expect to see the market cap of punks combined continue to grow significantly in the next five years, potentially even in proportion to the size of the NFT market as a whole.\n\nHere’s the theory: NFTs will be massive for the digital art and collectibles category. There will be billions of them. As this growth happens, certain NFTs will capture a majority of the value and punks are a good candidate to capture that value because capital will flow into them from *both* large and small investors.\n\nLet’s look at small collectors first. As new people come into the crypto space they tend to want to collect what is already valuable… and there’s nothing more valuable than punks: they’re persistent, they have a great community, they are used by important people as Twitter and Discord profile pictures, and so on.\n\nWhile punks are too pricey for everyday collectors — the lowest one on offer at the time of writing is $26,000 or 13.5 ETH — projects like NFTX and Niftex have made it possible for smallholders to participate. Both of those protocols use different mechanics to allow people to own a small portion of a punk, either through a set of index funds backed by real punks (NFTX) or fractional ownership of a single punk (Niftex). Together, these protocols allow ownership of punks to disperse in a way that’s never been true of any high-end collectible category. And there are liquid secondary markets for these tokens too.\n\nWhile value will pour into punks from normal collectors, wealthy NFT collectors will cause a surge in punk market cap as well. When I think of wealthy NFT collectors, I break them into two categories. There’s non-crypto money and crypto-native money.\n\nThe wealthy new investors will come into NFTs from outside crypto and want what is the most highly valued asset. Punks. For example, last week I was in the CryptoPunks Discord, which has a bot that reports on recent punk sales, and I saw a new Ethereum wallet drop a million dollars on a dozen punks in a single hour. How many people can do that before the prices go bananas?\n\nThen there’s the crypto-native people who denominate a portion of their net worth in punks. What does that even mean? In the same way that a lot of people who are OGs in Bitcoin play with and trade altcoins then take those gains back into Bitcoin… OG NFT collectors dabble in other NFT projects and when they make money there, they often take those gains back to punks as their numéraire (by buying more or rarer punks with that capital). As the NFT category expands, these people will be taking more and more profit back into punks. Again, punk numbers go up.\n\nUltimately then, with capital flowing in both from the bottom (everyday investors) and the top (high net worth people) punks will be bursting at the seams with value capture.

{"id": "BidAehG7IFW9oQOFNtok90Ma_NfklyDxkmqi7jtWLSU", "title": "The Fat CryptoPunks Thesis", "body": "\\*This essay appears as it was originally published in February 2021 with minor edits\n\nAs the non-fungible token (NFT) universe grows — both on Ethereum and across different blockchains — I think CryptoPunks will capture more value than any other set of digital art or collectibles. Before I explore why I think this is the case let’s define some terms.\n\nNon-fungible tokens are a type of crypto asset that represent unique (or “non-fungible”) digital goods like pieces of art or video game items. As with Bitcoin or Ether, these crypto-assets are held in a non-custodial and censorship resistant manner where proof of ownership exists on public blockchains.\n\nCryptoPunks are a set of 10,000 digital characters that have a variety of attributes with different levels of rarity based on their type (alien, ape, zombie) and attributes like tiaras, luxurious beards, hoodies, and so on. As one of the original NFT collectibles, punks were a seminal step in the development of the ERC-721 standard, which is the “file type” most NFT projects use today.\n\n![CryptoPunk8348](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b3abe999-a9ff-42c0-b1ca-6e244cc76334.png?height=345&width=624)\n\nInitially, it may seem crazy that there are people willing to pay big money for what critics say are just PNG files of pixel art. If someone likes one of these punks, can’t they just right click and save the image? While I understand people who hold this view, it misses some important nuance around how art is valued. Let’s consider “real” art for a minute as a comparison.\n\nPaintings by Vincent van Gogh are expensive and many of his pieces have sold for millions of dollars over the past decade. At the same time, I grew up with a printed copy of one of van Gogh’s Sunflowers hanging above my kitchen table… and even though *I* think it’s beautiful, I wouldn’t be able to sell it. It’s worthless, it’s a print.\n\nWhat this shows is fine art has value — at least financially speaking — based on verifiable ownership of an original, not because of aesthetic beauty alone. If someone owns an original work by a famous artist, they gain a level of status. Wealthy people store value in fine art based on the assumption that this will hold true. That status persists. This is in part why so much art sits in freeports around the world and gets traded without the owners ever bothering to go see the pieces in person.\n\n![Side-by-side copies of Sunflowers, Fourth Version, Vincent van Gogh, 1888](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aeb5675b-76f8-49c6-937f-3b4e186ce9e4.png?height=404&width=642)\n\nOk, back to CryptoPunks. What is novel about CryptoPunks is they are among the first pieces of digital art on Ethereum that have a built in means of verifying unique ownership. This is done through cryptographic hashing such that a wallet address on Ethereum can have ownership rights over a CryptoPunk in a secure manner. As people have caught on to this, there has been a surge of interest in buying punks. In the last quarter of 2020 and the first few months of 2021 there have been tens of millions of dollars in sales volume surrounding CryptoPunks and a few purchases of over one million dollars each for the rarest ones. See below for a visual of the price action over the past three months from nonfungible.com:\n\n![CryptoPunk trading data from nonfungible.com](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b232c90f-b63c-4367-b822-33b84f4e75b6.png?height=466&width=700)\n\nSeveral people have laid out investment theses around why punks will hold value over time. A good one to read if you’re interested in exploring this further can be found [here](https://punk.substack.com/p/cryptopunks-digital-collectibles). To me, the value proposition comes down to two things. Punks as a store of value and punks as a reflexive asset with a great narrative. On the store of value side, there are only 10,000 punks and with all the new money in crypto there aren’t enough to go around. It’s a supply-side crisis. On the narrative side, punks have a great story: they had a fair launch so anyone could claim them for free back in the day, the founders behind the project are brilliant, they’re the rookie card of NFTs, etc.\n\nWhile some people see the current run up in punk prices as a bubble — and it may be, in part — I see it more as the repricing of an asset that many people (myself included) missed for a long time. Further, I expect to see the market cap of punks combined continue to grow significantly in the next five years, potentially even in proportion to the size of the NFT market as a whole.\n\nHere’s the theory: NFTs will be massive for the digital art and collectibles category. There will be billions of them. As this growth happens, certain NFTs will capture a majority of the value and punks are a good candidate to capture that value because capital will flow into them from *both* large and small investors.\n\nLet’s look at small collectors first. As new people come into the crypto space they tend to want to collect what is already valuable… and there’s nothing more valuable than punks: they’re persistent, they have a great community, they are used by important people as Twitter and Discord profile pictures, and so on.\n\nWhile punks are too pricey for everyday collectors — the lowest one on offer at the time of writing is $26,000 or 13.5 ETH — projects like NFTX and Niftex have made it possible for smallholders to participate. Both of those protocols use different mechanics to allow people to own a small portion of a punk, either through a set of index funds backed by real punks (NFTX) or fractional ownership of a single punk (Niftex). Together, these protocols allow ownership of punks to disperse in a way that’s never been true of any high-end collectible category. And there are liquid secondary markets for these tokens too.\n\nWhile value will pour into punks from normal collectors, wealthy NFT collectors will cause a surge in punk market cap as well. When I think of wealthy NFT collectors, I break them into two categories. There’s non-crypto money and crypto-native money.\n\nThe wealthy *new* investors will come into NFTs from outside crypto and want what is the most highly valued asset. Punks. For example, last week I was in the CryptoPunks Discord, which has a bot that reports on recent punk sales, and I saw a new Ethereum wallet drop a million dollars on a dozen punks in a single hour. How many people can do that before the prices go bananas?\n\nThen there’s the crypto-native people who denominate a portion of their net worth in punks. What does that even mean? In the same way that a lot of people who are OGs in Bitcoin play with and trade altcoins then take those gains back into Bitcoin… OG NFT collectors dabble in other NFT projects and when they make money there, they often take those gains back to punks as their numéraire (by buying more or rarer punks with that capital). As the NFT category expands, these people will be taking more and more profit back into punks. Again, punk numbers go up.\n\nUltimately then, with capital flowing in both from the bottom (everyday investors) and the top (high net worth people) punks will be bursting at the seams with value capture. Over the coming years, we’re going to see some fat punks.\n\n*Credit to the many people whose thinking directly influenced this essay, specifically Aaron Wright, Scott Lewis, Alex Gausman, Snowfro, ddaavvee, gmoney, and JUSTIN.*\n\n*End Note: 100% of the proceeds from The Fat CryptoPunks Thesis will be donated to charity though Mirror’s “Split” functionality: 25% on-chain to GiveWell’s Maximum Impact Fund, 25% on-chain to SaveArtSpace, 25% on-chain to Coin Center, and 25% off-chain through me to charities in British Columbia.*\n\n[split://0x2cB6f19F64e76751DeFc6462852D4728CB0FDDda?network=mainnet](split://0x2cB6f19F64e76751DeFc6462852D4728CB0FDDda?network=mainnet)\n\n", "timestamp": 1630250609, "digest": "ak9bfiEqAW-PoDzLm9pwlAVbMc7KQj2iiA4PUHUk-X0", "contributor": "0x47ec58D5704082527a90362a6293029d7Ed5fc4E"}

The visuals and music weave an infinitely shifting experience, permanently etched on to the blockchain.\n\n### Of the 1,000 RITUALS that will be minted on ArtBlocks, the first 200 will be done exclusively IRL at Bright Moments NFT Gallery in Venice Beach.  These 200 physical experiences will be recognized on-chain (and with a visual watermark), that will forever link these decentralized ERC-721 smart contracts with the central role of the collector as a physical being, in a certain space, at a specific moment in time.\n\n### For those joining us for the RITUALS weekend, we are working with some of the most creative chefs, musicians, designers, and mindfulness practitioners that LA has to offer.\n\n - [Aaron Penne](https://www.artxcode.io/journal/aaron-penne-apparitions-on-art-blocks), [Boreta](https://boreta.net/), and [Bright Moments](https://twitter.com/brtmoments)\n\n[https://twitter.com/ritualsirl/status/1431413831314534401?s=20](https://twitter.com/ritualsirl/status/1431413831314534401?s=20)\n\n* **A 50-Hour Live Minting Marathon, with 200 continuous 15-minute IRL experiences.**\n* **Friday Afternoon Sep 24 - Sunday Evening, Sep 26 @ Bright Moments, 62 Windward Ave, Venice, California**\n* **ArtBlocks Factory edition of 1,000 NFTs = 200 IRL + 800 online mints**\n* **120 IRL tickets (GTRV = Golden Token: Rituals Venice) will go on sale for 2 ETH each tomorrow, Mon Aug 30 at 9am PT / noon ET**\n* **800 online mints will be available starting Sun Sep 26 at 7p PT / 10p ET, pricing TBD.**\n* **Holders of GTRV will receive  random IRL minting slots between #0-199, (which they can swap with other holders in a token-gated Discord channel)**\n* **Regardless of when you mint, in order to have the richest emotional experience possible,  we encourage you to join us Friday and Sunday for dinner.**\n\n**SCHEDULE**:\n\n* ***Before***:  Friday, Sep 24, 4pm PT: Prior to minting, we will host a late afternoon meal on the Windward Ave patio for the 200 holders of GTRV.

During each session, visitors will have an intimate, meditative opportunity to relax, set their intention and generate an original audio / visual experience that is revealed in the gallery (and which they will own as an ArtBlocks NFT in their ETH wallet). We ask everyone to bring something meaningful to them, and set it on the collective altar for the weekend.  There will be tea and fruit available for visitors in the gallery, and light food and drinks for visitors and their guests on the patio.\n* ***After***: Sun, Sep 26, 7pm PT Upon the final mint, we will reconvene on the Windward patio, having all experienced RITUALS in the gallery, and all of us  changed somehow by it.  We will also experience the 800 online RITUALS being minted in real time by others online across the world. Food by Travis Lett, music by Carlos Niño.\n\n*Note on Group Rituals:  for groups of four who wish to pool 4 GTRV and share their minting experiences over the course of an hour, we can help you pool your four minting slots, and the four NFTs that you each generate, into a single portfolio of 4 NFTs fractionalized four ways (similar to [PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/) & [Fractional.art](https://www.fractional.art)).*", "timestamp": 1630262299, "digest": "G13gPtKyusEoZi02vYw2-71iIuHG7O4ieNxQMntDrG4", "contributor": "0x467aadC88d99B4E978A8d3d4f0A9017DCAECaAbF"}

There will be tea and fruit available for visitors in the gallery, and light food and drinks for visitors and their guests on the patio.\n* ***After***: Sun, Sep 26, 7pm PT Upon the final mint, we will reconvene on the Windward patio, having all experienced RITUALS in the gallery, and all of us  changed somehow by it.  We will also experience the 800 online RITUALS being minted in real time by others online across the world. Food by Travis Lett, music by Carlos Niño.\n\n*Note on Group Rituals:  for groups of four who wish to pool 4 GTRV and share their minting experiences over the course of an hour, we can help you pool your four minting slots, and the four NFTs that you each generate, into a single portfolio of 4 NFTs fractionalized four ways (similar to [PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/) & [Fractional.art](https://www.fractional.art)).*", "timestamp": 1630268421, "digest": "G13gPtKyusEoZi02vYw2-71iIuHG7O4ieNxQMntDrG4", "contributor": "0x467aadC88d99B4E978A8d3d4f0A9017DCAECaAbF"}

Ownership of NFT collectibles (e.g. Nouns, Punks) enables communities with verifiable membership.\n\nSocial forums can use ownership verification to legitimize an account's voice within an NFT-based community, producing social capital for a pseudonymous entity. This begets a paradigm for collective action in which fully anonymized accounts can form capital and reliably coordinate to advance group values.\n\nWe consider the owner of a Noun NFT using a Mirror publication to run a crowdfund.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b9043b6e-4301-42c7-acb6-50dbcbcea7f6.png?height=506&width=1012)\n\n## Who is Noun 17?\n\nBuying a collectible NFT signals investment in a community. On August 24, an account invested [140 ETH](https://www.notion.so/0ee0eae99abaa43535b67b7a5cc90a0e) (\\~$450,000) in an NFT project called [NounsDAO](https://g.mirror.xyz/BqF6OA0uX2msUo4tp_iy9ZH1Dwz-_BWPOEJEoX46Yhg), purchasing the 17th Noun via auction. The signal is reinforced over time if the account holds the NFT as the resale value increases. We can verify this signal by viewing their [transaction history](https://www.notion.so/4990869c9f73bd7896271d83325d2067).\n\nAfter the purchase, the buyer did something else worth noting: They created a Twitter account called [Noun 17](https://twitter.com/Noun17_) - as if to speak on behalf of the Noun. The Twitter account only has 95 followers at the time of writing, and unfortunately we cannot verify NFT ownership on Twitter. But on Mirror we can verify ownership.\n\n## Reflections of a Noun\n\nMirror is a crypto-native publishing platform that links accounts to Ethereum addresses, so we can verify that a writer owns an NFT like a Noun.\n\nVerifying ownership legitimates the writer as a member of the community. As more crypto-native social networks come online, owners of collectible NFTs will have more spaces and forms in which to express themselves - enabling a multifaceted identity project for the NFT.\n\nA Noun can produce identity through narrative on forums like Mirror.\n\n## Noun Leaders\n\nMirror also has a crowdfunding tool, where DAOs are raising funds for various causes. A publication called *BLVKHVND* [just used it to raised 337.75 ETH](https://blvkhvnd.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930) (\\~$1 million), establishing their online gaming organization.\n\nAlthough NounsDAO can collaboratively govern a large treasury already, these tools give each Noun the autonomy to enact leadership using their own social capital.\n\nWhen we generalize from Nouns to every NFT community, we see the inevitable power of social networks that can verify Ethereum accounts.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* [NounsDAO](https://g.mirror.xyz/BqF6OA0uX2msUo4tp_iy9ZH1Dwz-_BWPOEJEoX46Yhg)\n* [How Identity Emerges in Crypto Networks](https://g.mirror.xyz/17-QuzdJJ0n-WGtuFiSXpH13-F3XCBgiPYCRtKANwc8)", "timestamp": 1630271825, "digest": "crpYz7_o0TMQkzqANnB12zsDkQ8LYidP20E0Y3sB9kI", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}
