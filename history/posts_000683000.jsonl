Real estate is the largest asset class in the world, most locked behind capital barriers, and is the primary mechanism through which the rentier paradigm sustains it’s parasitic extraction of urban value. The Building DAO, or ‘BauDAO’ is a collective-oriented, DAO-based software stack that restructures the paradigm of architectural funding, construction, and ownership. The BauDAO includes software mechanisms that 1) reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of urban assets, 2) enable tiered governance protocols for determining ‘program’, and 3) sharply decrease capital barriers to ownership by orders of magnitude through crowdfunding. \n \nThis report diagrams the software architecture (BIM wrapped in DAO) and the unique role of Architects themselves in triggering this paradigm of distributed urban ownership. The report begins with two near-term cases: a large creative collective acquiring studio space and a neighborhood-based residential building project, then speculates on mid-to-long-term scenarios for how these software-economic mechanisms can reshape cities and ecosystems in concert.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6517c066-8cd6-4f2b-9ac2-2c4baa57f5e1.jpg?height=2077&width=2700)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/31682ae9-1372-4dc0-afd2-be8cfbefdba8.jpg?height=1828&width=2700)\n\n\n\n# **The Problem of Memory in Digital Minds** \n-James Douglas Boyd\n\nDigital minds will differ from human ones in that they will be both intelligent agents and products of the engineering designs of others.

のレースについては[以前書いていますが](https://bspeak.substack.com/p/mirror-ethereum-eip-1559-)、先週ようやく10位以内に入ることができ、記事を投稿することができるようになりました。投票してくださった方々、大変ありがとうございます。\n\n今週分は[Mirror上でも投稿され](https://bspeak.mirror.xyz/)、Mirrorでの最初の日本語の文章となります。\n\nSubstackから文章をインポートすることができるため、簡単に利用することができます。また以前も書いた通りNFTクラウドファンディングができますが、他にも機能が追加されていて、「オークション」と「スプリット」という機能があります。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b02bf717-e34c-4641-8703-03afab4ab790.jpeg?height=1280&width=1296)\n\n\n　\n#### **オークション**\n\n主催側は、NFTオークションの開始価格と期間を設定します。そしてオークションで売り出したい自分のNFT（Zora上のNFT）を選ぶと、スマートコントラクトとして展開され、Mirrorの文章内に埋め込むことができます。\n\n設定した開始価格以上の入札があると、オークションが開始されます。\n\n例えば、Aliceが開始価格を1ETH、期間を12時間としたオークションを作成したとします。\n\nそのときの流れは、\n\n1.  ボブが1ETHの入札をしました。\n2.  12時間のオークションが開始されます。\n3.  最後の15分以内に入札された場合、残り時間は15分にリセットされます。\n4.  新しい入札は、前の入札よりも10％以上高い必要があります。\n5.  オークション終了時に最後に入札したアドレスがNFTを獲得します。\n\nとなります。\n\nまたオークションからの収益は、好きなEthereumアドレス/スマートコントラクトを指定できるため、自動で送ることができます。\n\nここで得た収益を、クラウドファンディングの支援者に回したり、後に説明するスプリット機能で複数のアドレスに流すこともできます。\n\n　\n#### **スプリット**\n\nこのスプリットは、生み出した収益を複数の人に共有する方法で、複数のアドレスに資金を流せるコントラクトになっています。作品を作ったときに協力してくれた人への報酬や、作品からの収益を寄付する方法として使用することができます。\n\nこれらの機能は今後来るべきがきたらぜひ利用したいと思っています。\n　\n　\n**■ Last Week in Crypto**\n\n１．[Uniswap | Uniswap V3 Mainnet Launch!](https://uniswap.org/blog/launch-uniswap-v3/)\n\nUniswap v3 がローンチしました。また予定では今月末にOptimismのL2対応になっています。Uniswap v3の概要は[以前書いています](https://bspeak.substack.com/p/uniswap-v3-mina-)が、流動性提供の際に価格レンジを指定することができます。\n\n書いている時点でローンチから３日経ちましたが、USDT/USDCのペアを見てみると、提供されている流動性は基本的に0.97ドルから1.03ドルの範囲に収まっています。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a6ee3fc-fad5-4f19-9d08-6d8ff682997a.jpeg?height=483&width=1190)\n\n\n\nUniswap v2 までは、このスパイクしている部分がなく、使われていない部分が多かったことを考えると、v3によって資産効率がよくなることが視覚的によくわかります。\n\nまた他のAMMを比べるには、TVLだけでは他のDeFiプロトコルと単純に比較できず、資産効率（出来高/流動性）という別の見方が必要ともいえます。\n\nちなみに流動性提供者それぞれが、市場価格と自分の予想に基づいて価格レンジを指定し、集中流動性プールが作られていく様子は[@bantgのツイート](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1390587207279382528)で見ることができます。\n\n　\n#### **NFT**\n\n流動性提供したポジションは固有になるため、ポジションごとにNFTで表現されていますが、面白いことにNFTごとにオンチェーンで画像が生成されます。\n\n\n\n\n\nそしてこの画像は、ポジションの情報によって変わるようになっています。例えば、配色はペアのトークンによって決まり、同じペアだとしてもトークンIDごとに色の分布が異なるため、それぞれがユニークになっています。\n\nまた預けられたときのトークン比率、集中流動性に基づいていて、カーブの形が変わるようになっています。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/901b62cf-9506-4ef9-9185-3940c15fbf15.jpeg?height=708&width=882)\n\n\n\n 右下にあるマークは、自分のポジションがどこにあるかによって変わり、✺のようなマークがついていると、レアマークだそうです（トークンIDが増えるとこのレア出る確率が少なくなり、異なるトークンIDが100個生成されれば約10％、10万個で約3％の確率になるそうです）。\n\nこのNFTのグラフィックを生成するスマートコントラクトは、Uniswap v3の中で唯一アップグレード可能なコントラクトになっているため、将来は新しいルールで生成されるNFTに変更できるようにもなっています。実際に、クリエーターが新しいデザインを提案でき、選ばれたものには助成金を与えることも予定されているそうです。\n\n\n　\n２．[Upshot’s NFT Appraisal Protocol Nabs $7.5M From CoinFund, Framework](https://www.coindesk.com/upshots-nft-appraisal-protocol-nabs-7-5m-from-coinfund-framework)\n\n[Upshot](https://upshot.io/) が $7.5Mを調達しました。Framework Ventures、CoinFund、Blockchain Capital、Slow Venturesなどが投資ラウンドに参加しました。\n\nUpshotは、専門家が正直な意見を言うことにインセンティブを与えるプロトコルで、それを応用してリアルタイムでのNFT鑑定のプラットフォームを目指しています。\n\nもともとUpshotは、保険に特化した予測市場として2019年に立ち上げられましたが、予測市場をNFTの価格発見に応用することに機会をみつけ「[UpshotOne](https://app.upshot.io/)」というサービスを開発しています。\n\n具体的には、NFTアートの価値について、ネット上から意見をもとめ、リアルタイムのNFT鑑定を集約します。ここには、正直な回答にインセンティブを与えられ、実績のある専門家の意見はより重視され、不誠実な参加者の意見は軽くなります。\n\n将来は、報酬をもらいながらキュレーションや鑑定するような人たちも出てくるかもしれません。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a0a26771-2779-482e-90c0-1046823bee7d.jpeg?height=651&width=1245)\n\n\n\n動画：[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSEOgG1zq44)\n\n#### **マネタイズ**\n\n将来的には、価格予測とチェーン上のデータを組み合わせてAPIを提供し、収益を上げることができる可能性があります。またネイティブトークンもあるので、そこから収益を得ることもできます。\n\n　\n３．[Jay-Z, A16z Back $19M Funding Round for NFT Platform Bitski](https://www.coindesk.com/jay-z-a16z-back-19m-funding-round-for-nft-platform-bitski)\n\nNFTプラットフォーム [Bitski](https://www.bitski.com/) は、Jay Z や a16z、EndeavorのCEOであるAri Emanuel などから $19Mを調達しました。Bitskiは、自らを「NFTのためのShopify」と表現し、ブランド、ゲーム開発者、消費者がデジタル商品を作成、購入、販売するための簡単なプラットフォームを提供することを目指しています。\n\n2019年11月にBitskiは、Galaxy Digital、Winklevoss Capital、Coinbase Venturesからの出資も受けていますが、当時Bitskiが注力していたのは、ビデオゲームなどの他のアプリケーションに簡単に組み込むことができるウォレットの開発でした。\n\n現在はマーケットプレイスに軸足を移し、アディダスなどのブランドによるNFT販売のためのプラットフォームを提供しています。\n\n上のUpshotもそうですが、NFTの盛り上がりとツールやインフラの整備をみて、NFTマーケットプレイス関連に軸足を移すサービスが増えてきました。VCによる投資も明らかに増えています。\n\n　\n４．[NFT startup RTFKT raises $8 million in seed funding led by A16Z](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/103837/nft-startup-rtfkt-8-million-seed-a16z)\n\nNFTスタートアップである[RTFKT Studios](https://www.rtfkt.com/)は、a16zが主導するシードラウンドで$8Mドルを調達しました。\n\nGalaxy Digital、Ledger、Dapper LabsのCEOであるRoham Gharegozlou氏、NFTアーティストのFewocious氏、以下で説明する「Genie」の創業者であるAkash Nigam氏などが参加しています。\n\n新たな資金で、クリエイターやアーティストを雇ってチームを拡大し、NFTマーケットプレイスを構築する計画です。\n\nRTFKT Studiosは、3月にデジタルスニーカーのNFTセールを開催して、開始7分で$3Mドル以上の売り上げを記録しています。\n\nバーチャルで過ごす時間が増えるにつれて、デジタルファッションが大きな市場となるのかはまだ分かりませんが、もしメタバースの世界が実現となればクリプトが利用されるのは自然なことです。\n\n　\n５．[Dapper Labs, Coinbase Ventures Join $65M Investment in Avatar Startup Genies](https://www.coindesk.com/dapper-labs-coinbase-ventures-join-65m-investment-in-avatar-startup-genies)\n\nオンライン世界の服など、アバターのマーケットプレイスを開発するスタートアップGeniesが、$65Mを調達しました。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/850508da-eb9f-4127-8c20-3feff1b99d26.jpeg?height=948&width=1152)\n\n\n\nDapper Labs、Polychain、Coinbase Ventures、Hashkeyなどのクリプト企業からも出資をうけています。\n\nまたジャスティン・ビーバーなどのセレブも早くからGENIESを支援していますが、歌手のカミラ・カベロも今回のシリーズBに参加しました。\n\nこの資金は、Geniesのアバター技術への投資に加えて、Flowブロックチェーン上でのデジタルグッズやNFTのマーケットプレイスの拡大に利用されます。\n\nDapper Labsは、今年後半にGenieと共に、デジタル製品の二次市場となるマーケットプレイスをつくる予定で、ユーザがアバターを購入、販売、交換することができます。\n　\n　\n６．[Paradigm, 3LAU Back $7.6M Raise for ‘NFT Social Network’

Alex Masmej氏は、過去に自身をトークン化した$ALEXというトークンを売り出したことで有名となりました。ソーシャルトークンの分野でもよく実例に出されるパーソナルトークンになっています。\n\n　\n７．[Solana-based NFT auction protocol Burnt Finance raises $3 million in seed

staking project Lido raises $73 million in new funding led by Paradigm](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/103874/eth2-staking-protocol-lido-raises-73-million-paradigm)\n\nEthereum 2.0のステーキングプロトコルであるLido Financeは、新たに$73Mドルの資金を調達しました。他のDeFiプロトコルの調達と比べると大型の調達です。\n\nこの資金調達をリード投資家となったのはVCのParadigmで、15,120ETHを投資し、LidoDAOの$51Mドル相当のLDOトークンを受け取りました。\n\n残りの$22Mドルは、Coinbase Ventures、Three Arrows Capital、Jump Trading、Alameda Research、Digital Currency Groupなどが投資をしています。\n\nLidoについては、[Bspeak! 2020年10月19日号](https://bspeak.substack.com/p/bancorammlidoeth20)

Billionドルのビットコイン収入を得て、これによる粗利益は$75Mドルとなっています。ビットコイン購入サービスによる利益が全体の7.7%に寄与したことになります。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/abf4c244-cc58-4769-a7ef-32f549ea9c91.jpeg?height=617&width=1070)\n\nまたSquareは、2020年4Qと2021年1Qに、それぞれ$50Mドルと$170Mドル分のビットコインに投資しましたが、リリースの中ではこの保有資産のパフォーマンスにも触れられています。それによると、2021年3月31日時点の、Squareのビットコイン投資の価値は$472Mドル（市場価格に基づく）で、投資時より$272Mドル上回っています。\n　\n　\n１１．[Coin

Blockchain Media Strategy](https://www.coindesk.com/forbes-blockchain-crypto-media-borderless)\n\nPatrick McConlogueという人物の作った企業 Borderless Services が、$700Mドルで、Forbesを買収するオファーを出しているという記事です。\n\n買収の契約がまとまれば、MetaMaskのようなブラウザ利用できるウォレットを統合し、クリプトメディアをつくるようです。Decryptのトークン実験のように、記事を読み終えたり、ソーシャルメディアで共有したりすると、トークンを受け取ることができるようになるかもしれません。広告に頼るメディアのビジネスモデルから脱却できる可能性があります。\n\nMcConlogue氏は「Borderlessの出版物はそれぞれ独自のトークンを発行する」ともコメントしています。\n\nまたForbesへの入札に加えて、ケーブルテレビや出版メディアを買収する予定とのことで、金融に関心のある読者や視聴者に、クリプトの認知度を高めることが目的だそうです。\n\nBorderlessは「[Overline](https://overline.network/)」というプロトコルを開発しているため、これが利用される可能性があり、オフラインのトランザクションも可能にする予定だそうです。\n\n---\n『Subscribe』を押すと毎週月曜6:30に届きます。ご登録ください☕\n\nhttps://bspeak.substack.com/\n\nぜひシェアお願いします🎉🎉\n\n---\n\n☕ Twitter：[@CoffeeTimesTW](https://twitter.com/CoffeeTimesTW)\n\n☕

のレースについては[以前書いていますが](https://bspeak.substack.com/p/mirror-ethereum-eip-1559-)、先週ようやく10位以内に入ることができ、記事を投稿することができるようになりました。投票してくださった方々、大変ありがとうございます。\n\n今週分は[Mirror上でも投稿され](https://bspeak.mirror.xyz/)、Mirrorでの最初の日本語の文章となります。\n\nSubstackから文章をインポートすることができるため、簡単に利用することができます。また以前も書いた通りNFTクラウドファンディングができますが、他にも機能が追加されていて、「オークション」と「スプリット」という機能があります。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b02bf717-e34c-4641-8703-03afab4ab790.jpeg?height=1280&width=1296)\n\n\n　\n#### **オークション**\n\n主催側は、NFTオークションの開始価格と期間を設定します。そしてオークションで売り出したい自分のNFT（Zora上のNFT）を選ぶと、スマートコントラクトとして展開され、Mirrorの文章内に埋め込むことができます。\n\n設定した開始価格以上の入札があると、オークションが開始されます。\n\n例えば、Aliceが開始価格を1ETH、期間を12時間としたオークションを作成したとします。\n\nそのときの流れは、\n\n1.  ボブが1ETHの入札をしました。\n2.  12時間のオークションが開始されます。\n3.  最後の15分以内に入札された場合、残り時間は15分にリセットされます。\n4.  新しい入札は、前の入札よりも10％以上高い必要があります。\n5.  オークション終了時に最後に入札したアドレスがNFTを獲得します。\n\nとなります。\n\nまたオークションからの収益は、好きなEthereumアドレス/スマートコントラクトを指定できるため、自動で送ることができます。\n\nここで得た収益を、クラウドファンディングの支援者に回したり、後に説明するスプリット機能で複数のアドレスに流すこともできます。\n\n　\n#### **スプリット**\n\nこのスプリットは、生み出した収益を複数の人に共有する方法で、複数のアドレスに資金を流せるコントラクトになっています。作品を作ったときに協力してくれた人への報酬や、作品からの収益を寄付する方法として使用することができます。\n\nこれらの機能は今後来るべきがきたらぜひ利用したいと思っています。\n　\n　\n**■ Last Week in Crypto**\n\n１．[Uniswap | Uniswap V3 Mainnet Launch!](https://uniswap.org/blog/launch-uniswap-v3/)\n\nUniswap v3 がローンチしました。また予定では今月末にOptimismのL2対応になっています。Uniswap v3の概要は[以前書いています](https://bspeak.substack.com/p/uniswap-v3-mina-)が、流動性提供の際に価格レンジを指定することができます。\n\n書いている時点でローンチから３日経ちましたが、USDT/USDCのペアを見てみると、提供されている流動性は基本的に0.97ドルから1.03ドルの範囲に収まっています。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a6ee3fc-fad5-4f19-9d08-6d8ff682997a.jpeg?height=483&width=1190)\n\n\n\nUniswap v2 までは、このスパイクしている部分がなく、使われていない部分が多かったことを考えると、v3によって資産効率がよくなることが視覚的によくわかります。\n\nまた他のAMMを比べるには、TVLだけでは他のDeFiプロトコルと単純に比較できず、資産効率（出来高/流動性）という別の見方が必要ともいえます。\n\nちなみに流動性提供者それぞれが、市場価格と自分の予想に基づいて価格レンジを指定し、集中流動性プールが作られていく様子は@bantgのツイートで見ることができます。\n\nhttps://twitter.com/bantg/status/1390587207279382528\n\n　\n#### **NFT**\n\n流動性提供したポジションは固有になるため、ポジションごとにNFTで表現されていますが、面白いことにNFTごとにオンチェーンで画像が生成されます。\n\n\nそしてこの画像は、ポジションの情報によって変わるようになっています。例えば、配色はペアのトークンによって決まり、同じペアだとしてもトークンIDごとに色の分布が異なるため、それぞれがユニークになっています。\n\nまた預けられたときのトークン比率、集中流動性に基づいていて、カーブの形が変わるようになっています。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/901b62cf-9506-4ef9-9185-3940c15fbf15.jpeg?height=708&width=882)\n\n\n\n 右下にあるマークは、自分のポジションがどこにあるかによって変わり、✺のようなマークがついていると、レアマークだそうです（トークンIDが増えるとこのレア出る確率が少なくなり、異なるトークンIDが100個生成されれば約10％、10万個で約3％の確率になるそうです）。\n\nこのNFTのグラフィックを生成するスマートコントラクトは、Uniswap v3の中で唯一アップグレード可能なコントラクトになっているため、将来は新しいルールで生成されるNFTに変更できるようにもなっています。実際に、クリエーターが新しいデザインを提案でき、選ばれたものには助成金を与えることも予定されているそうです。\n\n\n　\n２．[Upshot’s NFT Appraisal Protocol Nabs $7.5M From CoinFund, Framework](https://www.coindesk.com/upshots-nft-appraisal-protocol-nabs-7-5m-from-coinfund-framework)\n\n[Upshot](https://upshot.io/) が $7.5Mを調達しました。Framework Ventures、CoinFund、Blockchain Capital、Slow Venturesなどが投資ラウンドに参加しました。\n\nUpshotは、専門家が正直な意見を言うことにインセンティブを与えるプロトコルで、それを応用してリアルタイムでのNFT鑑定のプラットフォームを目指しています。\n\nもともとUpshotは、保険に特化した予測市場として2019年に立ち上げられましたが、予測市場をNFTの価格発見に応用することに機会をみつけ「[UpshotOne](https://app.upshot.io/)」というサービスを開発しています。\n\n具体的には、NFTアートの価値について、ネット上から意見をもとめ、リアルタイムのNFT鑑定を集約します。ここには、正直な回答にインセンティブを与えられ、実績のある専門家の意見はより重視され、不誠実な参加者の意見は軽くなります。\n\n将来は、報酬をもらいながらキュレーションや鑑定するような人たちも出てくるかもしれません。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a0a26771-2779-482e-90c0-1046823bee7d.jpeg?height=651&width=1245)\n\n\n\n動画：[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSEOgG1zq44)\n\n#### **マネタイズ**\n\n将来的には、価格予測とチェーン上のデータを組み合わせてAPIを提供し、収益を上げることができる可能性があります。またネイティブトークンもあるので、そこから収益を得ることもできます。\n\n　\n３．[Jay-Z, A16z Back $19M Funding Round for NFT Platform Bitski](https://www.coindesk.com/jay-z-a16z-back-19m-funding-round-for-nft-platform-bitski)\n\nNFTプラットフォーム [Bitski](https://www.bitski.com/) は、Jay Z や a16z、EndeavorのCEOであるAri Emanuel などから $19Mを調達しました。Bitskiは、自らを「NFTのためのShopify」と表現し、ブランド、ゲーム開発者、消費者がデジタル商品を作成、購入、販売するための簡単なプラットフォームを提供することを目指しています。\n\n2019年11月にBitskiは、Galaxy Digital、Winklevoss Capital、Coinbase Venturesからの出資も受けていますが、当時Bitskiが注力していたのは、ビデオゲームなどの他のアプリケーションに簡単に組み込むことができるウォレットの開発でした。\n\n現在はマーケットプレイスに軸足を移し、アディダスなどのブランドによるNFT販売のためのプラットフォームを提供しています。\n\n上のUpshotもそうですが、NFTの盛り上がりとツールやインフラの整備をみて、NFTマーケットプレイス関連に軸足を移すサービスが増えてきました。VCによる投資も明らかに増えています。\n\n　\n４．[NFT startup RTFKT raises $8 million in seed funding led by A16Z](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/103837/nft-startup-rtfkt-8-million-seed-a16z)\n\nNFTスタートアップである[RTFKT Studios](https://www.rtfkt.com/)は、a16zが主導するシードラウンドで$8Mドルを調達しました。\n\nGalaxy Digital、Ledger、Dapper LabsのCEOであるRoham Gharegozlou氏、NFTアーティストのFewocious氏、以下で説明する「Genie」の創業者であるAkash Nigam氏などが参加しています。\n\n新たな資金で、クリエイターやアーティストを雇ってチームを拡大し、NFTマーケットプレイスを構築する計画です。\n\nRTFKT

When we make assumptions, we state them. Otherwise, we presume that the future could unfold in many directions.\n\nThe futurist ideal is a profession dedicated to the formulation of new ideas and models for studying future possibilities. In practice, however, professional futurists necessarily produce content that is of value to their employers and funders. In many cases, their ideas are of value insofar as they serve to assist the realization of certain outcomes. It is rare for a futurist to be paid to simply think.\n\nWe launch our research service and publication project, Cope, with the view that the Mirror platform is a crowdfunding marketplace that makes an economy of ideas feasible. We seek to decouple our research from the conditions and agendas set by institutional funders, and conduct research that we and the Mirror community deem to be of importance. Feedback from our supporters is vital to our process. We imagine a new forum for future thought – research for the hive. Supporters can help steer our lines of inquiry by providing comments, asking questions, suggesting research topics, and by providing financial support for directions that they find valuable. \n\nWe methodically piece together plausible scenarios, step by step, using systems theory and applied mathematics. We compile our findings in detailed reports, and release them for small sums. We plan to release reports on a wide range of topics, such as:\n\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/320bf6ce-9d97-46a8-ab5d-1e2b625b7606.jpg?height=1500&width=2700)\n\n\nOur output is high-volume and our turn-arounds are prompt. Successfully crowdfunded reports are released within two weeks, often sooner. At certain intervals we will publish print editions of the entire body of research. These will also include previously unreleased material. All supporters will receive a print edition, regardless of the amount contributed. \n \nIf you're into Cope straight away, please support the first issue of our service. We've set a goal in anticipation of ongoing engagement with the distributed community of supporters. The first issue, Cope #1, includes two reports on topics of personal interest. The first report describes a DAO-based software stack for collective ownership of architecture. It outlines a sequence of scenarios in which programmable money, fractional ownership, and distributed governance radically reconfigure how the built environment is constructed and managed. The second report explores an anticipated issue of memory in digital mind engineering, introducing mathematical models to pose questions and offer solutions. Abstracts can be found below.\n\n\n[Cope 01](crowdfund://0xb0c813151d18482a914a2b95b1a25d020532Bb36?network=homestead)\n\nWe like Mirror because we see crowdfunding as an opportunity for young professional researchers to break from think tanks, universities, and strategy firms. We take the future too seriously to agree to institutional constraints. By establishing regular feedback with a distributed set of supporters who find our reports valuable, we can create systematic studies of future outcomes – and pathways toward them – without having to trudge through byzantine protocols, semantic ciphers of clients, and conditional funding cycles. By lifting legacy constraints, we can speak about the future unrestrained. \n\nWe're also making use of the [Splits](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/splits) feature, which allows us to automatically direct funds to those who have inspired our work. In this case, we’re sending 4% to three people who have laid groundwork for us: [Kei Kreutler](https://www.ourmachine.net/), [Jesse Walden](https://variant.fund/), and [Kristoffer Josefsson](https://foam.space/). Thanks to you all!\n\n\n\n\n\n## *Cope #01 – Two Reports*\n\n# **The BauDAO – An OS for Urban Ownership** \n-Pierce Myers\n\n\nFractional ownership and distributed governance are programmable mechanisms of the Ownership Economy that will be applied to the expanded field of tangible assets in the city. Real estate is the largest asset class in the world, most locked behind capital barriers, and is the primary mechanism through which the rentier paradigm sustains it’s parasitic extraction of urban value. The Building DAO, or ‘BauDAO’ is a collective-oriented, DAO-based software stack that restructures the paradigm of architectural funding, construction, and ownership. The BauDAO includes software mechanisms that 1) reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of urban assets, 2) enable tiered governance protocols for determining ‘program’, and 3) sharply decrease capital barriers to ownership by orders of magnitude through crowdfunding. \n \nThis report diagrams the software architecture (BIM wrapped in DAO) and the unique role of Architects themselves in triggering this paradigm of distributed urban ownership. The report begins with two near-term cases: a large creative collective acquiring studio space and a neighborhood-based residential building project, then speculates on mid-to-long-term scenarios for how these software-economic mechanisms can reshape cities and ecosystems in concert.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6517c066-8cd6-4f2b-9ac2-2c4baa57f5e1.jpg?height=2077&width=2700)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/31682ae9-1372-4dc0-afd2-be8cfbefdba8.jpg?height=1828&width=2700)\n\n\n\n# **The Problem of Memory in Digital Minds** \n-James Douglas Boyd\n\nDigital minds will differ from human ones in that they will be both intelligent agents and products of the engineering designs of others. It may not always be easy for a digital mind to differentiate the aspects of its intelligence that are autonomous and those that are features of others’ designs. Memory is one such aspect. We consider an experiment that a digital mind can conduct and two measures that it can estimate for choosing among hypotheses regarding the origins of its memories.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eef26e2d-486a-4b5a-9219-4f77c9d35d25.jpg?height=1300&width=2700)\n\n\n\n### *Going Forward*\nAs Cope grows, the issues will include larger numbers of reports from a diversity of future thinkers.

When we make assumptions, we state them. Otherwise, we presume that the future could unfold in many directions.\n\nThe futurist profession is dedicated to the formulation of new ideas and models for studying future possibilities. In practice however, professional futurists necessarily produce work that is of value to a single employer or funder. The ideas are valuable insofar as they help realize a predetermined outcome. It is rare for a futurist to be paid to think outside an agenda.\n\nWe’re launching our research service Cope, with the view that the Mirror platform is a crowdfunding marketplace that opens a new economy of ideas. We seek to decouple our research from the conditions and agendas set by institutional funders, and conduct research that the community deems to be of importance. In this model, feedback from our supporters is vital to our process. Supporters help steer our lines of inquiry by commenting, suggesting topics, and providing financial support.

Real estate is the largest asset class in the world, most locked behind capital barriers, and is the primary mechanism through which the rentier paradigm sustains it’s parasitic extraction of urban value. The Building DAO, or ‘BauDAO’ is a collective-oriented, DAO-based software stack that restructures the paradigm of architectural funding, construction, and ownership. The BauDAO includes software mechanisms that 1) reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of urban assets, 2) enable tiered governance protocols for determining ‘program’, and 3) sharply decrease capital barriers to ownership by orders of magnitude through crowdfunding. \n \nThis report diagrams the software architecture (BIM wrapped in DAO) and the unique role of Architects themselves in triggering this paradigm of distributed urban ownership. The report begins with two near-term cases: a large creative collective acquiring studio space and a neighborhood-based residential building project, then speculates on mid-to-long-term scenarios for how these software-economic mechanisms can reshape cities and ecosystems in concert.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6517c066-8cd6-4f2b-9ac2-2c4baa57f5e1.jpg?height=2077&width=2700)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/31682ae9-1372-4dc0-afd2-be8cfbefdba8.jpg?height=1828&width=2700)\n\n\n\n# **The Problem of Memory in Digital Minds** \n-James Douglas Boyd\n\nDigital minds will differ from human ones in that they will be both intelligent agents and products of the engineering designs of others.

When we make assumptions, we state them. Otherwise, we presume that the future could unfold in many directions.\n\nThe futurist profession is dedicated to the formulation of new ideas and models for studying future possibilities. In practice however, professional futurists necessarily produce work that is of value to a single employer or funder. The ideas are only valuable insofar as they help realize a predetermined outcome. It is rare for a futurist to be paid to think outside an agenda like this.\n\n***Cope*** is a research service, established with the understanding that the crowdfunding marketplace will open a new economy of ideas. Our research is decoupled from the conditions and agendas set by institutional funders. In a model like this, feedback from our supporters is vital to the process, and so our supporters will help steer the lines of inquiry by commenting, suggesting topics, and offering financial support for work they find valuable. We imagine it as a new forum for future thought – ***Research for the Hive***. \n\nWe methodically piece together plausible scenarios, step by step, using systems theory and applied mathematics. Our findings are compiled in detailed reports and released promptly. The range of topics includes:\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/320bf6ce-9d97-46a8-ab5d-1e2b625b7606.jpg?height=1500&width=2700)\n\n\nOur output is high-volume and our turn-arounds are prompt. Successfully crowdfunded reports are released within two weeks, often sooner. At certain intervals we will publish print editions of the entire body of research. These will also include previously unreleased material. All supporters will receive a print edition. \n \nIf you're into *Cope* straight away, please support the first issue of our service. We've set a goal in anticipation of ongoing engagement with the distributed community of supporters. The first issue includes two reports on topics of personal interest. The first report describes a DAO-based software stack for collective ownership of architecture. It outlines a sequence of scenarios in which programmable money, fractional ownership, and distributed governance radically reconfigure how the built environment is constructed and managed. The second report explores an anticipated issue of memory in digital mind engineering, introducing mathematical models to pose questions and offer solutions. Abstracts can be found below.\n\n\n[Cope 01](crowdfund://0xb0c813151d18482a914a2b95b1a25d020532Bb36?network=homestead)\n\nWe like Mirror because we see crowdfunding as an opportunity for young professional researchers to break from think tanks, universities, and strategy firms. We take the future too seriously to agree to institutional constraints. By establishing regular feedback with a distributed set of supporters who find our reports valuable, we can create systematic studies of future outcomes – and pathways toward them – without having to trudge through byzantine protocols, semantic ciphers of clients, and conditional funding cycles. By lifting legacy constraints, we can speak about the future unrestrained. \n\nWe're also making use of the [Splits](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/splits) feature, which allows us to automatically direct funds to those who have inspired our work. In this case, we’re sending 4% to three people who have laid groundwork for us: [Kei Kreutler](https://www.ourmachine.net/) for her work on the qualities of DAOs, [Jesse Walden](https://variant.fund/) for The Ownership Economy of Metaverses, and [Kristoffer Josefsson](https://foam.space/) for his ongoing work with FOAM and editorial guidance.\n\n\n## Report 1: *The BauDAO*\n-Pierce Myers\n\n\nFractional ownership and distributed governance are programmable mechanisms of the Ownership Economy that will be applied to the expanded field of tangible assets in the city. Real estate is the largest asset class in the world, most locked behind capital barriers, and is the primary mechanism through which the rentier paradigm sustains its parasitic extraction of urban value. The Building DAO, or ‘*BauDAO*’ is a collective-oriented, DAO-based software stack that restructures the paradigm of architectural funding, construction, and ownership. The *BauDAO* includes software mechanisms that 1) reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of urban assets, 2) enable tiered governance protocols for determining ‘program’, and 3) sharply decrease capital barriers to ownership by orders of magnitude through crowdfunding. \n \nThis report diagrams the software architecture (BIM wrapped in DAO) and the unique role of Architects themselves in triggering this paradigm of distributed urban ownership.

This helped us identify where we fit into the world. \n\n\n2. **Value Exchange** - Selling an NFT is an exchange of value. Step 1 helped us understand who we wanted to speak to and what our value prop was to the buyer. \n\n\n3. **Learn by Doing** - This process has accelerated our education in the space.The Auction itself educated us on the value of DAOs... and we've already invested in a DAO as well as discussed ways to roll out education with Crypto-Creator advisory board: Louie, JZ, Yang and Anish.\n\n### Interested in how we minted and sold the NFT?\nWatch our YouTube video from before the Auction\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSXMM9Y1blk\n\n### The Auction\n[Token #2962](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2962)\n\nThanks for taking part more to come on [YouTube.com/ColinandSamir](url)\n\n- Samir", "timestamp": 1620625382, "digest": "4vkEtviOAAu6aLoj_hqu5ukHl_taLh6KeWW2hk5go1M", "contributor": "0xc63A26A74326076feb89040586FfcDcED3B42bF5"}

{"id": "pDT2jdf5GSiHYyNHiFFDSfjsm9DJcTieE8bK3npokEA", "title": "The Great Online Game", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/832e2e69-8807-4b38-8bbd-71602050fc01.jpeg?height=600&width=1200)\n\n\nThis didn’t start as a piece about games. I set out to answer this question: why are tech growth stocks sagging while crypto moons and value roars back? \n\nBut I figured out how to explain that out in way fewer words: \n\nCrypto is just more fun. \n\nBut crypto itself is not the game. It’s just the in-game currency for a much bigger game, played across the internet, that involves CEOs, influencers, artists, researchers, investors, and regular people, like you and me. That’s a much more fun topic to explore than which asset class is outperforming which. This is bigger, more permanent than day-to-day market fluctuations.\n\nWe’re all playing a Great Online Game. How well we play determines the rewards we get, online and offline.\n\nThe Great Online Game is played concurrently by billions of people, online, as themselves, with real-world consequences. Your financial and psychological wellbeing is at stake, but the downside is limited. The upside, on the other hand, is infinite.\n\nSocial media is the clearest manifestation of this meta-game. Beginner-level Twitter feels weird, like a bunch of people exposing their personal thoughts to the world. Medium-level Twitter is Threads and engagement hacks. Twitter Mastery is indistinguishable from an ongoing game. This is also true for Reddit, Discord, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and other social networks. \n\nBut social media is just one piece of an interconnected game that spans online and offline spaces. The way you play in one area unlocks opportunities in others. Sharing ideas on Twitter might get you invited to a Discord, your participation in that Discord might get you invited to work on a new project, and that new project might make you rich. Or it might bring you more followers on Twitter and more Discord invites and more project opportunities and new ideas that you want to explore which might kick off any number of new paths. \n\nWe now live in a world in which, by typing things into your phone or your keyboard, or saying things into a microphone, or snapping pictures or videos, you can marshall resources, support, and opportunities. Crypto has the potential to take it up a notch by baking game mechanics -- points, rewards, skins, teams, and more -- right into the whole internet. \n\nThe Great Online Game is free to play, and it starts simply: by realizing that you’re playing a game. Every tweet is a free lottery ticket. That’s a big unlock.\n\nAnyone can play. You can choose how to play given your resources and skills at the current moment. You can level up fast. Financial and social capital are no longer tied so tightly to where you went, who you know, or what your boss thinks of you. This game has different physics and wormholes through which to jump. It’s exponential instead of linear.\n\nTo understand how the game works and how to play, we’ll work our way up: \n\nWhat is a Video Game? \n\nThe Great Online Game \n\nMeet the Players\n\nHow Crypto Supercharges the Game\n\nHow to Play the Game\n\nBy the end of this post, I hope I’ve convinced you to throw a couple coins in and start playing, but I think I might need to show you that we’re even playing a video game first.\n\nWhat is a Video Game? \n\nIt’s Monday morning. You’re tired. You have to go to work. You have an assignment that you pushed off on Friday, because it’s practically Hot Vax Summer and you had plans, but now it’s Monday and damn. Now you need to do that thing. This does not seem fun. This does not seem like a game. \n\nSo it might take me a minute to convince you that yes, it is, even for you. I’m going to start my argument like a shitty high school valedictorian: \n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines a video game as, “A game played by electronically manipulating images produced by a computer program on a television screen or other display screen.”\n\nIf you’re working remotely from a computer, what you’re doing perfectly fits the definition of a video game. \n\nNik Milanovic nailed it:\n\nHit the right keys in the right order, make money. Work is just an often boring sub-game within the meta-game. \n\nBut that’s still a little literal, and a lot reductive. Let’s go deeper. The best games, according to gaming entrepreneur turned top solo investor Josh Buckley, “are creating spaces that bring you into flow.” \n\nOn Invest Like the Best, Buckley said:\n\nThe biggest games today really take advantage of this, but you wouldn't actually think of them as a game. I look at Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram as games and 3 billion people are playing them actively. They're essentially big layers on top of a slot machine.\n\nBuckley went on to lay out four elements of successful game design: \n\nFrequent Feedback Loops\n\nVariable Outcomes \n\nSense of Control\n\nConnection to a Meta-Game\n\nAll four are present in the Great Online Game, none more importantly than the connection to the meta-game. \n\nThe Great Online Game \n\n“The internet is incredible.” You’ll hear that a lot from people who’ve started to master the Game. As I typed that last sentence, Blake Robbins tweeted this: \n\nGetting good at the Great Online Game makes seemingly absurd things happen. Your business icon? In your DMs. That person whose videos you don’t miss? Just reached out for a collab. Your dream job? Reaching out to you to tell you why Company X might be a fit. \n\nBlake has successfully translated “hanging out on the edges of the internet” into a career as a venture capitalist at Ludlow Ventures. He’s a go-to source on creators, gaming, and future internet stuff more broadly for some of the smartest people in the world. Blake summarized his approach in another recent tweet: \n\nHe’s playing an infinite game, going down rabbit holes, learning, helping people, meeting new ones, going down more rabbit holes, and so on. \n\nJames Carse, who coined the term in his 1986 book Finite and Infinite Games: A Vision of Life as Play and Possibility, wrote:\n\nThe infinite game - there is only one - includes any authentic interaction, from touching to culture, that changes rules, plays with boundaries and exists solely for the purpose of continuing the game. A finite player seeks power; the infinite one displays self-sufficient strength. Finite games are theatrical, necessitating an audience; infinite ones are dramatic, involving participants...\n\nThe Great Online Game is an infinite video game that plays out constantly across the internet. It uses many of the mechanics of a video game, but removes the boundaries. You’re no longer playing as an avatar in Fortnite or Roblox; you’re playing as yourself across Twitter, YouTube, Discords, work, projects, and investments. People who play the Great Online Game rack up points, skills, and attributes that they can apply across their digital and physical lives. Some people even start pseudonymous and parlay their faceless brilliance into jobs and money. \n\nThe Game rewards community and cooperation over individualism and competition. You get points for being curious, sharing, and helping with no expectation of reciprocation. By increasing your surface area, you’re opening yourself up to serendipity. For good actors, the Game has nearly unlimited upside, and practically no downside.\n\nYou can jump into the Great Online Game at any point, whether as a total unknown or an accomplished person, and start building the world that you want to build. It can take you on any number of paths. We’ll explore a few. \n\nMeet The Players \n\nThe inspiration for this essay was Elon Musk’s SNL appearance. No one plays this game better than Musk. The best way to explain his out-of-body run is that he’s playing a video game with cheat codes.\n\nHe’s doing things that people didn’t think were physically possible -- see: Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink -- while getting away with things that people didn’t think were legal -- see: pumping Dogecoin, $420 take-private tweet, getting high on Joe Rogan. \n\nHe’s playing a postmodern game against modern rivals. He’s like Neo. He’s not trying to forcefully bend the spoon; he understands there is no spoon. He has more money points than all but two people in the world to show for it.\n\nMusk plays an advanced version of the Game in which he builds rocket ships and electric cars and internet satellites, but you don’t need to bend atoms or become the wealthiest person in the solar system to win. You don’t even have to reveal yourself as a real person. \n\nA couple weeks ago, Austin Rief and I had Bored Elon Musk on our weekly Twitter Spaces show, Spaces Cadets. Bored Elon is a pseudonymous account. He tweets ideas for inventions that Elon might have if he were bored, and 1.7 million people follow him on Twitter. A couple months ago, he started selling NFTs. He pulled in $1 million in less than a month. How about a non-Elon example?\n\nTake Alex Danco. Alex has literally built himself a world: Dancoland. In an excellent post on his journey, Alex drew an actual map of his journey through the Great Online Game. \n\nHe started by writing about startups, moved on to bubbles and mania, passed through the Swamp of Scenes, and made it to the Humanities Mountain Range. While he wrote, he got to meet new people, test new ideas, and build up a reputation. It helped him find his next thing. “This newsletter was obviously part of a fishing expedition to find what I wanted to do next.” Next was a dream job at Shopify, thanks in part to the newsletter. \n\nInstead of claiming MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, though, he’s continuing to play the Great Online Game, expanding his world by branching into new communities. Specifically, he’s going to have a recurring segment on Jim O’Shaughnessy’s Infinite Loops podcast and become a more active participant in Anna Gat’s magical Interintellect. Those will no doubt lead to new opportunities and new worlds to explore.\n\nOr take Megan Leeds. \n\nLeeds parlayed YouTubes of herself literally playing video games -- The Sims -- into Roblox content into making games into a 1mm+ YouTube following, $8mm game studio, and a $1mm online store. Her quote in Rex Woodbury’s thread captures the Great Online Game beautifully:\n\nThere’s nothing I’ve done that anybody else can’t do. It’s about learning—learning the code, learning how the game works, & creating. All you have to do is start.\n\nStart, follow your curiosity, build relationships, stay open to new opportunities, keep playing.\n\nHow about Lil Nas X? Born Montero Hill after the Mitsubishi Montero, Lil Nas X started messing around on Facebook, Instagram, and finally, “hopped on Twitter ... where I really was a master. That was the first place where I could go viral.” \n\nHe started making music in his closet, and in December 2018, he dropped Old Town Road, which he made with a $30 sample and $20 worth of studio time. The song was played over 2.5 billion times in 2019 alone. He came out on the last day of Pride Month in 2019, and has used his platform to represent the LGBTQ community as one of the very few out rappers. Earlier this year, he released Montero (Call Me By Your Name). He gives the Devil a lap dance in the music video. \n\nMontero to memes to music to Montero. Lil Nas X continues to use Twitter like a young memelord. He’s playing the Game. \n\nThe Great Online Game overlaps with the Creator Economy -- Danco wrote a newsletter, Leeds had a YouTube channel, Lil Nas X makes music -- but it doesn’t necessarily mean living as a full-time creator. Danco has a full-time job, Leeds runs companies with employees. \n\nThere are countless more examples, from Kim Kardashian to Donald Glover to Turner Novak to Andrea Hernandez to Harry Stebbings to AOC to Web Smith to DeepFuckingValue to Soulja Boy to the Extended Pompliano Universe. All these people seem like they’re having a blast while they’re “working.” \n\nAnd that’s just my corner of the internet. There are millions of people playing the Game well.\n\nEach one is internet-native, each plays the Game, and each has cashed out some internet points for things like TV shows, Grammy-winning records, venture funds, companies, and political victories. It’s less about a particular platform or outcome, and more about the idea that there are different ways of playing the game and new ways to acquire and grow new types of assets. Like cities. \n\nMiami Mayor Francis Suarez became a Twitter darling last year when he decided to embrace the tech community. \n\nSince responding “How can I help?” to Delian’s tweet in December, Suarez has pulled a ton of high-growth companies into his city. He’s become the go-to example of how to grow a city by playing the Great Online Game. Not surprisingly, he’s also embraced crypto. \n\nWith crypto’s ascent, there are thousands of newly-minted millionaires, and dozens or hundreds of billionaires, who built their fortunes by hanging out in Discords, learning about and investing in new coins, playing with new protocols, and treating investing like a game. Millions of people are playing the Game just by hanging out and watching. \n\nI have multiple friends who, a couple months ago, had normal jobs at startups. Then they started hanging out in crypto Discords and Telegrams, trading, learning, meeting people, tweeting, and going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. I can’t imagine they’ll ever work in a non-crypto job from here on out. \n\nCrypto is an asset class that rewards participation in the Great Online Game. The fastest way to understand what’s legit and what’s not, and which coins people are going to buy and which they’re going to ignore, is to spend time participating and learning online. The right Discord or Twitter follow is a massive source of alpha. \n\nPlus, crypto is kind of the native token for the Great Online Game.\n\nHow Crypto Supercharges the Game\n\nPeople in crypto seem to understand better than anyone that this is all a game. The right meme can send a random coin to the moon and make people legitimately rich. \n\nBut beyond that, crypto is in-game money for the internet. It rewards participation directly. Early users, supporters, builders, stakers, validators, and community members get tokens. \n\nUntil now, I didn’t fully understand social tokens. They seemed like another way for influencers to monetize with no clear value. But in the context of the Great Online Game, they’re points that reward good gameplay across the internet, and give followers an incentive to join and support a team anywhere it goes. It’s like a Super Follow for the whole internet, with financial rewards.\n\nCrypto also lets players exchange value directly. Recently, I experimented with selling an essay as an NFT, which Clint Kisker bought for 2.19 ETH. That’s a direct connection between two players in the Game. Even though I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about, and even playing with, NFTs, though, it didn’t really click for me until I saw these slides from Mirror’s Patrick Rivera:\n\nThe Great Online Game imitates video games. If people want to buy skins in Fortnite to express themselves, or clothes in meatspace to do the same, of course they’d want to buy NFTs to express themselves online. In an open world like the internet, the more you signal who you are and what you care about, the more you open yourself up to new possibilities. It’s an abundant game. NFTs are online art, cars, outfits, and houses. They’re the digital trappings of digital wealth. \n\nDAOs, too, are going to be important infrastructure for the Great Online Game. They make it easier for people to float in and out of projects at internet speed instead of committing to climb the ladder within a company, and allow for lightweight and temporary groupings when people want to combine their superpowers. Recently, PartyDAO formed to bring a bunch of smaller players together to compete against rich whales in NFT auctions. \n\nI suspect that many of the most successful web3 projects built in the coming years will serve to give the Great Online Game tools that were previously only available within the walled gardens of specific virtual or corporate worlds. I’m excited about and / or an investor in Crucible, Mirror, Seed Club, and Opolis to name a few. \n\nThe Great Online Game is only going to get more compelling. We’re in the early innings. So how should you play? \n\nHow to Play the Game\n\nOn Friday, Shopify President Harley Finkelstein joined us on Spaces Cadets. To close out the conversation, we asked him for his advice to potential entrepreneurs out there: \n\nThat’s a key mental shift. The cost of failure is as close to zero as it’s ever been, and it will continue to fall. That’s true for entrepreneurship, and it’s even more true for the Great Online Game. Because entrepreneurs are trying to build a business; when you start to play the Great Online Game, you’re just building optionality. \n\nAnyone can play the Great Online Game. All you need is some knowledge and curiosity. \n\nA typical path into the Game starts out in one niche community -- maybe you start thoughtfully replying to a few people you respect in your field on Twitter, or hop into a crypto Discord and get a feel for things before asking questions and participating. Ask yourself: “What am I nerdiest about?” and then go find your fellow nerds. They’re out there. \n\nOver time, you go from consumer to creator. You write, make videos, lead discussions, build projects, collaborate on research, or just share your experience as a new player figuring it out. If you already have an offline reputation, maybe you skip the passive piece and jump right into activity. \n\nIn either case, be yourself, but play with your character attributes. You can choose to be someone who’s a little good at a lot of things, or unbelievably good at one thing. Both work, and you can evolve your character over time. Play with the fearlessness of someone playing a game, because you are. These are internet strangers. At worst, they’ll ignore you, and you can keep workshopping and start over; at best, they’ll open up new doors. \n\nOnce you’re in, the Game follows Buckley’s four elements of successful game design: \n\nFeedback Loops. Once you jump into the conversation or start sharing, you’ll start getting feedback. Don’t expect it to be much. A like here, a “great point!” there, maybe some questions and conversations. Pay attention to what’s working and what’s not, but don’t be too calculated about it. People can smell it. Your metric may not be likes or views; a real conversation with one person you respect might be the best starting point. \n\nVariable Outcomes. Some things will work, and some won’t. That’s OK. If you’re treating it like a game, that’s to be expected. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s experimentation. Play around, try new things; some will hit, some won’t. That’s part of the fun. It’ll keep you hungry. \n\nSense of Control. In traditional game design, this means that the more you practice, the better you get, and the better your outcomes. It’s not easy. You get out what you put in. That’s doubly true in the Great Online Game, because you’re not just playing, you’re designing the game you want to play. Pick the things that you love the most and go deep. Learn, interact, give value with no expectation of anything in return, keep learning. There’s no boss in the Great Online Game; your success or failure is a direct result of your skill and effort. \n\nConnection to the Meta Game. I’m going to give this one its own non-bulleted paragraph. It’s important.  \n\nThe Meta Game here is your life and your career. The more you evolve and level up, the more opportunities you’ll have. If you build up a following, meet the right people, and get involved with the right projects, you’ll have put yourself on an entirely new trajectory. \n\nThe fun part is, if you do it right, it really can feel like a game. Don’t take it too seriously. Don’t wait for the perfect moment to jump in. The vast majority of people reading this won’t want to quit your job and make a living entirely online; that doesn’t mean you can’t play. Play on the side, learn some things, build some new hobbies and relationships. Give yourself an insurance plan if things don’t work out in your job, and a supercharger if they do. You never know when it might come in handy, or what new path you might discover. \n\nImportant note: don’t be an asshole. It’s an easy way to get some followers early, and if you’re trying to game that metric, it might work, but it’s also the easiest way to lose your life in the Great Online Game. \n\nI didn’t set out to play the Great Online Game when I started writing Not Boring, but that’s accidentally what I did. Two years ago, bored at my job, I started spending more time on Twitter and writing a newsletter. I just wanted to meet smart people who were interested in the same things I was. I never in a million years thought that my job would become playing the Great Online Game. But that’s what it’s become. \n\nWhen people ask me my title, I don’t have a good answer. Writer? Founder? Investor? Some guy with a newsletter? They all fit, and I’m sure I’ll add more over time. Playing the Game is about having fun and opening doors that you didn’t even know existed. \n\nIt’s a lot of work, but it’s fun work, with exponential upside and compounding returns. \n\nGo play.", "timestamp": 1620665998, "digest": "Ety9LffRBgM8v-pz1-M0Dw_qS3nJFrNjPFX4OpfeXEk", "contributor": "0x2920A3192613d8c42f21b64873dc0Ddfcbf018D4"}

I set out to answer this question: why are tech growth stocks sagging while crypto moons and value roars back? \n\nBut I figured out how to explain that out in way fewer words: \n\nCrypto is just more fun. \n\nBut crypto itself is not the game. It’s just the in-game currency for a much bigger game, played across the internet, that involves CEOs, influencers, artists, researchers, investors, and regular people, like you and me. That’s a much more fun topic to explore than which asset class is outperforming which. This is bigger, more permanent than day-to-day market fluctuations.\n\nWe’re all playing a Great Online Game. How well we play determines the rewards we get, online and offline.\n\nThe Great Online Game is played concurrently by billions of people, online, as themselves, with real-world consequences. Your financial and psychological wellbeing is at stake, but the downside is limited. The upside, on the other hand, is infinite.\n\nSocial media is the clearest manifestation of this meta-game. Beginner-level Twitter feels weird, like a bunch of people exposing their personal thoughts to the world. Medium-level Twitter is Threads and engagement hacks. Twitter Mastery is indistinguishable from an ongoing game. This is also true for Reddit, Discord, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and other social networks. \n\nBut social media is just one piece of an interconnected game that spans online and offline spaces. The way you play in one area unlocks opportunities in others. Sharing ideas on Twitter might get you invited to a Discord, your participation in that Discord might get you invited to work on a new project, and that new project might make you rich. Or it might bring you more followers on Twitter and more Discord invites and more project opportunities and new ideas that you want to explore which might kick off any number of new paths. \n\nWe now live in a world in which, by typing things into your phone or your keyboard, or saying things into a microphone, or snapping pictures or videos, you can marshall resources, support, and opportunities. Crypto has the potential to take it up a notch by baking game mechanics -- points, rewards, skins, teams, and more -- right into the whole internet. \n\nThe Great Online Game is free to play, and it starts simply: by realizing that you’re playing a game. Every tweet is a free lottery ticket. That’s a big unlock.\n\nAnyone can play. You can choose how to play given your resources and skills at the current moment. You can level up fast. Financial and social capital are no longer tied so tightly to where you went, who you know, or what your boss thinks of you. This game has different physics and wormholes through which to jump. It’s exponential instead of linear.\n\nTo understand how the game works and how to play, we’ll work our way up: \n\nWhat is a Video Game? \n\nThe Great Online Game \n\nMeet the Players\n\nHow Crypto Supercharges the Game\n\nHow to Play the Game\n\nBy the end of this post, I hope I’ve convinced you to throw a couple coins in and start playing, but I think I might need to show you that we’re even playing a video game first.\n\nWhat is a Video Game? \n\nIt’s Monday morning. You’re tired. You have to go to work. You have an assignment that you pushed off on Friday, because it’s practically Hot Vax Summer and you had plans, but now it’s Monday and damn. Now you need to do that thing. This does not seem fun. This does not seem like a game. \n\nSo it might take me a minute to convince you that yes, it is, even for you. I’m going to start my argument like a shitty high school valedictorian: \n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines a video game as, “A game played by electronically manipulating images produced by a computer program on a television screen or other display screen.”\n\nIf you’re working remotely from a computer, what you’re doing perfectly fits the definition of a video game. \n\nNik Milanovic nailed it:\n\nHit the right keys in the right order, make money. Work is just an often boring sub-game within the meta-game. \n\nBut that’s still a little literal, and a lot reductive. Let’s go deeper. The best games, according to gaming entrepreneur turned top solo investor Josh Buckley, “are creating spaces that bring you into flow.” \n\nOn Invest Like the Best, Buckley said:\n\nThe biggest games today really take advantage of this, but you wouldn't actually think of them as a game.

NFTs are online art, cars, outfits, and houses. They’re the digital trappings of digital wealth. \n\nDAOs, too, are going to be important infrastructure for the Great Online Game. They make it easier for people to float in and out of projects at internet speed instead of committing to climb the ladder within a company, and allow for lightweight and temporary groupings when people want to combine their superpowers. Recently, PartyDAO formed to bring a bunch of smaller players together to compete against rich whales in NFT auctions. \n\nI suspect that many of the most successful web3 projects built in the coming years will serve to give the Great Online Game tools that were previously only available within the walled gardens of specific virtual or corporate worlds. I’m excited about and / or an investor in Crucible, Mirror, Seed Club, and Opolis to name a few. \n\nThe Great Online Game is only going to get more compelling. We’re in the early innings. So how should you play? \n\nHow to Play the Game\n\nOn Friday, Shopify President Harley Finkelstein joined us on Spaces Cadets. To close out the conversation, we asked him for his advice to potential entrepreneurs out there: \n\nThat’s a key mental shift. The cost of failure is as close to zero as it’s ever been, and it will continue to fall. That’s true for entrepreneurship, and it’s even more true for the Great Online Game. Because entrepreneurs are trying to build a business; when you start to play the Great Online Game, you’re just building optionality. \n\nAnyone can play the Great Online Game. All you need is some knowledge and curiosity. \n\nA typical path into the Game starts out in one niche community -- maybe you start thoughtfully replying to a few people you respect in your field on Twitter, or hop into a crypto Discord and get a feel for things before asking questions and participating. Ask yourself: “What am I nerdiest about?” and then go find your fellow nerds. They’re out there. \n\nOver time, you go from consumer to creator. You write, make videos, lead discussions, build projects, collaborate on research, or just share your experience as a new player figuring it out. If you already have an offline reputation, maybe you skip the passive piece and jump right into activity. \n\nIn either case, be yourself, but play with your character attributes. You can choose to be someone who’s a little good at a lot of things, or unbelievably good at one thing. Both work, and you can evolve your character over time. Play with the fearlessness of someone playing a game, because you are. These are internet strangers. At worst, they’ll ignore you, and you can keep workshopping and start over; at best, they’ll open up new doors. \n\nOnce you’re in, the Game follows Buckley’s four elements of successful game design: \n\nFeedback Loops. Once you jump into the conversation or start sharing, you’ll start getting feedback. Don’t expect it to be much. A like here, a “great point!” there, maybe some questions and conversations. Pay attention to what’s working and what’s not, but don’t be too calculated about it. People can smell it. Your metric may not be likes or views; a real conversation with one person you respect might be the best starting point. \n\nVariable Outcomes. Some things will work, and some won’t. That’s OK. If you’re treating it like a game, that’s to be expected. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s experimentation. Play around, try new things; some will hit, some won’t. That’s part of the fun. It’ll keep you hungry. \n\nSense of Control. In traditional game design, this means that the more you practice, the better you get, and the better your outcomes. It’s not easy. You get out what you put in. That’s doubly true in the Great Online Game, because you’re not just playing, you’re designing the game you want to play. Pick the things that you love the most and go deep. Learn, interact, give value with no expectation of anything in return, keep learning. There’s no boss in the Great Online Game; your success or failure is a direct result of your skill and effort. \n\nConnection to the Meta Game. I’m going to give this one its own non-bulleted paragraph. It’s important.  \n\nThe Meta Game here is your life and your career. The more you evolve and level up, the more opportunities you’ll have. If you build up a following, meet the right people, and get involved with the right projects, you’ll have put yourself on an entirely new trajectory. \n\nThe fun part is, if you do it right, it really can feel like a game. Don’t take it too seriously. Don’t wait for the perfect moment to jump in. The vast majority of people reading this won’t want to quit your job and make a living entirely online; that doesn’t mean you can’t play. Play on the side, learn some things, build some new hobbies and relationships. Give yourself an insurance plan if things don’t work out in your job, and a supercharger if they do. You never know when it might come in handy, or what new path you might discover. \n\nImportant note: don’t be an asshole. It’s an easy way to get some followers early, and if you’re trying to game that metric, it might work, but it’s also the easiest way to lose your life in the Great Online Game. \n\nI didn’t set out to play the Great Online Game when I started writing Not Boring, but that’s accidentally what I did. Two years ago, bored at my job, I started spending more time on Twitter and writing a newsletter. I just wanted to meet smart people who were interested in the same things I was. I never in a million years thought that my job would become playing the Great Online Game. But that’s what it’s become. \n\nWhen people ask me my title, I don’t have a good answer. Writer? Founder? Investor? Some guy with a newsletter? They all fit, and I’m sure I’ll add more over time. Playing the Game is about having fun and opening doors that you didn’t even know existed. \n\nIt’s a lot of work, but it’s fun work, with exponential upside and compounding returns. \n\nGo play.", "timestamp": 1620666133, "digest": "tw9hW87Sd1YXz_IqcvJXIS9pCxSSYBFVtZ2umBOdng0", "contributor": "0x2920A3192613d8c42f21b64873dc0Ddfcbf018D4", "nft": "{\"nftTransactionHash\": \"0x1a83dd48707369656afad1a3dfdbc336d426d9e6b7ea25a84b7ac602d7e8a14a\"}"}

I set out to answer this question: why are tech growth stocks sagging while crypto moons and value roars back? \n\nBut I figured out how to explain that out in way fewer words: \n\nCrypto is just more fun. \n\nBut crypto itself is not the game. It’s just the in-game currency for a much bigger game, played across the internet, that involves CEOs, influencers, artists, researchers, investors, and regular people, like you and me. That’s a much more fun topic to explore than which asset class is outperforming which. This is bigger, more permanent than day-to-day market fluctuations.\n\nWe’re all playing a Great Online Game. How well we play determines the rewards we get, online and offline.\n\nThe Great Online Game is played concurrently by billions of people, online, as themselves, with real-world consequences. Your financial and psychological wellbeing is at stake, but the downside is limited. The upside, on the other hand, is infinite.\n\nSocial media is the clearest manifestation of this meta-game. Beginner-level Twitter feels weird, like a bunch of people exposing their personal thoughts to the world. Medium-level Twitter is Threads and engagement hacks. Twitter Mastery is indistinguishable from an ongoing game. This is also true for Reddit, Discord, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and other social networks. \n\nBut social media is just one piece of an interconnected game that spans online and offline spaces. The way you play in one area unlocks opportunities in others. Sharing ideas on Twitter might get you invited to a Discord, your participation in that Discord might get you invited to work on a new project, and that new project might make you rich. Or it might bring you more followers on Twitter and more Discord invites and more project opportunities and new ideas that you want to explore which might kick off any number of new paths. \n\nWe now live in a world in which, by typing things into your phone or your keyboard, or saying things into a microphone, or snapping pictures or videos, you can marshall resources, support, and opportunities. Crypto has the potential to take it up a notch by baking game mechanics -- points, rewards, skins, teams, and more -- right into the whole internet. \n\nThe Great Online Game is free to play, and it starts simply: by realizing that you’re playing a game. Every tweet is a free lottery ticket. That’s a big unlock.\n\nAnyone can play. You can choose how to play given your resources and skills at the current moment. You can level up fast. Financial and social capital are no longer tied so tightly to where you went, who you know, or what your boss thinks of you. This game has different physics and wormholes through which to jump. It’s exponential instead of linear.\n\nTo understand how the game works and how to play, we’ll work our way up: \n\nWhat is a Video Game? \n\nThe Great Online Game \n\nMeet the Players\n\nHow Crypto Supercharges the Game\n\nHow to Play the Game\n\nBy the end of this post, I hope I’ve convinced you to throw a couple coins in and start playing, but I think I might need to show you that we’re even playing a video game first.\n\nWhat is a Video Game? \n\nIt’s Monday morning. You’re tired. You have to go to work. You have an assignment that you pushed off on Friday, because it’s practically Hot Vax Summer and you had plans, but now it’s Monday and damn. Now you need to do that thing. This does not seem fun. This does not seem like a game. \n\nSo it might take me a minute to convince you that yes, it is, even for you. I’m going to start my argument like a shitty high school valedictorian: \n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines a video game as, “A game played by electronically manipulating images produced by a computer program on a television screen or other display screen.”\n\nIf you’re working remotely from a computer, what you’re doing perfectly fits the definition of a video game. \n\nNik Milanovic nailed it:\n\nHit the right keys in the right order, make money. Work is just an often boring sub-game within the meta-game. \n\nBut that’s still a little literal, and a lot reductive. Let’s go deeper. The best games, according to gaming entrepreneur turned top solo investor Josh Buckley, “are creating spaces that bring you into flow.” \n\nOn Invest Like the Best, Buckley said:\n\nThe biggest games today really take advantage of this, but you wouldn't actually think of them as a game. I look at Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram as games and 3 billion people are playing them actively. They're essentially big layers on top of a slot machine.\n\nBuckley went on to lay out four elements of successful game design: \n\nFrequent Feedback Loops\n\nVariable Outcomes \n\nSense of Control\n\nConnection to a Meta-Game\n\nAll four are present in the Great Online Game, none more importantly than the connection to the meta-game. \n\nThe Great Online Game \n\n“The internet is incredible.” You’ll hear that a lot from people who’ve started to master the Game. As I typed that last sentence, Blake Robbins tweeted this: \n\nGetting good at the Great Online Game makes seemingly absurd things happen. Your business icon? In your DMs. That person whose videos you don’t miss? Just reached out for a collab. Your dream job? Reaching out to you to tell you why Company X might be a fit. \n\nBlake has successfully translated “hanging out on the edges of the internet” into a career as a venture capitalist at Ludlow Ventures. He’s a go-to source on creators, gaming, and future internet stuff more broadly for some of the smartest people in the world. Blake summarized his approach in another recent tweet: \n\nHe’s playing an infinite game, going down rabbit holes, learning, helping people, meeting new ones, going down more rabbit holes, and so on. \n\nJames Carse, who coined the term in his 1986 book Finite and Infinite Games: A Vision of Life as Play and Possibility, wrote:\n\nThe infinite game - there is only one - includes any authentic interaction, from touching to culture, that changes rules, plays with boundaries and exists solely for the purpose of continuing the game. A finite player seeks power; the infinite one displays self-sufficient strength. Finite games are theatrical, necessitating an audience; infinite ones are dramatic, involving participants...\n\nThe Great Online Game is an infinite video game that plays out constantly across the internet. It uses many of the mechanics of a video game, but removes the boundaries. You’re no longer playing as an avatar in Fortnite or Roblox; you’re playing as yourself across Twitter, YouTube, Discords, work, projects, and investments. People who play the Great Online Game rack up points, skills, and attributes that they can apply across their digital and physical lives. Some people even start pseudonymous and parlay their faceless brilliance into jobs and money. \n\nThe Game rewards community and cooperation over individualism and competition. You get points for being curious, sharing, and helping with no expectation of reciprocation. By increasing your surface area, you’re opening yourself up to serendipity. For good actors, the Game has nearly unlimited upside, and practically no downside.\n\nYou can jump into the Great Online Game at any point, whether as a total unknown or an accomplished person, and start building the world that you want to build. It can take you on any number of paths. We’ll explore a few. \n\nMeet The Players \n\nThe inspiration for this essay was Elon Musk’s SNL appearance. No one plays this game better than Musk. The best way to explain his out-of-body run is that he’s playing a video game with cheat codes.\n\nHe’s doing things that people didn’t think were physically possible -- see: Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink -- while getting away with things that people didn’t think were legal -- see: pumping Dogecoin, $420 take-private tweet, getting high on Joe Rogan. \n\nHe’s playing a postmodern game against modern rivals. He’s like Neo. He’s not trying to forcefully bend the spoon; he understands there is no spoon. He has more money points than all but two people in the world to show for it.\n\nMusk plays an advanced version of the Game in which he builds rocket ships and electric cars and internet satellites, but you don’t need to bend atoms or become the wealthiest person in the solar system to win. You don’t even have to reveal yourself as a real person. \n\nA couple weeks ago, Austin Rief and I had Bored Elon Musk on our weekly Twitter Spaces show, Spaces Cadets. Bored Elon is a pseudonymous account. He tweets ideas for inventions that Elon might have if he were bored, and 1.7 million people follow him on Twitter. A couple months ago, he started selling NFTs. He pulled in $1 million in less than a month. How about a non-Elon example?\n\nTake Alex Danco. Alex has literally built himself a world: Dancoland. In an excellent post on his journey, Alex drew an actual map of his journey through the Great Online Game. \n\nHe started by writing about startups, moved on to bubbles and mania, passed through the Swamp of Scenes, and made it to the Humanities Mountain Range. While he wrote, he got to meet new people, test new ideas, and build up a reputation. It helped him find his next thing. “This newsletter was obviously part of a fishing expedition to find what I wanted to do next.” Next was a dream job at Shopify, thanks in part to the newsletter. \n\nInstead of claiming MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, though, he’s continuing to play the Great Online Game, expanding his world by branching into new communities. Specifically, he’s going to have a recurring segment on Jim O’Shaughnessy’s Infinite Loops podcast and become a more active participant in Anna Gat’s magical Interintellect. Those will no doubt lead to new opportunities and new worlds to explore.\n\nOr take Megan Leeds. \n\nLeeds parlayed YouTubes of herself literally playing video games -- The Sims -- into Roblox content into making games into a 1mm+ YouTube following, $8mm game studio, and a $1mm online store. Her quote in Rex Woodbury’s thread captures the Great Online Game beautifully:\n\nThere’s nothing I’ve done that anybody else can’t do. It’s about learning—learning the code, learning how the game works, & creating. All you have to do is start.\n\nStart, follow your curiosity, build relationships, stay open to new opportunities, keep playing.\n\nHow about Lil Nas X? Born Montero Hill after the Mitsubishi Montero, Lil Nas X started messing around on Facebook, Instagram, and finally, “hopped on Twitter ... where I really was a master. That was the first place where I could go viral.” \n\nHe started making music in his closet, and in December 2018, he dropped Old Town Road, which he made with a $30 sample and $20 worth of studio time. The song was played over 2.5 billion times in 2019 alone. He came out on the last day of Pride Month in 2019, and has used his platform to represent the LGBTQ community as one of the very few out rappers. Earlier this year, he released Montero (Call Me By Your Name). He gives the Devil a lap dance in the music video. \n\nMontero to memes to music to Montero. Lil Nas X continues to use Twitter like a young memelord. He’s playing the Game. \n\nThe Great Online Game overlaps with the Creator Economy -- Danco wrote a newsletter, Leeds had a YouTube channel, Lil Nas X makes music -- but it doesn’t necessarily mean living as a full-time creator. Danco has a full-time job, Leeds runs companies with employees. \n\nThere are countless more examples, from Kim Kardashian to Donald Glover to Turner Novak to Andrea Hernandez to Harry Stebbings to AOC to Web Smith to DeepFuckingValue to Soulja Boy to the Extended Pompliano Universe. All these people seem like they’re having a blast while they’re “working.” \n\nAnd that’s just my corner of the internet. There are millions of people playing the Game well.\n\nEach one is internet-native, each plays the Game, and each has cashed out some internet points for things like TV shows, Grammy-winning records, venture funds, companies, and political victories. It’s less about a particular platform or outcome, and more about the idea that there are different ways of playing the game and new ways to acquire and grow new types of assets. Like cities. \n\nMiami Mayor Francis Suarez became a Twitter darling last year when he decided to embrace the tech community. \n\nSince responding “How can I help?” to Delian’s tweet in December, Suarez has pulled a ton of high-growth companies into his city. He’s become the go-to example of how to grow a city by playing the Great Online Game. Not surprisingly, he’s also embraced crypto. \n\nWith crypto’s ascent, there are thousands of newly-minted millionaires, and dozens or hundreds of billionaires, who built their fortunes by hanging out in Discords, learning about and investing in new coins, playing with new protocols, and treating investing like a game. Millions of people are playing the Game just by hanging out and watching. \n\nI have multiple friends who, a couple months ago, had normal jobs at startups. Then they started hanging out in crypto Discords and Telegrams, trading, learning, meeting people, tweeting, and going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. I can’t imagine they’ll ever work in a non-crypto job from here on out. \n\nCrypto is an asset class that rewards participation in the Great Online Game. The fastest way to understand what’s legit and what’s not, and which coins people are going to buy and which they’re going to ignore, is to spend time participating and learning online. The right Discord or Twitter follow is a massive source of alpha. \n\nPlus, crypto is kind of the native token for the Great Online Game.\n\nHow Crypto Supercharges the Game\n\nPeople in crypto seem to understand better than anyone that this is all a game. The right meme can send a random coin to the moon and make people legitimately rich. \n\nBut beyond that, crypto is in-game money for the internet. It rewards participation directly. Early users, supporters, builders, stakers, validators, and community members get tokens. \n\nUntil now, I didn’t fully understand social tokens. They seemed like another way for influencers to monetize with no clear value. But in the context of the Great Online Game, they’re points that reward good gameplay across the internet, and give followers an incentive to join and support a team anywhere it goes. It’s like a Super Follow for the whole internet, with financial rewards.\n\nCrypto also lets players exchange value directly. Recently, I experimented with selling an essay as an NFT, which Clint Kisker bought for 2.19 ETH. That’s a direct connection between two players in the Game. Even though I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about, and even playing with, NFTs, though, it didn’t really click for me until I saw these slides from Mirror’s Patrick Rivera:\n\nThe Great Online Game imitates video games. If people want to buy skins in Fortnite to express themselves, or clothes in meatspace to do the same, of course they’d want to buy NFTs to express themselves online. In an open world like the internet, the more you signal who you are and what you care about, the more you open yourself up to new possibilities. It’s an abundant game. NFTs are online art, cars, outfits, and houses. They’re the digital trappings of digital wealth. \n\nDAOs, too, are going to be important infrastructure for the Great Online Game. They make it easier for people to float in and out of projects at internet speed instead of committing to climb the ladder within a company, and allow for lightweight and temporary groupings when people want to combine their superpowers. Recently, PartyDAO formed to bring a bunch of smaller players together to compete against rich whales in NFT auctions. \n\nI suspect that many of the most successful web3 projects built in the coming years will serve to give the Great Online Game tools that were previously only available within the walled gardens of specific virtual or corporate worlds. I’m excited about and / or an investor in Crucible, Mirror, Seed Club, and Opolis to name a few. \n\nThe Great Online Game is only going to get more compelling. We’re in the early innings.

When we make assumptions, we state them. Otherwise, we presume that the future could unfold in many directions.\n\nThe futurist profession is dedicated to the formulation of new ideas and models for studying future possibilities. In practice however, professional futurists necessarily produce work that is of value to a single employer or funder. The ideas are only valuable insofar as they help realize a predetermined outcome. It is rare for a futurist to be paid to think outside an agenda like this.\n\n***Cope*** is a research service, established under the assumption that crowdfunding will enable a new economy of ideas. Our research is decoupled from the conditions and agendas set by institutional funders, meaning that feedback from our supporters is vital to the process. The community will help steer the lines of inquiry by commenting, suggesting topics, and offering financial support for work they find valuable. We imagine it as a new forum for future thought, as ***Research for the Hive***. \n\nWe methodically piece together plausible scenarios, step by step, using systems theory and applied mathematics. Our findings are compiled in detailed reports and released promptly. The range of topics we're currently working on includes:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b2b80b6d-2228-4bdd-8cd7-4efb34d75379.jpg?height=1500&width=2700)\n\n\n\nOur output is high-volume and our turn-arounds are prompt. After a successful crowdfund, the reports are released within two weeks, often sooner. At certain intervals we will publish print editions of the entire body of research. These will also include previously unreleased material. All supporters will receive a print edition. \n \nIf you're into ***Cope*** straight away, please support the first issue of our service. We've set a modest goal of 1 ETH in anticipation of extended engagement with the distributed community of supporters. \n\nThe first issue will include two reports on topics of personal interest. The first report is on the *BauDAO*, a DAO-based software stack for collective ownership of architecture. It outlines a sequence of scenarios in which programmable money, fractional ownership, and distributed governance radically reconfigure how the built environment is constructed and managed.

When we make assumptions, we state them. Otherwise, we presume that the future could unfold in many directions.\n\nThe futurist profession is dedicated to the formulation of new ideas and models for studying future possibilities. In practice however, professional futurists necessarily produce work that is of value to a single employer or funder. The ideas are only valuable insofar as they help realize a predetermined outcome. It is rare for a futurist to be paid to think outside an agenda like this.\n\n***Cope*** is a research service, established under the assumption that crowdfunding will enable a new economy of ideas. Our research is decoupled from the conditions and agendas set by institutional funders, meaning that feedback from our supporters is vital to the process. The community will help steer the lines of inquiry by commenting, suggesting topics, and offering financial support for work they find valuable. We imagine it as a new forum for future thought, as ***Research for the Hive***. \n\nWe methodically piece together plausible scenarios, step by step, using systems theory and applied mathematics. Our findings are compiled in detailed reports and released promptly. The range of topics we're currently working on includes:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b2b80b6d-2228-4bdd-8cd7-4efb34d75379.jpg?height=1500&width=2700)\n\n\n\nOur output is high-volume and our turn-arounds are prompt. After a successful crowdfund, the reports are released within two weeks, often sooner. At certain intervals we will publish print editions of the entire body of research. These will also include previously unreleased material. All supporters will receive a print edition. \n \nIf you're into ***Cope*** straight away, please support the first issue of our service. We've set a modest goal of 1 ETH in anticipation of extended engagement with the distributed community of supporters. \n\nThe first issue will include two reports on topics of personal interest. The first report is on the *BauDAO*, a DAO-based software stack for collective ownership of architecture. It outlines a sequence of scenarios in which programmable money, fractional ownership, and distributed governance radically reconfigure how the built environment is constructed and managed. The second report explores an anticipated issue of memory in digital mind engineering, introducing mathematical models to pose questions and offer solutions. ***Abstracts can be found below***.\n\n\n[Cope 01](crowdfund://0xb0c813151d18482a914a2b95b1a25d020532Bb36?network=homestead)\n\nWe like Mirror because we see crowdfunding as an opportunity for young professional researchers to break from think tanks, universities, and strategy firms.

I set out to answer this question: why are tech growth stocks sagging while crypto moons and value roars back? \n\nBut I figured out how to explain that out in way fewer words: \n\nCrypto is just more fun. \n\nBut crypto itself is not the game. It’s just the in-game currency for a much bigger game, played across the internet, that involves CEOs, influencers, artists, researchers, investors, and regular people, like you and me. That’s a much more fun topic to explore than which asset class is outperforming which. This is bigger, more permanent than day-to-day market fluctuations.\n\nWe’re all playing a Great Online Game. How well we play determines the rewards we get, online and offline.\n\nThe Great Online Game is played concurrently by billions of people, online, as themselves, with real-world consequences. Your financial and psychological wellbeing is at stake, but the downside is limited. The upside, on the other hand, is infinite.\n\nSocial media is the clearest manifestation of this meta-game. Beginner-level Twitter feels weird, like a bunch of people exposing their personal thoughts to the world. Medium-level Twitter is Threads and engagement hacks. Twitter Mastery is indistinguishable from an ongoing game. This is also true for Reddit, Discord, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and other social networks. \n\nBut social media is just one piece of an interconnected game that spans online and offline spaces. The way you play in one area unlocks opportunities in others. Sharing ideas on Twitter might get you invited to a Discord, your participation in that Discord might get you invited to work on a new project, and that new project might make you rich. Or it might bring you more followers on Twitter and more Discord invites and more project opportunities and new ideas that you want to explore which might kick off any number of new paths. \n\nWe now live in a world in which, by typing things into your phone or your keyboard, or saying things into a microphone, or snapping pictures or videos, you can marshall resources, support, and opportunities. Crypto has the potential to take it up a notch by baking game mechanics -- points, rewards, skins, teams, and more -- right into the whole internet. \n\nThe Great Online Game is free to play, and it starts simply: by realizing that you’re playing a game. Every tweet is a free lottery ticket. That’s a big unlock.\n\nAnyone can play. You can choose how to play given your resources and skills at the current moment. You can level up fast. Financial and social capital are no longer tied so tightly to where you went, who you know, or what your boss thinks of you. This game has different physics and wormholes through which to jump. It’s exponential instead of linear.\n\nTo understand how the game works and how to play, we’ll work our way up: \n\nWhat is a Video Game? \n\nThe Great Online Game \n\nMeet the Players\n\nHow Crypto Supercharges the Game\n\nHow to Play the Game\n\nBy the end of this post, I hope I’ve convinced you to throw a couple coins in and start playing, but I think I might need to show you that we’re even playing a video game first.\n\nWhat is a Video Game? \n\nIt’s Monday morning. You’re tired. You have to go to work. You have an assignment that you pushed off on Friday, because it’s practically Hot Vax Summer and you had plans, but now it’s Monday and damn. Now you need to do that thing. This does not seem fun. This does not seem like a game. \n\nSo it might take me a minute to convince you that yes, it is, even for you. I’m going to start my argument like a shitty high school valedictorian: \n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines a video game as, “A game played by electronically manipulating images produced by a computer program on a television screen or other display screen.”\n\nIf you’re working remotely from a computer, what you’re doing perfectly fits the definition of a video game. \n\nNik Milanovic nailed it:\n\nHit the right keys in the right order, make money. Work is just an often boring sub-game within the meta-game. \n\nBut that’s still a little literal, and a lot reductive. Let’s go deeper. The best games, according to gaming entrepreneur turned top solo investor Josh Buckley, “are creating spaces that bring you into flow.” \n\nOn Invest Like the Best, Buckley said:\n\nThe biggest games today really take advantage of this, but you wouldn't actually think of them as a game. I look at Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram as games and 3 billion people are playing them actively. They're essentially big layers on top of a slot machine.\n\nBuckley went on to lay out four elements of successful game design: \n\nFrequent Feedback Loops\n\nVariable Outcomes \n\nSense of Control\n\nConnection to a Meta-Game\n\nAll four are present in the Great Online Game, none more importantly than the connection to the meta-game. \n\nThe Great Online Game \n\n“The internet is incredible.” You’ll hear that a lot from people who’ve started to master the Game. As I typed that last sentence, Blake Robbins tweeted this: \n\nGetting good at the Great Online Game makes seemingly absurd things happen. Your business icon? In your DMs. That person whose videos you don’t miss? Just reached out for a collab. Your dream job? Reaching out to you to tell you why Company X might be a fit. \n\nBlake has successfully translated “hanging out on the edges of the internet” into a career as a venture capitalist at Ludlow Ventures. He’s a go-to source on creators, gaming, and future internet stuff more broadly for some of the smartest people in the world. Blake summarized his approach in another recent tweet: \n\nHe’s playing an infinite game, going down rabbit holes, learning, helping people, meeting new ones, going down more rabbit holes, and so on. \n\nJames Carse, who coined the term in his 1986 book Finite and Infinite Games: A Vision of Life as Play and Possibility, wrote:\n\nThe infinite game - there is only one - includes any authentic interaction, from touching to culture, that changes rules, plays with boundaries and exists solely for the purpose of continuing the game. A finite player seeks power; the infinite one displays self-sufficient strength. Finite games are theatrical, necessitating an audience; infinite ones are dramatic, involving participants...\n\nThe Great Online Game is an infinite video game that plays out constantly across the internet. It uses many of the mechanics of a video game, but removes the boundaries. You’re no longer playing as an avatar in Fortnite or Roblox; you’re playing as yourself across Twitter, YouTube, Discords, work, projects, and investments. People who play the Great Online Game rack up points, skills, and attributes that they can apply across their digital and physical lives. Some people even start pseudonymous and parlay their faceless brilliance into jobs and money. \n\nThe Game rewards community and cooperation over individualism and competition. You get points for being curious, sharing, and helping with no expectation of reciprocation. By increasing your surface area, you’re opening yourself up to serendipity. For good actors, the Game has nearly unlimited upside, and practically no downside.\n\nYou can jump into the Great Online Game at any point, whether as a total unknown or an accomplished person, and start building the world that you want to build. It can take you on any number of paths. We’ll explore a few. \n\nMeet The Players \n\nThe inspiration for this essay was Elon Musk’s SNL appearance. No one plays this game better than Musk. The best way to explain his out-of-body run is that he’s playing a video game with cheat codes.\n\nHe’s doing things that people didn’t think were physically possible -- see: Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink -- while getting away with things that people didn’t think were legal -- see: pumping Dogecoin, $420 take-private tweet, getting high on Joe Rogan. \n\nHe’s playing a postmodern game against modern rivals. He’s like Neo. He’s not trying to forcefully bend the spoon; he understands there is no spoon. He has more money points than all but two people in the world to show for it.\n\nMusk plays an advanced version of the Game in which he builds rocket ships and electric cars and internet satellites, but you don’t need to bend atoms or become the wealthiest person in the solar system to win. You don’t even have to reveal yourself as a real person. \n\nA couple weeks ago, Austin Rief and I had Bored Elon Musk on our weekly Twitter Spaces show, Spaces Cadets. Bored Elon is a pseudonymous account. He tweets ideas for inventions that Elon might have if he were bored, and 1.7 million people follow him on Twitter. A couple months ago, he started selling NFTs. He pulled in $1 million in less than a month. How about a non-Elon example?\n\nTake Alex Danco. Alex has literally built himself a world: Dancoland. In an excellent post on his journey, Alex drew an actual map of his journey through the Great Online Game. \n\nHe started by writing about startups, moved on to bubbles and mania, passed through the Swamp of Scenes, and made it to the Humanities Mountain Range. While he wrote, he got to meet new people, test new ideas, and build up a reputation. It helped him find his next thing. “This newsletter was obviously part of a fishing expedition to find what I wanted to do next.” Next was a dream job at Shopify, thanks in part to the newsletter. \n\nInstead of claiming MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, though, he’s continuing to play the Great Online Game, expanding his world by branching into new communities. Specifically, he’s going to have a recurring segment on Jim O’Shaughnessy’s Infinite Loops podcast and become a more active participant in Anna Gat’s magical Interintellect. Those will no doubt lead to new opportunities and new worlds to explore.\n\nOr take Megan Leeds. \n\nLeeds parlayed YouTubes of herself literally playing video games -- The Sims -- into Roblox content into making games into a 1mm+ YouTube following, $8mm game studio, and a $1mm online store. Her quote in Rex Woodbury’s thread captures the Great Online Game beautifully:\n\nThere’s nothing I’ve done that anybody else can’t do. It’s about learning—learning the code, learning how the game works, & creating. All you have to do is start.\n\nStart, follow your curiosity, build relationships, stay open to new opportunities, keep playing.\n\nHow about Lil Nas X? Born Montero Hill after the Mitsubishi Montero, Lil Nas X started messing around on Facebook, Instagram, and finally, “hopped on Twitter ... where I really was a master. That was the first place where I could go viral.” \n\nHe started making music in his closet, and in December 2018, he dropped Old Town Road, which he made with a $30 sample and $20 worth of studio time. The song was played over 2.5 billion times in 2019 alone. He came out on the last day of Pride Month in 2019, and has used his platform to represent the LGBTQ community as one of the very few out rappers. Earlier this year, he released Montero (Call Me By Your Name). He gives the Devil a lap dance in the music video. \n\nMontero to memes to music to Montero. Lil Nas X continues to use Twitter like a young memelord. He’s playing the Game. \n\nThe Great Online Game overlaps with the Creator Economy -- Danco wrote a newsletter, Leeds had a YouTube channel, Lil Nas X makes music -- but it doesn’t necessarily mean living as a full-time creator. Danco has a full-time job, Leeds runs companies with employees. \n\nThere are countless more examples, from Kim Kardashian to Donald Glover to Turner Novak to Andrea Hernandez to Harry Stebbings to AOC to Web Smith to DeepFuckingValue to Soulja Boy to the Extended Pompliano Universe. All these people seem like they’re having a blast while they’re “working.” \n\nAnd that’s just my corner of the internet. There are millions of people playing the Game well.\n\nEach one is internet-native, each plays the Game, and each has cashed out some internet points for things like TV shows, Grammy-winning records, venture funds, companies, and political victories. It’s less about a particular platform or outcome, and more about the idea that there are different ways of playing the game and new ways to acquire and grow new types of assets. Like cities. \n\nMiami Mayor Francis Suarez became a Twitter darling last year when he decided to embrace the tech community. \n\nSince responding “How can I help?” to Delian’s tweet in December, Suarez has pulled a ton of high-growth companies into his city. He’s become the go-to example of how to grow a city by playing the Great Online Game. Not surprisingly, he’s also embraced crypto. \n\nWith crypto’s ascent, there are thousands of newly-minted millionaires, and dozens or hundreds of billionaires, who built their fortunes by hanging out in Discords, learning about and investing in new coins, playing with new protocols, and treating investing like a game. Millions of people are playing the Game just by hanging out and watching. \n\nI have multiple friends who, a couple months ago, had normal jobs at startups. Then they started hanging out in crypto Discords and Telegrams, trading, learning, meeting people, tweeting, and going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. I can’t imagine they’ll ever work in a non-crypto job from here on out. \n\nCrypto is an asset class that rewards participation in the Great Online Game. The fastest way to understand what’s legit and what’s not, and which coins people are going to buy and which they’re going to ignore, is to spend time participating and learning online. The right Discord or Twitter follow is a massive source of alpha. \n\nPlus, crypto is kind of the native token for the Great Online Game.\n\nHow Crypto Supercharges the Game\n\nPeople in crypto seem to understand better than anyone that this is all a game. The right meme can send a random coin to the moon and make people legitimately rich. \n\nBut beyond that, crypto is in-game money for the internet. It rewards participation directly. Early users, supporters, builders, stakers, validators, and community members get tokens. \n\nUntil now, I didn’t fully understand social tokens. They seemed like another way for influencers to monetize with no clear value. But in the context of the Great Online Game, they’re points that reward good gameplay across the internet, and give followers an incentive to join and support a team anywhere it goes. It’s like a Super Follow for the whole internet, with financial rewards.\n\nCrypto also lets players exchange value directly. Recently, I experimented with selling an essay as an NFT, which Clint Kisker bought for 2.19 ETH. That’s a direct connection between two players in the Game. Even though I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about, and even playing with, NFTs, though, it didn’t really click for me until I saw these slides from Mirror’s Patrick Rivera:\n\nThe Great Online Game imitates video games. If people want to buy skins in Fortnite to express themselves, or clothes in meatspace to do the same, of course they’d want to buy NFTs to express themselves online. In an open world like the internet, the more you signal who you are and what you care about, the more you open yourself up to new possibilities. It’s an abundant game. NFTs are online art, cars, outfits, and houses. They’re the digital trappings of digital wealth. \n\nDAOs, too, are going to be important infrastructure for the Great Online Game. They make it easier for people to float in and out of projects at internet speed instead of committing to climb the ladder within a company, and allow for lightweight and temporary groupings when people want to combine their superpowers. Recently, PartyDAO formed to bring a bunch of smaller players together to compete against rich whales in NFT auctions. \n\nI suspect that many of the most successful web3 projects built in the coming years will serve to give the Great Online Game tools that were previously only available within the walled gardens of specific virtual or corporate worlds. I’m excited about and / or an investor in Crucible, Mirror, Seed Club, and Opolis to name a few. \n\nThe Great Online Game is only going to get more compelling. We’re in the early innings. So how should you play? \n\nHow to Play the Game\n\nOn Friday, Shopify President Harley Finkelstein joined us on Spaces Cadets. To close out the conversation, we asked him for his advice to potential entrepreneurs out there: \n\nThat’s a key mental shift. The cost of failure is as close to zero as it’s ever been, and it will continue to fall. That’s true for entrepreneurship, and it’s even more true for the Great Online Game. Because entrepreneurs are trying to build a business; when you start to play the Great Online Game, you’re just building optionality. \n\nAnyone can play the Great Online Game. All you need is some knowledge and curiosity. \n\nA typical path into the Game starts out in one niche community -- maybe you start thoughtfully replying to a few people you respect in your field on Twitter, or hop into a crypto Discord and get a feel for things before asking questions and participating. Ask yourself: “What am I nerdiest about?” and then go find your fellow nerds. They’re out there. \n\nOver time, you go from consumer to creator. You write, make videos, lead discussions, build projects, collaborate on research, or just share your experience as a new player figuring it out. If you already have an offline reputation, maybe you skip the passive piece and jump right into activity. \n\nIn either case, be yourself, but play with your character attributes. You can choose to be someone who’s a little good at a lot of things, or unbelievably good at one thing. Both work, and you can evolve your character over time. Play with the fearlessness of someone playing a game, because you are. These are internet strangers. At worst, they’ll ignore you, and you can keep workshopping and start over; at best, they’ll open up new doors. \n\nOnce you’re in, the Game follows Buckley’s four elements of successful game design: \n\nFeedback Loops. Once you jump into the conversation or start sharing, you’ll start getting feedback. Don’t expect it to be much. A like here, a “great point!” there, maybe some questions and conversations. Pay attention to what’s working and what’s not, but don’t be too calculated about it. People can smell it. Your metric may not be likes or views; a real conversation with one person you respect might be the best starting point. \n\nVariable Outcomes. Some things will work, and some won’t. That’s OK. If you’re treating it like a game, that’s to be expected. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s experimentation. Play around, try new things; some will hit, some won’t. That’s part of the fun. It’ll keep you hungry. \n\nSense of Control. In traditional game design, this means that the more you practice, the better you get, and the better your outcomes. It’s not easy. You get out what you put in. That’s doubly true in the Great Online Game, because you’re not just playing, you’re designing the game you want to play. Pick the things that you love the most and go deep. Learn, interact, give value with no expectation of anything in return, keep learning. There’s no boss in the Great Online Game; your success or failure is a direct result of your skill and effort. \n\nConnection to the Meta Game. I’m going to give this one its own non-bulleted paragraph. It’s important.  \n\nThe Meta Game here is your life and your career. The more you evolve and level up, the more opportunities you’ll have. If you build up a following, meet the right people, and get involved with the right projects, you’ll have put yourself on an entirely new trajectory. \n\nThe fun part is, if you do it right, it really can feel like a game. Don’t take it too seriously. Don’t wait for the perfect moment to jump in. The vast majority of people reading this won’t want to quit your job and make a living entirely online; that doesn’t mean you can’t play.

{"id": "UvaEkEZ1GperfBfLr5aueOaYqseCVOidDSEEUQEzhNY", "title": "The Great Online Game", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/832e2e69-8807-4b38-8bbd-71602050fc01.jpeg?height=600&width=1200)\n\n[Token #3094](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3094)\n\nThis didn’t start as a piece about games. I set out to answer this question: why are tech growth stocks sagging while crypto moons and value roars back? \n\nBut I figured out how to explain that out in way fewer words: \n\nCrypto is just more fun. \n\nBut crypto itself is not the game. It’s just the in-game currency for a much bigger game, played across the internet, that involves CEOs, influencers, artists, researchers, investors, and regular people, like you and me. That’s a much more fun topic to explore than which asset class is outperforming which. This is bigger, more permanent than day-to-day market fluctuations.\n\nWe’re all playing a Great Online Game. How well we play determines the rewards we get, online and offline.\n\nThe Great Online Game is played concurrently by billions of people, online, as themselves, with real-world consequences. Your financial and psychological wellbeing is at stake, but the downside is limited. The upside, on the other hand, is infinite.\n\nSocial media is the clearest manifestation of this meta-game. Beginner-level Twitter feels weird, like a bunch of people exposing their personal thoughts to the world. Medium-level Twitter is Threads and engagement hacks. Twitter Mastery is indistinguishable from an ongoing game. This is also true for Reddit, Discord, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and other social networks. \n\nBut social media is just one piece of an interconnected game that spans online and offline spaces. The way you play in one area unlocks opportunities in others. Sharing ideas on Twitter might get you invited to a Discord, your participation in that Discord might get you invited to work on a new project, and that new project might make you rich. Or it might bring you more followers on Twitter and more Discord invites and more project opportunities and new ideas that you want to explore which might kick off any number of new paths. \n\nWe now live in a world in which, by typing things into your phone or your keyboard, or saying things into a microphone, or snapping pictures or videos, you can marshall resources, support, and opportunities. Crypto has the potential to take it up a notch by baking game mechanics -- points, rewards, skins, teams, and more -- right into the whole internet. \n\nThe Great Online Game is free to play, and it starts simply: by realizing that you’re playing a game. Every tweet is a free lottery ticket. That’s a big unlock.\n\nAnyone can play. You can choose how to play given your resources and skills at the current moment. You can level up fast. Financial and social capital are no longer tied so tightly to where you went, who you know, or what your boss thinks of you. This game has different physics and wormholes through which to jump. It’s exponential instead of linear.\n\nTo understand how the game works and how to play, we’ll work our way up: \n\nWhat is a Video Game? \n\nThe Great Online Game \n\nMeet the Players\n\nHow Crypto Supercharges the Game\n\nHow to Play the Game\n\nBy the end of this post, I hope I’ve convinced you to throw a couple coins in and start playing, but I think I might need to show you that we’re even playing a video game first.\n\nWhat is a Video Game? \n\nIt’s Monday morning. You’re tired. You have to go to work. You have an assignment that you pushed off on Friday, because it’s practically Hot Vax Summer and you had plans, but now it’s Monday and damn. Now you need to do that thing. This does not seem fun. This does not seem like a game. \n\nSo it might take me a minute to convince you that yes, it is, even for you. I’m going to start my argument like a shitty high school valedictorian: \n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines a video game as, “A game played by electronically manipulating images produced by a computer program on a television screen or other display screen.”\n\nIf you’re working remotely from a computer, what you’re doing perfectly fits the definition of a video game. \n\nNik Milanovic nailed it:\n\nHit the right keys in the right order, make money. Work is just an often boring sub-game within the meta-game. \n\nBut that’s still a little literal, and a lot reductive. Let’s go deeper. The best games, according to gaming entrepreneur turned top solo investor Josh Buckley, “are creating spaces that bring you into flow.” \n\nOn Invest Like the Best, Buckley said:\n\nThe biggest games today really take advantage of this, but you wouldn't actually think of them as a game. I look at Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram as games and 3 billion people are playing them actively. They're essentially big layers on top of a slot machine.\n\nBuckley went on to lay out four elements of successful game design: \n\nFrequent Feedback Loops\n\nVariable Outcomes \n\nSense of Control\n\nConnection to a Meta-Game\n\nAll four are present in the Great Online Game, none more importantly than the connection to the meta-game. \n\nThe Great Online Game \n\n“The internet is incredible.” You’ll hear that a lot from people who’ve started to master the Game. As I typed that last sentence, Blake Robbins tweeted this: \n\nGetting good at the Great Online Game makes seemingly absurd things happen. Your business icon? In your DMs. That person whose videos you don’t miss? Just reached out for a collab. Your dream job? Reaching out to you to tell you why Company X might be a fit. \n\nBlake has successfully translated “hanging out on the edges of the internet” into a career as a venture capitalist at Ludlow Ventures. He’s a go-to source on creators, gaming, and future internet stuff more broadly for some of the smartest people in the world. Blake summarized his approach in another recent tweet: \n\nHe’s playing an infinite game, going down rabbit holes, learning, helping people, meeting new ones, going down more rabbit holes, and so on. \n\nJames Carse, who coined the term in his 1986 book Finite and Infinite Games: A Vision of Life as Play and Possibility, wrote:\n\nThe infinite game - there is only one - includes any authentic interaction, from touching to culture, that changes rules, plays with boundaries and exists solely for the purpose of continuing the game. A finite player seeks power; the infinite one displays self-sufficient strength. Finite games are theatrical, necessitating an audience; infinite ones are dramatic, involving participants...\n\nThe Great Online Game is an infinite video game that plays out constantly across the internet. It uses many of the mechanics of a video game, but removes the boundaries. You’re no longer playing as an avatar in Fortnite or Roblox; you’re playing as yourself across Twitter, YouTube, Discords, work, projects, and investments. People who play the Great Online Game rack up points, skills, and attributes that they can apply across their digital and physical lives. Some people even start pseudonymous and parlay their faceless brilliance into jobs and money. \n\nThe Game rewards community and cooperation over individualism and competition. You get points for being curious, sharing, and helping with no expectation of reciprocation. By increasing your surface area, you’re opening yourself up to serendipity. For good actors, the Game has nearly unlimited upside, and practically no downside.\n\nYou can jump into the Great Online Game at any point, whether as a total unknown or an accomplished person, and start building the world that you want to build. It can take you on any number of paths. We’ll explore a few. \n\nMeet The Players \n\nThe inspiration for this essay was Elon Musk’s SNL appearance. No one plays this game better than Musk. The best way to explain his out-of-body run is that he’s playing a video game with cheat codes.\n\nHe’s doing things that people didn’t think were physically possible -- see: Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink -- while getting away with things that people didn’t think were legal -- see: pumping Dogecoin, $420 take-private tweet, getting high on Joe Rogan. \n\nHe’s playing a postmodern game against modern rivals. He’s like Neo. He’s not trying to forcefully bend the spoon; he understands there is no spoon. He has more money points than all but two people in the world to show for it.\n\nMusk plays an advanced version of the Game in which he builds rocket ships and electric cars and internet satellites, but you don’t need to bend atoms or become the wealthiest person in the solar system to win. You don’t even have to reveal yourself as a real person. \n\nA couple weeks ago, Austin Rief and I had Bored Elon Musk on our weekly Twitter Spaces show, Spaces Cadets. Bored Elon is a pseudonymous account. He tweets ideas for inventions that Elon might have if he were bored, and 1.7 million people follow him on Twitter. A couple months ago, he started selling NFTs. He pulled in $1 million in less than a month. How about a non-Elon example?\n\nTake Alex Danco. Alex has literally built himself a world: Dancoland. In an excellent post on his journey, Alex drew an actual map of his journey through the Great Online Game. \n\nHe started by writing about startups, moved on to bubbles and mania, passed through the Swamp of Scenes, and made it to the Humanities Mountain Range. While he wrote, he got to meet new people, test new ideas, and build up a reputation. It helped him find his next thing. “This newsletter was obviously part of a fishing expedition to find what I wanted to do next.” Next was a dream job at Shopify, thanks in part to the newsletter. \n\nInstead of claiming MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, though, he’s continuing to play the Great Online Game, expanding his world by branching into new communities. Specifically, he’s going to have a recurring segment on Jim O’Shaughnessy’s Infinite Loops podcast and become a more active participant in Anna Gat’s magical Interintellect. Those will no doubt lead to new opportunities and new worlds to explore.\n\nOr take Megan Leeds. \n\nLeeds parlayed YouTubes of herself literally playing video games -- The Sims -- into Roblox content into making games into a 1mm+ YouTube following, $8mm game studio, and a $1mm online store. Her quote in Rex Woodbury’s thread captures the Great Online Game beautifully:\n\nThere’s nothing I’ve done that anybody else can’t do. It’s about learning—learning the code, learning how the game works, & creating. All you have to do is start.\n\nStart, follow your curiosity, build relationships, stay open to new opportunities, keep playing.\n\nHow about Lil Nas X? Born Montero Hill after the Mitsubishi Montero, Lil Nas X started messing around on Facebook, Instagram, and finally, “hopped on Twitter ... where I really was a master. That was the first place where I could go viral.” \n\nHe started making music in his closet, and in December 2018, he dropped Old Town Road, which he made with a $30 sample and $20 worth of studio time. The song was played over 2.5 billion times in 2019 alone. He came out on the last day of Pride Month in 2019, and has used his platform to represent the LGBTQ community as one of the very few out rappers. Earlier this year, he released Montero (Call Me By Your Name). He gives the Devil a lap dance in the music video. \n\nMontero to memes to music to Montero. Lil Nas X continues to use Twitter like a young memelord. He’s playing the Game. \n\nThe Great Online Game overlaps with the Creator Economy -- Danco wrote a newsletter, Leeds had a YouTube channel, Lil Nas X makes music -- but it doesn’t necessarily mean living as a full-time creator. Danco has a full-time job, Leeds runs companies with employees. \n\nThere are countless more examples, from Kim Kardashian to Donald Glover to Turner Novak to Andrea Hernandez to Harry Stebbings to AOC to Web Smith to DeepFuckingValue to Soulja Boy to the Extended Pompliano Universe. All these people seem like they’re having a blast while they’re “working.” \n\nAnd that’s just my corner of the internet. There are millions of people playing the Game well.\n\nEach one is internet-native, each plays the Game, and each has cashed out some internet points for things like TV shows, Grammy-winning records, venture funds, companies, and political victories. It’s less about a particular platform or outcome, and more about the idea that there are different ways of playing the game and new ways to acquire and grow new types of assets. Like cities. \n\nMiami Mayor Francis Suarez became a Twitter darling last year when he decided to embrace the tech community. \n\nSince responding “How can I help?” to Delian’s tweet in December, Suarez has pulled a ton of high-growth companies into his city. He’s become the go-to example of how to grow a city by playing the Great Online Game. Not surprisingly, he’s also embraced crypto. \n\nWith crypto’s ascent, there are thousands of newly-minted millionaires, and dozens or hundreds of billionaires, who built their fortunes by hanging out in Discords, learning about and investing in new coins, playing with new protocols, and treating investing like a game. Millions of people are playing the Game just by hanging out and watching. \n\nI have multiple friends who, a couple months ago, had normal jobs at startups. Then they started hanging out in crypto Discords and Telegrams, trading, learning, meeting people, tweeting, and going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. I can’t imagine they’ll ever work in a non-crypto job from here on out. \n\nCrypto is an asset class that rewards participation in the Great Online Game. The fastest way to understand what’s legit and what’s not, and which coins people are going to buy and which they’re going to ignore, is to spend time participating and learning online. The right Discord or Twitter follow is a massive source of alpha. \n\nPlus, crypto is kind of the native token for the Great Online Game.\n\nHow Crypto Supercharges the Game\n\nPeople in crypto seem to understand better than anyone that this is all a game. The right meme can send a random coin to the moon and make people legitimately rich. \n\nBut beyond that, crypto is in-game money for the internet. It rewards participation directly. Early users, supporters, builders, stakers, validators, and community members get tokens. \n\nUntil now, I didn’t fully understand social tokens. They seemed like another way for influencers to monetize with no clear value. But in the context of the Great Online Game, they’re points that reward good gameplay across the internet, and give followers an incentive to join and support a team anywhere it goes. It’s like a Super Follow for the whole internet, with financial rewards.\n\nCrypto also lets players exchange value directly. Recently, I experimented with selling an essay as an NFT, which Clint Kisker bought for 2.19 ETH. That’s a direct connection between two players in the Game. Even though I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about, and even playing with, NFTs, though, it didn’t really click for me until I saw these slides from Mirror’s Patrick Rivera:\n\nThe Great Online Game imitates video games. If people want to buy skins in Fortnite to express themselves, or clothes in meatspace to do the same, of course they’d want to buy NFTs to express themselves online. In an open world like the internet, the more you signal who you are and what you care about, the more you open yourself up to new possibilities. It’s an abundant game. NFTs are online art, cars, outfits, and houses. They’re the digital trappings of digital wealth. \n\nDAOs, too, are going to be important infrastructure for the Great Online Game. They make it easier for people to float in and out of projects at internet speed instead of committing to climb the ladder within a company, and allow for lightweight and temporary groupings when people want to combine their superpowers. Recently, PartyDAO formed to bring a bunch of smaller players together to compete against rich whales in NFT auctions. \n\nI suspect that many of the most successful web3 projects built in the coming years will serve to give the Great Online Game tools that were previously only available within the walled gardens of specific virtual or corporate worlds. I’m excited about and / or an investor in Crucible, Mirror, Seed Club, and Opolis to name a few. \n\nThe Great Online Game is only going to get more compelling. We’re in the early innings. So how should you play? \n\nHow to Play the Game\n\nOn Friday, Shopify President Harley Finkelstein joined us on Spaces Cadets. To close out the conversation, we asked him for his advice to potential entrepreneurs out there: \n\nThat’s a key mental shift. The cost of failure is as close to zero as it’s ever been, and it will continue to fall. That’s true for entrepreneurship, and it’s even more true for the Great Online Game. Because entrepreneurs are trying to build a business; when you start to play the Great Online Game, you’re just building optionality. \n\nAnyone can play the Great Online Game. All you need is some knowledge and curiosity. \n\nA typical path into the Game starts out in one niche community -- maybe you start thoughtfully replying to a few people you respect in your field on Twitter, or hop into a crypto Discord and get a feel for things before asking questions and participating. Ask yourself: “What am I nerdiest about?” and then go find your fellow nerds. They’re out there. \n\nOver time, you go from consumer to creator. You write, make videos, lead discussions, build projects, collaborate on research, or just share your experience as a new player figuring it out. If you already have an offline reputation, maybe you skip the passive piece and jump right into activity. \n\nIn either case, be yourself, but play with your character attributes. You can choose to be someone who’s a little good at a lot of things, or unbelievably good at one thing. Both work, and you can evolve your character over time. Play with the fearlessness of someone playing a game, because you are. These are internet strangers. At worst, they’ll ignore you, and you can keep workshopping and start over; at best, they’ll open up new doors. \n\nOnce you’re in, the Game follows Buckley’s four elements of successful game design: \n\nFeedback Loops. Once you jump into the conversation or start sharing, you’ll start getting feedback. Don’t expect it to be much. A like here, a “great point!” there, maybe some questions and conversations. Pay attention to what’s working and what’s not, but don’t be too calculated about it. People can smell it. Your metric may not be likes or views; a real conversation with one person you respect might be the best starting point. \n\nVariable Outcomes. Some things will work, and some won’t. That’s OK. If you’re treating it like a game, that’s to be expected. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s experimentation. Play around, try new things; some will hit, some won’t. That’s part of the fun. It’ll keep you hungry. \n\nSense of Control. In traditional game design, this means that the more you practice, the better you get, and the better your outcomes. It’s not easy. You get out what you put in. That’s doubly true in the Great Online Game, because you’re not just playing, you’re designing the game you want to play. Pick the things that you love the most and go deep. Learn, interact, give value with no expectation of anything in return, keep learning. There’s no boss in the Great Online Game; your success or failure is a direct result of your skill and effort. \n\nConnection to the Meta Game. I’m going to give this one its own non-bulleted paragraph. It’s important.  \n\nThe Meta Game here is your life and your career. The more you evolve and level up, the more opportunities you’ll have. If you build up a following, meet the right people, and get involved with the right projects, you’ll have put yourself on an entirely new trajectory. \n\nThe fun part is, if you do it right, it really can feel like a game. Don’t take it too seriously. Don’t wait for the perfect moment to jump in. The vast majority of people reading this won’t want to quit your job and make a living entirely online; that doesn’t mean you can’t play. Play on the side, learn some things, build some new hobbies and relationships. Give yourself an insurance plan if things don’t work out in your job, and a supercharger if they do. You never know when it might come in handy, or what new path you might discover. \n\nImportant note: don’t be an asshole. It’s an easy way to get some followers early, and if you’re trying to game that metric, it might work, but it’s also the easiest way to lose your life in the Great Online Game. \n\nI didn’t set out to play the Great Online Game when I started writing Not Boring, but that’s accidentally what I did. Two years ago, bored at my job, I started spending more time on Twitter and writing a newsletter. I just wanted to meet smart people who were interested in the same things I was. I never in a million years thought that my job would become playing the Great Online Game. But that’s what it’s become. \n\nWhen people ask me my title, I don’t have a good answer. Writer? Founder?

When we make assumptions, we state them. Otherwise, we presume that the future could unfold in many directions.\n\nThe futurist profession is dedicated to the formulation of new ideas and models for studying future possibilities. In practice however, professional futurists necessarily produce work that is of value to a single employer or funder. The ideas are only valuable insofar as they help realize a predetermined outcome. It is rare for a futurist to be paid to think outside an agenda like this.\n\n***Cope*** is a research service, established under the assumption that crowdfunding will enable a new economy of ideas. Our research is decoupled from the conditions and agendas set by institutional funders, meaning that feedback from our supporters is vital to the process. The community will help steer the lines of inquiry by commenting, suggesting topics, and offering financial support for work they find valuable. We imagine it as a new forum for future thought, as ***Research for the Hive***. \n\nWe methodically piece together plausible scenarios, step by step, using systems theory and applied mathematics. Our findings are compiled in detailed reports and released promptly. The range of topics we're currently working on includes:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/deeb2e57-a247-405b-9f2d-4b4e3f037346.jpg?height=1500&width=2700)\n\n\n\nOur output is high-volume and our turn-arounds are prompt. After a successful crowdfund, the reports are released within two weeks, often sooner. At certain intervals we will publish print editions of the entire body of research. These will also include previously unreleased material. All supporters will receive a print edition. \n \nIf you're into ***Cope*** straight away, please support the first issue of our service. We've set a modest goal of 1 ETH in anticipation of extended engagement with the distributed community of supporters. \n\nThe first issue will include two reports on topics of personal interest. The first report is on the *BauDAO*, a DAO-based software stack for collective ownership of architecture. It outlines a sequence of scenarios in which programmable money, fractional ownership, and distributed governance radically reconfigure how the built environment is constructed and managed. The second report explores an anticipated issue of memory in digital mind engineering, introducing mathematical models to pose questions and offer solutions. ***Abstracts can be found below***.\n\n\n[Cope 01](crowdfund://0xb0c813151d18482a914a2b95b1a25d020532Bb36?network=homestead)\n\nWe like Mirror because we see crowdfunding as an opportunity for young professional researchers to break from think tanks, universities, and strategy firms. We take the future too seriously to agree to institutional constraints. By establishing regular feedback with a distributed set of supporters who find our reports valuable, we can create systematic studies of future outcomes – and pathways toward them – without having to trudge through byzantine protocols, semantic ciphers of clients, and conditional funding cycles. By lifting legacy constraints, we can speak about the future unrestrained. \n\nWe're also making use of the [Splits](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/splits) feature, which allows us to automatically direct funds to those who have inspired our work. In this case, we’re sending 4% to three people who have laid groundwork for us: [Kei Kreutler](https://www.ourmachine.net/) for her work on the qualities of DAOs, [Jesse Walden](https://variant.fund/) for The Ownership Economy of Metaverses, and [Kristoffer Josefsson](https://foam.space/) for his ongoing work with FOAM and editorial guidance.\n\n\n## Report 1: *The BauDAO*\n-Pierce Myers\n\n\nFractional ownership and distributed governance are programmable mechanisms of the Ownership Economy that will be applied to the expanded field of tangible assets in the city. Real estate is the largest asset class in the world, most locked behind capital barriers, and is the primary mechanism through which the rentier paradigm sustains its parasitic extraction of urban value. The Building DAO, or ‘*BauDAO*’ is a collective-oriented, DAO-based software stack that restructures the paradigm of architectural funding, construction, and ownership. The *BauDAO* includes software mechanisms that 1) reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of urban assets, 2) enable tiered governance protocols for determining ‘program’, and 3) sharply decrease capital barriers to ownership by orders of magnitude through crowdfunding. \n \nThis report diagrams the software architecture (BIM wrapped in DAO) and the unique role of Architects in triggering this paradigm of distributed urban ownership. The report begins with two near-term cases: a large creative collective acquiring studio space and a neighborhood-based residential building project, then speculates on mid-to-long-term scenarios for how these software-economic mechanisms can reshape cities and ecosystems in concert.\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c8aedb61-3c58-44d5-87ae-712e37180737.jpg?height=2071&width=2700)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ed3f5486-2f3a-4b13-9ace-7ffcbb709c80.jpg?height=1790&width=2700)\n\n\n\n\n## Report 2: *The Problem of Memory in Digital Minds* \n-James Douglas Boyd\n\nDigital minds will differ from human ones in that they will be both intelligent agents and products of the engineering designs of others. It may not always be easy for a digital mind to differentiate the aspects of its intelligence that are autonomous and those that are features of others’ designs. Memory is one such aspect. We consider an experiment that a digital mind can conduct and two measures that it can estimate for choosing among hypotheses regarding the origins of its memories.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eef26e2d-486a-4b5a-9219-4f77c9d35d25.jpg?height=1300&width=2700)\n\n\n\nAs ***Cope*** grows, the issues will include larger numbers of reports from a diversity of future thinkers. The content will be multimedia, and we'll distribute value using Splits. At the release of the first issue, we'll open our feedback channels for conversation. We're really excited about what this will become, and we look forward to building!\n\n\n# ***Thanks, Cope*** ", "timestamp": 1620669635, "digest": "w6bifreLlg_EcklLYoTDcbAfjMspF57YpYVEKeXqbmE", "contributor": "0x5E692Fe3d06414D75380604BA202c7d5ed94f219"}
{"id": "ivkFwxH7gXle-EWsRtmODgn_Cx5yDuWXRLj2pQBXgKI", "title": "Financial Dadaism and the Rise of the Shitcoin", "body": "### Intrinsic Value and Market Value\n\nRecently, attempts to control financial markets by everyday people have been relatively successful, most notably the GameStop short squeeze and the rise of the Dogecoin cryptocurrency.\n\nBoth the GameStop market movements and Dogecoin rallies elicited significant negative public reaction. In the case of GameStop, legacy financiers and popular media accused the online community r/WallStreetBets of market manipulation and trading institutions barred retail traders from participating fully in the market. The Dogecoin rally was met with a slew of commentary trying to stop people from investing in the crypto because it could crash at any moment. Crypto prophets criticized the \"shitcoin\" boom, accusing participants of distracting from the true value of more promising blockchain projects.\n\nIn both cases, the negative reaction was born of the idea that financial behavior is or should be grounded in an analysis of a commodity's intrinsic value—that there is a meaningful link between intrinsic value and market value. Hardly anyone thinks intrinsic value and market value are the same, but most speculation in financial markets is purportedly based on the idea that intrinsic value and market value will eventually converge. At the very least, there is thought to be some correlation between the two. Cases like GameStop and Dogecoin subvert this idea in that investment decisions become increasingly involved with the question \"What are other players in the financial game doing?\" and less involved with \"What is the intrinsic value of this asset?\"\n\nIn the case of GameStop and Dogecoin, the intrinsic value is nothing more than an afterthought. What really matters is the market value—the line on the screen that goes up and down. This value is based entirely on sentiment and expectation. No one is looking at the fundamental value of Dogecoin or pouring over GameStop financial reports because they know the market value is divorced from the intrinsic value.\n\nThe project of financial analysis and much of economics is to pin down the logic of the market—to render it predictable and sensical. This approach often seems useful (and sometimes *is* useful) because it's a prophecy that fulfills itself: if we approach financial and economic behavior in a logical and sensical way, it becomes more likely that the market will follow the logic we inserted into it. However, this logic is not always inherent to the market. In many cases, the assumption that a financial asset's market value will align with intrinsic value results in an actual correlation between the two simply because we think it will. For example, when Google announces a new product, market players assume a connection between Google (the company) and GOOGL (the stock) and so the intrinsic value is tied to the market value because people think it is and the stock price changes based on the release.\n\nIn a financialized economy, speculation is queen. It doesn't really matter if that speculation is grounded in solid financial or economic analysis. Very little is connecting Google to GOOGL except the assumption by market participants that their values are connected. The realization that this connection can be broken is what allows speculative products like GME and Dogecoin to \"run away\" from the value of GameStop or the peer-to-peer trading system that underlies Dogecoin.\n\nThese cases demonstrate that people are increasingly realizing financial value can be completely fabricated. They're becoming financial dadaists.\n\n### Financial Dadaism\n\nDadaism is an artistic and cultural movement defined by whimsy, spontaneity, and irrationality. It's often interpreted as satirical and critical of high art and culture. For example, the most cited dadaist art piece, Fountain by Marcel Duchamp, was a urinal that was reoriented, mounted on the wall, and signed by the artist. The work was submitted to the Paris Salon, but rejected on the basis that it wasn't art. The dadaist movement holds an interesting place within art because it was critical of the mainstream art machine and yet became subsumed by it. What began as a whimsical critique of the nature of art became an embodied expression of an idea that was eventually taken rather seriously by the art world.\n\nFundamental to the dadaist movement was the assertion that something *is* art when someone *calls* it art. This artistic idea questioned both the existence and nature of art: if *everything* can be art, then can *anything* be art? Is the concept of \"art\" meaningful at all?\n\nRecent understandings of—and actions within—the financial market have applied dadaist thought in straightforward ways: the practice of divorcing speculative market value from intrinsic value identifies the potential absurdity of financial markets and rejects some mainstream economic ideas about how markets operate (namely how values converge). Movements like Gamestop and Dogecoin began spontaneously and rejected market logic, but eventually attracted the attention of the systems they seemed to critique. What could be seen as satirical criticisms of the financial system ultimately became serious and profitable part of the financial machine.\n\nThese movements expose that, just as art may become art when someone decides it is, financial products can be valuable simply because enough people say they are. They question our conception of financial value, asking whether any financial product can be truly valuable if that value is fabricated exclusively by market activity. If what we call \"value\" can be created and destroyed by speculation and sentiment alone, then is it really value at all?\n\nFinancial dadaists have importantly uncovered that the market can be whimsical and irrational in a purposeful way. It can be a game or a toy or a meme. The market is just a way for people to interact with each other, and the behavior of the market and its participants doesn't need to fit any rigid definition.\n\nThe principles of financial dadaism are not new: market manipulators have always known the financial values they manipulate are not wholly grounded in any more tangible form of value. That's how algorithmic traders make massive sums of money from tiny stock market movements that don't correlate to any non-financial behavior. That's how hedge funds suppress or inflate stock prices even though nothing about the company's intrinsic value changes.\n\nPopular financial logic stands to justify these speculative profits by assigning a narrative of allocative efficiency to financial behavior. While it's true that some speculative financial behavior actually does facilitate economic growth and catalyze innovation, this logic of financial efficiency has often been applied where it really shouldn't be.\n\n### The Honesty of the Shitcoin\n\nThe beauty of Dogecoin and related cryptocurrencies is that there is virtually no narrative that ties them to economic progress or efficiency. Much of the criticism of shitcoins, or digital currencies that have no immediate purpose, is that they're \"fake money\" and that their value is not necessarily based on anything other than speculation.\n\nIn contrast to mainstream cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, which is ushering in an entire world of smart contract innovation and decentralized finance possibilities, these coins are pure exercises in speculation. For many, this is a problem. The financial dadaist increasingly recognizes that the role of absurdity, speculation, and sentiment in the market is often understated or misrepresented. They identify the emergence of the shitcoin as a simple variation on a common financial theme.\n\nThe difference between GameStop and Dogecoin is that Gamestop is a company that has significant intrinsic value. If GME stock was not traded, Gamestop would still have reason to exist. The same cannot be said for Dogecoin. With Dogecoin, market value is its only value. Hardly any investors in Dogecoin made their investments because they thought it had intrinsic value and would be used as a standard currency in the future. It was and is truly understood solely as a speculative asset whose value is determined by the market without professing a connection to something else.\n\nIf every single financial asset can be inflated, deflated, and manipulated, then dropping the market logic charade seems like a step in the right direction. If we're going to participate in a massive financial game of chicken, we probably should contain the implications to truly financial assets. We can trade financial assets that don't purport to be anything more than speculative games, or we can trade mortgage-backed securities and destroy the housing market or speculate about a publicly traded company and drive it to bankruptcy. Which do we prefer?\n\nFinancialization is an absurd process that divorces market value and intrinsic value but finds justification in economic theory that (largely as a result of some strange assumptions about human rationality) asserts it actually marries the two. Speculative markets are unpredictable, often because they're intentionally obfuscated and rife with problems of asymmetric information. \n\nThe financial market is more dadaist by the day. Shitcoins embrace that. It's easy to demonize shitcoins on the grounds that they're fake or absurd or don't make sense, but maybe the fakeness and absurdity are the point. Those descriptors don't apply to shitcoins only because they're shitcoins but rather simply because they're financial assets and all financial assets can be absurd if market participants agree that they are. This criticism actually unveils a benefit of shitcoins: they're more transparent about what they are and what they're meant to do than other financial products.\n\nThe financial system doesn't make as much sense as we might think it does—it just has decades of shoddy economic theory and financial analysis trying to convince us that it represents real intrinsic value. The absurdity that was once hidden within the technocratic black box of finance and economics is being exposed to the public. This time around, the exposure doesn't happen when a bubble bursts and people's retirement accounts are decimated, but is assumed and reiterated with the release of the latest shitcoin.\n\nMaybe shitcoins and financial dadaism are a phase that will be suppressed or fall out of favor, or maybe financial dadaism is a new paradigm of financial honesty. \n\nIn a financial system where value is crafted from speculation and sentiment, maybe shitcoins are the only financial assets that are absurd enough to make any sense.\n\n*quasimatt is a student of philosophy and economics.

In the case of GameStop, legacy financiers and popular media accused the online community r/WallStreetBets of market manipulation and trading institutions barred retail traders from participating fully in the market. The Dogecoin rally was met with a slew of commentary trying to stop people from investing in the crypto because it could crash at any moment. Crypto prophets criticized the \"shitcoin\" boom, accusing participants of distracting from the true value of more promising blockchain projects.\n\nIn both cases, the negative reaction was born of the idea that financial behavior is or should be grounded in an analysis of a commodity's intrinsic value—that there is a meaningful link between intrinsic value and market value. Hardly anyone thinks intrinsic value and market value are the same, but most speculation in financial markets is purportedly based on the idea that intrinsic value and market value will eventually converge. At the very least, there is thought to be some correlation between the two.
