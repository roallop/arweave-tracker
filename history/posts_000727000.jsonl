It is 1 of 1 ü•∞\n\nVoice Models, in combination with machine learning technology, already allow for anyone to clone a voice to generate music and media, and the opportunities and complications inherent to these techniques will only intensify!\n\nThis development raises novel questions about voice ownership that I think can be addressed by DAO governance ü§ù\n\nI plan to decentralize access, decision making and profits made from my digital twin, Holly+ üë≠\n\nProfits made from the commercial usage of my digital likeness will be ingested by the DAO, who are able to vote on new tool creation, and approve official usage of my twin, Holly+ üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI will soon be launching a [Zora auction house](https://zora.co/zora/3099) to sell approved works made with my likeness üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è\n\n## Who am I?\n\nI'm an artist and composer üë©‚Äçüíª who has been working with machine learning for many years. My last album [PROTO(4AD,2019)](https://4ad.com/artists/122) was the first to utilize singing neural networks, and I completed my Doctorate at [Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/), where my research focus was on the interplay between machine learning and the voice, and the implications of this technology for IP and vocal sovereigntyüë©‚Äçüî¨\n\nSome AI models already know who I am! Here are some images spawned from my likeness using [OpenAI's CLIP model](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) ü§Ø\n\n![Latent Visions/VQGAN/CLIP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2d755ebb-b136-4e0b-bc47-f5cab587131a.JPG?height=352&width=640)\n![StyleGANxCLIP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3cfba721-440d-442b-9351-d3500c9548f6.PNG?height=1024&width=1024)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some links to find me online:\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Herndon) / [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@hollyherndon) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hollyherndon) / [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/holly_herndon/)\n\n## Holly+Spectre Voice Tool\n\nThe first tool, a custom voice instrument and website by [Never Before Heard Sounds](https://heardsounds.com/), allows for anyone to upload polyphonic audio and receive a download of that music sung back in my distinctive processed voice. Further tools are in development to allow for spoken and sung phrases, and image generation, to be released later this year.\n\nThere is an upload limit of 5 minutes for audio files ‚è≤Ô∏è\n\nWe do not retain a copy of any original audio uploaded to the tool, but we will archive copies of the output audio so you can share them!\n\nYou are free to use the material generated as you see fit, and accreditation is always appreciated! üòé\n\n## What is a Voice Model?\n\nA Voice Model is a deep neural network that can generate raw audio of an individual voice. The network is trained on recorded speech and singing from the target voice, and can be interacted with in various ways, from text-to-speech applications to more complex interactions such as audio style transfer, where audio from one voice can be converted to resemble the target voice, a kind of vocal puppetry ü§ñ\n\nThe recent introduction of projects like DeepMind‚Äôs [Wavenet](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio), Google‚Äôs [Tacotron](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) and others have advanced the field of voice generation sufficient to make me confident that generating convincing spoken and sung voices will soon become standard practice for artists and other creatives, as presaged by the popularity of celebrity vocal deep fakes already found all over YouTube.\n\nNot all vocal models are equal. While it may be possible to generate an approximation of a voice by training a neural network from freely available audio found online, the deeper and more detailed the model is, the wider the range of expression available to create with üñåÔ∏è\n\nWhile for the time being the perceived difference between a bootleg or official voice model may be quite small, as our ability to produce more detailed and convincing voice generation evolves, so too will the need for comprehensive, high fidelity vocal training data, as well as the urgency of discerning provenance.\n\nFor this reason I believe that there will be demand for official, high fidelity, vocal models of public figures, so why not experiment with my own? üó£Ô∏è\n\nThese models will guarantee the most realistic possible generated speech and song, and also provide a means for certifying officially approved usage of the voice in question.\n\nFidelity and range will be achieved by providing training input of the celebrity voice across different epochs of their lives, as a voice changes with the body, and also incorporate detailed aspects such as signature vocal habits and artificial effects ü•∏\n\n## Voice Model Rights\n\nExisting legal precedent protects public figures against artists or brands commercially appropriating their vocal likeness. There are two regularly cited cases arguing this point.\n\nFirst, in [Midler v. Ford Motor Co (1988)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midler_v._Ford_Motor_Co.), Bette Midler sued and won her case against Ford Motor Company, who had hired one of her backing singers to impersonate her delivery on her hit ‚ÄúDo You Want to Dance‚Äù after Midler herself had refused the offer. You can hear the original song [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGpwgSo3THE), and the convincing re-enactment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxShNrpdVRs) ü§î\n\nSecond, in [Waits v. Frito-Lay (1992)](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/communications/waits.html) , the artist Tom Waits sued and won a case against Frito-Lay for their vocal impersonation of him in a [Doritos radio commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNIJWCNEzTw). Significantly, the impersonation was not referencing a song he previously had any association with. This suggests that beyond practices of digital sampling of existing recordings or vocal reenactment of existing repertoire, ‚Äú[some stylistic aspects of the voice are definable, extractible, and defensible against unauthorized use under a right of publicity theory.](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=fclj)‚Äù\n\nWhile we are yet to see legal cases in relation to the commercial exploitation of a vocal likeness utilizing deep learning, these precedents suggest that public figures will retain exclusive rights to the exploitation of their vocal likeness for commercial purposes.\n\nWhile a public figure is protected from unlicensed commercial exploitation of their vocal likeness, there are also great benefits to offering the public open source access to a voice model under a [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). This license ensures that all derivative works created through experimentation in the voice would also be open source and not commercially exploitable üë©‚Äçüè´\n\nThrough providing artists and researchers access to the voice under these terms, it increases the likelihood of the voice‚Äôs prominence online, which in turn only contributes to the value of the original voice model itself.\n\nThis approach supports the ‚ÄúMy Collectible Ass‚Äù principle, advocated for by [ZORA](https://zora.co/) and originally proposed by theorist [McKenzie Wark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie_Wark). This principle states that the more prominent and visible/audible a work of art is, the more valuable the certified original becomes.\n\nOpen sourcing the voice model under a GPL license leaves open the possibility for its non commercial use, however only the owners and stewards of the voice model would be able to certify and profit from derivative works created from it, which feels fair ü§ù\n\n## Holly+ DAO\n\nDAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organization) stewardship of my voice model rights makes sense for many reasons.\n\nIt is an idea I have been interested in for a long time! [I dedicated a song to the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzP9IwznNuQ) on my album Platform(4AD,2015) üßÆ\n\nA DAO of stewards of the Holly+ voice model can vote on minting and certifying new works created from the voice model. As token holders, they are incentivized to only certify or license new works that contribute to the value of the voice, and do not dilute that value through the production of bad art or negative associations. Only a scarce number of official artworks will be minted using the voice model, and DAO token holders are entitled to a cut of profits from resales of those works in perpetuity ü§ù\n\n**The Holly+ model creates a virtuous cycle. I release tools to allow for the creative usage of my likeness, the best artworks and license opportunities are approved by DAO members, profit from those works will be shared amongst artists using the tools, DAO members, and a treasury to fund further development of the tools.** \n\nIn the event of my death, I feel more comfortable with distributed ownership of the rights to my voice model among a DAO of stewards who are invested in maintaining the value and reputation of my voice than the rights being passed down to someone less familiar with the values and standards associated with my work. There is precedent for music catalog rights being passed down to family estates whose best interest is in making as many short term gains from those rights as possible. My hope is that decentralizing decision making across a DAO of stewards will encourage a more delicate stewardship over those rights through debate and shared interest!\n\n## OpenLaw Tribute DAO Framework\n\nThe Holly+ DAO will make use of the [OpenLaw Tribute DAO framework](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts). You can learn more about [OpenLaw](https://www.openlaw.io/), and their instrumental role in legally recognizing DAO's in Wyoming, on our [Interdependence podcast](https://interdependence.fm/) here:\n\nhttps://interdependence.simplecast.com/episodes/the-wyoming-dao-bill-dao-art-collections-autonomous-daos-dao-templates-and-more-daos-with-priyanka-desai-aaron-wright-of-openlaw\n\n## Holly+ DAO tokens\n\nI will create ERC-20 VOICE tokens, airdropped to collectors of my art, friends and family of the project, and other artists selected to participate in using the Holly+ voice to create new works.\n\nThe ERC-20 VOICE tokens will come to represent voting shares in Holly+ DAO.\n\nDAO token holders will vote to mint new NFTs of derivative works generated by Holly+ voice, and the DAO will be entitled to a % cut of profits made from those sales in perpetuity.\n\nThe value of the token will be derived from access to governance decisions in stewarding the voice model and minting new works, royalties from any new works minted, secondary sales of all works minted, and eventually any commercial licensing of the Holly+ voice on or off chain, once we are able to reach our goal of recognizing the DAO as a legal entity.\n\n# NFT Minting\n\nOnce Holly+ voice is open sourced, artists will be able to submit media created with the voice for DAO approval through a [ZORA auction model](https://zora.mirror.xyz/9mQ9AeJK84USTnQ9eBY4Sc7s1bi0N8RoZd3Oy4q82FM).\n\nShould the DAO approve the work, an NFT will be minted, with 50% of initial and secondary sales shared with the creator of the new work. 40% of profits will be distributed amongst DAO members, and 10% will go to me directly, for rent! \n\n## **NFT Minting Scenario**\n\nArtist X produces a song using the Holly+ voice model.\n\nArtist X uploads the song online, and submits the song as a proposal to the DAO through a public interface.\n\nVOICE token holders vote to mint the song as an appropriate or inspiring usage of the Holly+ voice.\n\nAn NFT of the song is minted by the DAO, with 50% of sales generated going to the artist, and 40% of sales going to DAO members, and 10% reserved for me.\n\n# Roadmap\n\n**2021**\n\nLaunching of the interface to easily be able to make new works with the Holly+ voice model ‚úÖ\n\nOpen sourcing of the vocal model under a GNU GPL license to encourage experimentation and development ‚è≥\n\nThe first minting of NFTs using the Holly+ voice model from select collaborators, with 50% profits from sales being absorbed back into the DAO ‚è≥\n\nFurther tools for creation using the Holly+ voice ‚è≥\n\n**2022**\n\nThe establishment of Holly+ VOICE DAO LLC, offering profit splits with members for commercial usage of the voice model in on-chain and off-chain scenarios ‚è≥\n\nFurther development of the Holly+ voice model, and new tool development funded by DAO proceeds and voted upon by DAO members ‚è≥\n\n# Partners & Advisors\n\nNever Before Heard Sounds [https://heardsounds.com](https://heardsounds.com/) \n\nZora [https://zora.co/](https://zora.co/)\n\nOpenLaw [https://www.openlaw.io/](https://www.openlaw.io/)\n\nRVNG Intl.

The Holly+ model runs on our dedicated GPU backend that we use for all our cloud transformations. In addition to the cloud processor, all our models (including Holly+) can be performed live on a real-time hardware instrument we are developing.\n\n## Zora\n\nZora is a universal media registry protocol. It‚Äôs a way for creators to publish creative media, earn money on their work, and have others build and share what they create. Because this media is based on a protocol, all this happens without the lock-in of social media platforms.\n\n**Read what Zora does**: [https://zora.co/manifesto](https://zora.co/manifesto)\n\n**Learn how Zora does it:** [https://zora.engineering/whitepaper](https://zora.engineering/whitepaper)\n\n**Listen to our discussion with Zora on the Interdependence Podcast**:\n\nhttps://interdependence.simplecast.com/episodes/artist-tokens-community-owned-institutions-and-the-reliance-alliance-with-zora\n\n## Legal disclaimer\n\nDuring my lifetime, I will exclusively retain the right to do whatever I want with my physical voice!

Music is the fuel, electricity, and light of the world.\n\nCenturies ago, *Elektra* had a thriving civilization with a deep rooted sense of value towards art. But soon, motives around greed and self-interest took over, and the music that powered this world was lost.\n\nYour mission is to travel to *Elektra*, and help us collectively revive, restore and reignite this once beautiful world back to health.\n\n***Will you accept your mission?***\n\n\n[Phi Ticket](edition://0xEF3c951e22c65F6256746F4e227e19A5BcbF393C?editionId=3&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n[Psi Ticket](edition://0xEF3c951e22c65F6256746F4e227e19A5BcbF393C?editionId=2&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n[Chi Ticket](edition://0xEF3c951e22c65F6256746F4e227e19A5BcbF393C?editionId=1&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n## What is Songcamp Elektra?\n\n**Songcamp Elektra** is the second experiment created by *Songcamp* ‚Äî a community of musicians, artists and strategists with a deep interest in learning what happens when **music** and **the new internet** crash into each other.\n\n*Songcamp* acts a lot like a **web3 laboratory** ‚Äî experimenting at the far out edges of how web3 tools and tech can affect positive change in the lives and work of artists.\n\nThe *Songcamp Elektra* project is made up of ~42 artists, devs, project ops and strategists working together to bring this world to life. This crowdfund intends to raise the funds that will enable us to do just that. \n\n## Crowdfund Details\n\n* **90% to the *Elektra* project**\n* **10% to *Portal Tickets* visual team**\n\nWe will use 90% of the amount raised to put towards the *Elektra* project. \n\nThese funds will go toward the core team of project managers, web developers, artists and strategists working directly on the project. Other costs include transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, web hosting and file storage. We intend to save a portion of these funds to act as the *seed money* in standing up the *ElektraDAO* once this initial phase of the project is complete (more on that below).\n\nThe remaining 10% will go directly to the artists who created the *Portal Ticket* visuals.\n\n## Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra + The Elektra NFT Vault\n\n*Songcamp Elektra* will run for 4 weeks, until the first week of August. \n\nOnce through the portal, you will begin your journey. You will work with other players to move through this foreign land, discover more about the history of *Elektra*, and find your way to victory. \n\nIf successful, you will unlock the help you need ‚Äî the people and items along the way that will help you accomplish your mission. Remember, **it is music that powers the world of *Elektra***. Luckily, you‚Äôll have a lot of talented musicians to help along the way. You too may be summoned to assist in the music creation (should you wish to of course). :)\n\nAt times during the camp, 1-of-1 NFTs will be released. A 20% share of the proceeds from collected NFTs will go towards the ElektraDAO, while a select few of the NFTs will be placed in the Elektra Vault.\n\n## Phase 2: ElektraDAO + The $ELEKTRA Token\n\n> We will build a world, and own that world together. \n\nUpon purchasing your *Portal Ticket* NFT, you will also receive a portion of $ELEKTRA tokens based on the amount contributed. You will receive 100 $ELEKTRA for every 0.1 ETH you contribute to the crowdfund. \n\nThe project will retain 75% of $ELEKTRA‚Äôs supply, and distribute the majority to artists, devs, project ops and strategists working directly on the project. The remaining amount will be used to create bounty rewards for the wider network, as well as vest a portion in the treasury. \n\n**As this project evolves, the lines between creator and audience will blur.** Game builders will also play the game they are building; and game players will also help build the game they are playing. \n\nBy the end, we will have a community of contributors to the Elektra project that all hold $ELEKTRA tokens based on their contribution levels. At this point, **we will have *exited to community* ‚Äî and the project will be owned and governed by $ELEKTRA token holders.** \n\n## Then What?\n\nWell, then it‚Äôs up to the network. \n\nThe *ElektraDAO* will have created an incredibly strong backbone:\n\n1. A core group of musicians, visual artists, devs, project ops, strategists and backers with sharp coordination and collaboration skills ‚Äî plus an overflowing level of *squad energy*.\n2. 1-of-1 NFTs from the Elektra story secured in the DAO‚Äôs vault.\n3. A flow of royalties from the artwork created in-camp.\n\nWe then have the exciting opportunity to collectively decide what to do with all this. \n\nSome early ideas: make more art together, continue evolving the world and story of *Elektra*, experiment with and carve out new paths to monetization and value realization for the art we‚Äôve created, or our personal favourite‚Ä¶\n\nhttps://twitter.com/troels_a/status/1413234727822180354\n\nBroadway, here we come.\n\n### Once you've secured your *Portal Ticket*, enter the Portal to Elektra:\n\nhttps://elektra.camp/", "timestamp": 1626216387, "digest": "mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc", "contributor": "0xfC4852B5e3aF65058CdfE1D1dce26946c0C1975f"}

Here are some images spawned from my likeness using [OpenAI's CLIP model](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) ü§Ø\n\n![Latent Visions/VQGAN/CLIP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2d755ebb-b136-4e0b-bc47-f5cab587131a.JPG?height=352&width=640)\n![StyleGANxCLIP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3cfba721-440d-442b-9351-d3500c9548f6.PNG?height=1024&width=1024)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some links to find me online:\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Herndon) / [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@hollyherndon) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hollyherndon) / [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/holly_herndon/)\n\n## Holly+Spectre Voice Tool\n\nThe first tool, a custom voice instrument and website by [Never Before Heard Sounds](https://heardsounds.com/), allows for anyone to upload polyphonic audio and receive a download of that music sung back in my distinctive processed voice. \n\nFurther tools are in development to allow for spoken and sung phrases, and image generation, to be released later this year.\n\nThere is an upload limit of 5 minutes for audio files ‚è≤Ô∏è\n\nWe do not retain a copy of any original audio uploaded to the tool, but we will archive copies of the output audio so you can share them!\n\nYou are free to use the material generated as you see fit, and accreditation is always appreciated! üòé\n\n## What is a Voice Model?\n\nA Voice Model is a deep neural network that can generate raw audio of an individual voice. The network is trained on recorded speech and singing from the target voice, and can be interacted with in various ways, from text-to-speech applications to more complex interactions such as audio style transfer, where audio from one voice can be converted to resemble the target voice, a kind of vocal puppetry ü§ñ\n\nThe recent introduction of projects like DeepMind‚Äôs [Wavenet](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio), Google‚Äôs [Tacotron](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) and others have advanced the field of voice generation sufficient to make me confident that generating convincing spoken and sung voices will soon become standard practice for artists and other creatives, as presaged by the popularity of celebrity vocal deep fakes already found all over YouTube.\n\nNot all vocal models are equal. While it may be possible to generate an approximation of a voice by training a neural network from freely available audio found online, the deeper and more detailed the model is, the wider the range of expression available to create with üñåÔ∏è\n\nWhile for the time being the perceived difference between a bootleg or official voice model may be quite small, as our ability to produce more detailed and convincing voice generation evolves, so too will the need for comprehensive, high fidelity vocal training data, as well as the urgency of discerning provenance.\n\nFor this reason I believe that there will be demand for official, high fidelity, vocal models of public figures, so why not experiment with my own? üó£Ô∏è\n\nThese models will guarantee the most realistic possible generated speech and song, and also provide a means for certifying officially approved usage of the voice in question.\n\nFidelity and range will be achieved by providing training input of the celebrity voice across different epochs of their lives, as a voice changes with the body, and also incorporate detailed aspects such as signature vocal habits and artificial effects ü•∏\n\n## Voice Model Rights\n\nExisting legal precedent protects public figures against artists or brands commercially appropriating their vocal likeness. There are two regularly cited cases arguing this point.\n\nFirst, in [Midler v. Ford Motor Co (1988)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midler_v._Ford_Motor_Co.), Bette Midler sued and won her case against Ford Motor Company, who had hired one of her backing singers to impersonate her delivery on her hit ‚ÄúDo You Want to Dance‚Äù after Midler herself had refused the offer. You can hear the original song [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGpwgSo3THE), and the convincing re-enactment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxShNrpdVRs) ü§î\n\nSecond, in [Waits v. Frito-Lay (1992)](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/communications/waits.html) , the artist Tom Waits sued and won a case against Frito-Lay for their vocal impersonation of him in a [Doritos radio commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNIJWCNEzTw). Significantly, the impersonation was not referencing a song he previously had any association with. This suggests that beyond practices of digital sampling of existing recordings or vocal reenactment of existing repertoire, ‚Äú[some stylistic aspects of the voice are definable, extractible, and defensible against unauthorized use under a right of publicity theory.](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=fclj)‚Äù\n\nWhile we are yet to see legal cases in relation to the commercial exploitation of a vocal likeness utilizing deep learning, these precedents suggest that public figures will retain exclusive rights to the exploitation of their vocal likeness for commercial purposes.\n\nWhile a public figure is protected from unlicensed commercial exploitation of their vocal likeness, there are also great benefits to offering the public open source access to a voice model under a [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). This license ensures that all derivative works created through experimentation in the voice would also be open source and not commercially exploitable üë©‚Äçüè´\n\nThrough providing artists and researchers access to the voice under these terms, it increases the likelihood of the voice‚Äôs prominence online, which in turn only contributes to the value of the original voice model itself.\n\nThis approach supports the ‚ÄúMy Collectible Ass‚Äù principle, advocated for by [ZORA](https://zora.co/) and originally proposed by theorist [McKenzie Wark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie_Wark). This principle states that the more prominent and visible/audible a work of art is, the more valuable the certified original becomes.\n\nOpen sourcing the voice model under a GPL license leaves open the possibility for its non commercial use, however only the owners and stewards of the voice model would be able to certify and profit from derivative works created from it, which feels fair ü§ù\n\n## Holly+ DAO\n\nDAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organization) stewardship of my voice model rights makes sense for many reasons.\n\nIt is an idea I have been interested in for a long time! [I dedicated a song to the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzP9IwznNuQ) on my album Platform(4AD,2015) üßÆ\n\nA DAO of stewards of the Holly+ voice model can vote on minting and certifying new works created from the voice model. As token holders, they are incentivized to only certify or license new works that contribute to the value of the voice, and do not dilute that value through the production of bad art or negative associations. Only a scarce number of official artworks will be minted using the voice model, and DAO token holders are entitled to a cut of profits from resales of those works in perpetuity ü§ù\n\n**The Holly+ model creates a virtuous cycle. I release tools to allow for the creative usage of my likeness, the best artworks and license opportunities are approved by DAO members, profit from those works will be shared amongst artists using the tools, DAO members, and a treasury to fund further development of the tools.** \n\nIn the event of my death, I feel more comfortable with distributed ownership of the rights to my voice model among a DAO of stewards who are invested in maintaining the value and reputation of my voice than the rights being passed down to someone less familiar with the values and standards associated with my work. There is precedent for music catalog rights being passed down to family estates whose best interest is in making as many short term gains from those rights as possible. My hope is that decentralizing decision making across a DAO of stewards will encourage a more delicate stewardship over those rights through debate and shared interest!\n\n## OpenLaw Tribute DAO Framework\n\nThe Holly+ DAO will make use of the [OpenLaw Tribute DAO framework](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts).

Where buying art, voting, fundraising, and even social media were not controlled by a central company or intermediary, but rather an open-source, community-run network where code runs without interference. In 2013 Vitalik Buterin, an 18-year-old Bitcoin enthusiast and writer, proposed the tools to make that future possible. Less than a decade later, thousands of developers have contributed to building the Ethereum ecosystem: a technology that enables decentralized applications, including but not limited to money. For many, [Ethereum is building the internet of value](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-building-internet-of-value). \n\nBut as Ethereum grows in size and popularity, it faces mounting pressure from cutting-edge competitors, hype markets, and criticisms for its scalability and energy consumption. Spearheaded by a global team of researchers and developers, a push to upgrade the platform could address the criticisms and unlock the technology's full potential... or it could derail the still-budding $300 billion network. \n\nFollowing the high-stakes journey to upgrade the platform, ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN explores the innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain, the die-hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik Buterin, whose brilliant vision for the internet has the potential to change the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/96ec37d2-1253-4129-86c0-33693623101b.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### THE INFINITE GARDEN: \n\nIn this film, we approach Ethereum as an ‚Äúinfinite garden.‚Äù Instead of thinking of Ethereum as a machine controlled by a central brain, we see it as a decentralized ecosystem with soil, plants, and insects that need to be cared for in order to grow. \n\nThe idea of the infinite garden was conceptualized by Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. She was inspired by James P. Carse‚Äôs book *Finite and Infinite Games*. The following basic principles are at its core: \n\n- A finite game is played for the purpose of winning. An infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the play.\n- The rules of finite games may not change; the rules of infinite games must change.\n- Finite players play within boundaries; Infinite players play without boundaries. \n- Finite players are serious; Infinite players are playful\n- Finite players play to win titles; Infinite players have nothing but their names\n- A finite player plays to be powerful; an infinite player plays with strength\n- Finite players are theatrical; infinite players are dramatic\n- A finite player consumes time; an infinite player generates time\n- The finite players aims to win eternal life; the infinite player aims for eternal birth\n\nThose who tend to the seeds they plant in the Ethereum garden can nurture and empower the ecosystem but can also harm it. For a crypto culture to remain equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, it must be tended to carefully. ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN will introduce us to these early ‚Äúgardeners‚Äù of the platform as they face the mounting pressures and challenges of the growing ecosystem. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/66a1e300-6e0b-4fd5-812d-7a6a34e599a7.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### DIRECTOR‚ÄôS STATEMENT\n\nAs a kid, I grew up in a strictly open-source household. My dad‚Äôs radical adoration of Linux introduced me to the potential of community-led technology (and mind blowing internet [weirdness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5x5OXfe9KY)) before I was even in grade school. Today, I feel that same excitement my dad once felt, but for Ethereum and the unique community that powers it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4406f2a-503f-46ec-ba6b-89db89fdd8df.jpeg?height=2336&width=8742&size=large)\n\nMy hope is to make Ethereum accessible and understandable to the world. By highlighting diverse stories from the global network of developers, founders, and end-users, we can create an emotional and human record of Ethereum‚Äôs journey. From the inspiring Axie Infinity gamers in the Philippines supporting their families during COVID to the tireless developers making Proof of Stake possible, there already is a bountiful garden to explore. \n\nThirty years from now, when our children look back from a world powered by programmable blockchain technology, they will wonder who was behind it, what challenges they faced, and what sacrifices they made. Instead of boring them with scattered memories and poor explanations of the ‚Äú[Just Keep Chugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvr0xYeV94M)‚Äù meme, let's give them ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN.\n\n*-Zach Ingrasci, Director*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ed408928-e082-4606-ad6c-f393ec2fb501.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### Projected Timeline: \n\nThis past spring, the film team established an exclusive filming relationship with Vitalik Buterin and Aya Miyaguchi.

The network is trained on recorded speech and singing from the target voice, and can be interacted with in various ways, from text-to-speech applications to more complex interactions such as audio style transfer, where audio from one voice can be converted to resemble the target voice, a kind of vocal puppetry ü§ñ\n\nThe recent introduction of projects like DeepMind‚Äôs [Wavenet](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio), Google‚Äôs [Tacotron](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) and others have advanced the field of voice generation sufficient to make me confident that generating convincing spoken and sung voices will soon become standard practice for artists and other creatives, as presaged by the popularity of celebrity vocal deep fakes already found all over YouTube.\n\nNot all vocal models are equal. While it may be possible to generate an approximation of a voice by training a neural network from freely available audio found online, the deeper and more detailed the model is, the wider the range of expression available to create with üñåÔ∏è\n\nWhile for the time being the perceived difference between a bootleg or official voice model may be quite small, as our ability to produce more detailed and convincing voice generation evolves, so too will the need for comprehensive, high fidelity vocal training data, as well as the urgency of discerning provenance.\n\nFor this reason I believe that there will be demand for official, high fidelity, vocal models of public figures, so why not experiment with my own? üó£Ô∏è\n\nThese models will guarantee the most realistic possible generated speech and song, and also provide a means for certifying officially approved usage of the voice in question.\n\nFidelity and range will be achieved by providing training input of the celebrity voice across different epochs of their lives, as a voice changes with the body, and also incorporate detailed aspects such as signature vocal habits and artificial effects ü•∏\n\n## Voice Model Rights\n\nExisting legal precedent protects public figures against artists or brands commercially appropriating their vocal likeness. There are two regularly cited cases arguing this point.\n\nFirst, in [Midler v. Ford Motor Co (1988)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midler_v._Ford_Motor_Co.), Bette Midler sued and won her case against Ford Motor Company, who had hired one of her backing singers to impersonate her delivery on her hit ‚ÄúDo You Want to Dance‚Äù after Midler herself had refused the offer. You can hear the original song [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGpwgSo3THE), and the convincing re-enactment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxShNrpdVRs) ü§î\n\nSecond, in [Waits v. Frito-Lay (1992)](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/communications/waits.html) , the artist Tom Waits sued and won a case against Frito-Lay for their vocal impersonation of him in a [Doritos radio commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNIJWCNEzTw). Significantly, the impersonation was not referencing a song he previously had any association with. This suggests that beyond practices of digital sampling of existing recordings or vocal reenactment of existing repertoire, ‚Äú[some stylistic aspects of the voice are definable, extractible, and defensible against unauthorized use under a right of publicity theory.](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=fclj)‚Äù\n\nWhile we are yet to see legal cases in relation to the commercial exploitation of a vocal likeness utilizing deep learning, these precedents suggest that public figures will retain exclusive rights to the exploitation of their vocal likeness for commercial purposes.\n\nWhile a public figure is protected from unlicensed commercial exploitation of their vocal likeness, there are also great benefits to offering the public open source access to a voice model under a [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). This license ensures that all derivative works created through experimentation in the voice would also be open source and not commercially exploitable üë©‚Äçüè´\n\nThrough providing artists and researchers access to the voice under these terms, it increases the likelihood of the voice‚Äôs prominence online, which in turn only contributes to the value of the original voice model itself.\n\nThis approach supports the ‚ÄúMy Collectible Ass‚Äù principle, advocated for by [ZORA](https://zora.co/) and originally proposed by theorist [McKenzie Wark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie_Wark). This principle states that the more prominent and visible/audible a work of art is, the more valuable the certified original becomes.\n\nOpen sourcing the voice model under a GPL license leaves open the possibility for its non commercial use, however only the owners and stewards of the voice model would be able to certify and profit from derivative works created from it, which feels fair ü§ù\n\n## Holly+ DAO\n\nDAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organization) stewardship of my voice model rights makes sense for many reasons.\n\nIt is an idea I have been interested in for a long time! [I dedicated a song to the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzP9IwznNuQ) on my album Platform(4AD,2015) üßÆ\n\nA DAO of stewards of the Holly+ voice model can vote on minting and certifying new works created from the voice model. As token holders, they are incentivized to only certify or license new works that contribute to the value of the voice, and do not dilute that value through the production of bad art or negative associations. Only a scarce number of official artworks will be minted using the voice model, and DAO token holders are entitled to a cut of profits from resales of those works in perpetuity ü§ù\n\n**The Holly+ model creates a virtuous cycle. I release tools to allow for the creative usage of my likeness, the best artworks and license opportunities are approved by DAO members, profit from those works will be shared amongst artists using the tools, DAO members, and a treasury to fund further development of the tools.** \n\nIn the event of my death, I feel more comfortable with distributed ownership of the rights to my voice model among a DAO of stewards who are invested in maintaining the value and reputation of my voice than the rights being passed down to someone less familiar with the values and standards associated with my work. There is precedent for music catalog rights being passed down to family estates whose best interest is in making as many short term gains from those rights as possible. My hope is that decentralizing decision making across a DAO of stewards will encourage a more delicate stewardship over those rights through debate and shared interest!\n\n## OpenLaw Tribute DAO Framework\n\nThe Holly+ DAO will make use of the [OpenLaw Tribute DAO framework](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts).

The Holly+ model runs on our dedicated GPU backend that we use for all our cloud transformations. In addition to the cloud processor, all our models (including Holly+) can be performed live on a real-time hardware instrument we are developing.\n\n## Zora\n\nZora is a universal media registry protocol. It‚Äôs a way for creators to publish creative media, earn money on their work, and have others build and share what they create.

It is 1 of 1 ü•∞\n\nVoice Models, in combination with machine learning technology, already allow for anyone to clone a voice to generate music and media, and the opportunities and complications inherent to these techniques will only intensify!\n\nThis development raises novel questions about voice ownership that I think can be addressed by DAO governance ü§ù\n\nI plan to decentralize access, decision making and profits made from my digital twin, Holly+ üë≠\n\nProfits made from the commercial usage of my digital likeness will be ingested by the DAO, who are able to vote on new tool creation, and approve official usage of my twin, Holly+ üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI will soon be launching a [Zora auction house](https://zora.co/zora/3099) to sell approved works made with my likeness üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è\n\n## Who am I?\n\nI'm an artist and composer üë©‚Äçüíª who has been working with machine learning for many years. My last album [PROTO(4AD,2019)](https://4ad.com/artists/122) was the first to utilize singing neural networks, and I completed my Doctorate at [Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/), where my research focus was on the interplay between machine learning and the voice, and the implications of this technology for IP and vocal sovereigntyüë©‚Äçüî¨\n\nSome AI models already know who I am! Here are some images spawned from my likeness using [OpenAI's CLIP model](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) ü§Ø\n\n![Latent Visions/VQGAN/CLIP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2d755ebb-b136-4e0b-bc47-f5cab587131a.JPG?height=352&width=640)\n![StyleGANxCLIP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3cfba721-440d-442b-9351-d3500c9548f6.PNG?height=1024&width=1024)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some links to find me online:\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Herndon) / [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@hollyherndon) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hollyherndon) / [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/holly_herndon/)\n\n## Holly+ Voice Tool\n\nThe first tool, a custom voice instrument and website by [Never Before Heard Sounds](https://heardsounds.com/), allows for anyone to upload polyphonic audio and receive a download of that music sung back in my distinctive processed voice. \n\nFurther tools are in development to allow for spoken and sung phrases, and image generation, to be released later this year.\n\nThere is an upload limit of 5 minutes for audio files ‚è≤Ô∏è\n\nWe do not retain a copy of any original audio uploaded to the tool, but we will archive copies of the output audio so you can share them!\n\nYou are free to use the material generated as you see fit, and accreditation is always appreciated! üòé\n\n## What is a Voice Model?\n\nA Voice Model is a deep neural network that can generate raw audio of an individual voice. The network is trained on recorded speech and singing from the target voice, and can be interacted with in various ways, from text-to-speech applications to more complex interactions such as audio style transfer, where audio from one voice can be converted to resemble the target voice, a kind of vocal puppetry ü§ñ\n\nThe recent introduction of projects like DeepMind‚Äôs [Wavenet](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio), Google‚Äôs [Tacotron](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) and others have advanced the field of voice generation sufficient to make me confident that generating convincing spoken and sung voices will soon become standard practice for artists and other creatives, as presaged by the popularity of celebrity vocal deep fakes already found all over YouTube.\n\nNot all vocal models are equal. While it may be possible to generate an approximation of a voice by training a neural network from freely available audio found online, the deeper and more detailed the model is, the wider the range of expression available to create with üñåÔ∏è\n\nWhile for the time being the perceived difference between a bootleg or official voice model may be quite small, as our ability to produce more detailed and convincing voice generation evolves, so too will the need for comprehensive, high fidelity vocal training data, as well as the urgency of discerning provenance.\n\nFor this reason I believe that there will be demand for official, high fidelity, vocal models of public figures, so why not experiment with my own? üó£Ô∏è\n\nThese models will guarantee the most realistic possible generated speech and song, and also provide a means for certifying officially approved usage of the voice in question.\n\nFidelity and range will be achieved by providing training input of the celebrity voice across different epochs of their lives, as a voice changes with the body, and also incorporate detailed aspects such as signature vocal habits and artificial effects ü•∏\n\n## Voice Model Rights\n\nExisting legal precedent protects public figures against artists or brands commercially appropriating their vocal likeness. There are two regularly cited cases arguing this point.\n\nFirst, in [Midler v. Ford Motor Co (1988)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midler_v._Ford_Motor_Co.), Bette Midler sued and won her case against Ford Motor Company, who had hired one of her backing singers to impersonate her delivery on her hit ‚ÄúDo You Want to Dance‚Äù after Midler herself had refused the offer. You can hear the original song [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGpwgSo3THE), and the convincing re-enactment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxShNrpdVRs) ü§î\n\nSecond, in [Waits v. Frito-Lay (1992)](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/communications/waits.html) , the artist Tom Waits sued and won a case against Frito-Lay for their vocal impersonation of him in a [Doritos radio commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNIJWCNEzTw). Significantly, the impersonation was not referencing a song he previously had any association with. This suggests that beyond practices of digital sampling of existing recordings or vocal reenactment of existing repertoire, ‚Äú[some stylistic aspects of the voice are definable, extractible, and defensible against unauthorized use under a right of publicity theory.](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=fclj)‚Äù\n\nWhile we are yet to see legal cases in relation to the commercial exploitation of a vocal likeness utilizing deep learning, these precedents suggest that public figures will retain exclusive rights to the exploitation of their vocal likeness for commercial purposes.\n\nWhile a public figure is protected from unlicensed commercial exploitation of their vocal likeness, there are also great benefits to offering the public open source access to a voice model under a [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). This license ensures that all derivative works created through experimentation in the voice would also be open source and not commercially exploitable üë©‚Äçüè´\n\nThrough providing artists and researchers access to the voice under these terms, it increases the likelihood of the voice‚Äôs prominence online, which in turn only contributes to the value of the original voice model itself.\n\nThis approach supports the ‚ÄúMy Collectible Ass‚Äù principle, advocated for by [ZORA](https://zora.co/) and originally proposed by theorist [McKenzie Wark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie_Wark). This principle states that the more prominent and visible/audible a work of art is, the more valuable the certified original becomes.\n\nOpen sourcing the voice model under a GPL license leaves open the possibility for its non commercial use, however only the owners and stewards of the voice model would be able to certify and profit from derivative works created from it, which feels fair ü§ù\n\n## Holly+ DAO\n\nDAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organization) stewardship of my voice model rights makes sense for many reasons.\n\nIt is an idea I have been interested in for a long time! [I dedicated a song to the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzP9IwznNuQ) on my album Platform(4AD,2015) üßÆ\n\nA DAO of stewards of the Holly+ voice model can vote on minting and certifying new works created from the voice model. As token holders, they are incentivized to only certify or license new works that contribute to the value of the voice, and do not dilute that value through the production of bad art or negative associations. Only a scarce number of official artworks will be minted using the voice model, and DAO token holders are entitled to a cut of profits from resales of those works in perpetuity ü§ù\n\n**The Holly+ model creates a virtuous cycle. I release tools to allow for the creative usage of my likeness, the best artworks and license opportunities are approved by DAO members, profit from those works will be shared amongst artists using the tools, DAO members, and a treasury to fund further development of the tools.** \n\nIn the event of my death, I feel more comfortable with distributed ownership of the rights to my voice model among a DAO of stewards who are invested in maintaining the value and reputation of my voice than the rights being passed down to someone less familiar with the values and standards associated with my work. There is precedent for music catalog rights being passed down to family estates whose best interest is in making as many short term gains from those rights as possible. My hope is that decentralizing decision making across a DAO of stewards will encourage a more delicate stewardship over those rights through debate and shared interest!\n\n## OpenLaw Tribute DAO Framework\n\nThe Holly+ DAO will make use of the [OpenLaw Tribute DAO framework](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts).

Where buying art, voting, fundraising, and even social media were not controlled by a central company or intermediary, but rather an open-source, community-run network where code runs without interference. In 2013 Vitalik Buterin, an 18-year-old Bitcoin enthusiast and writer proposed the tools to make that future possible. Less than a decade later, thousands of developers have contributed to building the Ethereum ecosystem: a technology that enables decentralized applications, including but not limited to money. For many, [Ethereum is building the internet of value](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-building-internet-of-value). \n\nBut as Ethereum grows in size and popularity, it faces mounting pressure from cutting-edge competitors, hype markets, and criticisms for its scalability and energy consumption. Spearheaded by a global team of researchers and developers, a push to upgrade the platform could address the criticisms and unlock the technology's full potential... or it could derail the still-budding $300 billion network. \n\nFollowing the high-stakes journey to upgrade the platform, ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN is a feature-length documentary film that explores the innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain, the die-hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik Buterin, whose brilliant vision for the internet has the potential to change the world.\n\n[](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/videos/08600430-066a-4551-818c-26fdabb5836e.mp4?controls=true)\n\n### The Infinite Garden\n\nIn this film, we approach Ethereum as an ‚Äúinfinite garden.‚Äù Instead of thinking of Ethereum as a machine controlled by a central brain, we see it as a decentralized ecosystem with soil, plants, and insects that need to be cared for in order to grow. \n\nThe idea of the infinite garden was conceptualized by Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. She was inspired by James P. Carse‚Äôs book *Finite and Infinite Games*. The following basic principles are at its core: \n\n- A finite game is played for the purpose of winning; An infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the play\n- The rules of finite games may not change; the rules of infinite games must change\n- Finite players play within boundaries; Infinite players play without boundaries\n- Finite players are serious; Infinite players are playful\n- Finite players play to win titles; Infinite players have nothing but their names\n- A finite player plays to be powerful; an infinite player plays with strength\n- Finite players are theatrical; infinite players are dramatic\n- A finite player consumes time; an infinite player generates time\n- The finite players aims to win eternal life; the infinite player aims for eternal birth\n\nThose who tend to the seeds they plant in the Ethereum garden can nurture and empower the ecosystem, but can also harm it.

By highlighting diverse stories from the global network of developers, founders, and end-users, we can create an emotional and human record of Ethereum‚Äôs journey. From the inspiring Axie Infinity gamers in the Philippines supporting their families during COVID to the tireless developers making Proof of Stake possible, there already is a bountiful garden to explore. \n\nThirty years from now, when our children look back from a world powered by programmable blockchain technology, they will wonder who was behind it, what challenges they faced, and what sacrifices they made.

Where buying art, voting, fundraising, and even social media were not controlled by a central company or intermediary, but rather an open-source, community-run network where code runs without interference. In 2013 Vitalik Buterin, an 18-year-old Bitcoin enthusiast and writer proposed the tools to make that future possible. Less than a decade later, thousands of developers have contributed to building the Ethereum ecosystem: a technology that enables decentralized applications, including but not limited to money. For many, [Ethereum is building the internet of value](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-building-internet-of-value). \n\nBut as Ethereum grows in size and popularity, it faces mounting pressure from cutting-edge competitors, hype markets, and criticisms for its scalability and energy consumption. Spearheaded by a global team of researchers and developers, a push to upgrade the platform could address the criticisms and unlock the technology's full potential... or it could derail the still-budding $300 billion network. \n\nFollowing the high-stakes journey to upgrade the platform, ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN is a feature-length documentary film that explores the innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain, the die-hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik Buterin, whose vision for the internet has the potential to change the world.\n\n[](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/videos/vitalik-interview.mp4?controls=true)\n\n### The Infinite Garden\n\nIn this film, we approach Ethereum as an ‚Äúinfinite garden.‚Äù Instead of thinking of Ethereum as a machine controlled by a central brain, we see it as a decentralized ecosystem with soil, plants, and insects that need to be cared for in order to grow. \n\nThe idea of the infinite garden was conceptualized by Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. She was inspired by James P. Carse‚Äôs book *Finite and Infinite Games*. The following basic principles are at its core: \n\n- A finite game is played for the purpose of winning; An infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the play\n- The rules of finite games may not change; the rules of infinite games must change\n- Finite players play within boundaries; Infinite players play without boundaries\n- Finite players are serious; Infinite players are playful\n- Finite players play to win titles; Infinite players have nothing but their names\n- A finite player plays to be powerful; an infinite player plays with strength\n- Finite players are theatrical; infinite players are dramatic\n- A finite player consumes time; an infinite player generates time\n- The finite players aims to win eternal life; the infinite player aims for eternal birth\n\nThose who tend to the seeds they plant in the Ethereum garden can nurture and empower the ecosystem, but can also harm it. For a crypto culture to remain equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, it must be tended to carefully. ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN will introduce us to these early ‚Äúgardeners‚Äù of the platform as they face the mounting pressures and challenges of the growing ecosystem.\n\n### Director's Statement\n\nAs a kid, I grew up in a strictly open-source household.

Because the old  models of fundraising are lacking. Traditionally, crowdfunding campaigns are the only way young artists like us can bring our visions to life. Art is essential: bringing people meaning, comfort, and community. But with the current infrastructure, art can be really difficult to make and share with the world: we‚Äôre often forced to put a lot of our own money, hard work and time into projects without compensation. Often, we have to sign away ownership of our creative vision to companies that hold our art and our creative rights hostage. It goes both ways, too: fans are just fans, and donors don‚Äôt get much in return for their financial contribution.\n\n[The Dog Lover](crowdfund://0x0fbc61029D01fB6B52Bb8474879F4A00fF672D8C?version=tiered_1&network=mainnet&features=overview)\n\nWith this experiment in a crypto-funded model of filmmaking, we want to pave the way for change. We want models of direct ownership of art: a future where there is a real connection between artists and their fans. We want you to have a stake in *The Dog Lover*.

What personal price would you pay? Would you change yourself into someone ‚Äî or something ‚Äî other than who you are?\n\nThese are the questions *The Dog Lover* asks, and that our main character, Walter, must answer. \n\nWhen Walter‚Äôs wife‚Äôs beloved dog Max dies, her grief is crushing. Walter works hard to fill the aching void in her heart, but nothing seems to please her. Walter soon discovers that he can win Sarah‚Äôs love by acting like her dog. \n\nIt isn‚Äôt long before the couple begins to rekindle their romance through these strange circumstances. Things are looking up, until Walter realizes that this particular pathway to love is paved with all sorts of bizarre pitfalls. A little too bizarre, perhaps. It soon becomes clear to Walter that he must choose whether he‚Äôs willing to be his wife‚Äôs dog. \n\n*The Dog Lover* is a weird, offbeat story with elements of dark comedy and horror. But it also has an emotional core that is deeply relatable: at one point or another, we‚Äôve all had to decide if we‚Äôre going to be someone‚Äôs dog (so to speak) or risk loneliness. Needless to say, we don‚Äôt always make the right decision. \n\nThe trailer above is cut from footage from the original short we made together during our first year at the American Film Institute Conservatory. With this new version, we‚Äôre going to expand and perfect the story and utilize the skills we developed during our time at AFI. \n\n\n### MEET THE TEAM\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9ec11675-df2e-4bfb-a6e7-8c7e4e461309.jpeg?height=320&width=213)\n\n**DIRECTOR: ANNE-SOPHIE BINE**\nFrench and Polish background, Anne-Sophie Bine was raised in several different countries ‚Äî which may be why she speaks five languages.

It is 1 of 1 ü•∞\n\nVoice Models, in combination with machine learning technology, already allow for anyone to clone a voice to generate music and media, and the opportunities and complications inherent to these techniques will only intensify!\n\nThis development raises novel questions about voice ownership that I think can be addressed by DAO governance ü§ù\n\nI plan to decentralize access, decision making and profits made from my digital twin, Holly+ üë≠\n\nProfits made from the commercial usage of my digital likeness will be ingested by the DAO, who are able to vote on new tool creation, and approve official usage of my twin, Holly+ üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI will soon be launching a [Zora auction house](https://zora.co/zora/3099) to sell approved works made with my likeness üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è\n\n## Who am I?\n\nI'm an artist and composer üë©‚Äçüíª who has been working with machine learning for many years. My last album [PROTO(4AD,2019)](https://4ad.com/artists/122) was the first to utilize singing neural networks, and I completed my Doctorate at [Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/), where my research focus was on the interplay between machine learning and the voice, and the implications of this technology for IP and vocal sovereigntyüë©‚Äçüî¨\n\nSome AI models already know who I am! Here are some images spawned from my likeness using [OpenAI's CLIP model](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) ü§Ø\n\n![Latent Visions/VQGAN/CLIP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2d755ebb-b136-4e0b-bc47-f5cab587131a.JPG?height=352&width=640)\n![StyleGANxCLIP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3cfba721-440d-442b-9351-d3500c9548f6.PNG?height=1024&width=1024)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some links to find me online:\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Herndon) / [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@hollyherndon) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hollyherndon) / [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/holly_herndon/)\n\n## Holly+ Voice Tool\n\nThe first tool, a custom voice instrument and website by [Never Before Heard Sounds](https://heardsounds.com/), allows for anyone to upload polyphonic audio and receive a download of that music sung back in my distinctive processed voice. \n\nFurther tools are in development to allow for spoken and sung phrases, and image generation, to be released later this year.\n\nThere is an upload limit of 5 minutes for audio files ‚è≤Ô∏è\n\nWe do not retain a copy of any original audio uploaded to the tool, but we will archive copies of the output audio so you can share them!\n\nYou are free to use the material generated as you see fit, and accreditation is always appreciated! üòé\n\n## What is a Voice Model?\n\nA Voice Model is a deep neural network that can generate raw audio of an individual voice. The network is trained on recorded speech and singing from the target voice, and can be interacted with in various ways, from text-to-speech applications to more complex interactions such as audio style transfer, where audio from one voice can be converted to resemble the target voice, a kind of vocal puppetry ü§ñ\n\nThe recent introduction of projects like DeepMind‚Äôs [Wavenet](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio), Google‚Äôs [Tacotron](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) and others have advanced the field of voice generation sufficient to make me confident that generating convincing spoken and sung voices will soon become standard practice for artists and other creatives, as presaged by the popularity of celebrity vocal deep fakes already found all over YouTube.\n\nNot all vocal models are equal. While it may be possible to generate an approximation of a voice by training a neural network from freely available audio found online, the deeper and more detailed the model is, the wider the range of expression available to create with üñåÔ∏è\n\nWhile for the time being the perceived difference between a bootleg or official voice model may be quite small, as our ability to produce more detailed and convincing voice generation evolves, so too will the need for comprehensive, high fidelity vocal training data, as well as the urgency of discerning provenance.\n\nFor this reason I believe that there will be demand for official, high fidelity, vocal models of public figures, so why not experiment with my own? üó£Ô∏è\n\nThese models will guarantee the most realistic possible generated speech and song, and also provide a means for certifying officially approved usage of the voice in question.\n\nFidelity and range will be achieved by providing training input of the celebrity voice across different epochs of their lives, as a voice changes with the body, and also incorporate detailed aspects such as signature vocal habits and artificial effects ü•∏\n\n## Voice Model Rights\n\nExisting legal precedent protects public figures against artists or brands commercially appropriating their vocal likeness. There are two regularly cited cases arguing this point.\n\nFirst, in [Midler v. Ford Motor Co (1988)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midler_v._Ford_Motor_Co.), Bette Midler sued and won her case against Ford Motor Company, who had hired one of her backing singers to impersonate her delivery on her hit ‚ÄúDo You Want to Dance‚Äù after Midler herself had refused the offer. You can hear the original song [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGpwgSo3THE), and the convincing re-enactment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxShNrpdVRs) ü§î\n\nSecond, in [Waits v. Frito-Lay (1992)](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/communications/waits.html) , the artist Tom Waits sued and won a case against Frito-Lay for their vocal impersonation of him in a [Doritos radio commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNIJWCNEzTw). Significantly, the impersonation was not referencing a song he previously had any association with. This suggests that beyond practices of digital sampling of existing recordings or vocal reenactment of existing repertoire, ‚Äú[some stylistic aspects of the voice are definable, extractible, and defensible against unauthorized use under a right of publicity theory.](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=fclj)‚Äù\n\nWhile we are yet to see legal cases in relation to the commercial exploitation of a vocal likeness utilizing deep learning, these precedents suggest that public figures will retain exclusive rights to the exploitation of their vocal likeness for commercial purposes.\n\nWhile a public figure is protected from unlicensed commercial exploitation of their vocal likeness, there are also great benefits to offering the public open source access to a voice model under a [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). This license ensures that all derivative works created through experimentation in the voice would also be open source and not commercially exploitable üë©‚Äçüè´\n\nThrough providing artists and researchers access to the voice under these terms, it increases the likelihood of the voice‚Äôs prominence online, which in turn only contributes to the value of the original voice model itself.\n\nThis approach supports the ‚ÄúMy Collectible Ass‚Äù principle, advocated for by [ZORA](https://zora.co/) and originally proposed by theorist [McKenzie Wark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie_Wark). This principle states that the more prominent and visible/audible a work of art is, the more valuable the certified original becomes.\n\nOpen sourcing the voice model under a GPL license leaves open the possibility for its non commercial use, however only the owners and stewards of the voice model would be able to certify and profit from derivative works created from it, which feels fair ü§ù\n\n## Holly+ DAO\n\nDAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organization) stewardship of my voice model rights makes sense for many reasons.\n\nIt is an idea I have been interested in for a long time! [I dedicated a song to the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzP9IwznNuQ) on my album Platform(4AD,2015) üßÆ\n\nA DAO of stewards of the Holly+ voice model can vote on minting and certifying new works created from the voice model. As token holders, they are incentivized to only certify or license new works that contribute to the value of the voice, and do not dilute that value through the production of bad art or negative associations. Only a scarce number of official artworks will be minted using the voice model, and DAO token holders are entitled to a cut of profits from resales of those works in perpetuity ü§ù\n\n**The Holly+ model creates a virtuous cycle. I release tools to allow for the creative usage of my likeness, the best artworks and license opportunities are approved by DAO members, profit from those works will be shared amongst artists using the tools, DAO members, and a treasury to fund further development of the tools.** \n\nIn the event of my death, I feel more comfortable with distributed ownership of the rights to my voice model among a DAO of stewards who are invested in maintaining the value and reputation of my voice than the rights being passed down to someone less familiar with the values and standards associated with my work. There is precedent for music catalog rights being passed down to family estates whose best interest is in making as many short term gains from those rights as possible. My hope is that decentralizing decision making across a DAO of stewards will encourage a more delicate stewardship over those rights through debate and shared interest!\n\n## OpenLaw Tribute DAO Framework\n\nThe Holly+ DAO will make use of the [OpenLaw Tribute DAO framework](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts).

Where buying art, voting, fundraising, and even social media were not controlled by a central company or intermediary, but rather an open-source, community-run network where code runs without interference. In 2013 Vitalik Buterin, an 18-year-old Bitcoin enthusiast and writer proposed the tools to make that future possible. Less than a decade later, thousands of developers have contributed to building the Ethereum ecosystem: a technology that enables decentralized applications, including but not limited to money. For many, [Ethereum is building the internet of value](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-building-internet-of-value). \n\nBut as Ethereum grows in size and popularity, it faces mounting pressure from cutting-edge competitors, hype markets, and criticisms for its scalability and energy consumption. Spearheaded by a global team of researchers and developers, a push to upgrade the platform could address the criticisms and unlock the technology's full potential... or it could derail the still-budding $300 billion network. \n\nFollowing the high-stakes journey to upgrade the platform, ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN is a feature-length documentary film that explores the innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain, the die-hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik Buterin, whose vision for the internet has the potential to change the world.\n\n[](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/videos/vitalik-interview.mp4?controls=true)\n\n### The Infinite Garden\n\nIn this film, we approach Ethereum as an ‚Äúinfinite garden.‚Äù Instead of thinking of Ethereum as a machine controlled by a central brain, we see it as a decentralized ecosystem with soil, plants, and insects that need to be cared for in order to grow. \n\nThe idea of the infinite garden was conceptualized by Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. She was inspired by James P. Carse‚Äôs book *Finite and Infinite Games*. The following basic principles are at its core: \n\n- A finite game is played for the purpose of winning; An infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the play\n- The rules of finite games may not change; the rules of infinite games must change\n- Finite players play within boundaries; Infinite players play without boundaries\n- Finite players are serious; Infinite players are playful\n- Finite players play to win titles; Infinite players have nothing but their names\n- A finite player plays to be powerful; an infinite player plays with strength\n- Finite players are theatrical; infinite players are dramatic\n- A finite player consumes time; an infinite player generates time\n- The finite players aims to win eternal life; the infinite player aims for eternal birth\n\nThose who tend to the seeds they plant in the Ethereum garden can nurture and empower the ecosystem, but can also harm it. For a crypto culture to remain equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, it must be tended to carefully. ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN will introduce us to these early ‚Äúgardeners‚Äù of the platform as they face the mounting pressures and challenges of the growing ecosystem.\n\n### Director's Statement\n\nAs a kid, I grew up in a strictly open-source household. My dad‚Äôs radical adoration of Linux introduced me to the potential of community-led technology (and mind blowing internet [weirdness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5x5OXfe9KY)) before I was even in grade school. Today, I feel that same excitement my dad once felt, but for Ethereum and the unique community that powers it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4406f2a-503f-46ec-ba6b-89db89fdd8df.jpeg?height=2336&width=8742&size=large)\n\nMy hope is to make Ethereum accessible and understandable to the world. By highlighting diverse stories from the global network of developers, founders, and end-users, we can create an emotional and human record of Ethereum‚Äôs journey. From the inspiring Axie Infinity gamers in the Philippines supporting their families during COVID to the tireless developers making Proof of Stake possible, there already is a bountiful garden to explore. \n\nThirty years from now, when our children look back from a world powered by programmable blockchain technology, they will wonder who was behind it, what challenges they faced, and what sacrifices they made. Instead of boring them with scattered memories and poor explanations of the ‚Äú[Just Keep Chugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvr0xYeV94M)‚Äù meme, let's give them ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN.\n\n*-Zach Ingrasci, Director*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ed408928-e082-4606-ad6c-f393ec2fb501.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### Projected Timeline \n\n- Spring - Summer 2021: Development & Casting\n- Summer 2021- Winter 2022: Principle Photography \n- Spring 2022: Begin Edit\n- Summer 2022: Rough Cut\n- Fall 2022: Lock Picture\n- Winter 2023: Festival Premiere/ Release\n\n### A note from the NFT artist\n\n> This piece excites me because it's probably one of the first NFTs that also doubles as a movie poster and represents so much of what the community believes in. It reflects my interpretation of an \"infinite garden\" and uses a color palette that cross references the main illustration from the Ethereum website as well as my previous work. I find myself in a unique position standing at the intersection of NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi, and I definitely don't want to take this attention for granted. I feel a degree of responsibility to help spread awareness to these topics in a positive and eloquent way, and this documentary certainly is a step in that direction.\n\n*‚Äîpplpleasr, NFT Artist*\n\n**pplpleasr**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d694da66-57b2-4903-b109-6d654d6f9a76.jpeg?height=320&width=320)\n\n[pplpleasr](https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1) is a multidisciplinary artist based in NYC.

{"id": "VgewzCtdX5bW3hdfCmE6tcmXsX1c-g1ccpW4SdUDTJE", "title": "Welcome to the Creator DAO Revolution", "body": "As we move from Web2 to Web3, we‚Äôll see a shift toward a more creator-centric economy. In this ecosystem, creators will no longer sit at the bottom of the totem pole picking up scraps leftover by corporate giants but will instead be able to earn in full and instantaneously for their work. \n\nThe convergence of the creator economy and DAOs is where the magic happens. The decentralized, non-hierarchical structure of DAOs serves as a turbo boost to propel the creator economy (which is mostly theoretical right now) into reality.\n\n## The problem with the current (lack of) creator economy\n\nAfter I quit my job as an attorney to travel the world in 2017, I became a travel blogger and Instagram influencer to pay the bills while not having a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job. I got a nice camera, leveled up my photography skills, spent hours each day trying to build my social media following, and learned the latest marketing strategies for building an online following.\n\nI was creating content regularly, posting daily on social media and multiple times per week on my blog. I grew my following to over 15,000 monthly views on my blog and 20,000 Instagram followers, but it wasn‚Äôt enough. There were other travel bloggers and Instagram influencers with larger followings, and I wasn‚Äôt able to secure the largest brand deals because I didn‚Äôt have the largest following.\n\nDespite the struggle to monetize my content, I had a loyal and active audience. I received messages regularly from inspired fans and noticed a group of followers commenting on all of my posts.\n\nSo why did I have to rely on Instagram and other centralized platforms to decide whether my content was valuable when I already received validation that it is from my audience?\n\n## The creator economy of Web3\n\nThe creator economy of Web3 will revolutionize the way artists, musicians, and content creators have been monetizing their work for decades. Rather than relying on centralized platforms to pay them a fraction of what consumers are willing to pay, creators will get paid directly by their fans. That means creators will receive the full amount that consumers are willing to pay because intermediaries will no longer exist to take a cut of their profits.\n\nThis doesn‚Äôt mean that all of a sudden, creators will all become millionaires. On the contrary, competition will only become stiffer as more people discover the freedom that comes with being a creator. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important for creators to not only have opportunities to create for themselves and for their followers but also for decentralized projects and protocols that have larger and more reliable funding engines.\n\n## Creator economy, meet DAOs\n\nThis is where DAOs come in. A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a group of people who have a common mission and are governed by rules coded into a smart contract on the blockchain that all members of the DAO agree to. The founding members of a DAO decide on a set of rules to code into the smart contract that will govern the DAO, and anyone who joins the DAO after that agrees to abide by that set of rules. \n\nEach DAO is formed with a specific mission in mind, and that mission can vary widely. A DAO can be set up to fund proposals ([Moloch DAO](https://twitter.com/MolochDAO)), buy NFTs ([pleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO)), support communities ([Panvala](https://twitter.com/PanvalaHQ)), or just for fun ([pizzaDAO](https://twitter.com/pizza_dao)).\n\nOne type of DAO that hasn‚Äôt made a noticeable impact yet is the creator DAO. The intersection of the creator economy and DAOs has always felt natural and inevitable. DAOs democratize access to resources, pulling them away from the top of hierarchical structures and redistributing them amongst creators. Instead of the traditional model of \n\n> Stack resume with top credentials ‚Üí Get a job/income ‚Üí Contribute \n\nwhere most people can‚Äôt make it past the first step, DAOs allow creators to at least have some skin in the game by shifting the model to\n\n> Contribute ‚Üí Make money ‚Üí Contribute more ‚Üí Make more money\n\nCompetition amongst creators will remain strong, but this model at least gives creators an opportunity to compete - not just amongst themselves but against larger, more established entities. Creators will find more opportunities to work on interesting projects that were traditionally outsourced to agencies or built in house with full time staff. \n\n## Renaissance DAO\n\nThis shared mission to help Web2 creators make money in Web3 is what brought [Alex Yao](https://twitter.com/TheAlexYao) and I together during our time in the Gitcoin [KERNEL](https://twitter.com/KERNEL0x) fellowship. Together with a group of several others and led by Alex, we formed [Renaissance DAO](https://twitter.com/DAORenaissance), a community for content creators to learn about creating content for Web3 projects and, in turn, earn money (crypto) for their contributions.\n\nWe believe having a community like Renaissance DAO is important because each creator has a unique voice that will bring new audiences and perspectives to Web3. It also enables creators to work together, which allows them to do more than they could individually - and have more fun doing it.\n\nOur goal is to help solve for some of the common problems creators face in today‚Äôs economy, including:\n\n- The desire to do what they love but the inability to monetize their work\n- The procurement of a dedicated following but the inability to monetize that following\n- The need for freedom but the inability to earn a consistent income\n\nAs a member of Renaissance DAO, you will:\n\n- Learn how to create content in Web3\n- Match with Web3 projects and protocols to collaborate on paid work\n- Be part of a community of other Web3 creators\n- Earn tokens in proportion to the amount of content you create\n- Get access to exclusive community-only talks and events\n\nI‚Äôm excited to share more details about what we‚Äôve been working on with you shortly, and we‚Äôre launching a formal cohort-based application process soon, but in the meantime, feel free to tweet any questions you have to me at [@ddwchen](twitter.com/ddwchen). \n", "timestamp": 1626291424, "digest": "Y19OlShAGp8nf6t_Rngj9SuISGBIWfzHfa7j2_dWdF8", "contributor": "0xcEd09CCFc82b091195bdE04E6Cd65374518E7b95"}

It is 1 of 1 ü•∞\n\nVoice Models, in combination with machine learning technology, already allow for anyone to clone a voice to generate music and media, and the opportunities and complications inherent to these techniques will only intensify!\n\nThis development raises novel questions about voice ownership that I think can be addressed by DAO governance ü§ù\n\nI plan to decentralize access, decision making and profits made from my digital twin, Holly+ üë≠\n\nProfits made from the commercial usage of my digital likeness will be ingested by the DAO, who are able to vote on new tool creation, and approve official usage of my twin, Holly+ üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI will soon be launching a [Zora auction house](https://zora.co/zora/3099) to sell approved works made with my likeness üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è\n\n## Who am I?\n\nI'm an artist and composer üë©‚Äçüíª who has been working with machine learning for many years. My last album [PROTO(4AD,2019)](https://4ad.com/artists/122) was the first to utilize singing neural networks, and I completed my Doctorate at [Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/), where my research focus was on the interplay between machine learning and the voice, and the implications of this technology for IP and vocal sovereigntyüë©‚Äçüî¨\n\nSome AI models already know who I am! Here are some images spawned from my likeness using [OpenAI's CLIP model](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) ü§Ø\n\n![Latent Visions/VQGAN/CLIP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2d755ebb-b136-4e0b-bc47-f5cab587131a.JPG?height=352&width=640)\n![StyleGANxCLIP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3cfba721-440d-442b-9351-d3500c9548f6.PNG?height=1024&width=1024)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some links to find me online:\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Herndon) / [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@hollyherndon) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hollyherndon) / [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/holly_herndon/)\n\n## Holly+ Voice Tool\n\nThe first tool, a custom voice instrument and website by [Never Before Heard Sounds](https://heardsounds.com/), allows for anyone to upload polyphonic audio and receive a download of that music sung back in my distinctive processed voice. \n\nFurther tools are in development to allow for spoken and sung phrases, and image generation, to be released later this year.\n\nThere is an upload limit of 5 minutes for audio files ‚è≤Ô∏è\n\nWe do not retain a copy of any original audio uploaded to the tool, but we will archive copies of the output audio so you can share them!\n\nYou are free to use the material generated as you see fit, and accreditation is always appreciated! üòé\n\n## What is a Voice Model?\n\nA Voice Model is a deep neural network that can generate raw audio of an individual voice. The network is trained on recorded speech and singing from the target voice, and can be interacted with in various ways, from text-to-speech applications to more complex interactions such as audio style transfer, where audio from one voice can be converted to resemble the target voice, a kind of vocal puppetry ü§ñ\n\nThe recent introduction of projects like DeepMind‚Äôs [Wavenet](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio), Google‚Äôs [Tacotron](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) and others have advanced the field of voice generation sufficient to make me confident that generating convincing spoken and sung voices will soon become standard practice for artists and other creatives, as presaged by the popularity of celebrity vocal deep fakes already found all over YouTube.\n\nNot all vocal models are equal. While it may be possible to generate an approximation of a voice by training a neural network from freely available audio found online, the deeper and more detailed the model is, the wider the range of expression available to create with üñåÔ∏è\n\nWhile for the time being the perceived difference between a bootleg or official voice model may be quite small, as our ability to produce more detailed and convincing voice generation evolves, so too will the need for comprehensive, high fidelity vocal training data, as well as the urgency of discerning provenance.\n\nFor this reason I believe that there will be demand for official, high fidelity, vocal models of public figures, so why not experiment with my own? üó£Ô∏è\n\nThese models will guarantee the most realistic possible generated speech and song, and also provide a means for certifying officially approved usage of the voice in question.\n\nFidelity and range will be achieved by providing training input of the celebrity voice across different epochs of their lives, as a voice changes with the body, and also incorporate detailed aspects such as signature vocal habits and artificial effects ü•∏\n\n## Voice Model Rights\n\nExisting legal precedent protects public figures against artists or brands commercially appropriating their vocal likeness. There are two regularly cited cases arguing this point.\n\nFirst, in [Midler v. Ford Motor Co (1988)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midler_v._Ford_Motor_Co.), Bette Midler sued and won her case against Ford Motor Company, who had hired one of her backing singers to impersonate her delivery on her hit ‚ÄúDo You Want to Dance‚Äù after Midler herself had refused the offer. You can hear the original song [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGpwgSo3THE), and the convincing re-enactment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxShNrpdVRs) ü§î\n\nSecond, in [Waits v. Frito-Lay (1992)](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/communications/waits.html) , the artist Tom Waits sued and won a case against Frito-Lay for their vocal impersonation of him in a [Doritos radio commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNIJWCNEzTw). Significantly, the impersonation was not referencing a song he previously had any association with. This suggests that beyond practices of digital sampling of existing recordings or vocal reenactment of existing repertoire, ‚Äú[some stylistic aspects of the voice are definable, extractible, and defensible against unauthorized use under a right of publicity theory.](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=fclj)‚Äù\n\nWhile we are yet to see legal cases in relation to the commercial exploitation of a vocal likeness utilizing deep learning, these precedents suggest that public figures will retain exclusive rights to the exploitation of their vocal likeness for commercial purposes.\n\nWhile a public figure is protected from unlicensed commercial exploitation of their vocal likeness, there are also great benefits to offering the public open source access to a voice model under a [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). This license ensures that all derivative works created through experimentation in the voice would also be open source and not commercially exploitable üë©‚Äçüè´\n\nThrough providing artists and researchers access to the voice under these terms, it increases the likelihood of the voice‚Äôs prominence online, which in turn only contributes to the value of the original voice model itself.\n\nThis approach supports the ‚ÄúMy Collectible Ass‚Äù principle, advocated for by [ZORA](https://zora.co/) and originally proposed by theorist [McKenzie Wark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie_Wark). This principle states that the more prominent and visible/audible a work of art is, the more valuable the certified original becomes.\n\nOpen sourcing the voice model under a GPL license leaves open the possibility for its non commercial use, however only the owners and stewards of the voice model would be able to certify and profit from derivative works created from it, which feels fair ü§ù\n\n## Holly+ DAO\n\nDAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organization) stewardship of my voice model rights makes sense for many reasons.\n\nIt is an idea I have been interested in for a long time! [I dedicated a song to the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzP9IwznNuQ) on my album Platform(4AD,2015) üßÆ\n\nA DAO of stewards of the Holly+ voice model can vote on minting and certifying new works created from the voice model. As token holders, they are incentivized to only certify or license new works that contribute to the value of the voice, and do not dilute that value through the production of bad art or negative associations. Only a scarce number of official artworks will be minted using the voice model, and DAO token holders are entitled to a cut of profits from resales of those works in perpetuity ü§ù\n\n**The Holly+ model creates a virtuous cycle. I release tools to allow for the creative usage of my likeness, the best artworks and license opportunities are approved by DAO members, profit from those works will be shared amongst artists using the tools, DAO members, and a treasury to fund further development of the tools.** \n\nIn the event of my death, I feel more comfortable with distributed ownership of the rights to my voice model among a DAO of stewards who are invested in maintaining the value and reputation of my voice than the rights being passed down to someone less familiar with the values and standards associated with my work. There is precedent for music catalog rights being passed down to family estates whose best interest is in making as many short term gains from those rights as possible. My hope is that decentralizing decision making across a DAO of stewards will encourage a more delicate stewardship over those rights through debate and shared interest!\n\n## OpenLaw Tribute DAO Framework\n\nThe Holly+ DAO will make use of the [OpenLaw Tribute DAO framework](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts).

{"id": "Mpc6M89jBcNpc1e87-7PZelwtLFjZswYCT24tWgElWk", "title": "On utility and story-telling in a new public sphere", "body": "Music is one of the strongest forms of story-telling, it also has strong utility: it's useful in bringing people together; it's beneficial in its cathartic power; and it can be profitable for rightsholders. Music, however, rarely managed to put those two powers together to create massive value in a similar way to other art forms. Perhaps because of the fleeting nature of audio, or because of its ubiquity, what created value was rarely the music itself, but instead the future potential revenues associated with that music. \nIn a massive bird's eye view of the history of those potential revenue makers we went from a sheet music dominated pre-modern era into a 20th Century dominated by physical recordings followed by the current digital era. Among many other aspects, a part of that trajectory is a move from scarcity to ubiquity and a move from ownership to nonpossession. Music's inherent utility and story-telling abilities, however, position it perfectly to explore the value of NFTs and the underlying blockchain technologies. Moreover, those technologies allow musicians, fans, and organizers to create new forms of public sphere. In the thinking of philosopher **J√ºrgen Habermas**, a public sphere is a space where people convene to discuss and pinpoint problems and relate those to governments. The new, decentralized, public sphere brings the public and the government together into one group. \n\n## Stepping into the value proposition\nDuring the first real mainstream push for blockchains in 2017 **[Imogen Heap](https://hbr.org/2017/06/blockchain-could-help-musicians-make-money-again)** wrote for **HBR** that:\n> Blockchain has the potential to provide a more quick and seamless experience for anyone involved with creating or interacting with music. For example, listening to a song might automatically trigger an agreement for everyone involved in the journey of a song with anyone who wants to interact or do business with it ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs a fan, a DSP (digital service provider such as Spotify or iTunes), a radio station, or a film production crew.\nThis problem has not been solved yet, the black box persists even if there's been [some positive developments](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/03/18/a-necessary-legal-fight-collective-rights-management-and-allocation/) in fighting unassigned royalties. What's more, it's not actually artists like Imogen Heap, or Independent Management Entities like **Unison** who are currently getting the most success in breaking the black box, but investment funds like **Hipgnosis**. In their latest [annual report](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5937f2f1bebafb1297678ff8/t/60e2a296b958e2192c5d5a50/1625465502816/HSFL-AR21-web-.pdf) the company states that:\n> our copyright management that has identified historic registrations errors,break downsin income chains and unclaimed recordings, which when fixed will all create incremental revenue for the Company. For example, we have identified 76 million views of unclaimed/unmatched recordings of our Songs on YouTube in the month of January alone, which would represent a 36% uplift. \nOf course, Hipgnosis' copyright management has nothing to do with blockchain, let alone NFTs. However, the annual report also stipulates that the company currently explores this space including:\n> the potentially lucrative NFT landscape but also increased activity in the production and release of personalised digitally focused merchandise and collectibles utilising our copyrights which will lead to significant upside in revenues.\nIn other words they see two potential revenue streams:\n- On the one hand there's the 'simple' 1-of-1 NFT sale strategy\n- On the other hand, there's the utility aspect of NFTs in terms of new ways to present merch and to create collectibles out of the IP that Hipgnosis now owns\n\n## Pushing boundaries\nWhat's striking about the three options laid out above: copyright flows, 1-of-1 NFTs, and collectibles is that they barely touch upon the inherent power of story-telling and the utility of music. Let's see what happens when the focus does turn to those two elements and what kind of roadblocks appear. \n### Back to royalties\nConsidering the above argument by Imogen Heap and investment funds like Hipgnosis it makes sense to start with the utility or future royalties. There aren't many examples yet of NFT sales that included percentages of full claims of future royalties. And that's probably because most of the paperwork required still happens off-chain. That said, there's still a lot that can be utilized by including a royalty percentage not only of future sales of the NFT, but also of the song or album included with the NFT as well. Using the same kind of valuation process that a company like Hipgnosis uses it's possible to determine, for example, a baseline value to the NFT at first sale. \nThis, of course, is pure utility. To bring in the story-telling the artist or band involved will have to tap into their creativity. By asking 'why mint an NFT' and going beyond the financial imperatives and into the creative community the story-telling starts immediately. Who to work with? Why? Which audience to focus on? The superfans? With what goal? Etcetera and so on. Each of these questions comes with a story and all of them will be unique to the NFT, because the idea of the drop led to each connection and collaboration. \nPushing boundaries means hitting roadblocks. The most obvious one here being the fact that future royalties are not handled via blockchains yet, nor are smart contracts accepted yet in the world of [Collective Management Organizations](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/12/8/134). \nAnother roadblock comes in the form of Security Law. Basically, it's easier to sell a piece of art that might appreciate in value than it is to sell something that involves the direct promise of future revenues. To be on the safe side, it's better to dive into [this Security issue](https://dilendorf.com/resources/security-token-offerings-for-nfts.html) in advance. \nThe final roadblock leads neatly into the focus on community for my next point. It concerns the fact that not all marketplaces are capable of splitting revenues. **Mirror** is a great example of how splits can work, but for many marketplaces the primary focus is on one seller and one buyer. The music-focused NFT marketplace **[Foundation](https://foundation.app/)**, for example, only recently implemented splits, and for now they are limited to [three recipients](https://help.foundation.app/en/articles/5305276-how-can-i-create-a-split-on-foundation#:~:text=As%20a%20creator%20on%20Foundation,realized%20in%20the%20NFT%20space.&text=Click%20%22Create%22%20to%20mint%20an,add%20a%20title%20and%20description). \n### Towards community\nWhether it's bringing together a set of creatives in a [DAO](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/08/the-community-owned-rave-event-organisers-as-daos/) or engaging your fans with perks and surprises connected to [NFTs](https://www.rodg.io/) and [other tokens](https://www.coindesk.com/latest-music-act-to-launch-a-social-token-portugal-the-man) the community aspect drives a lot of boundary pushing within the blockchain and NFT spaces. A great example is **[Songcamp Elektra](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/)** of which [Bas is a part](https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2021/06/29/why-im-participating-in-songcamp-elektra-%e2%9a%a1%ef%b8%8f/). Another example comes through **Holly Herndon**, who just launched her **[Holly+](https://holly.plus/)** which is an instrument built from her voice. Moreover, she'll [govern her digital likeness](https://twitter.com/hollyherndon/status/1415321272653844488) through a DAO. Giving over your voice to bring together a community might be a step too far for a lot of artists, but it shows what's possible.\nTaking the notion of the superfan, NFTs can be used to create layers of status in fan communities. This stretches as far as **3LAU**'s [custom song](https://www.cultr.com/news/3lau-just-sold-his-ultraviolet-album-nfts-for-11-7-million/) to things like **Li Jin** (admittedly not a musician) recording [a podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPDlDuKG3vQ) together with the buyer of her first NFT. Another example is the sale of **Umek**'s [concert](https://djmag.com/news/umek-announces-world-s-first-live-performance-nft), which could be used by a fan to get him to play a set at their house, but could also be used to book him at a venue. With all of these examples, they only touch the surface of what's possible when it comes to community-driven NFTs. \nThis is where the Web3 notion of ownership comes in. Whereas before fans could set up their own fanclub anywhere they wanted, now it becomes possible to have a fan club that includes the artist and where both they and their fans govern the club together. In a decentralized public sphere, the artist becomes more than a musician. This isn't for all artists, nor should it be required. But for those artists who enjoy fostering a community with their fans, the promise of shared ownership and community-based decision making is easier to realise than ever. \nStory-telling then becomes a shared opportunity between artist and fans. Moreover, the primary utility of music is to bring people together, something exemplified in the emergence of DAOs. Looking at DAOs or other fan communities governed through NFTs and other tokens as new forms public sphere helps to define how they can operate. With Habermas, the public sphere mediated 'a public' to 'a government', whereas with a decentralized organization the public is also the government. And each step and decision that organization takes requires good story-telling in order to find agreement and continuity. \n\n## The role of artefacts lead back to story-telling\nGaming is ahead of music when it comes to the adoption of digital artefacts to enhance and display identity in online worlds, or metaverses. Music is catching up, for example through the **[Genies Universe](https://genies.com/)** or **WILSONN**'s [AR filter NFT](https://theindustryobserver.thebrag.com/wilsonns-nft-auctions-for-more-than-40000-usd/). But it's nowhere near the  potential of skins and items in games. The promise of NFTs for the metaverse is that it creates the building blocks for [the thriving economy needed to really make it the successor to the mobile internet](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/metaversepayments). The NFT allows its owner to give proof of provenance for the artefacts the NFT connects to. In other words it validates the story someone tries to tell within the public sphere. As music creators and fans continue to build, solidify, and expand communities, the public spheres they create will allow them to convene together and drive their creativity forward. Moreover, in convening publicly the community will hopefully create the story-driven social contexts for the utility of their creative visions.

Our community is full of thousands of smart, talented individuals looking to get hands-on experience working for a DAO.\n\nA common frustration we hear from many is how hard it is to ‚Äúbreak into‚Äù existing DAOs. There are hundreds of people who want to participate, but have yet to find their way into an operational role.\n\nSo we asked ourselves ‚Ä¶\n\nWhat if we used Mirror‚Äôs full set of creator empowering tools to launch a DAO that supports creative projects on Mirror, and gives individuals hands-on experience in building and operating a DAO?\n\nWell, today we‚Äôre excited to announce Mirror Club: a Grant Giving DAO designed to support creators and make it easy for individuals to gain valuable DAO experience.\n\n### Mirror Club starts now with the $mCLUB crowdfund.\n\nHere‚Äôs the game plan.\n\n- Backers can support the crowdfund with ETH in return for $mCLUB tokens.\n- $mCLUB tokens represent membership in Mirror Club.\n- The first feature of Mirror Club will be a tokenized Discord, gated by $mCLUB. Backers will immediately be able to access the Mirror Club section of the Seed Club Discord.\n- $mCLUB holders, with the support of Seed Club, will coordinate in the Discord to decide on a plan for governance and how to allocate the contributed funds.\n- 50% of $mCLUB supply will be held back to airdrop toon quality community members who'd like to participate but may not be able to back the project with ETH.\n- The crowdfund will target a fundraise of 25 ETH, which will be deposited into a multisig governed by the backers at mirror.club.eth\n\nSo what will the Mirror Club DAO do?\n\nThat‚Äôs really up to you.\n\nPerhaps the DAO becomes known for being the first backer of the most inspiring creative projects launching on Mirror. It might help recruit new creators into the Mirror ecosystem (and help them win a future $WRITE RACE), or help steward the development of new features, templates and modules. The DAO could even launch its own MediaDAO, funding its operations using NFTs and splits.\n\nThe future is up to $mCLUB holders.\n\n[Mirror Club](crowdfund://0x8Ac9077395b024Da617A9454B63F7cbd9e35F489?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=overview)\n\n[Mirror Club](crowdfund://0x8Ac9077395b024Da617A9454B63F7cbd9e35F489?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=backers)\n\n[Mirror Club](crowdfund://0x8Ac9077395b024Da617A9454B63F7cbd9e35F489?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=editions)\n\n[Hepburn](edition://0x92F424663F2E52DeDa4471D4560157eFEC7fAAd0?editionId=25&version=crowdfund_1)\n\n[Nietzsche](edition://0x92F424663F2E52DeDa4471D4560157eFEC7fAAd0?editionId=26&version=crowdfund_1)\n", "timestamp": 1626316576, "digest": "p0q6UuQYQHHvlBbcjqzpD0MC_t3R1DhO3cRZgWfbdDE", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}
