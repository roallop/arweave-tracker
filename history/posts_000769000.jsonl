With Liquidity Mining programs, contributors will earn money by pooling liquidity. Thanks to the Liquidity now available, the community will grow and work on more significant projects.\n\nLiquidity Mining Programs (LMP) are a fantastic tool to leverage a community. This essay aims to explain to a broader audience that might not be familiar with those concepts what Liquidity Mining programs are and how, as someone new in the Social Token space, you can help a community to grow while earning social tokens. Let's get into it 🔥\n\n## 1/ What is Liquidity?\n\nToday, many of the most famous decentralized communities have created a Token on a Fixed supply, which means they have made a known number of tokens since day one, and then reflected on how to allocate and distribute them.\n\nBuilding a Community Token on a Fixed supply is a perfect way to keep the total power over the distribution of the Token but comes at the cost of the inherent value of the Token. Indeed, on a Fixed supply, the Token has no inherent value, as no one has put money in it yet. You could have a million of a $NAME Token that you've just created that you couldn't buy any item in real life. **That's the reason why, at some point, communities are looking to add Liquidity**, **allowing anyone to buy the Token in exchange for some other cryptocurrencies that already have a monetary value.**\n\nBy allowing anyone to buy and sell the Token, the coin gains economic value, and community leaders can use this money to make the community grow. **Pooling liquidity is a good way for communities to leverage their early believers to crowdfund their projects and build a treasury for future needs.**\n\n![GlobalCoinResearch / Ethereum Pool on Uniswap.org](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc3a7750-8fa3-4441-bc97-224f07752668_2844x1388.png)\n\nGlobalCoinResearch / Ethereum Pool on Uniswap.org\n\nAt the very beginning, the main goal of a community leader is to gather a strong community toward a joint project and reward manually contributors that are early believers in the project. Community leaders have total power over the token distribution and can control each action taken for the community. **However, at a later stage, a community should decentralize the power and open its economy to more people interested in joining, allowing anyone to buy/sell the community Token.** By purchasing Tokens, buyers will become contributors and have voting power over future decisions, **making the community more decentralized**.\n\nTo summarize, in the first phase of a community, the only way to earn some of the Social Tokens is to contribute and be rewarded manually by community leaders who have access to the whole supply. However, in a later stage, community leaders should create a Liquidity pool and make available the community token in exchange for USD or other cryptocurrencies with monetary value to decentralize more the community and crowdfund future needs.\n\nAs we just saw, most communities need Liquidity at some point. But how do you find this Liquidity? How do you incentivize the early contributors of your community, those who earned a decent amount of Tokens, to provide Liquidity for the community? How do you convince them to deposit the Token on a decentralized exchange to provide Liquidity for the community?\n\nA solution that has shown its efficiency in the past is the Liquidity Mining Programs, and we're going to dig into this right now.\n\n## 2/ Liquidity Mining Programs\n\nLiquidity mining, also known as yield farming, provides Liquidity via cryptocurrencies to decentralized exchanges. It's the process of depositing or lending specified token assets to Provide Liquidity to the community's fund pool and obtain an income afterward.\n\nConcretely, pooling liquidity means creating a Pool, a place where people can make their Token and another one (bond) available for anyone wanting to buy it. When the LP is created, users can add the exact value of two Token (your Token + collateral, aka any other token) in a Pool and earn trading fees proportional to their share of the total Liquidity. **Put simply, these Liquidity providers facilitate trading by willing to buy or sell a particular asset at any given time, thereby providing Liquidity and enabling traders to trade without waiting for another buyer or seller to show up**.\n\nLiquidity Mining is the same concept that having a savings account and making interests. **When putting your money at the bank, you agree that bankers will play with your money in exchange for a specific interest rate. When pooling Liquidity on a decentralized exchange, you agree to automatically buy or sell a particular asset at any given time to help the project grow in exchange for a reward.** It is a powerful way of incentivizing users to hold on to their crypto holdings, as, in return for doing so, these users will receive staking rewards.\n\nTo make it more clear, here are the conditions of the Liquidity Mining Program created by [Forefront](https://forefront.market/), a thriving community with the goal of creating exclusive content and market insights on Social Tokens and DAOs:\n\n\"Forefront will allocate **20,000 FF** from the treasury for this program that will get distributed to FF/ETH Uniswap V2 liquidity providers over 60 days. The reward will be distributed proportionally to the amount of Liquidity each person provides. i.e. if you provide $4,000 worth of Liquidity ($2,000 FF & $2,000 ETH) and there is a total of $100k Liquidity in the FF-ETH pool for ten days, then you are entitled to 10% of the distribution over that period.\"\n\n![Forefront Liquidity Mining Campaign Landing Page](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0294c8f-030b-47c9-8728-66db756a1bd2_2838x1448.png)\n\nForefront Liquidity Mining Campaign Landing Page\n\nPooling Liquidity is expensive. As you have to bond your Token with another one that has monetary value, if you want to put $100K worth of your Token in a pool, you'll also have to deposit $100K worth of another token. By creating such a program and allocating a part of their treasury to reward contributors that would participate, Forefront's Leaders ensured to motivate enough people to pool Liquidity and leveraged the power of its community.\n\nWhile the monetary aspect is central in Liquidity Mining Programs and is often the main reason people agree to hold their token and pool Liquidity, there are many other advantages of creating and participating in such programs for contributors and Community leaders.\n\n## 3/ Use cases\n\nFor a community, Liquidity is essential. Indeed, with enough Liquidity, communities will:\n\n* **Start a gradual path to community ownership -** By allowing anyone to buy and sell the Token, more people will have the Token and have the voting power that comes with it. Liquidity is an excellent way to decentralize the decision power and a path to community Ownership. are now official community owners and govern the Braintrust network. You’re able to use your tokens to vote on key decisions and to control the future of the platform you make your living on.\n* **Be able to bootstrap the project -** With people exchanging other cryptocurrencies that have monetary value for the $NAME Token, community leaders have access to funds that they can use to fund new experiences and grow the community.\n* **Increase the transaction speed -** If Liquidity is low, there's a high probability that your orders will take a lot of time to be executed. On the other hand, with a lot of Liquidity, the processing of orders takes only a few seconds.\n* **Transaction depth -** Transaction depth is the degree of market price stability. The greater the depth, the less significant the impact of several transactions will be on the price. On the other hand, with low Liquidity, a single person can drop or bump the cost of your Token by buying or selling a significant amount.\n\nCreating Liquidity pools and Liquidity Mining programs are important milestones for every community as it comes with many advantages. But it's also highly interesting for contributors as it gives them more ownership over the project (Pool liquidity > earn tokens as a reward > more tokens = more voting power) and allow a broader and equal distribution of the Token. Liquidity Mining Programs lower barriers to entry and give any individual an equal chance of owning tokens. Contributors don't need to be accredited investors or have tons of money to invest in projects they like. They can earn a decent amount of Social Token by pooling Liquidity and claim the rewards.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLiquidity Mining is an excellent way for anyone to invest in promising communities and earn Social Tokens. Through Liquidity Mining Programs, community leaders ensure to have enough Liquidity to grow their project and start a gradual path to community ownership. Liquidity Mining Programs have shown their efficiency to align incentives and create a positive-sum game.\n\n\n---\n\n###### **Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en) and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/8jaQB5CZ) 🔥**\n\nThanks for being here!\n\n\n---\n\nFurther resources:\n\n* [Liquidity Mining: Explanation, Application, and Benefits](https://pixelplex.io/blog/what-is-liquidity-mining/)\n* [Liquidity Mining Program by Forefront](https://www.notion.so/Liquidity-Mining-Program-082d7044cac345a58243608fddefc05b)", "timestamp": 1631563077, "digest": "eq98gwQf8EF6hw4bhgp9NOjaIeyHktdUIJKuhFB22mI", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

{"id": "VPwlvRno-aSzGwUwDSMvoHjgR55iZqfBy5FxPAQWjZ4", "title": "The Myco Blueprint", "body": "Myco is a tool for bootstrapping abundance. It's an all-in-one platform for groups of people who have a shared set of goals and values— potential energy— to come together and convert that energy into real world action.\n\nOne of the central themes of Myco is **collective** **ownership**: the belief that the economic benefits which stem from work should be fairly shared among the group of people who contributed to its creation, in a way that promotes **sustainable, long-lasting relationships**.\n\nWhile this blueprint may be applied to many different forms of organizations, to begin we are focussing specifically on what we call **Digital Social Clubs**: communities of like minded individuals who gather together on the internet. Our goal is to enable these groups to be anything they want to be: a **co**mmunity, a **co**llective, a **co**op, a **co**mpany.\n\n### Launching a Co\n\nWhen people launch Co's on Myco, they create a new space within which a community can co-create valuable media together. Instead of us (the platform) retaining any economic rights over the media that users produce within their Co's, all of it is instead co-owned by the Co.\n\nTo achieve this, each Co is itself a company (technically a Nevada-based Series LLC), which is launched as part of every new community. These LLCs are sort of like sub-companies below our parent umbrella Myco Space LLC, which owns and operates the platform that powers these Co's. By wrapping all of the activity in an LLC structure, we ensure that **contributors are protected from individual liability resulting from the actions of the collective**.\n\n### Co Ownership\n\nEach Co is also launched with its own native **points** system, which represent an equal share of profit rights stemming from the Co's various activities. Co's may select to have point holders participate in votes for certain decisions, as needed, but points do not automatically confer decision making rights to their holders. They are purely used as a measurement of profit rights over the activities of the Co. Because point holders are legally entitled to any economic benefits resulting from the Co, the points may only be rewarded to people who meaningfully contribute to it, and **may not be sold freely on open markets**. All points and distributions are 100% transparent for all members, so everyone can verify that they aren’t being taken advantage of.\n\nCo's may reward their contributors with points based on the various roles or tasks that they fulfill. These points are minted on a continuous basis, exemplifying the continuous growing of the pie that occurs when communities **endure**, so that **fresh contributors are always earning a fair stake in the communities they're helping to sustain**. This continuous issuance provides communities with the flexibility they need to learn and grow, while also ensuring that individual contributors need to stick around if they want to retain a given percentage ownership stake in a Co. Unlike other forms of companies, we do not believe that digital communities should reward orders of magnitude more ownership to people who launch a community vs those who stick around. Communities aren't like technology companies; you can't just deploy them and forget about them. They are people businesses, and they require continuous nurturing in order to succeed. **We believe that the individuals who do this continuous nurturing should be fairly rewarded for it.**\n\nPoints are minted and distributed through a variety of methods: they’re distributed monthly to the individuals who inhabit different roles, on an ad-hoc basis to individuals who perform tasks, and automatically to the people who perform different actions within the Co itself. Points may also be tipped between members, and members may also be given a balance of points which must be rewarded to their peers. By bringing all of the Co's activities into one platform, it becomes even easier to distribute rewards in new and unique ways based on the needs of each Co.\n\n**By letting Co’s reward people with ownership points before they’ve made any money, groups can form and bootstrap value creation, powered by their shared belief that their project will succeed— a self-fulfilling prophesy of abundance.**\n\n### Co Roles\n\nEach Co has its own unique set of roles, which should be crafted based on the specific goals and activities of that group. By default, each Co comes with two basic roles: *Creators*, and *Members.* Each role comes with its own set of permissions within the Co (ie things that those individuals have control over), as well as a monthly salary of points that all individuals in that role will earn on a monthly basis. Although *Creators* will by default have all possible permissions in the Co that they launch, they are encouraged to create new roles and to confer new permissions onto them as their community grows. This allows *Creators* to have complete control over how centralized or distributed their decision making is, and more importantly, enables them evolve it over time as their Co grows in both membership and value.\n\nCo's may also designate various ways to decide who may hold various roles. They may choose to let anyone join and become a member, or they may require an application be submitted for approval by others within the Co. They may also choose to gate membership in the co based on holding various tokens off-platform, such as owning an NFT in a series, holding a sufficient number of ERC20 tokens, or via membership fees which individuals pay on a monthly basis. These roles are meant to be as flexible as each Co's *Creators* want them to be, and may also be used to define and reward activities that happen off-platform, in the real world.\n\n### Co Vault\n\nBecause each Co is a company, it is also able to do the primary thing that companies do: make money. Myco lets Co's earn money directly on the platform by charging membership fees, or selling products and services. All of the money that a Co earns on Myco automatically gets deposited into its Vault, and deposits can also be made for any money that’s earned off-platform, via traditional banking transfers or transfers of Ethereum-based tokens like ETH or stablecoins.\n\nOnce the Co pays for any costs or debts associated with their activities, they can distribute their profits back to their points-holders at the click of a button, thereby closing the value-creation loop, and directly rewarding the people who helped to build the Co. These profit distributions do not require individuals to sell their points, and are instead comparable to a dividend in traditional companies. This means that individuals can make money from being a part of these communities without having to relinquish the ownership share that they've earned.\n\nAs with the ownership points and roles, decision-making power over the Co's vault is controlled by a set of permissions which Creators can confer on any role they desire, including allowing members themselves to co-control the group's finances.\n\n### Co Conversations\n\nFinally, because these Co's are meant to initially be used for digital social clubs, they need a space where information can be shared, and relationships can be built. To that end, Myco provides each Co with its own Conversation space, which can be used for both synchronous and async communications. Without giving too much away, our first implementation of Conversations is a blend between Discord, Twitter, and Reddit, along with an ephemeral chat for live conversations only.\n\nWhile conversations initially supports only text-based media, Co's will also be able to communicate via audio and video channels as they please. Conversations can be gated based on various roles, or made public altogether, allowing them to produce valuable media that can be delivered to external subscribers.\n\n\n---\n\n## Case Studies\n\nTo illustrate Myco in action, here are some basic examples of Co's which are being built on Myco.\n\n### 1. An NFT-Gated Community\n\nLets imagine a world where you, an NFT artist and community builder, have launched a pfp series into the world. You've embedded your core values into the works, and you want to begin building a community with these NFTs as a focal point.\n\nSo, you join Myco, and launch a new Co for your community, with membership being gated via ownership of one of these NFTs. This new Co is independent from the group which initially launched the NFTs, and is meant to be the container for the new community itself, which is much larger in scope.\n\nThen, you begin inviting your community to join and participate in this new space, and **you begin rewarding your contributors with a piece of collective ownership in the community they're creating**. You quickly discover which individuals in the community want to be core contributors, and you promote them into new roles with specific responsibilities based on their individual strengths.\n\nAs your community grows and thrives, it's time for the group which initially launched the NFTs to reward the Co for building a useful community around the original project, and the group begins to pay the Co for running the community (which acts as a useful and valuable marketing arm for the original NFTs). These funds are deposited into the Co's vault, and are immediately distributed to the individuals who participated and stuck around, **closing the loop on NFT-community value creation.**\n\nWithin months, your original NFT project has grown from being just about simple NFT PFP's into something much larger: a fully fledged media company, that’s powered by a broad swath of individual contributors who co-own the venture. Soon this company begins to create value for people even outside of the community itself, and no longer relies on profit distributions from the initial NFT sale to pay contributors. **Just like that, a valuable and long-lasting company has been born, with its own value system and goals.**\n\n### 2. A Creator Fan Club\n\nLets imagine a world where you, a Creator, want to **convert your audience into a community**, where instead of them just engaging with *your* content, they begin engaging with each other about the various aspects of their existence that they have in common, the same aspects that initially attracted them to you. Maybe it's a video game you all play, a form of art you all produce, or a sport you all compete in. Maybe it's just your vibe.\n\nSo, you launch a Co on Myco, and begin inviting your biggest fans to join. You charge a membership fee, which helps to ensure that the people who join have something at stake, but it isn't so high that it stops your less-well-off fans from being able to participate as well. You set up automatic points rewards for the people who contribute to conversations and share interesting content, and you begin to see your super-fans revealing themselves as power-contributors.\n\nSoon, people aren't just joining the club to get access to you, they're joining to be part of a network, and for the content that *everyone* is producing. Now, you don’t have to feel bad stepping away from the creator hamster wheel, and **you can finally take a week off from posting content**, since you can trust that your co-contributors will keep things running in your absence. Go ahead, you’ve earned that trip to Greece!\n\nThen, as the Co begins to scale, you see brands reaching out for access to this community, and its most important members. Now your brand sponsorship deals aren't just about access to you, they're about access the entire group. **Instead of playing the creator economy as an individual, you've turned it into a team sport, where everyone can get a fair share of the spoils.**\n\n### 3. Making Money with Friends Online\n\nLets imagine a world where you, an individual who lives in the internet metaverse, has friends. Right now you all gather in a small chatroom to share alfa or news of the day, but you get the sense that it could be more than just a passive social experience for everyone. You ask yourself: **what would happen if your group chat was also a company?**\n\nSo, you launch a Co on Myco, and distribute ownership to your members. Maybe you even make everyone in the group a *Creator*, because everyone is equally important to whatever it is you might be doing, and the level of trust between you is high.\n\nThen, a few weeks later, someone in the chat gets a cool new idea for a small internet business that you all could spin up within a matter of days. Although most members contribute some ideas, only a few of you actually do the work to execute on the idea, so some new points are minted for those who do the work. You launch the project, and to your surprise — it actually makes money!\n\nSoon, your group chat has morphed into a sort of internet tribe, which is constantly scouting for new opportunities in the wild, and tackling bounties together.\n\nWhile these are just some of the examples of the types of groups which can use Myco, there is no limit to the various permutations of digital-native organizations that this powerful but simple platform can support.\n\n\n---\n\n## Platform Economics\n\nAs part of building Myco in a sustainable fashion, we are launching the project with a sustainable business model that **will never force us to coerce our users, sell their data, or push ads into THEIR spaces.**\n\nMyco makes money by charging a 10% royalty on all profits which the Co's distribute to their points-holders. This is the value we earn from being part automated community manager, part legal advisor, part accountant, and full-time technology provider. We invest time into every single Co that launches on our platform, and make ourselves available to advise you on how to best turn your goals and values into an actionable endeavor. This ownership stake (rather than a one-time-fee) reflects the long term orientation we have towards every single Co that builds on Myco— **we are in it for the long haul, and we only make money if you do too.**\n\nThis parent Myco Space LLC is also itself a Co on the platform, and every user of the platform is automatically a member. This means that Myco has its own points system, which confers the same economic benefits to its holders as the other Co's points do. These points are granted to users of the platform - both to individuals who contribute and use the platform's improvement and growth, as well as to the Co's themselves. **This means that half of the economic value which is generated from the Myco project will be shared among its users, and the other half will go to the company which helps to operate the platform.**\n\nTo build Myco, we've created two entities: Uni Uni Uni Inc (which is a Delaware C-corp), and Myco Space LLC (Myco) a Nevada-based LLC. Uni is the company which we work for, and the company which has received investments from third parties. This company provides a myriad of services to Myco, including building the platform, marketing it and building its community, and overseeing its operations initially. Over time, Myco will rely less and less on Uni, as it is progressively decentralized. In exchange for providing these services, Uni will get a 50% royalty of any profit which Myco earns.\n\nHere’s a diagram which illustrates this more clearly:\n\n![Myco's virtuous economic cycles ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/827614a3-2203-4e87-8454-f0b7f10c09e8.png?height=922&width=1168)\n\nWe made sure that this economic model reflects our core view that there should be no separation between Myco the platform, and the Co's which are built on top of it. While these communities have the latitude to act completely independently, they may also choose to align themselves closely with the Myco community and our core values around collective ownership and fair capitalism. We want to be co-builders of the projects you launch on Myco, and similarly we want you to be co-builders of the platform too. While we haven't started rewarding any of our Myco points to users or contributors yet, when we do so (retroactively) we will be taking into account the individuals and Co's which have been most crucial in our early days, helping to give us feedback on what they want the platform to do, and participating in the network before we've achieved critical mass.\n\n\n---\n\nWe built Myco with the hopes that it can serve as a Mycelial network for the humans which use it, providing a new substrate to efficiently transport information and nutrients between users, to help grow **new ecosystems of value**. We're the mycelium, you’re the mushrooms, but in the end we're all one anyway.\n\n\n---\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to what we’re building and resonated with this post, we’re actively recruiting new team members to help us build Myco (engineers, community builders, designers, and lawyers). If you want to join us, please send a resume to arya@myco.space, and tell us why you want to join us.\n\nWe are also actively recruiting the Co's which will be our earliest users, and will help us build this platform. Myco is far from perfect right now, and there's still lots of work to be done, so we want to be intentional about ensuring that the values of our early users are highly aligned with ours, as both co-owners and as the people who will help shape the platform itself. **If you are building a digital community and think you might want to use Myco, please email mark@myco.space and tell us a bit about your group and your plans for the future.**\n\nIf you're building a project or platform in this space that you think we can integrate with, please email arya@myco.space and tell us a bit about what you're up to — we're always looking for new ways to expand the mycelial network and integrate with existing bodies of work.\n\nFinally, if you’re just interested in joining Co’s on Myco and want to stay in the loop, you can [follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/mycodotspace) or [join our mailing list](https://myco.space).", "timestamp": 1631594500, "digest": "6UxMOPMAnCZr8XSkhIM2Xx47bZ7X5rColwpnwIDbx5s", "contributor": "0xbfDb50Dc66C8Df9fd9688D8fe5A0C34126427645"}

However, upon closer inspection, these myths are not monolithic; they culturally transform in their telling.

The key to their success perhaps lies in their composable “open source” plurality. In this light, if DAOs aim to be networks in which “collective memory freely circulates”, their tooling can learn from stories like the constellations that survive millennia ([1](https://blog.curvelabs.eu/ownership-in-cryptonetworks-96f13f4a113e)).\n\n## Unveiling Zodiac\n\nAfter 2016, *The DAO* gave rise to many decentralized governance platforms, each offering its own protocol for making decisions. In 2021, the ecosystem flourishes with hundreds of DAOs combining platforms, protocols, and tools. However, threads connecting this plug-and-play approach lacked an open standard until now. In our last post, we offered [a prehistory of DAOs](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q), but now we’ll share one of their futures.\n\nA composable design philosophy for DAOs, Zodiac is a collection of tools built according to an open standard. The Zodiac open standard enables DAOs to act more like constellations, connecting platforms, protocols, and chains, no longer confined to monolithic designs.\n\nIn other words: **Zodiac is the expansion pack for DAOs**.\n\n![Compose your myth.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7975a8e9-3e66-4eb9-bee9-d7822c05e064.png?height=1500&width=3000&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nZodiac launches today with four tools available through the **Zodiac App** on [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/). These are ***Exit, Bridge, and*** ***Delay***, which join ***Reality*** (formerly SafeSnap) in the Zodiac collection of tools.\n\nEach adheres to the Zodiac open standard consisting of Avatars, Modules, Modifiers, and Guards. The current Zodiac compliant collection of tools, soon to all be available through the Zodiac App, fully encompass:\n\n### Avatars\n\n* **[Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/)**: The most trusted platform for managing digital assets on Ethereum. Zodiac embraces Gnosis Safe as a powerful, extensible and programmable account standard. However, all Zodiac tools are framework agnostic, and they can be plugged into any programmable account that implements the [IAvatar](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac/blob/master/contracts/interfaces/IAvatar.sol) interface.\n\n### Modules\n\n* ***[Reality](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-reality/get-started)*** (formerly SafeSnap): This module allows on-chain execution based on the outcome of events reported by the [Reality.eth](https://reality.eth.link/) oracle. While built initially to execute Gnosis Safe transactions according to Snapshot proposals, this module is framework agnostic. It can enable proposal execution from just about anywhere. For example, it can bring Discord polls on-chain.\n* ***[Bridge](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-bridge/get-started)***: This module allows an address on one chain to control an avatar on another chain using an Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB). This enables a DAO on one chain to control assets and interact with systems like a Gnosis Safe on a different chain.\n* ***[Exit](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-exit/get-started)***: This module allows participants to redeem a designated token for a proportional share of an avatar's digital assets, similar to Moloch DAO's [rageQuit()](https://twitter.com/molochdao/status/1115451404242436098) function.\n* ***[Safe Minion](https://daohaus.substack.com/p/6991f40b-3931-47ff-bea3-fa6f9c365135)*** (developed by [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/)): This module allows Moloch DAOs to manage a Gnosis Safe’s digital assets based on the outcome of v2 Moloch DAO proposals. Safe Minion enables Moloch DAOs to control collections of NFTs, manage LP positions with AMMs, and initiate any other arbitrary interactions. Even more, it supports DAOs that begin as a Gnosis Safe to later delegate governance to a Moloch DAO.\n* ***[Seele](https://github.com/TokenWalk/Seele)*** (developed by [TokenWalk](https://www.tokenwalk.org/)): This module allows avatars to operate with trustless tokenized DeGov, similar to Compound or Gitcoin, with a time-boxed proposal core that can register swappable voting contracts. This enables DAOs to choose from various on-chain voting methods that best suit their needs.\n\n### Modifiers\n\n* ***[Delay](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-modifier-delay/get-started)***: This modifier allows avatars to enforce a time delay between when a module initiates a transaction and when it can be executed by an avatar.\n\n### Guards\n\n* ***[Scope](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-guard-scope)*:** This guard allows an avatar or module to limit the scope of the functions with which it can interact. This enables a DAO to define granular permissions for different control mechanisms.\n\nThe Zodiac collection of tools can be equipped by visiting the `APPS` page on a Gnosis Safe and navigating to the Zodiac App. The [Zodiac documentation](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac) offers tutorials on how to set up each using the Zodiac App, and the [Zodiac Github repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) offers technical tutorials on how to configure each using the CLI. Detailed developer resources on how to build your own Zodiac module, modifier, or guard will be available soon.\n\n![Zodiac App on Gnosis Safe](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac99b614-f6ce-428d-9dbc-eeea1b51dfd3.jpg?height=1069&width=1699&&&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nAnyone can contribute to the Zodiac compliant collection of tools by submitting a pull request on the [repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac). We look forward to sharing collaborations with partner organizations [dOrg](https://www.dorg.tech/#/), [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/), [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/), [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/), [yearn.finance,](https://yearn.finance/) [Friends with Benefits (FWB)](https://www.fwb.help/), [TokenWalk](https://www.tokenwalk.org), [PrimeDAO](https://www.prime.xyz/), [Raid Guild](https://www.raidguild.org/), [ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.com/), [SZNS](https://szns.io/), [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/), [Stakewise](https://stakewise.io/), [Colony](https://colony.io/), [DeepDAO](https://deepdao.io/#), [Moving Castles](https://trust.support/feed/moving-castles), [Other Internet](https://twitter.com/otherinternet__), and [Black Swan](https://trust.support/events/black-swan-panel). Even more, Zodiac works with the ecosystem to develop a **DAO Improvement Proposal (DIP)** process to establish standard practices, which can be discussed in the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq) #dao-improvement-proposals channel with the plans to move to a more public forum.\n\n## Songlines for Progressive Decentralization\n\nBecause of its composable design philosophy, Zodiac supports DAOs on the road to progressive decentralization. This philosophy decouples avatars from decision making, meaning that practices surrounding governance, membership, and treasury management can be customized independently of the affordances of any of the tools a DAO uses.\n\nFor example, let’s imagine a DAO on a common trajectory today. A DAO begins as a squad with an idea. They deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-signature account as their avatar to manage shared resources, and this Gnosis Safe has 4/6 signatures required to execute a transaction. While informal proposals through a group chat suffice initially, eventually their decisions as a squad become more substantial: they decide to launch a token to expand their project. In order to keep a formal record of their decisions, they create a Snapshot space for token voting, and their first vote includes who should be elected as signers on their Gnosis Safe. Using the Zodiac App, they also equip ***Exit***, so that anyone who holds their token can leave the organization with their proportional share of digital assets if they disagree with a decision.\n\nAs time goes on, their community grows rapidly, developing many centers of activity through their token-enabled Discord, and one central team managing their Gnosis Safe becomes less than ideal. They decide to use ***Reality***, allowing bothoff-chain Snapshot proposals and Discord polls to trigger on-chain Gnosis Safe transactions that anyone in the community can execute. To add extra security to this new practice, they enable ***Scope***, which restricts addresses their Gnosis Safe can call. After acclimating to using Snapshot and Gnosis Safe with the Zodiac mods ***Reality*** and ***Scope***, they choose to disable the Gnosis Safe signers, achieving decentralization of its core technical system managing resources.\n\n![Zodiac Songline for Progressive Decentralization](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/009969ed-4861-4b11-aa97-c0fd00c30cea.png?height=1724&width=3066&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nContinuing the example with a future scenario, eventually this DAO community would like more refined governance processes than token voting. They take an interest in [conviction voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475), in which members can continuously signal their preferences, and they decide to use an upcoming conviction voting app on the xDai network to save gas fees. Operating as a multichain DAO does not sacrifice composability, however, because they also enable ***Bridge***, which connects the conviction voting app deployed on the xDai network to their Gnosis Safe treasury deployed on Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nZodiac not only changes access to platforms, protocols, and tools, but bridges chains, organizations, and networks through DAO-to-DAO (D2D) collaboration mechanisms. We expect DAOs to grow across ecosystems, seeing the Zodiac open standard as their foundation.  Even more options for nuanced governance processes can be achieved with ***Seele***, which enables interchangeable voting strategies, meaning DAOs can coordinate multiple agile governance processes across teams, squads, and other DAOs participating in their network.\n\n[https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1392454358810472448](https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1392454358810472448)\n\nThe approach of DAOs embracing modular tools as their organization develops proves their most effective cultural pattern yet. DAOs can continue with their favorite platforms, which become newly composable through equipping Zodiac modules, modifiers, and guards. Like expansion packs for games that introduce new maps, loot, and storylines to existing worlds, Zodiac encourages a plug-and-play culture of modding. Participants can shape their *access to DAO tools*, foregrounding a way the web could still be.\n\n![The WHOLE EARTH CATALOG (1969) embraced access to tools. Perhaps in the decades since, tools have also gotten access to us.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5452304-de9d-4540-a31f-0f1bf38f7e47.png?height=800&width=1590)\n\n## The team behind Zodiac\n\nGnosis Guild is a society for interdependent software with the values of conviviality, co-ownership, and experimentation at its heart. Incubated by [Gnosis](https://gnosis.io/), we operate as a small team using the tools we build. The two co-founders of Gnosis Guild, [Auryn Macmillan](https://twitter.com/auryn_macmillan) and [Kei Kreutler](https://twitter.com/keikreutler), bring over ten years combined experience developing products for decentralized governance in the blockchain ecosystem. From closely observing the rise of Gnosis Safe, our awareness that the DAO technology stack lacked composability ignited the initiative for Zodiac.\n\nGnosis guild is a core contributor to Zodiac and a keeper of the open standard. True to its philosophy, however, Zodiac is open for participation. Anyone can contribute to the Zodiac compliant collection of tools by submitting a pull request on the [repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac). As an initial core contributor, Gnosis Guild approves which submissions comply with the standard. We embrace practices that will over time meaningfully distribute contribution, governance, and ownership of the value Zodiac produces, encouraging individuals, teams, and DAOs to participate. This includes the Zodiac design language, which consists of glyphs that can be recombined to create Zodiac icons.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/45a0e2a8-6c93-4a1c-967f-4e807480e7c2.png?height=1856&width=1920)\n\nDeveloped by [PROPS.SUPPLY](https://props.supply/), the design language represents the collection of tools according to the qualities, such as strength, magic, and dexterity, each tool affords an organization. Even more, DAOs can overlay these glyphs to represent the constitution of their organization as a badge. While still evolving, the release of the first version of the design language will coincide with a Gnosis Guild NFT drop.\n\n![Zodiac Delay Module composition](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2933d2c3-e87b-489a-94f1-802536dab760.png?height=1500&width=3000&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nThrough this design language, Zodiac seeks to decentralize not only its development but its vibe.\n\n## Bright Night Sky Ahead\n\nThe future of Zodiac is bright.\n\nThe tools launched today enhance existing practices in the DAO ecosystem, but the Zodiac roadmap aims to establish new practices in DAO-to-DAO collaboration mechanisms with a special focus on multichain governance. Upcoming Zodiac releases ​​include secret voting with zero knowledge proofs magic, message bridges between compatible networks, and web3 backends for your favorite virtual worlds. Like the glyphs that when co-present on star charts change their aspect, the Zodiac collection of tools are mods that support, expand, and transform how organizations operate.\n\nTo participate, join the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq) today.\n\n![Moonlit night by the sea, Lev Lagorio, 1886](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ff3c5bfc-e101-499b-a201-69e83e3d6094.jpeg?height=589&width=1000)\n\n*Use the Zodiac collection of tools today through the Zodiac App available on [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/).

This enables DAOs to choose from various on-chain voting methods that best suit their needs.\n\n### Modifiers\n\n* ***[Delay](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-modifier-delay/get-started)***: This modifier allows avatars to enforce a time delay between when a module initiates a transaction and when it can be executed by an avatar.\n\n### Guards\n\n* ***[Scope](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-guard-scope)*:** This guard allows an avatar or module to limit the scope of the functions with which it can interact. This enables a DAO to define granular permissions for different control mechanisms.\n\nThe Zodiac collection of tools can be equipped by visiting the `APPS` page on a Gnosis Safe and navigating to the Zodiac App. The [Zodiac documentation](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac) offers tutorials on how to set up each using the Zodiac App, and the [Zodiac Github repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) offers technical tutorials on how to configure each using the CLI. Detailed developer resources on how to build your own Zodiac module, modifier, or guard will be available soon.\n\n![Zodiac App on Gnosis Safe](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac99b614-f6ce-428d-9dbc-eeea1b51dfd3.jpg?height=1069&width=1699&&&&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nAnyone can contribute to the Zodiac compliant collection of tools by submitting a pull request on the [repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac). We look forward to sharing collaborations with partner organizations [dOrg](https://www.dorg.tech/#/), [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/), [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/), [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/), [yearn.finance,](https://yearn.finance/) [Friends with Benefits (FWB)](https://www.fwb.help/), [TokenWalk](https://www.tokenwalk.org), [PrimeDAO](https://www.prime.xyz/), [Raid Guild](https://www.raidguild.org/), [ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.com/), [SZNS](https://szns.io/), [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/), [Stakewise](https://stakewise.io/), [Colony](https://colony.io/), [DeepDAO](https://deepdao.io/#), [Moving Castles](https://trust.support/feed/moving-castles), [Other Internet](https://twitter.com/otherinternet__), and [Black Swan](https://trust.support/events/black-swan-panel). Even more, Zodiac works with the ecosystem to develop a **DAO Improvement Proposal (DIP)** process to establish standard practices, which can be discussed in the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq) #dao-improvement-proposals channel with the plans to move to a more public forum.\n\n## Songlines for Progressive Decentralization\n\nBecause of its composable design philosophy, Zodiac supports DAOs on the road to progressive decentralization. This philosophy decouples avatars from decision making, meaning that practices surrounding governance, membership, and treasury management can be customized independently of the affordances of any of the tools a DAO uses.\n\nFor example, let’s imagine a DAO on a common trajectory today. A DAO begins as a squad with an idea. They deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-signature account as their avatar to manage shared resources, and this Gnosis Safe has 4/6 signatures required to execute a transaction. While informal proposals through a group chat suffice initially, eventually their decisions as a squad become more substantial: they decide to launch a token to expand their project. In order to keep a formal record of their decisions, they create a Snapshot space for token voting, and their first vote includes who should be elected as signers on their Gnosis Safe. Using the Zodiac App, they also equip ***Exit***, so that anyone who holds their token can leave the organization with their proportional share of digital assets if they disagree with a decision.\n\nAs time goes on, their community grows rapidly, developing many centers of activity through their token-enabled Discord, and one central team managing their Gnosis Safe becomes less than ideal. They decide to use ***Reality***, allowing both off-chain Snapshot proposals and Discord polls to trigger on-chain Gnosis Safe transactions that anyone in the community can execute. To add extra security to this new practice, they enable ***Scope***, which restricts addresses their Gnosis Safe can call. After acclimating to using Snapshot and Gnosis Safe with the Zodiac mods ***Reality*** and ***Scope***, they choose to disable the Gnosis Safe signers, achieving decentralization of its core technical system managing resources.\n\n![Zodiac Songline for Progressive Decentralization](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/009969ed-4861-4b11-aa97-c0fd00c30cea.png?height=1724&width=3066&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nContinuing the example with a future scenario, eventually this DAO community would like more refined governance processes than token voting. They take an interest in [conviction voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475), in which members can continuously signal their preferences, and they decide to use an upcoming conviction voting app on the xDai network to save gas fees. Operating as a multichain DAO does not sacrifice composability, however, because they also enable ***Bridge***, which connects the conviction voting app deployed on the xDai network to their Gnosis Safe treasury deployed on Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nZodiac not only changes access to platforms, protocols, and tools, but bridges chains, organizations, and networks through DAO-to-DAO (D2D) collaboration mechanisms. We expect DAOs to grow across ecosystems, seeing the Zodiac open standard as their foundation.  Even more options for nuanced governance processes can be achieved with ***Seele***, which enables interchangeable voting strategies, meaning DAOs can coordinate multiple agile governance processes across teams, squads, and other DAOs participating in their network.\n\n[https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1392454358810472448](https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1392454358810472448)\n\nThe approach of DAOs embracing modular tools as their organization develops proves their most effective cultural pattern yet. DAOs can continue with their favorite platforms, which become newly composable through equipping Zodiac modules, modifiers, and guards. Like expansion packs for games that introduce new maps, loot, and storylines to existing worlds, Zodiac encourages a plug-and-play culture of modding. Participants can shape their *access to DAO tools*, foregrounding a way the web could still be.\n\n![The WHOLE EARTH CATALOG (1969) embraced access to tools.

Take, for instance, the stories we tell ourselves about the stars. The characters that accompany the constellations, like the Great Bear, the Bull, or the Seven Sisters, appear to pass singularly from one generation to the next. However, upon closer inspection, these myths are not monolithic; they culturally transform in their telling. Even more, these myths are not merely stories, they are also design systems supported by artefacts like glyphs, charts, and cards that carry their resemblance through time.\n\n![They are relational, rather than grand, narratives. Image: Final Fantasy Tactics by jekoln, 2009, https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197339-final-fantasy-tactics/map/6667-zodiac-compatibility-chart/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/806e7ed0-0a8e-4184-bdcb-cac808f3a7e5.png?height=780&width=1075)\n\nIn a sense, the artefacts that accompany constellations can be viewed as collections of tools to pass on their memory, which are consistently reincorporated into new settings, like in the Final Fantasy IX example above. The key to their success perhaps lies in their composable “open source” plurality. In this light, if DAOs aim to be networks in which “collective memory freely circulates”, their tooling can learn from stories like the constellations that survive millennia ([1](https://blog.curvelabs.eu/ownership-in-cryptonetworks-96f13f4a113e)).\n\n## Unveiling Zodiac\n\nAfter 2016, *The DAO* gave rise to many decentralized governance platforms, each offering its own protocol for making decisions. In 2021, the ecosystem flourishes with hundreds of DAOs combining platforms, protocols, and tools. However, threads connecting this plug-and-play approach lacked an open standard until now. In our last post, we offered [a prehistory of DAOs](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q), but now we’ll share one of their futures.\n\nA composable design philosophy for DAOs, Zodiac is a collection of tools built according to an open standard. The Zodiac open standard enables DAOs to act more like constellations, connecting platforms, protocols, and chains, no longer confined to monolithic designs.\n\nIn other words: **Zodiac is the expansion pack for DAOs**.\n\n![Compose your myth.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7975a8e9-3e66-4eb9-bee9-d7822c05e064.png?height=1500&width=3000&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nZodiac launches today with four tools available through the **Zodiac App** on [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/). These are ***Exit, Bridge, and*** ***Delay***, which join ***Reality*** (formerly SafeSnap) in the Zodiac collection of tools.\n\nEach adheres to the Zodiac open standard consisting of Avatars, Modules, Modifiers, and Guards. The current Zodiac compliant collection of tools, soon to all be available through the Zodiac App, fully encompass:\n\n### Avatars\n\n* **[Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/)**: The most trusted platform for managing digital assets on Ethereum. Zodiac embraces Gnosis Safe as a powerful, extensible and programmable account standard. However, all Zodiac tools are framework agnostic, and they can be plugged into any programmable account that implements the [IAvatar](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac/blob/master/contracts/interfaces/IAvatar.sol) interface.\n\n### Modules\n\n* ***[Reality](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-reality/get-started)*** (formerly SafeSnap): This module allows on-chain execution based on the outcome of events reported by the [Reality.eth](https://reality.eth.link/) oracle. While built initially to execute Gnosis Safe transactions according to Snapshot proposals, this module is framework agnostic. It can enable proposal execution from just about anywhere. For example, it can bring Discord polls on-chain.\n* ***[Bridge](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-bridge/get-started)***: This module allows an address on one chain to control an avatar on another chain using an Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB). This enables a DAO on one chain to control assets and interact with systems like a Gnosis Safe on a different chain.\n* ***[Exit](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-exit/get-started)***: This module allows participants to redeem a designated token for a proportional share of an avatar's digital assets, similar to Moloch DAO's [rageQuit()](https://twitter.com/molochdao/status/1115451404242436098) function.\n* ***[Safe Minion](https://daohaus.substack.com/p/6991f40b-3931-47ff-bea3-fa6f9c365135)*** (developed by [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/)): This module allows Moloch DAOs to manage a Gnosis Safe’s digital assets based on the outcome of v2 Moloch DAO proposals. Safe Minion enables Moloch DAOs to control collections of NFTs, manage LP positions with AMMs, and initiate any other arbitrary interactions. Even more, it supports DAOs that begin as a Gnosis Safe to later delegate governance to a Moloch DAO.\n* ***[Seele](https://github.com/TokenWalk/Seele)*** (developed by [TokenWalk](https://www.tokenwalk.org/)): This module allows avatars to operate with trustless tokenized DeGov, similar to Compound or Gitcoin, with a time-boxed proposal core that can register swappable voting contracts. This enables DAOs to choose from various on-chain voting methods that best suit their needs.\n\n### Modifiers\n\n* ***[Delay](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-modifier-delay/get-started)***: This modifier allows avatars to enforce a time delay between when a module initiates a transaction and when it can be executed by an avatar.\n\n### Guards\n\n* ***[Scope](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-guard-scope)*:** This guard allows an avatar or module to limit the scope of the functions with which it can interact. This enables a DAO to define granular permissions for different control mechanisms.\n\nThe Zodiac collection of tools can be equipped by visiting the `APPS` page on a Gnosis Safe and navigating to the Zodiac App. The [Zodiac documentation](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac) offers tutorials on how to set up each using the Zodiac App, and the [Zodiac Github repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) offers technical tutorials on how to configure each using the CLI.

{"id": "66ICH4O3q4R1bUz0S7I1eBbLChOtoiH6T9H_Y6FcPcM", "title": "Joining TCG Crypto", "body": "I am thrilled to share that I am joining the team at [TCG](https://tcg.co/), The Chernin Group, to focus on the firm’s investments at the intersection of consumer and crypto. I’ll be working closely with [Jarrod Dicker](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker), [Jake Smilovitz](https://twitter.com/jsmilovitz), [Jonathan Moore](https://twitter.com/jonmoore202), and the rest of the TCG team to support founders building in web3 at the earliest stages.\n\nI have always been deeply curious about the different ways we interact with technology. This informed my decision to study [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/about/whats-name) — a combination of philosophy, psychology, and computer science — at Stanford, and it led to my finding a voice as a consumer investor at both [Chapter One](https://www.chapterone.com/) and [Bessemer Venture Partners](https://www.bvp.com/). Over the past couple years, I’ve written extensively about ideas surrounding consumer technology and digital culture: specifically, I’ve spent time thinking about [curation](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/qvnNJhylZz-w6t4ubZzHfxd5gP17zDAXa6ruwOyO7sc), [decentralized communities](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/zqchiBQhWWS49gaabLU92-BUUwfBL5aHCtNT88VTI8o), and this concept of [modern friends](https://gaby.mirror.xyz/7nu_NnZCr02HEaK7nelnRzQncSCAU8lnKmqpz-bwytQ).\n\nMuch of the reason I spent so much time thinking about these ideas is because they affected me — like many of you — so personally. I got my first job in venture through a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1237057565898375169?s=20), and many of my closest friends today were originally just online friends through group chats and Zoom calls. I finally began to understand why people called the Internet [the great equalizer](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1996-10-20/the-internet-is-the-great-equalizer).\n\n> “If the use of virtual communities turns out to answer a deep and compelling need in people… today’s small online enclaves may grow into much larger networks over the next twenty years.”\n>\n> *— Howard Rheingold, [A Slice of Life in My Virtual Community](http://cyborganthropology.com/A_Slice_of_Life_in_My_Virtual_Community) (1992)*\n\nBut although I’ve experienced so much positivity in my life through the Internet, I’ve also grown dissatisfied with the platforms that have been built on it and reached scale. In my view, the first wave of true social apps — Myspace, Facebook, even Instagram — was all about bringing *real-life experiences* online. Myspace and Facebook were about connecting with your *real-life* friends. Instagram was about sharing *real-life* photos. For those use cases, these platforms worked just fine. The problem is that over the last decade, as we’ve spent more and more time on the Internet, we no longer have just “real-life experiences.” We have *digital* experiences, too — a lot of them. We make online friends. We follow influencers. We support [creators](https://signalfire.com/blog/creator-economy/). We watch livestreams. We take [screenshots](https://medium.com/@alex_37564/on-life-lived-online-a81b4e4562ae). We buy digital art. **The way we interact online has fundamentally shifted, and we’re only getting started.**\n\n[https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1435974534918594562?s=20](https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1435974534918594562?s=20)\n\nThe web was created in 1989 with the vision of a decentralized and open network of information and data where users, *not* centralized platforms, were in control. During this first era of the Internet, we saw the emergence of companies like Google, Yahoo, and Amazon. Over the next couple decades (essentially, until the present), as these platforms reached scale, consumers [migrated from open services to these more sophisticated, centralized ones](https://onezero.medium.com/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e). This was good, because it made true the Internet’s goal of providing billions of people access to various technologies. But it also limited our ability to be innovative and dynamic, because it became harder for individuals and groups to create things online without concern of centralized platforms taking control. This is still a problem we see today — one poignant example is Apple taking a 30% commission of all revenues from apps on its App Store. [This thread](https://twitter.com/jasminericegirl/status/1403022286014365697?s=20) from the co-founder of [Fanhouse](https://fanhouse.app/), a tool for creators, helps to illuminate what this actually means for new technologies and the people who use them.\n\nMy view, and the view of many in this space, is that web3 will inspire us to return back to the original values of what the Internet should be: decentralized, community-governed, efficient, innovative, accessible, and wildly dynamic. Crypto networks provide us with a cooperative economic model that ensures incentive alignment between platforms and users over time. When users are truly aligned with platforms, the platforms become larger and more resilient, and the users become more incentivized to innovate and create new technology. It is difficult to overstate the impact digital ownership will have online. Of course, too, it is difficult to comprehend in its early stage. But we are moving towards an entirely new economy built on the foundation of what consumers need. **The next era of the Internet, web3, will be defined by software that is not just architected, operated, moderated, and funded by users — but collectively owned by them, too.**\n\n\n---\n\nThe best way to learn about anything is by jumping in, living there, and [getting up to your elbows](http://cyborganthropology.com/A_Slice_of_Life_in_My_Virtual_Community) in all that thing has to offer. I am fortunate to have spent significant time over the past few months in various communities and with some of my brightest, most inspiring friends talking about these different ideas. But it’s hard to be a tourist in this ecosystem, and I am ready now to jump all the way in.\n\nI hope to help make TCG Crypto the center of gravity for young, forward-thinking founders building world-changing consumer products in crypto. If you are building something or otherwise spending time in the space, please [reach out](https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg)! I would love to start the conversation.\n\n\n---\n\nNow comes the part where I talk about the personal stuff. I am early in my career. There are a lot of unknowns, and there will be a lot more unknowns to come. But the one thing that has stayed the same through it all has been my passion for telling stories.\n\nFor five years of my young life, I grew up [selectively mute](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/selective-mutism/#:\\~:text=Selective%20mutism%20is%20a%20severe,untreated%2C%20can%20persist%20into%20adulthood.). Aside from my parents and two brothers, I avoided conversation with anyone around me. For that time, my coping mechanism was stories (I read… a lot) and storytelling (I wrote… a lot). Since then, I’ve grown up and found my voice, but my passion for telling stories never went away.\n\nNow, as an adult, I’ve found that capital — venture capital, specifically — is a great way to both tell stories and empower the stories of others. My work as an investor brings me energy and leaves me so incredibly fulfilled. As our lives increasingly migrate onto the Internet, we will continue to ask ourselves questions surrounding identity and community. *When we look in the mirror in the metaverse, what do we look like? Who are we, and what do we stand for?* By uplifting the most important, most authentic stories, I hope to help us answer these questions, and continue asking the ones we haven’t quite gotten to yet. It is nothing short of an honor to join this ecosystem and help push forward the next frontier of consumer software.\n\nThe last thing I’ll say in this personal manifesto of sorts (thank you, if you’ve gotten this far) is that I’ve always believed luck is like a moving car. You don’t get to choose when the car comes, or how fast it’s coming at you, but you *do* get to decide if you want to jump in.\n\nFor many of us, web3 feels like a moving car. Today, alongside the incredible team at TCG, I am jumping in. I am so grateful, and so very excited for the ride.\n\n\n---\n\n*I am so fortunate to have so many incredible people in my corner, who have supported me in many different ways along my journey. There is no way I can thank them all — but I particularly want to thank my mentors [Talia Goldberg](https://twitter.com/taliagold) and [Jeff Morris, Jr.](https://twitter.com/jmj), along with my modern friends — too many to list here, but all wonderful people I am lucky to know — and my family for their continued support.*\n\n*If you are a young person thinking about making a career change or otherwise curious about web3, please reach out! My DMs are open and I would love to chat.*\n\n*To learn more about web3, I update [this reading list](https://gabygoldberg.notion.site/f7050e62461143d49345e7b46eb5576b?v=c02511c4230c44ce9a1a03c9757da524) on a regular basis.*\n\n*Lastly, thank you to my dear friend [Bobby](https://twitter.com/BobbyThakkar) for this post’s cover art.*", "timestamp": 1631635100, "digest": "sXs9qaL44Cf5x3cAJ2ZXWOqoKJ8BRvHoH37-W6rwlDU", "contributor": "0x01b7baA7baA864fEF3CD1C7bc118Cc97cEdCB33f"}

The ALGS year after year has built one of the largest purses of tournament earnings with 2021-22 season at $5m in total prizes.*\n\n**Player + Coaching Goals**\n\nOur goal is to recruit a 5 person team for Arenas to compete in ALGS Season 3. For the combine, the top three candidates will be offered primary placement with candidates 4 + 5 offered secondary roles. In addition to players, we will be looking for a coach, gameplay analyst, and broadcaster/host to commentate our games.\n\n### Halo Infinite\n\n*Halo. The staple. The game that the core inceptors of BLVKHVND had played when they competed seriously.

In addition to players, we will be looking for a coach, gameplay analyst, and broadcaster/host to commentate our games.\n\n### Axie Infinity\n\n*Axie Infinity has continued to prove that it is one of the most impactful and expansive titles in the crypto-gaming space and has the potential to become a prolific eSports phenomenon. At BLVKHVND we see a cross-pollination of our players building comp teams, developing content around mechanics, metas, breeding, as well as contributing to building a dynamic eSports Axie league within North America.*\n\n**Player + Coaching Goals**\n\nOur goal is to recruit a 3 person team to compete in Arena for Axie Infinity.

Parallel can become a TCG titan with an expansive league for competitive play, amateur appeal, casual play while inventing new mechanics for trading cards we haven’t seen yet.

So our fifth game for next year’s competitive season will be chosen by HVND members! In the coming weeks before the Combine Event, we will gather the best proposals and vote on them using Snapshot to build a team to compete.

For us, serving casual, amateur, and pro-level players is no easy task, but one we are eager to tackle. Our focus will be recruiting for enthusiastic, coachable players that have the propensity to learn and experiment with their gameplay. Knowledge and experience of the game titles a player is interested in forming a team is important as is some level of competitive experience.\n\nAll players that do get accepted into our Pro and Amateur programs as well as coaching staff will receive compensation. These positions require hard work, dedication, and immense collaboration. We are a unit that serves the community as a beacon to break barriers and boundaries within competitive sport.

Take, for instance, the stories we tell ourselves about the stars. The characters that accompany the constellations, like the Great Bear, the Bull, or the Seven Sisters, appear to pass singularly from one generation to the next. However, upon closer inspection, these myths are not monolithic; they culturally transform in their telling. Even more, these myths are not merely stories, they are also design systems supported by artefacts like glyphs, charts, and cards that carry their resemblance through time.\n\n![They are relational, rather than grand, narratives. Image: Final Fantasy Tactics by jekoln, 2009, https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197339-final-fantasy-tactics/map/6667-zodiac-compatibility-chart/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/806e7ed0-0a8e-4184-bdcb-cac808f3a7e5.png?height=780&width=1075)\n\nIn a sense, the artefacts that accompany constellations can be viewed as collections of tools to pass on their memory, which are consistently reincorporated into new settings, like in the Final Fantasy IX example above. The key to their success perhaps lies in their composable “open source” plurality. In this light, if DAOs aim to be networks in which “collective memory freely circulates”, their tooling can learn from stories like the constellations that survive millennia ([1](https://blog.curvelabs.eu/ownership-in-cryptonetworks-96f13f4a113e)).\n\n## Unveiling Zodiac\n\nAfter 2016, *The DAO* gave rise to many decentralized governance platforms, each offering its own protocol for making decisions. In 2021, the ecosystem flourishes with hundreds of DAOs combining platforms, protocols, and tools. However, threads connecting this plug-and-play approach lacked an open standard until now. In our last post, we offered [a prehistory of DAOs](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q), but now we’ll share one of their futures.\n\nA composable design philosophy for DAOs, Zodiac is a collection of tools built according to an open standard. The Zodiac open standard enables DAOs to act more like constellations, connecting platforms, protocols, and chains, no longer confined to monolithic designs.\n\nIn other words: **Zodiac is the expansion pack for DAOs**.\n\n![Compose your myth.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7975a8e9-3e66-4eb9-bee9-d7822c05e064.png?height=1500&width=3000&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nZodiac launches today with four tools available through the **Zodiac App** on [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/). These are ***Exit, Bridge, and*** ***Delay***, which join ***Reality*** (formerly SafeSnap) in the Zodiac collection of tools.\n\nEach adheres to the Zodiac open standard consisting of Avatars, Modules, Modifiers, and Guards. The current Zodiac compliant collection of tools, soon to all be available through the Zodiac App, fully encompass:\n\n### Avatars\n\n* **[Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/)**: The most trusted platform for managing digital assets on Ethereum. Zodiac embraces Gnosis Safe as a powerful, extensible and programmable account standard. However, all Zodiac tools are framework agnostic, and they can be plugged into any programmable account that implements the [IAvatar](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac/blob/master/contracts/interfaces/IAvatar.sol) interface.\n\n### Modules\n\n* ***[Reality](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-reality/get-started)*** (formerly SafeSnap): This module allows on-chain execution based on the outcome of events reported by the [Reality.eth](https://reality.eth.link/) oracle. While built initially to execute Gnosis Safe transactions according to Snapshot proposals, this module is framework agnostic. It can enable proposal execution from just about anywhere. For example, it can bring Discord polls on-chain.\n* ***[Bridge](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-bridge/get-started)***: This module allows an address on one chain to control an avatar on another chain using an Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB). This enables a DAO on one chain to control assets and interact with systems like a Gnosis Safe on a different chain.\n* ***[Exit](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-exit/get-started)***: This module allows participants to redeem a designated token for a proportional share of an avatar's digital assets, similar to Moloch DAO's [rageQuit()](https://twitter.com/molochdao/status/1115451404242436098) function.\n* ***[Safe Minion](https://daohaus.substack.com/p/6991f40b-3931-47ff-bea3-fa6f9c365135)*** (developed by [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/)): This module allows Moloch DAOs to manage a Gnosis Safe’s digital assets based on the outcome of v2 Moloch DAO proposals. Safe Minion enables Moloch DAOs to control collections of NFTs, manage LP positions with AMMs, and initiate any other arbitrary interactions. Even more, it supports DAOs that begin as a Gnosis Safe to later delegate governance to a Moloch DAO.\n* ***[Seele](https://github.com/TokenWalk/Seele)*** (developed by [TokenWalk](https://www.tokenwalk.org/)): This module allows avatars to operate with trustless tokenized DeGov, similar to Compound or Gitcoin, with a time-boxed proposal core that can register swappable voting contracts. This enables DAOs to choose from various on-chain voting methods that best suit their needs.\n\n### Modifiers\n\n* ***[Delay](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-modifier-delay/get-started)***: This modifier allows avatars to enforce a time delay between when a module initiates a transaction and when it can be executed by an avatar.\n\n### Guards\n\n* ***[Scope](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-guard-scope)*:** This guard allows an avatar or module to limit the scope of the functions with which it can interact. This enables a DAO to define granular permissions for different control mechanisms.\n\nThe Zodiac collection of tools can be equipped by visiting the `APPS` page on a Gnosis Safe and navigating to the Zodiac App. The [Zodiac documentation](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac) offers tutorials on how to set up each using the Zodiac App, and the [Zodiac Github repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) offers technical tutorials on how to configure each using the CLI. Detailed developer resources on how to build your own Zodiac module, modifier, or guard will be available soon.\n\n![Zodiac App on Gnosis Safe](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac99b614-f6ce-428d-9dbc-eeea1b51dfd3.jpg?height=1069&width=1699&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nAnyone can contribute to the Zodiac compliant collection of tools by submitting a pull request on the [repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac). We look forward to sharing collaborations with partner organizations [dOrg](https://www.dorg.tech/#/), [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/), [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/), [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/), [yearn.finance,](https://yearn.finance/) [Friends with Benefits (FWB)](https://www.fwb.help/), [TokenWalk](https://www.tokenwalk.org), [PrimeDAO](https://www.prime.xyz/), [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/mission), [Raid Guild](https://www.raidguild.org/), [ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.com/), [SZNS](https://szns.io/), [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/), [Stakewise](https://stakewise.io/), [Colony](https://colony.io/), [DeepDAO](https://deepdao.io/#), [Moving Castles](https://trust.support/feed/moving-castles), [Other Internet](https://twitter.com/otherinternet__), and [Black Swan](https://trust.support/events/black-swan-panel). Even more, Zodiac works with the ecosystem to develop a **DAO Improvement Proposal (DIP)** process to establish standard practices, which can be discussed in the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq) #dao-improvement-proposals channel with the plans to move to a more public forum.\n\n## Songlines for Progressive Decentralization\n\nBecause of its composable design philosophy, Zodiac supports DAOs on the road to progressive decentralization. This philosophy decouples avatars from decision making, meaning that practices surrounding governance, membership, and treasury management can be customized independently of the affordances of any of the tools a DAO uses.\n\nFor example, let’s imagine a DAO on a common trajectory today. A DAO begins as a squad with an idea. They deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-signature account as their avatar to manage shared resources, and this Gnosis Safe has 4/6 signatures required to execute a transaction. While informal proposals through a group chat suffice initially, eventually their decisions as a squad become more substantial: they decide to launch a token to expand their project. In order to keep a formal record of their decisions, they create a Snapshot space for token voting, and their first vote includes who should be elected as signers on their Gnosis Safe. Using the Zodiac App, they also equip ***Exit***, so that anyone who holds their token can leave the organization with their proportional share of digital assets if they disagree with a decision.\n\nAs time goes on, their community grows rapidly, developing many centers of activity through their token-enabled Discord, and one central team managing their Gnosis Safe becomes less than ideal. They decide to use ***Reality***, allowing both off-chain Snapshot proposals and Discord polls to trigger on-chain Gnosis Safe transactions that anyone in the community can execute. To add extra security to this new practice, they enable ***Scope***, which restricts addresses their Gnosis Safe can call. After acclimating to using Snapshot and Gnosis Safe with the Zodiac mods ***Reality*** and ***Scope***, they choose to disable the Gnosis Safe signers, achieving decentralization of its core technical system managing resources.\n\n![Zodiac Songline for Progressive Decentralization](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/009969ed-4861-4b11-aa97-c0fd00c30cea.png?height=1724&width=3066&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nContinuing the example with a future scenario, eventually this DAO community would like more refined governance processes than token voting. They take an interest in [conviction voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475), in which members can continuously signal their preferences, and they decide to use an upcoming conviction voting app on the xDai network to save gas fees. Operating as a multichain DAO does not sacrifice composability, however, because they also enable ***Bridge***, which connects the conviction voting app deployed on the xDai network to their Gnosis Safe treasury deployed on Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nZodiac not only changes access to platforms, protocols, and tools, but bridges chains, organizations, and networks through DAO-to-DAO (D2D) collaboration mechanisms. We expect DAOs to grow across ecosystems, seeing the Zodiac open standard as their foundation.  Even more options for nuanced governance processes can be achieved with ***Seele***, which enables interchangeable voting strategies, meaning DAOs can coordinate multiple agile governance processes across teams, squads, and other DAOs participating in their network.\n\n[https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1392454358810472448](https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1392454358810472448)\n\nThe approach of DAOs embracing modular tools as their organization develops proves their most effective cultural pattern yet. DAOs can continue with their favorite platforms, which become newly composable through equipping Zodiac modules, modifiers, and guards. Like expansion packs for games that introduce new maps, loot, and storylines to existing worlds, Zodiac encourages a plug-and-play culture of modding. Participants can shape their *access to DAO tools*, foregrounding a way the web could still be.\n\n![The WHOLE EARTH CATALOG (1969) embraced access to tools. Perhaps in the decades since, tools have also gotten access to us.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5452304-de9d-4540-a31f-0f1bf38f7e47.png?height=800&width=1590)\n\n## The team behind Zodiac\n\nGnosis Guild is a society for interdependent software with the values of conviviality, co-ownership, and experimentation at its heart. Incubated by [Gnosis](https://gnosis.io/), we operate as a small team using the tools we build. The two co-founders of Gnosis Guild, [Auryn Macmillan](https://twitter.com/auryn_macmillan) and [Kei Kreutler](https://twitter.com/keikreutler), bring over ten years combined experience developing products for decentralized governance in the blockchain ecosystem. From closely observing the rise of Gnosis Safe, our awareness that the DAO technology stack lacked composability ignited the initiative for Zodiac.\n\nGnosis guild is a core contributor to Zodiac and a keeper of the open standard. True to its philosophy, however, Zodiac is open for participation. Anyone can contribute to the Zodiac compliant collection of tools by submitting a pull request on the [repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac). As an initial core contributor, Gnosis Guild approves which submissions comply with the standard. We embrace practices that will over time meaningfully distribute contribution, governance, and ownership of the value Zodiac produces, encouraging individuals, teams, and DAOs to participate. This includes the Zodiac design language, which consists of glyphs that can be recombined to create Zodiac icons.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/45a0e2a8-6c93-4a1c-967f-4e807480e7c2.png?height=1856&width=1920)\n\nDeveloped by [PROPS.SUPPLY](https://props.supply/), the design language represents the collection of tools according to the qualities, such as strength, magic, and dexterity, each tool affords an organization. Even more, DAOs can overlay these glyphs to represent the constitution of their organization as a badge. While still evolving, the release of the first version of the design language will coincide with a Gnosis Guild NFT drop.\n\n![Zodiac Delay Module composition](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2933d2c3-e87b-489a-94f1-802536dab760.png?height=1500&width=3000&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nThrough this design language, Zodiac seeks to decentralize not only its development but its vibe.\n\n## Bright Night Sky Ahead\n\nThe future of Zodiac is bright.\n\nThe tools launched today enhance existing practices in the DAO ecosystem, but the Zodiac roadmap aims to establish new practices in DAO-to-DAO collaboration mechanisms with a special focus on multichain governance. Upcoming Zodiac releases ​​include secret voting with zero knowledge proofs magic, message bridges between compatible networks, and web3 backends for your favorite virtual worlds. Like the glyphs that when co-present on star charts change their aspect, the Zodiac collection of tools are mods that support, expand, and transform how organizations operate.\n\nTo participate, join the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq) today.\n\n![Moonlit night by the sea, Lev Lagorio, 1886](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ff3c5bfc-e101-499b-a201-69e83e3d6094.jpeg?height=589&width=1000)\n\n*Use the Zodiac collection of tools today through the Zodiac App available on [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/).

The two co-founders of Gnosis Guild, [Auryn Macmillan](https://twitter.com/auryn_macmillan) and [Kei Kreutler](https://twitter.com/keikreutler), bring over ten years combined experience developing products for decentralized governance in the blockchain ecosystem. From closely observing the rise of Gnosis Safe, our awareness that the DAO technology stack lacked composability ignited the initiative for Zodiac.\n\nGnosis Guild is a core contributor to Zodiac and a keeper of the open standard. True to its philosophy, however, Zodiac is open for participation. Anyone can contribute to the Zodiac compliant collection of tools by submitting a pull request on the [repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac). As an initial core contributor, Gnosis Guild approves which submissions comply with the standard. We embrace practices that will over time meaningfully distribute contribution, governance, and ownership of the value Zodiac produces, encouraging individuals, teams, and DAOs to participate. This includes the Zodiac design language, which consists of glyphs that can be recombined to create Zodiac icons.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/45a0e2a8-6c93-4a1c-967f-4e807480e7c2.png?height=1856&width=1920)\n\nDeveloped by [PROPS.SUPPLY](https://props.supply/), the design language represents the collection of tools according to the qualities, such as strength, magic, and dexterity, each tool affords an organization. Even more, DAOs can overlay these glyphs to represent the constitution of their organization as a badge. While still evolving, the release of the first version of the design language will coincide with a Gnosis Guild NFT drop.\n\n![Zodiac Delay Module composition](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2933d2c3-e87b-489a-94f1-802536dab760.png?height=1500&width=3000&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nThrough this design language, Zodiac seeks to decentralize not only its development but its vibe.\n\n## Bright Night Sky Ahead\n\nThe future of Zodiac is bright.\n\nThe tools launched today enhance existing practices in the DAO ecosystem, but the Zodiac roadmap aims to establish new practices in DAO-to-DAO collaboration mechanisms with a special focus on multichain governance. Upcoming Zodiac releases ​​include secret voting with zero knowledge proofs magic, message bridges between compatible networks, and web3 backends for your favorite virtual worlds. Like the glyphs that when co-present on star charts change their aspect, the Zodiac collection of tools are mods that support, expand, and transform how organizations operate.\n\nTo participate, join the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq) today.\n\n![Moonlit night by the sea, Lev Lagorio, 1886](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ff3c5bfc-e101-499b-a201-69e83e3d6094.jpeg?height=589&width=1000)\n\n*Use the Zodiac collection of tools today through the Zodiac App available on [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/).

I will be honest that when he first pitched me on the idea of him becoming a CryptoPunk-style portrait artist, I was skeptical. That is, until he made me one, and immediately it clicked. Unbeknownst to all of us, **Thom had just started a powerful movement**.\n\nSoon, Thom was creating Pixel Portraits for everyone that he knew who might even be *slightly* interested in crypto, using them to form a secret Slack group for people who used them as a avatar, acting as conversation starters with his coworkers in the hopes that *some* of them would open their eyes to the financial revolution happening around us. Very soon, Thom and everyone around him who had received a portrait (and understood crypto) had realized that what he'd created for us was more valuable than any NFT we'd received thus-far. **He'd given us an NFT that we'd never sell.**\n\nThere were a number of values which Thom had embedded into the project, which made it uniquely interesting for its holders.\n\nFor starters, using a Pixel Portrait as your PFP allowed you to immediately signal to the world that you were a member of the crypto in-group (because the portraits are carefully crafted to perfectly match the same aesthetic as the original CryptoPunks), without ever surrendering your identity or [losing the visual recognition that a well-established PFP can offer you](https://medium.com/@rrhoover/why-i-never-change-my-profile-pic-72de0daa2785). You could literally reuse the same PFP as the one you had before, with the same colors and all, just with slight modifications (and of course, pixelation) to make it fit into the community.\n\nThe way that the portraits were created was also important: you didn't just upload an image to a website and wait for it to generate the art automatically, hoping it didn't mess up a single pixel and give you a big nose or long chin. When you commissioned a portrait, **you got the white-glove treatment**: Thom messaged you personally, had a conversation with you one on one, akin to a tattoo consultation, and hand-crafted a portrait for you in a way that ensured it exactly suited your desires. If you didn't like something, you could ask him to fix it, and Thom would tirelessly iterate on portraits until **every single holder was 100% satisfied with the result**. Every single person who commissioned the portrait would be a crypto-Medici, and every one of them would love what they received.\n\nThom also made sure to embed his values in the way that the portraits were released: if any insiders (or even us, his co-contributors) wanted a portrait, we all had to commission them the same way everyone else did. When we announced the pre-sale back in March, I had to sit there waiting for the countdown clock the same way everyone else did, **and somehow I still ended up being 23rd in line**.\n\nWhen Thom got DMs from crypto twitter influencers who wanted insider access or deals, he made sure to treat them the same way he did every single other person who commissioned a portrait. No one would be skipping the line, and everyone would get the same elite treatment that we all deserve, regardless of the individual's accumulated wealth or social clout. **As an extremely values-driven individual, Thom was not about to defile his fine work by bending the rules for the few at the expense of the many**.\n\nAfter the successful launch of the pre-sale, we assembled a crack team of Thom (the Creator), Jamie (the web developer), and myself (being pulled off the bench as a smart contract author), and got to work on a mechanism which could be used to sell these portraits on a perpetual basis. We wanted to let people get in line to commission their portraits from the maestro himself, while saving Thom from drowning in Google spreadsheets, Twitter DMs, and suffering any flake-outs. \\[This was where my formal contributions to the project began\\].\n\nOnce again, we wanted to make sure that the way that the portraits were purchased would be reflective of our values. As Thom put it, **we needed a mechanism \"for both the crypto-letariat and the bourgeoi-defi\"**; a mechanism which anyone could afford, while still allowing for those with deep pockets to pay a premium if they wanted to. Out of this work, we birthed a brand new mechanism: **Auction Queues**.\n\nThe idea was quite simple: Thom would enforce a minimum bid price to commission a portrait (for example 0.1ETH), but would let anyone jump ahead in line if they pleased by **submitting a higher bid.** This pay-to-skip-ahead model meant that **Thom could now charge an accurate time-adjusted price for his commissions**, letting him capture more upside from the people who had a higher time preference, without having to exclude anyone who wanted a portrait. All payments would be made upfront, and so a great deal of administrative burden would be relieved off his shoulders, so Thom could focus on what he did best: creating dope portraits and a sick community. It took some all-nighters (along with Jamie heroically throwing himself in the deep end of dapp development with barely a MetaMask wallet to his name when we kicked off), but we managed to build a product that was simple but powerful.\n\nWe launched the project, and over the course of 5 months saw this mechanism in action: a majority of purchasers were fine with waiting in line, with select individuals opting to out-bid each other to skip ahead and get their portraits quickly.\n\nDuring this time, the project slowly gathered speed and followers, as the NFT space got hotter and hotter, and more people heard about the best source of custom NFT PFPs on the market. **There was no paid marketing, no influencers given gifts in exchange for promotion.** Just a Twitter account, some memes, and **the publicly tweeted testimonials of hundreds of happy customers who were delighted to share the project with their friends when they were asked where they got their PFP**.\n\nAs some people were starting to rotate their PFPs on a weekly basis to signal participation in the ponzi of the week, or began donning NFTs worth millions as signals of their stature, a select few began to realize that a humble but powerful Pixel Portrait was the perfect PFP to signal that you were in the in-group, without any of the gaudy finishes. Whether they knew it or not, individuals were self-selecting to join a not-yet-established community of people who understood NFTs without the flash; **who valued both their individuality *and* the collective**.\n\nTo date, The Pixel Portraits project has been lucky enough to have earned over 120ETH from just over 480 different commissioners. Some people just bought portraits of themselves, some as gifts for friends or loved ones, and some of notable figures that they wanted to memorialize. **But a majority of purchasers, once they got their first one, couldn't resist getting at least one more.**\n\nThankfully, this success has also meant that Thom has been rescued from his old job as a cog in a corporate machine full of ngmi-folk who were keen to ignore the bright future unfolding ahead of them (most of the original portraits that were made for that Slack group still remain un-minted). There are few more deserving of financial freedom than Thom, and I feel lucky to have even been a part of this journey so far.\n\nWe've delivered portraits to **some of the most important founders and investors in the crypto ecosystem, the best and brightest anon degens on Crypto Twitter, as well as a broad group crypto newbies whose first NFT purchase was their Pixel Portrait.** The portraits have always been for everyone\\*\\*, as long as you got it.\\*\\*\n\nAs I write this, we're closing a chapter in the story of The Pixel Portraits, nearing 1000 unique 1/1 portraits, which we'll memorialize as the OG portraits, ahead of a re-launch with [many big plans for the future](https://twitter.com/thepxlportraits/status/1432014883579699200). So far Thom's committed to seeing the collection through to 10,000 hand-made portraits, but we're already thinking of several orders of magnitude more than that.\n\nThe time has come for the behemoth iceberg that's been forming under the surface to begin revealing itself. In the coming days, we'll be launching the **PixelFam** **Community**, a space that's exclusively reserved for individuals who hold at least one portrait. This will be the first community that will be built using the [Myco Blueprint](https://m.mirror.xyz/6UxMOPMAnCZr8XSkhIM2Xx47bZ7X5rColwpnwIDbx5s), which will see us rewarding our members with co-ownership in the community that they're helping us build.\n\n**It's time to show just how powerful a PFP project can be when it morphs from being an NFT series into something much much bigger.

{"id": "g8yeSIPIp91wfhJ9DCPHl0-NS5xobsHEZBJ1gHePLMs", "title": "Building Community, One Face at a Time (Part 2): The Pixel Portraits Story", "body": "For part 1 of this post, please read \n\n[https://m.mirror.xyz/Xr0TX6_b6TSB5Ui90mvfixrlfp2fgmhOtzQbM3CXegk](https://m.mirror.xyz/Xr0TX6_b6TSB5Ui90mvfixrlfp2fgmhOtzQbM3CXegk)\n\nEarlier this year, I had the pleasure of connecting with [Thom](https://twitter.com/pixelthom), an artist/ creative/ polymath/ 21st Century Renaissance Man, who was keen to dive head first into crypto.\n\nAfter seeing the sudden rise in popularity of CryptoPunks (but not being able to purchase one of his own), and the very low quality of ‘bootleg punks’ being sold on OpenSea, Thom decided to take matters into his own hands: he made his own custom Punk — himself— and began to don it as his new PFP on various social platforms. I will be honest that when he first pitched me on the idea of him becoming a CryptoPunk-style portrait artist, I was skeptical. That is, until he made me one, and immediately it clicked. Unbeknownst to all of us, **Thom had just started a powerful movement**.\n\nSoon, Thom was creating Pixel Portraits for everyone that he knew who might even be *slightly* interested in crypto, using them to form a secret Slack group for people who used them as a avatar, acting as conversation starters with his coworkers in the hopes that *some* of them would open their eyes to the financial revolution happening around us. Very soon, Thom and everyone around him who had received a portrait (and understood crypto) had realized that what he'd created for us was more valuable than any NFT we'd received thus-far. **He'd given us an NFT that we'd never sell.**\n\nThere were a number of values which Thom had embedded into the project, which made it uniquely interesting for its holders.\n\nFor starters, using a Pixel Portrait as your PFP allowed you to immediately signal to the world that you were a member of the crypto in-group (because the portraits are carefully crafted to perfectly match the same aesthetic as the original CryptoPunks), without ever surrendering your identity or [losing the visual recognition that a well-established PFP can offer you](https://medium.com/@rrhoover/why-i-never-change-my-profile-pic-72de0daa2785). You could literally reuse the same PFP as the one you had before, with the same colors and all, just with slight modifications (and of course, pixelation) to make it fit into the community.\n\nThe way that the portraits were created was also important: you didn't just upload an image to a website and wait for it to generate the art automatically, hoping it didn't mess up a single pixel and give you a big nose or long chin. When you commissioned a portrait, **you got the white-glove treatment**: Thom messaged you personally, had a conversation with you one on one, akin to a tattoo consultation, and hand-crafted a portrait for you in a way that ensured it exactly suited your desires. If you didn't like something, you could ask him to fix it, and Thom would tirelessly iterate on portraits until **every single holder was 100% satisfied with the result**. Every single person who commissioned the portrait would be a crypto-Medici, and every one of them would love what they received.\n\nThom also made sure to embed his values in the way that the portraits were released: if any insiders (or even us, his co-contributors) wanted a portrait, we all had to commission them the same way everyone else did. When we announced the pre-sale back in March, I had to sit there waiting for the countdown clock the same way everyone else did, **and somehow I still ended up being 23rd in line**.\n\nWhen Thom got DMs from crypto twitter influencers who wanted insider access or deals, he made sure to treat them the same way he did every single other person who commissioned a portrait. No one would be skipping the line, and everyone would get the same elite treatment that we all deserve, regardless of the individual's accumulated wealth or social clout. **As an extremely values-driven individual, Thom was not about to defile his fine work by bending the rules for the few at the expense of the many**.\n\nAfter the successful launch of the pre-sale, we assembled a crack team of Thom (the Creator), Jamie (the web developer), and myself (being pulled off the bench as a smart contract author), and got to work on a mechanism which could be used to sell these portraits on a perpetual basis. We wanted to let people get in line to commission their portraits from the maestro himself, while saving Thom from drowning in Google spreadsheets, Twitter DMs, and suffering any flake-outs. \\[This was where my formal contributions to the project began\\].\n\nOnce again, we wanted to make sure that the way that the portraits were purchased would be reflective of our values. As Thom put it, **we needed a mechanism \"for both the crypto-letariat and the bourgeoi-defi\"**; a mechanism which anyone could afford, while still allowing for those with deep pockets to pay a premium if they wanted to. Out of this work, we birthed a brand new mechanism: **Auction Queues**.\n\nThe idea was quite simple: Thom would enforce a minimum bid price to commission a portrait (for example 0.1ETH), but would let anyone jump ahead in line if they pleased by **submitting a higher bid.** This pay-to-skip-ahead model meant that **Thom could now charge an accurate time-adjusted price for his commissions**, letting him capture more upside from the people who had a higher time preference, without having to exclude anyone who wanted a portrait. All payments would be made upfront, and so a great deal of administrative burden would be relieved off his shoulders, so Thom could focus on what he did best: creating dope portraits and a sick community. It took some all-nighters (along with Jamie heroically throwing himself in the deep end of dapp development with barely a MetaMask wallet to his name when we kicked off), but we managed to build a product that was simple but powerful.\n\nWe launched the project, and over the course of 5 months saw this mechanism in action: a majority of purchasers were fine with waiting in line, with select individuals opting to out-bid each other to skip ahead and get their portraits quickly.\n\nDuring this time, the project slowly gathered speed and followers, as the NFT space got hotter and hotter, and more people heard about the best source of custom NFT PFPs on the market. **There was no paid marketing, no influencers given gifts in exchange for promotion.** Just a Twitter account, some memes, and **the publicly tweeted testimonials of hundreds of happy customers who were delighted to share the project with their friends when they were asked where they got their PFP**.\n\nAs some people were starting to rotate their PFPs on a weekly basis to signal participation in the ponzi of the week, or began donning NFTs worth millions as signals of their stature, a select few began to realize that a humble but powerful Pixel Portrait was the perfect PFP to signal that you were in the in-group, without any of the gaudy finishes. Whether they knew it or not, individuals were self-selecting to join a not-yet-established community of people who understood NFTs without the flash; **who valued both their individuality *and* the collective**.\n\nTo date, The Pixel Portraits project has been lucky enough to have earned over 120ETH from just over 480 different commissioners. Some people just bought portraits of themselves, some as gifts for friends or loved ones, and some of notable figures that they wanted to memorialize. **But a majority of purchasers, once they got their first one, couldn't resist getting at least one more.**\n\nThankfully, this success has also meant that Thom has been rescued from his old job as a cog in a corporate machine full of ngmi-folk who were keen to ignore the bright future unfolding ahead of them (most of the original portraits that were made for that Slack group still remain un-minted). There are few more deserving of financial freedom than Thom, and I feel lucky to have even been a part of this journey so far.\n\nWe've delivered portraits to **some of the most important founders and investors in the crypto ecosystem, the best and brightest anon degens on Crypto Twitter, as well as a broad group crypto newbies whose first NFT purchase was their Pixel Portrait.** The portraits have always been for everyone\\*\\*, as long as you got it.\\*\\*\n\nAs I write this, we're closing a chapter in the story of The Pixel Portraits, nearing 1000 unique 1/1 portraits, which we'll memorialize as the OG portraits, ahead of a re-launch with [many big plans for the future](https://twitter.com/thepxlportraits/status/1432014883579699200). So far Thom's committed to seeing the collection through to 10,000 hand-made portraits, but we're already thinking of several orders of magnitude more than that.\n\nThe time has come for the behemoth iceberg that's been forming under the surface to begin revealing itself. In the coming days, we'll be launching the **PixelFam** **Community**, a space that's exclusively reserved for individuals who hold at least one portrait. This will be the first community that will be built using the [Myco Blueprint](https://m.mirror.xyz/6UxMOPMAnCZr8XSkhIM2Xx47bZ7X5rColwpnwIDbx5s), which will see us rewarding our members with co-ownership in the community that they're helping us build.\n\n**It's time to show just how powerful a PFP project can be when it morphs from being an NFT series into something much much bigger. It's time to show people just how powerful these focal points really are.**\n\n### Disclaimers\n\nIf you think I've been too lavish in my praise for Thom, all I can say is that there were earlier versions of this post which were even more approbative, and that this is the *toned down* version of this story.

Sparked by a renewed interest in CryptoPunks, creators have designed series after series of characters and provided each them with traits and unique features that set them apart from each other.\n\nSome of the art has been top notch, with some PFP creators even going as far as to hand-design every single implementation (cough cough like The Pixel Portraits you see above).

They can give everyone an instantly recognizable visual cue that the community is there. They can help people understand the expected behavioural norms or values of the group. They can compress an entire community — which lives in the hearts and minds of each of its members— into a single point. **Without** a strong focal point, it's hard to keep people moving together in a coordinated fashion; **with** a strong focal point, a community can move in unison with little to no oversight.\n\nThese days, community focal points come in many forms: sometimes they're visual memes, sometimes they're brands, and sometimes they're dance moves. But they all serve the same purpose: providing a community with an agreed upon fulcrum around which all of its activities can rotate.\n\n### Tokens as Community Focal Points\n\nWith the rise of Bitcoin, and later an infinite series of new fungible tokens, people began to realize that **money itself** could itself be a focal point for any new community.\n\nWhat's more, the meme could be more than just a superficial idea; these tokens could become valuable, and could act as representations of the community in motion. The market-cap of a token became synonymous with the total value of the community who owned it. But the system was still flawed.\n\nUsing a fungible token as a focal point was useful if the community's core purpose was to transact together, but otherwise they weren't exactly ideal vessels for transmitting cultural frequencies. It's pretty hard to embed a community's values into a token which is quite literally represented by a 3-5 character string, along with a ledger of its transaction history. At best your meme could be a single word, and your values need to be reflected in the way the token was distributed and used.\n\nCommunities needed more solid foundations if they wanted to ensure long-term coordination.\n\n### Non Fungible Focal Points\n\nReturning to the original focal point of this post — PFP projects— what people quickly began to discover as more of these projects were launched was that they served as excellent focal points for any community.\n\nPFP projects are constructed using a shared set of symbols and visual elements which are representations of the community's values and beliefs, **while still enabling individual members to retain a sense of individuality and uniqueness**. You could be part of the collective without completely surrendering your identity and wearing a mask that was shared by every single other member of the group, even if your identity was itself pseudonymous.\n\nFurther, the variety of mechanisms by which these PFPs could be released to new members meant that creators could come up with new ways to embed their values directly into the project, **so that the people who were most aligned with the values of the community would be the ones most likely to redeem a PFP early on.** This was a beautiful example of [autopoesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis) in motion, which allowed community builders to push the act of curation onto the shoulders of the members, who would self-select themselves into the community if it aligned with their own personal values.\n\nAs an observer to many of these projects and their launch processes, one of the most saddening elements has been seeing well intentioned individuals unintentionally program other people's values into their own projects by following the patterns and methods used by others.
