I am excited to attend the 3-day event but I can’t help reflect on these past 6 months in the crypto space. What a crazy year it’s been.\n\nIn 2020, I didn’t know what a Non-Fungible Token was. I didn’t own Bitcoin, Ethereum or any Cryptocurrency. I didn’t care about Crypto. I had friends in the space who were obsessed with the industry and it sure sounded like they were doing well, but I wasn’t interested.\n\nThat changed when Jack Dorsey, the owner of Twitter and Square posted an essay on his Twitter feed. The essay explored the history of money. This started my deep-dive into Cryptocurrency.\n\nAt the time, Warren, a client who I had been mentoring, left his successful content management business to become a full-time Crypto-currency trader. I remember talking with Warren as he told me about the incredible opportunity in the cryptocurrency space. He was taking the relative-value lessons he learned from our options and futures program and was applying them in the fragmenting market of cryptocurrencies. It was a good choice; I knew it – Warren was in his 20’s with the entire world in front of him. I was proud (and impressed) that he was willing to make such a big shift in his career path. I respect folks who instinctually pivot when they see opportunity.\n\nAs I learned about Crypto, Warren became a phenomenal resource for me as we kept in close contact. He was building a hedge fund, along with a consultancy service for other traditional hedge funds, looking to get into the Crypto space. The trade he was doing was awesome. He had the right technology allowing him to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum and other DeFi (Decentralized Finance) coins on multiple exchanges. What he was doing (and is still doing) was pure arbitrage. It’s what traders should be looking for when trading their money, or someone else’s. The fact that he had found an edge in a growing market,was engaged, happy and doing great made me proud.\n\nI started Masters in Trading 2015 to offer something that wasn’t available for retail trader. I wanted to offer professional-level trading education. The space was littered with marketers and technicians making outlandish promises about the trillions of dollars up-for-grabs if they would just follow their special system. Watching trading videos on Youtube about the same technical analysis nonsense was comical to me, so I set out to change the industry.\n\nI have since learned that trading education is a game of marketing. The best content doesn’t necessarily win. The best marketing wins, which is not that much different than any other industry. Over time, to make my content more digestible for retail traders, we have developed technology to provide value to our clients. They seem happy. When my clients are happy, I am happy.\n\nAs I learned more about Bitcoin and Ethereum, I gravitated to the former. Ethereum spoke to me because I understood the utility of the contract and I saw the practical application that it presents. What grabbed me next was Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs). I’ll explain why, but before I do, I want to go back to Warren.\n\n*Ethereum spoke to me because I understood the utility of the contract and I saw the practical application that it presents.*\n\nWarren and I were routinely meeting in the beginning of 2021. He was incredibly generous with his time and I was learning so much. This was the most excited I had been about education since the 9-month grueling training session it took to complete Ironman Wisconsin.\n\nDo you know what biggest risk athletes face when training for 10+ hour endurance events? I didn’t. *Nutrition*. – facing stomach issues by not consuming the right kind of sugars and either too little or too many calories. *Hydration* – competing the Ironman was the equivalent of taking a masters class in nutrition. Back to crypto…\n\nAs we continued talking, I had come to realize there are many directions one can go in the Crypto space but my interest were starting to deviate from Warren’s. Warren is a trader, and a darn good one. He was looking to build a Hedge Fund to invest money so clients can get a great return. For me, I’ve been there and done that. I’ve traded my entire life and the thought of diving into a brand-new trade wasn’t that exciting for me. As I reflect, I’m certain the reason for this is trading can be a selfish profession. A career trader spends days staring at a computer hoping to ring-the-register by days end. It’s fun, and can be extremely lucrative, but you’re not doing anything for anyone. You’re not creating anything. It’s only about money.\n\nAs I learned more, instead of spending time looking for arbitrage opportunities between Bitcoin on one exchange vs Bitcoin on another exchange I was fascinated with *smart contracts*. These were groundbreaking to me, smart contracts would allow digital ownership for the first time in history. These smart contracts were called Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs).\n\n## Fungible versus Non Fungible Tokens\n\nQuick lesson – Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD are Fungible. These are fungible because one Ethereum can be transacted for another Ethereum, it’s still just Ethereum. In trading the word Fungible is used as well, for instance: If I buy an option on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and then sell that option on the Philadelphia Options exchange, the option is Fungible to each exchange, meaning that both exchanges will respect the price and value of the option regardless of where it came from.\n\nIf a photographer, let’s say Ansel Adams, arguably the most well know photographer, takes 5 different photos of the Grand Canyon, each of those photos is distinct, they are one of ones. They are unique, making them similar to Non Fungible tokens. If Ansel’s photos were NFTs, we couldn’t trade one of his photos for another and expect the value to be the same. Demand might be greater for one photo over another, which renders them as non-fungible.\n\nNon Fungible tokens are built on top of various Blockchains. The NFTs I began following were built on the Ethereum blockchain, but other NFTs such as Solana, Polygon and Binance also have a growing NFT presence.\n\n## NFTs, Photography and Art – Simplying the Process for Artists and Collectors\n\nLet’s expand on NFTs further continuing with photography as the example. In the past, a professional photographer would take a photo on a digital camera, and then send that file to an art gallery. The gallery would then print, mount and frame that photo and offer it for sale to collectors. The photo may sell for $2,000, the artist takes $1,000 and the gallery might take $1,000. This would be the end of the transaction for both parties.\n\nHere’s the beauty of NFTs using the exact same example.\n\nA photographer takes a photo with a digital camera but instead of sending the file to a gallery, they post the file on an auction site similar for $2,000 USD. The collector purchases work for $2,000 and the artist collects $2,000 (less minimal expenses). The gallery owner doesn’t play a role anymore. Now, the collector has the options to print, mount and frame the work and display in their home. Once displayed, they are welcome to resell the NFT if they choose (or keep the digital asset, it’s up to them).\n\nThis is already an improvement from historical procedures, but there’s more!\n\nIn the past, a gallery would sell to a collector, the collector would own an illiquid investment that they could enjoy but selling is nearly impossible. In 1999, I purchased two Andy Warhol pieces for a total of $17,000 at a contemporary art show in Chicago. I enjoyed those works for 13 years until I decided to sell in 2012. I reached out to major auction house, Sotheby’s, to initiate the sale. The Warhols ended up selling for close to $75,000 each – WOOHOO! I was expecting $150,000 less some fees… but, those fees ended up costing me over $50k, not to mention the 3 months the entire transaction took to complete. I was happy with the trade, but the process was awful.\n\nNFT’s simplify this process. When the collector eventually sells the photo, the artist continues to get a portion of futures sales, industry standard is 10% as I write. If the work appreciates and sells for $3,000, the artist gets a $300 cut. If the work again sells again for $4,000, the artist gets a $400 cut. This process continues forever! In the past, when an artist’s work appreciated, it would result in zero benefit to the artist. This is a GAME CHANGER for the art world! The term ‘starving artist’ will be a relic of the past.\n\nWarren was surprised that my interests deviated from trading the arbitrage opportunities he was finding. I remember him encouraging me… he would say, “…with your background, you would have incredible EDGE in trading cryptocurrencies.” He was probably right, but the technology of smart contracts and the Ethereum Blockchain had me mesmerized. This was the most fascinating technology I had ever seen.\n\n## My History with Art\n\nI’ve always loved art and the supply and demand of the art market. In my first year on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, I was blessed to have earned close to $1.5m trading S&P 500 Futures and Nasdaq Futures on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Trading was easy, but I’ve come to learn that the market was forgiving at that time. Trading, in general, is challenging – regardless of what some crooked gurus might tell you. The trade at the time had edge for the floor traders because in order for the public to trade, they had no other option than to trade through the markets the traders presented. The markets in the early 2000’s were also transitioning to the computer and the older generation was afraid of computers. My contemporaries and I jumped right in and gobbled up every tradable edge we could find. We were building spreading software that would find us great trades before humans could value the markets. I learned that you need to keep pushing forward. You need to change, adapt and be nimble because the markets were always changing. Traders that didn’t change got left behind.\n\nAs a young 20 something with loads of cash, I was able to dive into my love of contemporary art. My mom was my wingman when it came to attending art shows. We would fly to Miami and go to Art Basel, and in the early 2000’s, Chicago had a phenomenal contemporary art scene. My cousin, a gallery owner in NYC with a PhD in Art History helped curate my earliest purchases. My mom passed in April of 2019, but I wish she could see the art market now. My mom would most certainly get NFTs. She would love most that artists were getting properly compensated for their work in the new age of Web 3.0.   \n\nIn February 2021, I was convinced of the practical application of Ethereum and NFTs and ready to put capital to work. Other trading gurus in the space had started talking trades in Bitcoin, but it was the same technical analysis nonsense that many were doing in stock and options. I had no doubt cryptocurrency would eventually go mainstream but I also knew these stock and options ‘teachers’ would follow and immediately claim to be experts without doing any work. They would follow the hot topic of the day, just like they had in the past.\n\nHow could I differentiate myself? How could I get in front of the curve and prove to my audience that I wasn’t selling a course to make money? How could I convince those who trusted me that I was genuinely looking to help?  I wouldn’t say that I was an influencer, but there’s no doubt my clients put trust me and I have influence.\n\nIt is already happening. Today I got an email that said – Solana is up 200% for the year, Ethereum is up 250% for the year – now, come to my webinar and buy my course. The email did not say that Solana was a Layer 1 Blockchain that might have better, faster technology than Ethereum. The email just showed a chart and said, “Look at this chart! If you bought Solana at this level and sold at this level you could have made xxx%.”\n\nWhat a bunch of horse-sh\\*t! This is more of the same nonsense that consumes our collective email inboxes.\n\n## Going All-IN on Ethereum and NFTs\n\nIn February, I started buying Ethereum at $1500 and Solana for under $50. As I write Ethereum is trading close to $5,000 and Solana ($SOL) is $240. Both of these assets will trade much higher in my opinion.\n\nThe BIG move I made, the move that said to my closest clients that I’m going ALL-IN on the Ethereum blockchain was purchasing a Cryptopunk for 25.97 Ethereum (see the transaction below). Today, this Punk is easily valued in excess of 150 Ethereum.\n\nWhat’s a Cryptopunk? The Cryptopunk is one of the earliest examples of a “Non-Fungible Token” and were the inspiration for the ERC-721 Standard that powers most digital arts and collectibles. To me, a Cryptopunk is like investing in the Printing Press. The most desirable, and highest prices transactions are below. Those are some expensive JPEGS!\n\nIt didn’t stop there – it wasn’t even close! I felt so strongly about this opportunity that I poured money into Ethereum and other historical artifacts on the Ethereum Blockchain. I wanted clients to see that I was putting my money where my mouth is. I was not some doofus talking technical analysis nonsense without any skin-in-the-game.\n\nI purchased and sold the first musical beat ever generated on the Ethereum Blockchain. You can see the full transaction below; buy and then sell.\n\nNext, I dove into a new form of art called Generative Art – Gen Art is new artistic medium that I am betting on to be as commonplace as photography, pastels or charcoal in the coming years. Ten years from now museums will have wings solely for Generative Artist, at least that’s what I am betting on.\n\n## Commitment to the Future of NFTs\n\nMy commitment was to educate my closest clients, the ones who bet on me years ago and never left my side. Clients like Warren who are now making more money than he ever dreamed of in NYC. Clients like Pablo Lucena who left Facebook, to build tools for my trading community, and trade the markets full time.\n\nI truly believe that NFTs represent the future of the art world. It’s a future that favors and respects the hard work, talent and creativity of the artist, while also improving the process by which collectors obtain and manage their art. I’m thrilled to not only be part of this future, but to have ability to share this knowledge with my closest clients so that they too, can share in the journey.\n\nThanks for reading -\n\nJonathan Rose owner Mastersintrading.com", "timestamp": 1636651776, "digest": "XGk327-DakXOLfaLXZcOrV_XIq3QfCH9LDyMPEdzbVM", "contributor": "0x3B1c2244C69dcFf316f25Ed89590c0513EF85735"}

{"id": "yIj22-WvHOA2GzJdspib2r8skG4sOPVmCsW01_3YMNM", "title": "Move Towards Playable NFTs: \nAn Analysis on the LAND of GameFi \n\n", "body": "In traditional games, defence and plunder are the fundamental mechanisms that players interact with land resource, integrating into the 4X Strategy game with eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate as distinguishing features. Although the LAND in GameFi project haven’t been thoroughly involved with gameplay on account of its financial attribute, the utility of LAND is derived from exhibition to binding with the APR of staking, and then engages players to contribute to the community.\n\nThis article will briefly review the utility evolution of LAND NFTs and analyze the mechanism design on both playable and profit-driven GameFi projects.\n\n**1. Sandbox Games: Exhibit the Land**\n\nInitially, LAND was sold in sandbox games such as Sandbox and Decentraland, that give the player a great degree of creativity and strongly relates to the core feature of Metaverse, emphasizing sociality and user content generation (UGC). In sandbox games, LAND is used to display swanky and rare commodities or build a set of installation to interact with, which facilitates artistic players selling crafts in the second market. The value of LAND changes depending on adjoining business district thus many LANDs is occupied for advertising or building theme parks in the future. Though the LAND as a static asset with limited interactive functions doesn’t affect the game experience, players in sandbox games concern more about the sense of identity and social activity, hence the username transaction in Decentraland boomed.\n\nHowever, even if sandbox games based on UGC cultivate a stable user base and promote the secondary market trading, the gameplay only mastered by a spot of players as a creative tool that is not an entertainment with a wider range of audience. Additionally, such games aim to create a harmonious environment and Sandbox impose restriction on players jointing, encouraging the participation of individual artists to a certain extent, but it restrictes the development of guild economy. Therefore, landowners can't benefit more than the appreciation of lAND and token, lacking of direct incentives for such players to actively participate in the game.\n\n![The Map of Sandbox ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lW9tUl_ZyCwmV3U0pcGO5.png?height=436&width=967)\n\n**2. MMORPG: Manage the Land** \n\nIn massively multiplayer online games led by Ember Sword and Mirandus, LAND can be a differentiating element for the game experience: there are random monsters, NPCs and natural resources in remote areas; bazaars and small guilds gather in the suburban areas; while the largest trading markets and guilds are concentrated in the city. There are even more detailed LAND categories like kingdoms, capitals, and castles, which makes difference in prices. For instance, one of Mirandus' five castles, Citadel of the Stars, was bought by Polyient Games for $16 billion.\n\nIn addition to various LAND types, the elaborate premise and background story also make the land assets meaningful. Players write lore and chronicle about games in the Discord channels, demonstrating how a virtual world further deepen a sense of belonging to the land.\n\nIn this kind of games, landowners can be quite flexible on asset disposal and participate in the game through land management; whether improve the infrastructure, tax on the service and toll, or establish guilds to expand the reputation, players will be more closely connected with their land resources.\n\nNevertheless, the activity of players in such games largely depends on the development of player community. Taking traditional MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft and Fantasy Westward Journey as examples, these games need a stable and large group of players to activate the secondary market, as well as a centralized approach to innovate game versions and retain players. MMORPG combining with GameFi is better than traditional games in terms of incentive mechanism and asset ownership, but considering the small base of crypto players and the long period of development, it’s better to wait and see how the community play a role after the game launch.\n\n![LAND Introduction of Ember Sword](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f23aRIBYo728iIKQUTbNJ.png?height=624&width=1818)\n\nAll games mentioned above have one thing in common that the landowner can sit back and wait for the land to appreciate; instead, the mechanism design in following games that fuels landowners to involve in the community construction through subdividing roles of players.\n\n**3.Adventure Games: Empower the Land**\n\n**3.1 - Mines of Dalarnia**\n\nIn Mines of Dalarnia, an action-adventure game, land (planet) holders stake $DAR to keep the planet’s resource from diminishing and increase its attractiveness to appeal other players to mine on their planet; in turn, miner players need to pay the mining rent fee and the entrance fee to the planet owner. The economic system is functioned effectively that miners are highly mobile to mine resources and scarce equipment on a variety of planets and landholders are engaged in stakting on their own initiative to compete with other landholders.\n\n![Mechanism Illustration of Mines of Dalarnia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GZXlC44WehKJYDgBi20zF.jpg?height=593&width=984)\n\n**3.2 - Gold Fever**\n\nA similar design can be found in Gold Fever, an action-RPG where some players can buy a land license to become mine owners but can't directly mine the resources unless recruiting other players as miners, and they cannot get the reward directly because there are players form corporates and rainforest tribes to rob the treasure. The game attempts to restore the Gold Rush era and divides players into seven roles, making the action gameplay more exciting and the corresponding reward is also more generous.\n\n![A Gold Fever Mining Claim](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WM_QJzssuYMCOAdYKSYtg.png?height=316&width=590)\n\n**3.3 - Aavegotchi**\n\nAnother example is the Gotchiverse in Aavegotchi, an open-ended social space based on Gotchi NFT where players can engage in myriad minigames, the landowners or Gotchi players need to bolster their land parcels and build defensive structures to protect their resources from being collected by Lickquidators, the NFT which will be distributed via airdrops to free-entry players, and landowners also need to trod out to wipe them. Therefore, the game creates an asymmetry arena to enhance the cooperation between Gotchi players and landholders, and to attract new players through Lickquidator forming strong in-game competition.\n\n![Aavegotchi Realm](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XE4XElRebOKjYvnn5JMTv.png?height=602&width=621)\n\nThe three games above make use of asymmetric competitive design, that is, the mechanism divides the functions of players and correspondingly limits some abilities. On the one hand, it forces players to cooperate and strengthen the community strength, activating secondary market transactions and promote resource circulation. On the other hand, it reinforces the confliction of players that promotes resource consumption with higher reward and enable players to achieve play-to-earn that truly relies on strategy and skill to gain, returning to the competitive feature of game rather than using hype and gambling psychology to profit.\n\n**4. New Scenario: Break the Limit of Land**\n\n**4.1 - Vulcan Forged**\n\nIn addition to increasing staking reward from the LAND, the reward token can also be burnt and achieve deflation. \n\nIn an open world game, Vulcan Forged, each time a landowner upgrades the LAND, the revenue of staking will be burnt, and once more than half of landowners upgrade their lands above level 7, 8 million coins will disappear out of a current supply.  It is predicted that landowners are willing to stake for a long period due to the considerable token appreciation and actively recruit players to produce resources from the land in order to destroy coins rapidly, making them scarcer and raising the market price.\n\nOn the face of it, this mechanism incentivizes landowners to further expand their participation, binding themselves firmly to the land assets and getting more players involved; but in the long run, if the team doesn’t develop attractive features or restrict withdrawals, the hilarity will collapse in a flash since no one is willing to be a newcomer.\n\n![Map of Vulcan Forged](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bJ2te06HGueirDUbn7L8Q.png?height=496&width=661)\n\n**4.2 - Bloktopia**\n\nThe application of LAND is not limited in games like Bloktopia that aims to create a virtual social space, serving only as a game hall in the building for entertainment, while the rest of the space is more integrated with the social scene in the real world. The virtual building now houses content creators including Polygon and Avalanche, and on November 2nd KuCoin announced plans to create an office in Bloktopia that will allow chat and work in a virtual environment.\n\n![A KuCoin Poster in Bloktopia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XRTFdk_9CI-h_p7FwLvZc.png?height=692&width=1267)\n\n**5.Conclusion**\n\nIn a nutshell, the utility of LAND NFT in GameFi attains more interaction with players and active the community. The developers refined the functions of players to strengthen the economic circulation and consumption. Besides, there are also projects designed in depth at the level of financial properties of game assets to cater to the needs of most players in the market with diversified and entertaining means of making wealth.\n\nThis article mainly discusses the utility of LAND NFT in various GameFi projects, but GameFi is still in its infancy and more utilities will be gradually derived from playability and profitability, and both of which have plenty of scope. \n\nWhile the designing intricacy may disappoint some speculators, video games have evolved to a variety of kinds that can satisfy multiple players. It can be anticipated that game will ultimately balance the entertainment and profit and breathe new life into the web3.0.", "timestamp": 1636652580, "digest": "oRLhDn9xmQa-gHwCVoDxivqBwDSCQDbNJDerrrm7CBQ", "contributor": "0x9e8bE10261c4fbD017991fe8af5b4892255E9684"}

In a world where there is an[ influx of information](https://blog.microfocus.com/how-much-data-is-created-on-the-internet-each-day/) and we are overwhelmed from living our ***extremelyonline™*** personas, an entire generation that grew up with the internet as novelty has now been dubbed the **“burnout generation”** enter the rise of CaaS, *curation as a service*, as a much necessary pushback against unnecessary noise.\n\n***“And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden you are free to eat; but as for the tree of knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat of it; for as soon as you eat of it, you shall die.”***\n\n**-Genesis 2:16**\n\nGood and evil in ancient religious texts is used as a merism, a combination of two contrasting parts referring to the whole, in this case to convey ***“everything*”** which can be looked at as a much needed warning against the overconsumption of information.Taking a bite from the **“forbidden fruit”**  leads to **“death”** a way to denote the pervasiveness to the oneself.\n\n**In the beginning, there was buffering** -the term as we know it over the Internet, happens where packets can traverse numerous routers from source to destination, and delays can be introduced at any moment. Throughout history, ***“buffering”*** has taken different kinds of forms. Looking back at the origins of mass media, it can be traced to the days when dramas were performed in various ancient cultures, think of it as early broadcasting. After that came the first dated printed book, ***“Diamond Sutra”*** printed in China way back in 868 AD, then came movable clay, these mediums, though innovative at the time, had a low spread, these physical limitations were the original ***“buffering.”*** Then in Europe in the 1400s, ***\"mass media\"*** was coined with the creation of print media, notable for being the first example of it as we use the term today.

The Lightning Network is dematerializing all segregated, independent, bifurcated monetary networks onto one single global standard.”*\n\nThis isn’t the only company Strike plans on integrating its API with for payments, they say. There is “a select group of partners, ranging from small businesses to the largest companies in the world” that Strike is intimately working with on similar rollouts for the upcoming weeks.\n\nIt’s obvious within the past year that Twitter has not been shy to experiment with its platform and its overall direction as a company — Spaces, Tips, subtly changing its font (Chirp), the confusing ‘Follow’ button color fiasco, and also, future plans to incorporate a Bitcoin decentralized exchange, and an NFT (non-fungible token) authentication feature that allows users to authenticate their digital art and property online.\n\nTwitter, earlier in the year, has also stated its ambitious intent on decentralizing its currently-centralized social media model through its self-funded initiative ‘bluesky,’ headed by seasoned crypto developer, Jay Graber. The project is still in its infancy at the moment, but it’ll certainly be curious to see how all of this unfolds.\n\nWith Bitcoin and Lightning Network as the first open, transparent, global money protocols now functioning on one of the world’s biggest social media platforms, the sky (or should we say, bluesky’s) the limit for where this could all go next.", "timestamp": 1636653479, "digest": "-bYe4nAtBePmNqJr8KzPa5JFpryEq4qF7-w_Gx1tmVY", "contributor": "0x38BE439e199BEd44117316D4589037501D84E689"}

In a world where there is an[ influx of information](https://blog.microfocus.com/how-much-data-is-created-on-the-internet-each-day/) and we are overwhelmed from living our ***extremelyonline™*** personas, an entire generation that grew up with the internet as novelty has now been dubbed the **“burnout generation”** enter the rise of CaaS, *curation as a service*, as a much necessary pushback against unnecessary noise.\n\n***“And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden you are free to eat; but as for the tree of knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat of it; for as soon as you eat of it, you shall die.”***\n\n**-Genesis 2:16**\n\nGood and evil in ancient religious texts is used as a merism, a combination of two contrasting parts referring to the whole, in this case to convey ***“everything*”** which can be looked at as a much needed warning against the overconsumption of information.Taking a bite from the **“forbidden fruit”** leads to **“death”** a way to denote the pervasiveness to the oneself.\n\n**In the beginning, there was buffering** -the term as we know it over the Internet, happens where packets can traverse numerous routers from source to destination, and delays can be introduced at any moment. Throughout history, ***“buffering”*** has taken different kinds of forms. Looking back at the origins of mass media, it can be traced to the days when dramas were performed in various ancient cultures, think of it as early broadcasting. After that came the first dated printed book, ***“Diamond Sutra”*** printed in China way back in 868 AD, then came movable clay, these mediums, though innovative at the time, had a low spread, these physical limitations were the original ***“buffering.”*** Then in Europe in the 1400s, ***\"mass media\"*** was coined with the creation of print media, notable for being the first example of it as we use the term today. This form media creation lead to:\n\n* the invention of Gutenberg’s printing press in 1455\n* the first weekly printed newspaper in Antwerp in 1605\n* the invention of radio in 1895\n* television by John Logie Baird in 1925\n* the creation of internet, WWW by Tim Berners Lee in 1990 -which leads me to a more *recent* prophetic warning.\n\n> ***“This much is known: For every rational line or forthright statement there are leagues of senseless cacophony, verbal nonsense, and incoherency.”***\n>\n> **-Library of Babel, Borges**\n\nTake notorious Latin American author, Jorge Luis Borges, famous for his magical realism pieces that beautifully incorporated the concepts of philosophy, infinity, labyrinths, mortality and more. Back in 1941, he wrote the short story ***[“The Library of Babel”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel)*** in which he constructs a metaphorical replica of the universe, and narrates the descent into existential despair of the civilization within. In almost an oracular way, Borges describes a universe manifested as a hexagonal library with infinite galleries bordered by bookshelves that contain every book ever written: past, present, future --*sound familiar?* Long before the existence of the internet, Borges wrote about the *pervasiveness* of access to excess information—how it ultimately is rendered a useless, noisy nightmare and as a 30 year old millennial, nothing resonates with me more than the dread and paralysis that stems from this. We are the *[consuming generation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337599/)* after all.\n\n> ***“For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\"***\n>\n> **-Genesis 3:5**\n\nThe Library of Babel serves as a perfect example of information both as salvation and as destruction, in good measure it redeems us from our ignorance, but in excess it becomes our own demise -a perpetual paradox.\n\n# Revelations\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/40SKhV1ZoyJe-vSQXAu-N.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n> ***“When it was announced that the Library contained all books, the first reaction was unbounded joy. All men felt themselves the possessors of an intact and secret treasure.***\n>\n> ***There was no personal problem, no world problem, whose eloquent solution did not exist-somewhere in some hexagon.***\n>\n> **The universe was justified; the universe suddenly became congruent with the unlimited width and breadth of humankind's hope”**\n>\n> **-Library of Babel, Borges**\n\n**Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop** -excess, unfortunately, is well embedded in our psyche, in a well known documentary, ***“Consuming Kids”*** it is revealed that Millennials were the first generation to be marketed to without restrictions, as deregulation of advertising in the mid-80s opened the floodgates for companies to indoctrinate us into consumption, before an entire generation was born, marketers had already determined how much business potential our over consumption would lead to. This indoctrinated behavior has permeated into everything else, not just food and products, but information over consumption, fueled by the removal constant of friction, buffering, as technology continues to develop.\n\nThough at the start, the internet felt magical, the concept of **“surfing the web”** led one to believe that it was a place for fun discovery, equal parts entertainment and enlightening, it was a place filled with hope. Similar to the biblical iterations of Eden or back to Borges’ example of **“Library of Babel”,** were the Librarians considered the existence of the library as the key to solving every single one of the issues in their world, and it was welcomed with ***“unbundled joy.”*** A sentiment that did not last long, and ultimately drove them mad, and to self obliteration, after all, in Borges’ own words, **“even the sun burns if it’s too much.”**\n\n***Analysis Paralysis*** \\*-\\*though it is a way to communicate as old as Roman times, the actual word of propaganda comes from the latin *propagare* or to ***“set forward, extend, spread, increase”*** and early on it was used to describe a group of cardinals in charge of foreign missions of the Catholic Church. Many considered that the first large-scale and organized *propagation* of government propaganda was brought on by the outbreak of the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War) in 1914. After the defeat of Germany, military officials like General [Erich Ludendorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Ludendorff) suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat. After World War I, propaganda then became a term that was used to describe a more [manipulative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation) approach, enter *hypodermic needle theory.*\n\n> **“Infidels claim that the rule in the Library is not \"sense;' but \"non-sense;' and that \"rationality\" (even humble, pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception.”**\n>\n> **-Library of Babel, Borges**\n\nIn the study of communications, [Hypodermic Needle theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle_model#:\\~:text=6.2%20Sources-,Concept,in%20the%201930s%20and%201940s.&text=It%20suggests%20that%20the%20media,straight%20into%20the%20passive%20audience.) was based on early observations of the effect of mass media, as used by [Nazi propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_propaganda) and the effects of [Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood) in the 1930s and 1940s. People were assumed to be [\"uniformly controlled by their biologically based 'instincts' and that they react more or less uniformly to whatever 'stimuli' came along\"](https://books.google.com/books?id=vIC92PdJ0l0C&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=People+were+assumed+to+be+%22uniformly+controlled+by+their+biologically+based+%27instincts%27+and+that+they+react+more+or+less+uniformly+to+whatever+%27stimuli%27+came+along%22&source=bl&ots=G3ABVKktRS&sig=ACfU3U0Kgxvj4_9GpuVpVQmnodUeYdPJ4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwilj6Dc_ov0AhWIFTQIHR0VBKsQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q=People%20were%20assumed%20to%20be%20%22uniformly%20controlled%20by%20their%20biologically%20based%20'instincts'%20and%20that%20they%20react%20more%20or%20less%20uniformly%20to%20whatever%20'stimuli'%20came%20along%22&f=false) this theory suggests that the media injects its messages straight into the passive audience, the audience is then immediately affected by these messages. Hypodermic needle theory assumes that the receiver is passive, in a way, information overload puts us in a state of paralysis, as someone with a background in this field, I have been preaching the use of ***“selective silence”*** and “***law of minimum”*** attention for years now. Focus only on what you can control, the rest will put us in a “passive state” unable to make a decision, enter the paradox of choice.\n\nAmerican psychologist, Barry Schwartz wrote ***“The Paradox of Choice”*** almost a decade ago. In this book he analyses the behavior of different types of people, ones he calls *maximisers* and *satisfiers* facing abundance of choice. He also makes a point that demonstrates how the exponential explosion in choice has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution, and how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse.\n\n> ***“Learning to choose is hard. Learning to choose well is harder. And learning to choose well in a world of unlimited possibilities is harder still, perhaps too hard.”***\n>\n> **-Paradox of Choice, Schwartz**\n\nBarry Schwartz found that having this unparalleled plethora of choice in the modern world was actually causing people to be less happy with their decisions. He found that instead of increasing decision satisfaction, having too many options made people less likely to be satisfied that they had made the best decision. While freedom is important, Schwartz explains that there is a fine line between having the freedom to choose what you want and being paralyzed in the face of too many options. ***If the medium is the message, what had the internet communicated ultimately, despair?***\n\nIn 2006, and only two years after the publication of Schwartz’s book, TIME magazine asked *[“Are Kids Too Wired for Their Own Good?”](http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20060327,00.html)*, consider that this was also at the time Facebook and “social apps” were rising promoting connectivity, and gargantuan marketplaces like Amazon promised us convenience in the form of options. By the year 2008, at a Web 2.0 summit, Mark Zuckerberg had [coined](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/zuckerbergs-law-of-information-sharing/) his infamous law, in which he concluded that the amount of information shared on the internet roughly doubles every year. A decade later, Tristan Harris, the founder of Center for Humane Technology and a technology ethicist, stated [technology had hacked our minds](https://www.wired.com/story/our-minds-have-been-hijacked-by-our-phones-tristan-harris-wants-to-rescue-them/), and two years after, the infamous [Buzzfeed piece](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work) was published, in which we were diagnosed as the ***“burnout generation\"*** —having internalized ***over-consumption* of everything: work, entertainment, food, clothes, etc.** The past 30 years since the inception of the internet, has lead us to a depressing state —*finitude projecting itself into infinity*.\n\n## Curation as Salvation\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xezC1spI5xldaIDB0o-rS.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nWorking backwards, we have arrived at our actual Genesis, how do we build a better way for us to digest information that doesn’t consume us entirely? The solution, though not novel, can be leveraged using our new found technology and learnings, to become our redemption via consumption: curation. The word itself has origins in Latin “cura” which means to *heal* or *restoration of health.* Curators were seen as guardians, or keepers -originally meant to signify someone who overlooked others care, it then was adopted to signify *“in charge”* whether it was museums or art galleries.\n\nCuration as the internet matured was seen as something in the shape of **“directories”** or **“algorithm based feeds”** all which end up being gamified, and in these cases the removals of friction tend to lead to the ultimate *destruction* of the inherent utility of these aggregations in the first place. Curation can be viewed as ***necessary friction*** that is needed to prevent the rise of ***unnecessary noise***, less of gatekeeping, using the internet’s ability to give access to the masses, and making curation be *participatory,* to discourage ***[\"a tower of Babel”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel)*** effect. Consider that in the early internet era, even with access to infinite knowledge, our most inherent traits as humans go back to tribalism, hence the rise of web rings. With the dawn of “web3” Discord chats are being leveraged into DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) a more modern take on original web rings, empowered with transparency and treasuries. The way into most of these new iterations of organizations comes through participation, *[“curation via staking.”](https://medium.com/paratii/curation-markets-infinite-staking-247e8b72caa3)*\n\nIn the end, one can see ***collective*** ***curation*** to be the path moving forward, and to go back to biblical prophecies mentioned prior, if biting from the ***“forbidden apple”*** made us *Godlike*, maybe the fault was in the individualistic approach to ***“an all encompassing being”*** -the internet has given us the opportunity to become enlightened communities, if we can leverage its ability to make tools and information accessible, into the process of creation via curation, utility to build forward, not get stuck in paralysis of choice or overabundance of noise. The Big Bang basically tells us that all of existence started with an explosion from one point that is continually multiplying, and as Borges eloquently said, ***“in an expanding universe, the concept of individuality is null.”*** We are ultimately no one, but we *are a collective, and these paradoxical truths exists ever growing farther away from each other.*\n\nAfter all maybe we are all here to solve life’s true mystery, how to use infinity to project finitude, either way, curation has always been and will remain, a form of healing.", "timestamp": 1636653715, "digest": "U800cex6AafjsoqmB0by1rYWVGzSke1sZa5j8yhA5uo", "contributor": "0x6847C39414f57Ce409004Ecd7f0f97Bb49738C2D"}

{"id": "DaPYFwdGpkD4y-Juu6ofFh2Y7i_1gyRa4SzZrhGt5hs", "title": "Move Towards the Playable NFTs: \nAn Analysis on LAND of GameFi \n\n", "body": "In traditional games, defence and plunder are the fundamental mechanisms that players interact with land resource, integrating into the 4X Strategy game with eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate as distinguishing features. Although the LAND in GameFi project haven’t been thoroughly involved with gameplay on account of its financial attribute, the utility of LAND is derived from exhibition to binding with the APR of staking, and then engages players to contribute to the community.\n\nThis article will briefly review the utility evolution of LAND NFTs and analyze the mechanism design on both playable and profit-driven GameFi projects.\n\n**1. Sandbox Games: Exhibit the Land**\n\nInitially, LAND was sold in sandbox games such as Sandbox and Decentraland, that give the player a great degree of creativity and strongly relates to the core feature of Metaverse, emphasizing sociality and user content generation (UGC). In sandbox games, LAND is used to display swanky and rare commodities or build a set of installation to interact with, which facilitates artistic players selling crafts in the second market. The value of LAND changes depending on adjoining business district thus many LANDs is occupied for advertising or building theme parks in the future. Though the LAND as a static asset with limited interactive functions doesn’t affect the game experience, players in sandbox games concern more about the sense of identity and social activity, hence the username transaction in Decentraland boomed.\n\nHowever, even if sandbox games based on UGC cultivate a stable user base and promote the secondary market trading, the gameplay only mastered by a spot of players as a creative tool that is not an entertainment with a wider range of audience. Additionally, such games aim to create a harmonious environment and Sandbox impose restriction on players jointing, encouraging the participation of individual artists to a certain extent, but it restrictes the development of guild economy. Therefore, landowners can't benefit more than the appreciation of lAND and token, lacking of direct incentives for such players to actively participate in the game.\n\n![The Map of Sandbox ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lW9tUl_ZyCwmV3U0pcGO5.png?height=436&width=967)\n\n**2. MMORPG: Manage the Land** \n\nIn massively multiplayer online games led by Ember Sword and Mirandus, LAND can be a differentiating element for the game experience: there are random monsters, NPCs and natural resources in remote areas; bazaars and small guilds gather in the suburban areas; while the largest trading markets and guilds are concentrated in the city. There are even more detailed LAND categories like kingdoms, capitals, and castles, which makes difference in prices. For instance, one of Mirandus' five castles, Citadel of the Stars, was bought by Polyient Games for $16 billion.\n\nIn addition to various LAND types, the elaborate premise and background story also make the land assets meaningful. Players write lore and chronicle about games in the Discord channels, demonstrating how a virtual world further deepen a sense of belonging to the land.\n\nIn this kind of games, landowners can be quite flexible on asset disposal and participate in the game through land management; whether improve the infrastructure, tax on the service and toll, or establish guilds to expand the reputation, players will be more closely connected with their land resources.\n\nNevertheless, the activity of players in such games largely depends on the development of player community. Taking traditional MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft and Fantasy Westward Journey as examples, these games need a stable and large group of players to activate the secondary market, as well as a centralized approach to innovate game versions and retain players. MMORPG combining with GameFi is better than traditional games in terms of incentive mechanism and asset ownership, but considering the small base of crypto players and the long period of development, it’s better to wait and see how the community play a role after the game launch.\n\n![LAND Introduction of Ember Sword](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f23aRIBYo728iIKQUTbNJ.png?height=624&width=1818)\n\nAll games mentioned above have one thing in common that the landowner can sit back and wait for the land to appreciate; instead, the mechanism design in following games that fuels landowners to involve in the community construction through subdividing roles of players.\n\n**3.Adventure Games: Empower the Land**\n\n**3.1 - Mines of Dalarnia**\n\nIn Mines of Dalarnia, an action-adventure game, land (planet) holders stake $DAR to keep the planet’s resource from diminishing and increase its attractiveness to appeal other players to mine on their planet; in turn, miner players need to pay the mining rent fee and the entrance fee to the planet owner. The economic system is functioned effectively that miners are highly mobile to mine resources and scarce equipment on a variety of planets and landholders are engaged in stakting on their own initiative to compete with other landholders.\n\n![Mechanism Illustration of Mines of Dalarnia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GZXlC44WehKJYDgBi20zF.jpg?height=593&width=984)\n\n**3.2 - Gold Fever**\n\nA similar design can be found in Gold Fever, an action-RPG where some players can buy a land license to become mine owners but can't directly mine the resources unless recruiting other players as miners, and they cannot get the reward directly because there are players form corporates and rainforest tribes to rob the treasure. The game attempts to restore the Gold Rush era and divides players into seven roles, making the action gameplay more exciting and the corresponding reward is also more generous.\n\n![A Gold Fever Mining Claim](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WM_QJzssuYMCOAdYKSYtg.png?height=316&width=590)\n\n**3.3 - Aavegotchi**\n\nAnother example is the Gotchiverse in Aavegotchi, an open-ended social space based on Gotchi NFT where players can engage in myriad minigames, the landowners or Gotchi players need to bolster their land parcels and build defensive structures to protect their resources from being collected by Lickquidators, the NFT which will be distributed via airdrops to free-entry players, and landowners also need to trod out to wipe them. Therefore, the game creates an asymmetry arena to enhance the cooperation between Gotchi players and landholders, and to attract new players through Lickquidator forming strong in-game competition.\n\n![Aavegotchi Realm](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XE4XElRebOKjYvnn5JMTv.png?height=602&width=621)\n\nThe three games above make use of asymmetric competitive design, that is, the mechanism divides the functions of players and correspondingly limits some abilities. On the one hand, it forces players to cooperate and strengthen the community strength, activating secondary market transactions and promote resource circulation. On the other hand, it reinforces the confliction of players that promotes resource consumption with higher reward and enable players to achieve play-to-earn that truly relies on strategy and skill to gain, returning to the competitive feature of game rather than using hype and gambling psychology to profit.\n\n**4.

{"id": "IvzGx2_TbdCZHldWR-nnjtugmf7JPN1UzSXYKpQBzWQ", "title": "Move Towards the Playable NFTs: \nAn Analysis on LAND of GameFi \n\n", "body": "In traditional games, defence and plunder are the fundamental mechanisms that players interact with land resource, integrating into the 4X Strategy game with eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate as distinguishing features. Although the LAND in GameFi project haven’t been thoroughly involved with gameplay on account of its financial attribute, the utility of LAND is derived from exhibition to binding with the APR of staking, and then engages players to contribute to the community.\n\nThis article will briefly review the utility evolution of LAND NFTs and analyze the mechanism design on both playable and profit-driven GameFi projects.\n\n**1. Sandbox Games: Exhibit the Land**\n\nInitially, LAND was sold in sandbox games such as Sandbox and Decentraland, that give the player a great degree of creativity and strongly relates to the core feature of Metaverse, emphasizing sociality and user content generation (UGC). In sandbox games, LAND is used to display swanky and rare commodities or build a set of installation to interact with, which facilitates artistic players selling crafts in the second market. The value of LAND changes depending on adjoining business district thus many LANDs is occupied for advertising or building theme parks in the future. Though the LAND as a static asset with limited interactive functions doesn’t affect the game experience, players in sandbox games concern more about the sense of identity and social activity, hence the username transaction in Decentraland boomed.\n\nHowever, even if sandbox games based on UGC cultivate a stable user base and promote the secondary market trading, the gameplay only mastered by a spot of players as a creative tool that is not an entertainment with a wider range of audience. Additionally, such games aim to create a harmonious environment and Sandbox impose restriction on players jointing, encouraging the participation of individual artists to a certain extent, but it restrictes the development of guild economy. Therefore, landowners can't benefit more than the appreciation of lAND and token, lacking of direct incentives for such players to actively participate in the game.\n\n![The Map of Sandbox ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lW9tUl_ZyCwmV3U0pcGO5.png?height=436&width=967)\n\n**2. MMORPG: Manage the Land** \n\nIn massively multiplayer online games led by Ember Sword and Mirandus, LAND can be a differentiating element for the game experience: there are random monsters, NPCs and natural resources in remote areas; bazaars and small guilds gather in the suburban areas; while the largest trading markets and guilds are concentrated in the city. There are even more detailed LAND categories like kingdoms, capitals, and castles, which makes difference in prices. For instance, one of Mirandus' five castles, Citadel of the Stars, was bought by Polyient Games for $16 billion.\n\nIn addition to various LAND types, the elaborate premise and background story also make the land assets meaningful. Players write lore and chronicle about games in the Discord channels, demonstrating how a virtual world further deepen a sense of belonging to the land.\n\nIn this kind of games, landowners can be quite flexible on asset disposal and participate in the game through land management; whether improve the infrastructure, tax on the service and toll, or establish guilds to expand the reputation, players will be more closely connected with their land resources.\n\nNevertheless, the activity of players in such games largely depends on the development of player community. Taking traditional MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft and Fantasy Westward Journey as examples, these games need a stable and large group of players to activate the secondary market, as well as a centralized approach to innovate game versions and retain players. MMORPG combining with GameFi is better than traditional games in terms of incentive mechanism and asset ownership, but considering the small base of crypto players and the long period of development, it’s better to wait and see how the community play a role after the game launch.\n\n![LAND Introduction of Ember Sword](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f23aRIBYo728iIKQUTbNJ.png?height=624&width=1818)\n\nAll games mentioned above have one thing in common that the landowner can sit back and wait for the land to appreciate; instead, the mechanism design in following games that fuels landowners to involve in the community construction through subdividing roles of players.\n\n**3.Adventure Games: Empower the Land**\n\n**3.1 - Mines of Dalarnia**\n\nIn Mines of Dalarnia, an action-adventure game, land (planet) holders stake $DAR to keep the planet’s resource from diminishing and increase its attractiveness to appeal other players to mine on their planet; in turn, miner players need to pay the mining rent fee and the entrance fee to the planet owner. The economic system is functioned effectively that miners are highly mobile to mine resources and scarce equipment on a variety of planets and landholders are engaged in stakting on their own initiative to compete with other landholders.\n\n![Mechanism Illustration of Mines of Dalarnia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GZXlC44WehKJYDgBi20zF.jpg?height=593&width=984)\n\n**3.2 - Gold Fever**\n\nA similar design can be found in Gold Fever, an action-RPG where some players can buy a land license to become mine owners but can't directly mine the resources unless recruiting other players as miners, and they cannot get the reward directly because there are players form corporates and rainforest tribes to rob the treasure. The game attempts to restore the Gold Rush era and divides players into seven roles, making the action gameplay more exciting and the corresponding reward is also more generous.\n\n![A Gold Fever Mining Claim](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WM_QJzssuYMCOAdYKSYtg.png?height=316&width=590)\n\n**3.3 - Aavegotchi**\n\nAnother example is the Gotchiverse in Aavegotchi, an open-ended social space based on Gotchi NFT where players can engage in myriad minigames, the landowners or Gotchi players need to bolster their land parcels and build defensive structures to protect their resources from being collected by Lickquidators, the NFT which will be distributed via airdrops to free-entry players, and landowners also need to trod out to wipe them. Therefore, the game creates an asymmetry arena to enhance the cooperation between Gotchi players and landholders, and to attract new players through Lickquidator forming strong in-game competition.\n\n![Aavegotchi Realm](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XE4XElRebOKjYvnn5JMTv.png?height=602&width=621)\n\nThe three games above make use of asymmetric competitive design, that is, the mechanism divides the functions of players and correspondingly limits some abilities. On the one hand, it forces players to cooperate and strengthen the community strength, activating secondary market transactions and promote resource circulation. On the other hand, it reinforces the confliction of players that promotes resource consumption with higher reward and enable players to achieve play-to-earn that truly relies on strategy and skill to gain, returning to the competitive feature of game rather than using hype and gambling psychology to profit.\n\n**4. New Scenario: Break the Limit of Land**\n\n**4.1 - Vulcan Forged**\n\nIn addition to increasing staking reward from the LAND, the reward token can also be burnt and achieve deflation. \n\nIn an open world game, Vulcan Forged, each time a landowner upgrades the LAND, the revenue of staking will be burnt, and once more than half of landowners upgrade their lands above level 7, 8 million coins will disappear out of a current supply.

In a world where there is an[ influx of information](https://blog.microfocus.com/how-much-data-is-created-on-the-internet-each-day/) and we are overwhelmed from living our ***extremelyonline™*** personas, an entire generation that grew up with the internet as novelty has now been dubbed the **“burnout generation”** enter the rise of CaaS, *curation as a service*, as a much necessary pushback against unnecessary noise.\n\n***“And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden you are free to eat; but as for the tree of knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat of it; for as soon as you eat of it, you shall die.”***\n\n**-Genesis 2:16**\n\nGood and evil in ancient religious texts is used as a merism, a combination of two contrasting parts referring to the whole, in this case to convey ***“everything*”** which can be looked at as a much needed warning against the overconsumption of information.Taking a bite from the **“forbidden fruit”**  leads to **“death”** a way to denote the pervasiveness to the oneself.\n\n**In the beginning, there was buffering** -the term as we know it over the Internet, happens where packets can traverse numerous routers from source to destination, and delays can be introduced at any moment. Throughout history, ***“buffering”*** has taken different kinds of forms. Looking back at the origins of mass media, it can be traced to the days when dramas were performed in various ancient cultures, think of it as early broadcasting. After that came the first dated printed book, ***“Diamond Sutra”*** printed in China way back in 868 AD, then came movable clay, these mediums, though innovative at the time, had a low spread, these physical limitations were the original ***“buffering.”*** Then in Europe in the 1400s, ***\"mass media\"*** was coined with the creation of print media, notable for being the first example of it as we use the term today. This form media creation lead to:\n\n* the invention of Gutenberg’s printing press in 1455\n* the first weekly printed newspaper in Antwerp in 1605\n* the invention of radio in 1895\n* television by John Logie Baird in 1925\n* the creation of internet, WWW by Tim Berners Lee in 1990 -which leads me to a more *recent* prophetic warning.\n\n> ***“This much is known: For every rational line or forthright statement there are leagues of senseless cacophony, verbal nonsense, and incoherency.”***\n>\n> **-Library of Babel, Borges**\n\nTake notorious Latin American author, Jorge Luis Borges, famous for his magical realism pieces that beautifully incorporated the concepts of philosophy, infinity, labyrinths, mortality and more. Back in 1941, he wrote the short story ***[“The Library of Babel”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel)*** in which he constructs a metaphorical replica of the universe, and narrates the descent into existential despair of the civilization within. In almost an oracular way, Borges describes a universe manifested as a hexagonal library with infinite galleries bordered by bookshelves that contain every book ever written: past, present, future --*sound familiar?* Long before the existence of the internet, Borges wrote about the *pervasiveness* of access to excess information—how it ultimately is rendered a useless, noisy nightmare and as a 30 year old millennial, nothing resonates with me more than the dread and paralysis that stems from this. We are the *[consuming generation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337599/)* after all.\n\n> ***“For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\"***\n>\n> **-Genesis 3:5**\n\nThe Library of Babel serves as a perfect example of information both as salvation and as destruction, in good measure it redeems us from our ignorance, but in excess it becomes our own demise -a perpetual paradox.\n\n# Revelations\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iXDn9zNCjvs4T4_v7yTTv.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n> ***“When it was announced that the Library contained all books, the first reaction was unbounded joy. All men felt themselves the possessors of an intact and secret treasure.***\n>\n> ***There was no personal problem, no world problem, whose eloquent solution did not exist-somewhere in some hexagon.***\n>\n> **The universe was justified; the universe suddenly became congruent with the unlimited width and breadth of humankind's hope”**\n>\n> **-Library of Babel, Borges**\n\n**Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop** -excess, unfortunately, is well embedded in our psyche, in a well known documentary, ***“Consuming Kids”*** it is revealed that Millennials were the first generation to be marketed to without restrictions, as deregulation of advertising in the mid-80s opened the floodgates for companies to indoctrinate us into consumption, before an entire generation was born, marketers had already determined how much business potential our over consumption would lead to. This indoctrinated behavior has permeated into everything else, not just food and products, but information over consumption, fueled by the removal constant of friction, buffering, as technology continues to develop.\n\nThough at the start, the internet felt magical, the concept of **“surfing the web”** led one to believe that it was a place for fun discovery, equal parts entertainment and enlightening, it was a place filled with hope. Similar to the biblical iterations of Eden or back to Borges’ example of **“Library of Babel”,** were the Librarians considered the existence of the library as the key to solving every single one of the issues in their world, and it was welcomed with ***“unbundled joy.”*** A sentiment that did not last long, and ultimately drove them mad, and to self obliteration, after all, in Borges’ own words, **“even the sun burns if it’s too much.”**\n\n***Analysis Paralysis*** \\*-\\*though it is a way to communicate as old as Roman times, the actual word of propaganda comes from the latin *propagare* or to ***“set forward, extend, spread, increase”*** and early on it was used to describe a group of cardinals in charge of foreign missions of the Catholic Church. Many considered that the first large-scale and organized *propagation* of government propaganda was brought on by the outbreak of the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War) in 1914. After the defeat of Germany, military officials like General [Erich Ludendorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Ludendorff) suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat. After World War I, propaganda then became a term that was used to describe a more [manipulative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation) approach, enter *hypodermic needle theory.*\n\n> **“Infidels claim that the rule in the Library is not \"sense;' but \"non-sense;' and that \"rationality\" (even humble, pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception.”**\n>\n> **-Library of Babel, Borges**\n\nIn the study of communications, [Hypodermic Needle theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle_model#:\\~:text=6.2%20Sources-,Concept,in%20the%201930s%20and%201940s.&text=It%20suggests%20that%20the%20media,straight%20into%20the%20passive%20audience.) was based on early observations of the effect of mass media, as used by [Nazi propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_propaganda) and the effects of [Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood) in the 1930s and 1940s. People were assumed to be [\"uniformly controlled by their biologically based 'instincts' and that they react more or less uniformly to whatever 'stimuli' came along\"](https://books.google.com/books?id=vIC92PdJ0l0C&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=People+were+assumed+to+be+%22uniformly+controlled+by+their+biologically+based+%27instincts%27+and+that+they+react+more+or+less+uniformly+to+whatever+%27stimuli%27+came+along%22&source=bl&ots=G3ABVKktRS&sig=ACfU3U0Kgxvj4_9GpuVpVQmnodUeYdPJ4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwilj6Dc_ov0AhWIFTQIHR0VBKsQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q=People%20were%20assumed%20to%20be%20%22uniformly%20controlled%20by%20their%20biologically%20based%20'instincts'%20and%20that%20they%20react%20more%20or%20less%20uniformly%20to%20whatever%20'stimuli'%20came%20along%22&f=false) this theory suggests that the media injects its messages straight into the passive audience, the audience is then immediately affected by these messages. Hypodermic needle theory assumes that the receiver is passive, in a way, information overload puts us in a state of paralysis, as someone with a background in this field, I have been preaching the use of ***“selective silence”*** and “***law of minimum”*** attention for years now. Focus only on what you can control, the rest will put us in a “passive state” unable to make a decision, enter the paradox of choice.\n\nAmerican psychologist, Barry Schwartz wrote ***“The Paradox of Choice”*** almost a decade ago. In this book he analyses the behavior of different types of people, ones he calls *maximisers* and *satisfiers* facing abundance of choice. He also makes a point that demonstrates how the exponential explosion in choice has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution, and how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse.\n\n> ***“Learning to choose is hard. Learning to choose well is harder. And learning to choose well in a world of unlimited possibilities is harder still, perhaps too hard.”***\n>\n> **-Paradox of Choice, Schwartz**\n\nBarry Schwartz found that having this unparalleled plethora of choice in the modern world was actually causing people to be less happy with their decisions. He found that instead of increasing decision satisfaction, having too many options made people less likely to be satisfied that they had made the best decision. While freedom is important, Schwartz explains that there is a fine line between having the freedom to choose what you want and being paralyzed in the face of too many options. ***If the medium is the message, what had the internet communicated ultimately, despair?***\n\nIn 2006, and only two years after the publication of Schwartz’s book, TIME magazine asked *[“Are Kids Too Wired for Their Own Good?”](http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20060327,00.html)*, consider that this was also at the time Facebook and “social apps” were rising promoting connectivity, and gargantuan marketplaces like Amazon promised us convenience in the form of options. By the year 2008, at a Web 2.0 summit, Mark Zuckerberg had [coined](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/zuckerbergs-law-of-information-sharing/) his infamous law, in which he concluded that the amount of information shared on the internet roughly doubles every year. A decade later, Tristan Harris, the founder of Center for Humane Technology and a technology ethicist, stated [technology had hacked our minds](https://www.wired.com/story/our-minds-have-been-hijacked-by-our-phones-tristan-harris-wants-to-rescue-them/), and two years after, the infamous [Buzzfeed piece](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work) was published, in which we were diagnosed as the ***“burnout generation\"*** —having internalized ***over-consumption* of everything: work, entertainment, food, clothes, etc.** The past 30 years since the inception of the internet, has lead us to a depressing state —*finitude projecting itself into infinity*.\n\n## Curation as Salvation\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2SgQpP46V4Fpp3-fTzAsq.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nWorking backwards, we have arrived at our actual Genesis, how do we build a better way for us to digest information that doesn’t consume us entirely?

In a world where there is an[ influx of information](https://blog.microfocus.com/how-much-data-is-created-on-the-internet-each-day/) and we are overwhelmed from living our ***extremelyonline™*** personas, an entire generation that grew up with the internet as novelty has now been dubbed the **“burnout generation”** enter the rise of CaaS, *curation as a service*, as a much necessary pushback against unnecessary noise.\n\n***“And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden you are free to eat; but as for the tree of knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat of it; for as soon as you eat of it, you shall die.”***\n\n**-Genesis 2:16**\n\nGood and evil in ancient religious texts is used as a merism, a combination of two contrasting parts referring to the whole, in this case to convey ***“everything*”** which can be looked at as a much needed warning against the overconsumption of information.Taking a bite from the **“forbidden fruit”**  leads to **“death”** a way to denote the pervasiveness to the oneself.\n\n**In the beginning, there was buffering** -the term as we know it over the Internet, happens where packets can traverse numerous routers from source to destination, and delays can be introduced at any moment. Throughout history, ***“buffering”*** has taken different kinds of forms. Looking back at the origins of mass media, it can be traced to the days when dramas were performed in various ancient cultures, think of it as early broadcasting. After that came the first dated printed book, ***“Diamond Sutra”*** printed in China way back in 868 AD, then came movable clay, these mediums, though innovative at the time, had a low spread, these physical limitations were the original ***“buffering.”*** Then in Europe in the 1400s, ***\"mass media\"*** was coined with the creation of print media, notable for being the first example of it as we use the term today. This form media creation lead to:\n\n* the invention of Gutenberg’s printing press in 1455\n* the first weekly printed newspaper in Antwerp in 1605\n* the invention of radio in 1895\n* television by John Logie Baird in 1925\n* the creation of internet, WWW by Tim Berners Lee in 1990 -which leads me to a more *recent* prophetic warning.\n\n> ***“This much is known: For every rational line or forthright statement there are leagues of senseless cacophony, verbal nonsense, and incoherency.”***\n>\n> **-Library of Babel, Borges**\n\nTake notorious Latin American author, Jorge Luis Borges, famous for his magical realism pieces that beautifully incorporated the concepts of philosophy, infinity, labyrinths, mortality and more. Back in 1941, he wrote the short story ***[“The Library of Babel”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel)*** in which he constructs a metaphorical replica of the universe, and narrates the descent into existential despair of the civilization within. In almost an oracular way, Borges describes a universe manifested as a hexagonal library with infinite galleries bordered by bookshelves that contain every book ever written: past, present, future --*sound familiar?* Long before the existence of the internet, Borges wrote about the *pervasiveness* of access to excess information—how it ultimately is rendered a useless, noisy nightmare and as a 30 year old millennial, nothing resonates with me more than the dread and paralysis that stems from this. We are the *[consuming generation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337599/)* after all.\n\n> ***“For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\"***\n>\n> **-Genesis 3:5**\n\nThe Library of Babel serves as a perfect example of information both as salvation and as destruction, in good measure it redeems us from our ignorance, but in excess it becomes our own demise -a perpetual paradox.\n\n# Revelations\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iXDn9zNCjvs4T4_v7yTTv.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n> ***“When it was announced that the Library contained all books, the first reaction was unbounded joy. All men felt themselves the possessors of an intact and secret treasure.***\n>\n> ***There was no personal problem, no world problem, whose eloquent solution did not exist-somewhere in some hexagon.***\n>\n> **The universe was justified; the universe suddenly became congruent with the unlimited width and breadth of humankind's hope”**\n>\n> **-Library of Babel, Borges**\n\n**Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop** -excess, unfortunately, is well embedded in our psyche, in a well known documentary, ***“Consuming Kids”*** it is revealed that Millennials were the first generation to be marketed to without restrictions, as deregulation of advertising in the mid-80s opened the floodgates for companies to indoctrinate us into consumption, before an entire generation was born, marketers had already determined how much business potential our over consumption would lead to. This indoctrinated behavior has permeated into everything else, not just food and products, but information over consumption, fueled by the removal constant of friction, buffering, as technology continues to develop.\n\nThough at the start, the internet felt magical, the concept of **“surfing the web”** led one to believe that it was a place for fun discovery, equal parts entertainment and enlightening, it was a place filled with hope. Similar to the biblical iterations of Eden or back to Borges’ example of **“Library of Babel”,** were the Librarians considered the existence of the library as the key to solving every single one of the issues in their world, and it was welcomed with ***“unbundled joy.”*** A sentiment that did not last long, and ultimately drove them mad, and to self obliteration, after all, in Borges’ own words, **“even the sun burns if it’s too much.”**\n\n***Analysis Paralysis*** \\*-\\*though it is a way to communicate as old as Roman times, the actual word of propaganda comes from the latin *propagare* or to ***“set forward, extend, spread, increase”*** and early on it was used to describe a group of cardinals in charge of foreign missions of the Catholic Church. Many considered that the first large-scale and organized *propagation* of government propaganda was brought on by the outbreak of the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War) in 1914. After the defeat of Germany, military officials like General [Erich Ludendorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Ludendorff) suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat. After World War I, propaganda then became a term that was used to describe a more [manipulative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation) approach, enter *hypodermic needle theory.*\n\n> **“Infidels claim that the rule in the Library is not \"sense;' but \"non-sense;' and that \"rationality\" (even humble, pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception.”**\n>\n> **-Library of Babel, Borges**\n\nIn the study of communications, [Hypodermic Needle theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle_model#:\\~:text=6.2%20Sources-,Concept,in%20the%201930s%20and%201940s.&text=It%20suggests%20that%20the%20media,straight%20into%20the%20passive%20audience.) was based on early observations of the effect of mass media, as used by [Nazi propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_propaganda) and the effects of [Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood) in the 1930s and 1940s. People were assumed to be [\"uniformly controlled by their biologically based 'instincts' and that they react more or less uniformly to whatever 'stimuli' came along\"](https://books.google.com/books?id=vIC92PdJ0l0C&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=People+were+assumed+to+be+%22uniformly+controlled+by+their+biologically+based+%27instincts%27+and+that+they+react+more+or+less+uniformly+to+whatever+%27stimuli%27+came+along%22&source=bl&ots=G3ABVKktRS&sig=ACfU3U0Kgxvj4_9GpuVpVQmnodUeYdPJ4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwilj6Dc_ov0AhWIFTQIHR0VBKsQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q=People%20were%20assumed%20to%20be%20%22uniformly%20controlled%20by%20their%20biologically%20based%20'instincts'%20and%20that%20they%20react%20more%20or%20less%20uniformly%20to%20whatever%20'stimuli'%20came%20along%22&f=false) this theory suggests that the media injects its messages straight into the passive audience, the audience is then immediately affected by these messages. Hypodermic needle theory assumes that the receiver is passive, in a way, information overload puts us in a state of paralysis, as someone with a background in this field, I have been preaching the use of ***“selective silence”*** and “***law of minimum”*** attention for years now. Focus only on what you can control, the rest will put us in a “passive state” unable to make a decision, enter the paradox of choice.\n\nAmerican psychologist, Barry Schwartz wrote ***“The Paradox of Choice”*** almost a decade ago. In this book he analyses the behavior of different types of people, ones he calls *maximisers* and *satisfiers* facing abundance of choice. He also makes a point that demonstrates how the exponential explosion in choice has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution, and how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse.\n\n> ***“Learning to choose is hard. Learning to choose well is harder. And learning to choose well in a world of unlimited possibilities is harder still, perhaps too hard.”***\n>\n> **-Paradox of Choice, Schwartz**\n\nBarry Schwartz found that having this unparalleled plethora of choice in the modern world was actually causing people to be less happy with their decisions. He found that instead of increasing decision satisfaction, having too many options made people less likely to be satisfied that they had made the best decision. While freedom is important, Schwartz explains that there is a fine line between having the freedom to choose what you want and being paralyzed in the face of too many options. ***If the medium is the message, what had the internet communicated ultimately, despair?***\n\nIn 2006, and only two years after the publication of Schwartz’s book, TIME magazine asked *[“Are Kids Too Wired for Their Own Good?”](http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20060327,00.html)*, consider that this was also at the time Facebook and “social apps” were rising promoting connectivity, and gargantuan marketplaces like Amazon promised us convenience in the form of options. By the year 2008, at a Web 2.0 summit, Mark Zuckerberg had [coined](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/zuckerbergs-law-of-information-sharing/) his infamous law, in which he concluded that the amount of information shared on the internet roughly doubles every year. A decade later, Tristan Harris, the founder of Center for Humane Technology and a technology ethicist, stated [technology had hacked our minds](https://www.wired.com/story/our-minds-have-been-hijacked-by-our-phones-tristan-harris-wants-to-rescue-them/), and two years after, the infamous [Buzzfeed piece](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work) was published, in which we were diagnosed as the ***“burnout generation\"*** —having internalized ***over-consumption* of everything: work, entertainment, food, clothes, etc.** The past 30 years since the inception of the internet, has lead us to a depressing state —*finitude projecting itself into infinity*.\n\n## Curation as Salvation\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2SgQpP46V4Fpp3-fTzAsq.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nWorking backwards, we have arrived at our actual Genesis, how do we build a better way for us to digest information that doesn’t consume us entirely? The solution, though not novel, can be leveraged using our new found technology and learnings, to become our redemption via consumption: curation. The word itself has origins in Latin “cura” which means to *heal* or *restoration of health.* Curators were seen as guardians, or keepers -originally meant to signify someone who overlooked others care, it then was adopted to signify *“in charge”* whether it was museums or art galleries.\n\nCuration as the internet matured was seen as something in the shape of **“directories”** or **“algorithm based feeds”** all which end up being gamified, and in these cases the removals of friction tend to lead to the ultimate *destruction* of the inherent utility of these aggregations in the first place.

Besides cracking the petaflops barrier, IBM hopes hundreds of users will decide to plug into their IBM servers a two-socket board housing the new Cell chips to deliver what IBM calls “supercomputing for the masses.”\n\nInstead of servers being plugged into a grid, why not use PCs and gaming consoles?\n\nI find this announcement to be kind of ironic since it was IBM that realized open source (the Apache Web Server) is more valuable than a centralized and closed platform, even if is somewhat open.\n\nIf I was IBM, here is what I would do.\n\nThe idea: Mixing different kinds of computers into a supercomputing grid to create an infinitely scalable supercomputer for enterprise solutions. Just as [SETI](http://www.seti.com/) and [Stanford](http://www.itjungle.com/tug/tug062206-story10.html) have created new hybrids of supercomputers for astrological data analyzation and Computational Earth and Environmental Science research respectively, a similar supercomputing hybrid model has yet to be adopted for commercialized use. This idea will allow users to submit their PCs or gaming consoles to the supercomputing grid, where they can be accessed whenever they are not being used, and will contribute to a commercially available supercomputer. By participating in this supercomputing grid, donations will be made to charities on the users’ behalf. These donations will depend on the amount of data processes computed on their machines. On the other end of the business, enterprises will be able to rent, lease, or even purchase data processing bandwidth. This will enable startups, small to medium businesses, and large businesses, to acquire computationally intensive processing power with extremely fast clock cycles which could easily deliver sustained petaflops performance and beyond. This would be the first ever cluster of machines available for commercialized use providing for cheap energy costs and cheap hardware costs. By participating in this grid, users will be members of ongoing charitable donations, and businesses will, for the first time ever, have paralleled computing power to the likes of SETI and Stanford. PCs were once thought of “business or research only”. Today, virtually everyone owns a PC. Supercomputers today are only thought of as “research-only”. This put supercomputers in the commercialized or “business” realm. IBM has just announced a new initiative to delver a supercomputer to the masses, as they predict an $8-$10 Billion market. Instead of creating a centralized supercomputer for the masses, this idea will create a decentralized supercomputer to the masses, that will exceed any one supercomputer.\n\nThat is what I would do.", "timestamp": 1636659283, "digest": "yuE5vZezcB6OBf8i5e7oD_AUIv41tCXBY-hvvmS-aR0", "contributor": "0x5828EcbA6057dE39dA53b5fab9B27114AaAe8541"}

The tools relied upon by Silicon Valley growth marketers over the past decade have largely evaporated in our industry, and we've been left with only a couple arrows in the quiver. Beyond meme contests and an active Twitter account, Web3 teams have relied mainly on token incentives for early adopters. Using tokens as an incentive, while successful in some instances, is more recently being called into question as it has trained parasitic behavior as users rush into projects with liquidity to earn tokens only to dump them and when the incentives dry up, say goodbye to those users.\n\n# Introducing Project Galaxy\n\n[Project Galaxy](https://galaxy.eco/) is building permissionless infrastructure for web3 projects that powers on-chain credentials with plug-and-play NFT modules. An on-chain credential system provides protocols and DAOs with actionable data to more effectively acquire and retain users. Protocols can build customized campaigns with plug & play modules to issue credential-based NFTs achieving all types of objectives: promote community engagement and retention, reward most active contributors, or allow users to stake in any designated tokens to mint NFTs that represent one’s contribution in the community.\n\n## Introducing Hashflow\n\nAt Lattice, we spend a lot of time monitoring community sentiment to understand how portfolio companies are tracking and how they can improve. Before launching Lattice, we invested in the [Seed](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hashflow-announces-3-2m-seed-round-to-bring-professional-market-makers-to-defi-backed-by-dragonfly-capital-and-electric-capital-301280935.html) round of [Hashflow](https://www.hashflow.com/). Hashflow is a new decentralized exchange that launched into[ Private Alpha](https://blog.hashflow.com/launching-hashflows-open-alpha-f7619a02b11e) in early August. The Hashflow protocol is unique in that it connects users on-chain directly to leading crypto market makers. It makes swapping tokens both:\n\n* Gas-efficient (\\~50% cheaper than Uniswap) - even with Uniswap v3, AMMs still offer high fees, frontrunning, sandwich attacks, gas inefficiency, and frequent [failed transactions](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d&__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=567a4d13ead9a2f3b9e78f9235fc46b186967ccf-1613059039-0-AZOqYWcjdbyywN9nZK7j41ukvEFAhMIIsHsdmoo9V697LmHRurAJD16ZbN7YQu9K9ilUGlb4MwpNv73xa1p1-RnkLCo6-UNeUBUpKDy4aKTGLZGkukfS9dGhxyP-Lt0NF2fYMN2ISlXxF583p1-l55Pl965UwJiPT2BmNc6Xv0QMl7CJ487b6vstQhZfUxy_u3NEFbJT5kY6YWOBcrM9a8EDFtiKnpT7VxhndDeaEonYdoy9UkXm5X9Km6_1mxe1LzjUlqAOxwRxhsUX4jQkDN1-6ZHwB6CPedvJXai5a8pntLirGxeQIIUR4-lKnw1hO0o_oWvOiZ7woe_rk2y6adpO2XjqnfeZrVCWFfvKLeuP4tLw7y-GMcNuGT5YJfZfGw). It is still unclear if any AMM will be able to solve these problems fundamentally.\n* Capital-efficient - as [highlighted](https://blog.hashflow.com/the-capital-efficiency-era-of-defi-d8b3427feae4) by Pranay, the baseline measure of capital efficiency is the utilization rate of assets. In the context of decentralized exchanges, we measure utilization in a slightly different way than for lending protocols: *Utilization Rate = Daily Trading Volume / TVL.* During Open Alpha and Open Beta phases, Hashflow showed impressive metrics: market makers increased TVL to [$1.2M](https://twitter.com/hashflownetwork/status/1447627774009643011?s=21), while the average daily trading volume during the Open Alpha phase was around [$3.2M](https://dune.xyz/Hashflow/Hashflow).\n\nDespite those compelling advantages, growing trading volume can be a challenge as crypto traders have many other options, both centralized and decentralized, and it is especially challenging when you don't have a governance token to juice activity.\n\n# The Hashflow <> Galaxy Story\n\nHashflow not having a token early led to some questioning from early community members. Even months before the release of their closed alpha product, most of them tended to be skeptical about the advantages of being an early user, even if the core team ensured they were having discussions about potential mechanics to reward early contributors.\n\nThen, we introduced [Charles](https://twitter.com/charleswayn) from Project Galaxy to the Hashflow team because it seemed pretty evident that it could lead to a great collaboration to incentivize and reward early community members with NFTs.\n\nIn September, Hashflow and Project Galaxy [announced](https://blog.galaxy.eco/hashflow-invades-the-galaxy-with-the-hashbot-d5f87cd07af1) a partnership to utilize the credential-based NFT infrastructure and launched the Hashbot Genesis campaign. They also activated an exclusive, one-of-a-kind NFT that personifies the badass tech powering Hashflow called The Hashbot. This 1st issue was claimable by all Private Alpha users. Since that first drop, Hashflow has been incentivizing its users’ thanks to the infrastructure provided by Project Galaxy:\n\n* Hashflow used Project Galaxy to reward the HashMatic Trading Competition winners by offering a Diwali-inspired, MATIC-themed Hashbot poster.\n* For Halloween, Hashflow released a special Hashbot art for the most loyal #hashgang members who continue to grow and strengthen the community.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tg_EIihGKLUyLPefTNd33.png?height=1833&width=4913)\n\nWith ten drops and more than 20,850 NFTs minted, Project Galaxy has been a great tool to show the community-driven growth of Hashflow truly its most loyal users own Hashflow. The goal has always been to distribute rewards fairly to ensure that Hashflow is owned by its most loyal users.\n\n> “ We have seen explosive demand around on-chain credentialing and on-chain marketing in the Web3 space. Hashflow's campaigns demonstrated how projects and DAOs can leverage the combination of on-chain credentials and achievement-based NFTs to bring the community engagement to the next level.”\n>\n> Charles Wayn, Co-Founder Project Galaxy\n\nOn October 6th, Hashflow [tweeted](https://twitter.com/hashflownetwork/status/1445887519342481420) that they crossed $250M trading volume. Metrics have been [growing](https://dune.xyz/Hashflow/Hashflow) tremendously since then.\n\n![The Galaxy Campaign also had a significant impact on Hashflow WAU's](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6uI_Qt3oYkjRhMevp3T-9.png?height=577&width=954)\n\n> \"We believe that NFTs are a great way to do brand acquisition and build the cult following. Project Galaxy understood this thesis extremely well and have done an amazing job at catering to our needs and feedback and executed flawlessly despite the pressure.  Can't wait for many more collaborations that lie ahead!\"\n>\n> Varun Kumar, CEO Hashflow\n\nThat is why we got so excited when we met the Project Galaxy team this past summer; they are changing how truly Web3 companies grow, putting more growth arrows in the quiver. Project Galaxy is building an on-chain credential system using NFTs, providing protocols and DAOs with actionable data to acquire and retain users more effectively. Protocols can then leverage these indexed and curated data sets to set up various reward systems for their most loyal users. With the explosion in popularity of NFTs this year, the token is no longer the only game in town to incentivize positive user behavior.", "timestamp": 1636659773, "digest": "IkNz6sQZgICuiOFqAoOxa8nlaNGrqlzvSMrL_xS2Drw", "contributor": "0x377B581957f447D2C56C08a0af23586c5a3B2577"}

{"id": "1TPUITZ62DP9R-U-7T7tm_UX_bBoMUdJoMpEqyFAGUM", "title": "The DAO: A Medicine for Ailing Capitalism", "body": "> *A rational mind does not work under compulsion… \\~ Ayn Rand*\n\n**To date**, most modern societies with powerful economies have functioned around some form of capitalism, or at least benefited from borrowed theories of such. And this is fine: Capitalism, when in a healthy, burgeoning state, encourages the individual accumulation of wealth through entrepreneurship which eventually stimulates economic growth through the tools of labor and wages. And when it works, it can work really well! In a capitalist society, you can have an idea and start a business on that idea that sells to others around you. To expand on that idea and further grow the business, you can hire other people to work on your idea. This provides you with labor, one of the most important tools available to us for the creation of wealth, and it provides the employee with wages, money that will then get spent back into the economy and drive further demand for goods and services. At its most fundamental, simplified core, we have just described a market and it is this foundation upon which capitalism tends to be built.\n\nBut there are some issues with this model that begin to arise once it reaches full maturity and these issues are starting to cause societal decay at the weak points in our current culture in the US.\n\nFor one, capitalist structures, whether businesses or markets, tend to be structured in a top-approach. There’s a founder, someone with an idea, a dream, a lofty ambition. They execute and craft a startup, a company, perhaps an LLC in Delaware, and begin looking for money. They network, call their rich friends, pitch their roadmaps. Eventually, someone somewhere will invest, usually for a piece of the company. They inject immediate capital in order to supply labor which will increase the total output of the LLC in Delaware and eventually, hopefully, generate value in the act of holding onto a piece of the company. At least that’s the bet. The problem with this approach is twofold: First, the labor hired is removed from the capitalist ambition as they are no longer free to pursue their own ideations and are instead a resource in the pursuit of someone else’s dream (a dream that won’t function without their provided resource, however). Second, this incentivizes endless growth wherein the dreams and ambitions are replaced with the dreams and ambitions of the investor, that is, making good on the investment. The investor wants a return. They want a 2x, a 5x, a 10x! Their ambition is regaining capital through market creation, and to them, business is the labor resource in play. Thus, the business owner is in a way working for the goal of generating endless returns of value to prove worth and provide wealth for anyone that owns stock or equity. This approach to economics creates a game of tug of war between all the parties involved wherein they all fundamentally need each other, but they wish they didn’t.\n\nI believe we are currently seeing the fruits of the endless pursuit of labor in the efforts of endless wealth creation for the consolidated rungs at the top. Companies have grown so large that their need for labor is too great and has created a world wherein the capitalist expression of free flowing ideas necessary for the creation of a healthy market is no longer possible: Too many people are needed to create the wealth of others rather than the wealth for themselves. This is stifling innovation and forward thinking problem solving and causing a regression of society where people are no longer incentivized to learn and educate themselves on new skills. People are instead encouraged to only reproduce a small set of skills only as needed for their place in the pool of labor. This is massively unhealthy in a capitalist society and causes the system to quickly collapse into a consolidation of kleptocratic oligarchs that aren’t easily distinguished from politicians.\n\nCapitalism also tends to produce a race to the bottom. The idea of capitalism on paper is that it would produce a race to the top where people compete on out besting each other in areas of innovation. The innovation is injected back into society and produces a net-positive for humanity on a whole and drives those that failed to innovate to work harder in the hopes of leap frogging the competition. It’s all a grand race pushing society forward. However, in practice, the modern company is one where the goal is to generate value in the company stock itself so that investors can generate wealth within the market. Remember, the company is just another rung on the ladder of labor. Because of this, the company must always look for ways to expand their reach, generate more goods, encourage more spending, and ultimately generate wealth in raising their valuation within the greater market. This is can be done by consolidating income and reducing spending which generally translates to reducing wages and cheaply importing parts en masse respectively. The goal is to be valuable, not necessarily to produce an actual good product or service. The focus is never on the ideals of the founder, but rather the play of the market. This can have dire effects that exacerbate the natural push and pull of the labor pool versus businesses. Reduced wages ultimately reduces spending and consolidates the sale of goods into luxury classes that can only be obtained by the wealthy (remember, in capitalism prices can’t be reduced because this would reduce the valuation of the business by generating less value against the strength of the currency); reduced spending results in market decay and eventual collapse into an effective Banana Republic as wealth further consolidates. In these kinds of scenarios, the market has functioned exactly as intended: It has generated ultimate value for the founder who has further generated value for the initial investor, but that value collapses in on itself if the market collapses…thus, we arrive back on the requirement of a balance between the labor and the business.\n\nNone of this is sustainable long term and it tends to create a dull and dimwitted society of laborers that are no longer encouraged or able to pursue the ambitions of capitalism and wealth creation on their own: They are locked into the wealth creation of someone else’s dream. But what if I told you there was a solution to all of this that still preserved capitalistic ideals?\n\nEnter the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, better known as a DAO: A new kind of company for the future. In fact, it’s not really a company at all, at least not in the legal definition. Famed crypto investor Cooper Turley describes a DAO as “a Telegram group with 10 members and 1 ETH”. At least, that’s one of his many definitions. A DAO is essentially a collective of people bound by simultaneous access to some form of capital coming together to generate value for a community. The biggest difference between a company and a DAO, though, is not the odd and informal structure of them, but rather the means of capital generation.\n\nIn a traditional corporate structure, capital is first injected from singular, or if not then a selected group of, individuals. This is the seed funding, the money that gets things moving. It may be personalized investments direct from the founder or it could also be from outside investors. This money is what funds the company year after year. DAOs, however, create their own value. People come together to fund the initial wallet if needed, but at the end of the day that idea of a DAO is that it is community run, organized, and governed and that this community is rewarded for the work through the DAO’s token. The token is the representation of value and the store of wealth. It is not a currency, at least not in the traditional sense we are used to with fiat banknotes and coinage, but it is a store of wealth and it is speculative by nature due to the value it holds inherently. This value is derived from the DAO’s communal worth. If people believe the DAO is worth becoming invested in, then they hold the token and the value of the token itself is irrelevant in regards to the value the token holder derives from it as a form of membership within the governing body of the DAO. The DAO is collective, collaborative, and self-managed by people who can come and go as they need. You can hold membership in multiple DAOs, work from anywhere, and create and receive value from your peers in the community. Your worth becomes merit based, wholly based on output of production.\n\nThis is in direct antithesis to traditional capitalism, where your worth is valued either as the resource of labor wherein you must fit into the goals of another individual, or it is value in whatever the market dictates your worth to be based on the performance of your goals. If you fall into the larger labor category, you have no control over your worth and you lose the ability to generate wealth except as a tool for someone else. In a DAO, you maintain your autonomy as an individual and agency as a human being. The value you bring to the DAO is directly rewarded in a form that brings direct and immediate value to yourself as a separate entity, but also in a form that directly elevates the DAO itself and injects value back into itself. If LLCs are oligarchies and dictatorships, DAOs are republics and democracies, directly governed by anyone that has the ability and ambition to do so. There are no gatekeepers here, there are no barriers to entry: Anyone can learn the skills needed to interact directly with the DAO and anyone can elevate themselves to a major role. There is no ceiling here and you are really, truly only limited by your own imagination and drive.\n\nAll of this boils down to two very important reasons for why DAOs are the only viable future for incorporating and federating an idea. First, they socialize controlling interest in the company and place power squarely back into the hands of the proletariat. They emphasize the role of the worker and reduce the unhealthy relationship between employer and employee by elevating agency and minimizing oversight. You keep your time and with it, you keep your value. Second, DAOs do all this without fundamentally breaking the capitalist pursuits of personal ambition, creativity, entrepreneurship, and accumulation of personal wealth. This isn’t some radical Communist restructuring of our culture or economy. Rather this is a new radical extreme of capitalism, a logical conclusion to an economic experiment that doesn’t end in misery for the bottom 99%. The DAO is an experiment in how a company can be successful and create value for society without exploiting the worker to do so, all while stimulating economics of scale in ways traditional markets normally wouldn’t be able to without breaking (directly injecting fiat in a traditional structure would simply cause runaway inflation and value would be lost, not created). DAOs solve every problem of capitalism with very few sacrifices and in many ways, should make pretty much everyone happy no matter their political views. It’s a fascinating development in the arena of work and forces us to face our preconceived notions about what work actually is and what it means to be productive. The DAO allows people to collectively work on shared ideas and solve shared problems without sacrificing their own autonomy to work on private projects.\n\nRight now, DAOs exist on the edge of an already $3T market cap industry. It’s time to pay attention. We exist in a world in decline — the current status of employment and labor relations is not sustainable. The market that governs such a system and allows it to propagate is not sustainable. These are fundamentals and should we stay the course, mark my words, the economy will eventually collapse around it or the society will crumble either into a Banana Republic full of wage slaves, or a chaotic, ruthless, unstable nation as people grow angry over the imposed status quo. Beyond complacency there are only two ways out: Restructure into a different kind of fiat economy (which itself is unsustainable for a variety of reasons) or accept that more decentralized structures that are capable of producing wealth for everyone in a meaningful way are the way forward. DAOs inject the system they inhabit with much greater wealth, creating structures of capital that current systems aren’t able to do with their limited top-down approach. Community is everything and with everything, a pool of liquidity is better than a single seed any one person can provide. DAOs will stimulate economic development, provide new capital streams to ventures that would normally go unfunded, and create massive value in society as a whole. Who knows? Maybe one day NASA will no longer have to grovel to the government for funding and instead will be funded by a community governed entity of passionate individuals that just love space. All that’s needed is a group of friends and some ETH after all.\n\nIt’s a new world.

And this is fine: Capitalism, when in a healthy, burgeoning state, encourages the individual accumulation of wealth through entrepreneurship which eventually stimulates economic growth through the tools of labor and wages. And when it works, it can work really well! In a capitalist society, you can have an idea and start a business on that idea that sells to others around you. To expand on that idea and further grow the business, you can hire other people to work on your idea. This provides you with labor, one of the most important tools available to us for the creation of wealth, and it provides the employee with wages, money that will then get spent back into the economy and drive further demand for goods and services. At its most fundamental, simplified core, we have just described a market and it is this foundation upon which capitalism tends to be built.\n\nBut there are some issues with this model that begin to arise once it reaches full maturity and these issues are starting to cause societal decay at the weak points in our current culture in the US.\n\nFor one, capitalist structures, whether businesses or markets, tend to be structured in a top-approach. There’s a founder, someone with an idea, a dream, a lofty ambition. They execute and craft a startup, a company, perhaps an LLC in Delaware, and begin looking for money. They network, call their rich friends, pitch their roadmaps. Eventually, someone somewhere will invest, usually for a piece of the company. They inject immediate capital in order to supply labor which will increase the total output of the LLC in Delaware and eventually, hopefully, generate value in the act of holding onto a piece of the company. At least that’s the bet. The problem with this approach is twofold: First, the labor hired is removed from the capitalist ambition as they are no longer free to pursue their own ideations and are instead a resource in the pursuit of someone else’s dream (a dream that won’t function without their provided resource, however). Second, this incentivizes endless growth wherein the dreams and ambitions are replaced with the dreams and ambitions of the investor, that is, making good on the investment. The investor wants a return. They want a 2x, a 5x, a 10x! Their ambition is regaining capital through market creation, and to them, business is the labor resource in play. Thus, the business owner is in a way working for the goal of generating endless returns of value to prove worth and provide wealth for anyone that owns stock or equity. This approach to economics creates a game of tug of war between all the parties involved wherein they all fundamentally need each other, but they wish they didn’t.\n\nI believe we are currently seeing the fruits of the endless pursuit of labor in the efforts of endless wealth creation for the consolidated rungs at the top. Companies have grown so large that their need for labor is too great and has created a world wherein the capitalist expression of free flowing ideas necessary for the creation of a healthy market is no longer possible: Too many people are needed to create the wealth of others rather than the wealth for themselves. This is stifling innovation and forward thinking problem solving and causing a regression of society where people are no longer incentivized to learn and educate themselves on new skills. People are instead encouraged to only reproduce a small set of skills only as needed for their place in the pool of labor. This is massively unhealthy in a capitalist society and causes the system to quickly collapse into a consolidation of kleptocratic oligarchs that aren’t easily distinguished from politicians.\n\nCapitalism also tends to produce a race to the bottom. The idea of capitalism on paper is that it would produce a race to the top where people compete on out besting each other in areas of innovation. The innovation is injected back into society and produces a net-positive for humanity on a whole and drives those that failed to innovate to work harder in the hopes of leap frogging the competition. It’s all a grand race pushing society forward. However, in practice, the modern company is one where the goal is to generate value in the company stock itself so that investors can generate wealth within the market. Remember, the company is just another rung on the ladder of labor. Because of this, the company must always look for ways to expand their reach, generate more goods, encourage more spending, and ultimately generate wealth in raising their valuation within the greater market. This is can be done by consolidating income and reducing spending which generally translates to reducing wages and cheaply importing parts en masse respectively. The goal is to be valuable, not necessarily to produce an actual good product or service. The focus is never on the ideals of the founder, but rather the play of the market. This can have dire effects that exacerbate the natural push and pull of the labor pool versus businesses. Reduced wages ultimately reduces spending and consolidates the sale of goods into luxury classes that can only be obtained by the wealthy (remember, in capitalism prices can’t be reduced because this would reduce the valuation of the business by generating less value against the strength of the currency); reduced spending results in market decay and eventual collapse into an effective Banana Republic as wealth further consolidates.

{"id": "8maJr4idv7_492I09N_QYJsHrWW5Pt1ccqwt5eYilX8", "title": "DAOs: Communities of the Future", "body": "## Some thoughts on community evolution from Web2 to Web3\n\nTo say that there has been a lot of excitement around [Web3](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-web3/) lately would be an understatement. If you live in New York like I do, you may have noticed that the city was absolutely buzzing with activity (read: [parties](https://twitter.com/lisaaxu/status/1456101000801046529)) last week around [NFT.NYC](https://www.nft.nyc/). It certainly feels like we are in the midst of a technological and cultural movement and at the forefront of something truly big.\n\nUltimately, everyone will explore and enter the Web3 ecosystem in their own way. For me, what has been most fascinating in Web3 has been the communities. Earlier this year I wrote about the importance of [community teams and software in the modern enterprise](https://lisamxu.medium.com/the-rise-of-the-community-department-232d427de65f), as well as the opportunity for [infrastructure to democratize digital community building](https://lisamxu.medium.com/the-next-generation-of-community-infrastructure-f9fc04031a9c).\n\nIn the context of Web3, communities are decentralized and they have a name: DAOs. DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and they are communities that are hosted on the blockchain and collectively owned by their members. In the past year, many community DAOs have risen to prominence, ranging from [digitally native social clubs](https://www.fwb.help/) to [NFT curator groups](https://flamingodao.xyz/) to [professional guilds](https://www.lexdao.coop/) (for more on DAOs, check out this great [beginners’ guide](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o) by Linda Xie).\n\nWhile I am still learning along my Web3 journey, I wanted to share some of my early thoughts on DAOs and why I am so excited about them from a community perspective.\n\n### The DAO boom\n\nDAOs have grown rapidly in the past year — there are now 1.3M DAO members globally, and DAOs manage over $14B in assets. Dan Wu coined the term “[DAO boom](https://mirror.xyz/danwu.eth/tshaD9QvkFLl8iLmzZjZ3g-0IcWWUY7App6SHTg5wDY)” to describe this explosion of the DAO ecosystem.\n\n![Source: Deep DAO (November 7, 2021)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*DQ5H5oD21Ek1ZaJX0209Bg.png)\n\nFundamentally, the growth of DAOs has been driven by many of the same tailwinds that Web2 communities are experiencing. Amid [rising loneliness](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2021/01/feature-the-loneliness-pandemic), people are increasingly searching for connection within digital communities — a trend that was only accelerated by pandemic lockdowns. On top of this, people are dramatically [rethinking their relationship with work](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1007914455/as-the-pandemic-recedes-millions-of-workers-are-saying-i-quit) and consumer adoption of crypto is accelerating — all of which is driving more people into DAOs.\n\nDAOs are not just another use case of Ethereum — they are organizations that give users a home to explore the entire Web3 ecosystem. Packy McCormick wrote in [The Dao of DAOs](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos-5b9): “If blockchains, NFTs, smart contracts, DeFi protocols, and DApps are the what, DAOs are the how.”\n\n![Source: Aaron Wright (@awrigh01)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*-GmAouO9JHLKXJgx)\n\nThe same forces that make Web2 communities so powerful (network effects, organic growth, collective wisdom, etc.) are the reason DAOs will ultimately play such a big role in Web3 discovery, exploration, and creation.\n\n## Web2 vs. Web3 communities\n\nIn the context of Web2, I generally thought about two types of organizations:\n\n1. **Community-led businesses**: Companies that invest in their community as an important moat or asset to the business, but make money from a separate product or service\n2. **Communities as businesses**: Communities that are expanding their monetization (i.e., paid communities), creating business models around community as the product\n\nWith Web3, DAOs combine the best of both constructs. They are communities at their core, so building a successful community is a first priority of the organization (unlike in traditional companies, where community can be one of many priorities). They also have a sustainable businesses model built-in because tokenization unlocks a multitude of potential revenue streams.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*N7URm25jGhmiA5InutHeMw.png)\n\nDavid Spinks wrote a great Twitter thread on [how DAOs solve important community problems](https://twitter.com/davidspinks/status/1455548391744700431), including contribution compensation (DAO members get financial upside for creating more value for the community), member decision-making (DAO members have real influence through voting), and measuring community value (the value of the DAO is reflected in the value of the token).\n\nAs I thought about all of the other challenges facing Web2 community builders, I really got excited about the potential of DAOs:\n\n* **Monetization** — Monetizing is a huge challenge for Web2 communities (creators still rely on brand deals and ads for [80%+ of their income](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-influencers-make-money-poparazzi-pops-to-the-top)) and requires a different skill set than building a community. With DAOs, every community member can earn through the value of their membership tokens. DAO monetization is still in its early days, but there are already many [widely used strategies](https://p.mirror.xyz/cVN3KOss0uqpZwxHQKtC4Syvn1RfXaxofFKHJuKLWS4), including NFT drops, membership fees, and token investments. This enables niche communities to become real businesses that earn income.\n* **Membership** — Web2 communities often struggle to define who is a member vs. a follower or subscriber (the age old community vs. audience debate). This ambiguity around membership makes it difficult for community builders to understand and serve their core communities. With DAOs, membership (and ownership) is measured in tokens, which gives members access to gated content, voting rights, etc. and a clear way for DAOs to think about their core membership.\n* **Scalability** — Community builders think a lot about how to maintain the quality and sense of intimacy of a community as it grows. I think this will be a challenge across both Web2 and Web3 communities, but the concept of working groups in DAOs helps with scalability. Within a working group, active contributors can make decisions within a specific purview, which means that groups of members can stay highly engaged and have clear impact even as the broader community scales.\n* **Engagement** — Many Web2 community leaders have talked about the concept of a “Dunbar’s numbers for communities” —that is, there are only so many communities that each person can meaningfully engage in. As a result, many communities have to invest significant resources and put in active effort (content, events, etc.) to keep their members engaged. With DAOs, members who hold tokens should be financially incentivized to contribute to the community on an ongoing basis.\n* **Data** — Web2 community data often lives in siloes, and entity resolution is difficult as members may use various aliases (names, email addresses, etc.) across different platforms. With Web3, digital identity is tied to a user’s wallet, which serves as their username and login to every platform, including DAOs. This (along with open-source data) should enable DAO leaders to have much greater data visibility across their communities.\n\nClearly, many of the advantages of DAOs stem from the promise of ownership, which blockchain enables. This is why many have called DAOs the [next evolution in online communities](http://next%20evolution%20in%20online%20communities).\n\n## Observations and opportunities\n\nWith the explosion of DAOs, [dozens of tools](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/organization-legos-the-state-of-dao-tooling-866b6879e93e) have already emerged to serve their growing needs. While it is true that DAO tooling is [nascent and insufficient](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze/status/1442674731627466753) today, I have been struck by how quickly DAO platforms have emerged.\n\nWith Web2, community operating systems like [Commsor](https://commsor.com/), [Orbit](https://orbit.love/), and [Common Room](https://www.commonroom.io/) came about to solve the data and workflow problems that already existed in the community tech stack and to coordinate across hundreds of existing point solutions. In contrast, even in the earliest days of DAOs, there are already many operating systems available ([Aragon](https://aragon.org/), [DAOstack](https://daostack.io/), [Colony](https://colony.io/), [Syndicate](https://syndicate.io/), and [Orca](http://orcaprotocol.org/), to name a few). This is no doubt because DAOs require plenty of complex infrastructure (on-chain governance, treasury management, compensation, etc.) in order to launch compared to Web2 communities, which can develop more organically and with less technical involvement. In any case, these DAO operating systems have become the central platforms for DAOs, which would imply that the ecosystem of DAO tools that is emerging should have a strong foundation to plug into.\n\n[https://twitter.com/JulzRoze/status/1452614226502107138](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze/status/1452614226502107138)\n\nOne thing that DAOs have in common with Web2 communities is that each community has its own unique goals and needs. Consequently, there is no one-size-fits-all solution that will work for every community. As noted in the Tweet above, modularity will be critical for DAO infrastructure long-term. Like Web2 communities, DAOs must be able to plug and play different solutions over time as their needs evolve. Given the existence of robust operating systems today, this type of flexible ecosystem should be very viable for DAOs.\n\nWhat seems to be a big gap right now between Web2 and Web3 communities is thinking about the end-to-end member journey. There is loads of friction throughout the process of joining a DAO. For new Web3 users, some of this friction comes from just setting up their basics (wallet, ENS domain, etc.) and getting educated on Web3 in general. But even for existing Web3 users, joining a DAO is a difficult and confusing journey. From my own experience, lack of context seems to be a major problem (i.e., what is this DAO and why should I join?).\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1443697228737138690](https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1443697228737138690)\n\nThere is a lot of opportunity for DAOs to implement some of the best practices that Web2 communities are already doing around onboarding, cohort-based learning, member management and connection, content production and delivery, etc. — all of which makes joining a community more approachable and more fun.\n\nAs the DAO ecosystem matures, not all DAOs will find product-market fit. Right now, there is a lot of hype around DAOs, but every DAO will need to build a sustainable community in the long run — especially as competition for high quality members increases. To that end, there is a huge opportunity to [bring Web2 community leaders into Web3](https://twitter.com/davidspinks/status/1455401264968200194) (which may also become inevitable as more Web2 communities turn into DAOs).\n\nFinal thoughts — I think DAOs are an incredibly powerful way of bringing people into the Web3 ecosystem. People are more willing to explore new things when they are a part of a community, and that is exactly what DAOs promise.

**但在看似複雜的工業生產環境中，其實同樣是以「人」來控制機器作業，故同樣須考量到使用者如何有效和機台互動，如何透過更好、更易用的介面幫助操作人員完成工作任務。**\n\n以下就來和大家分享我們在這個專案中的研究發現和設計考量，如何讓工業操作產品的「人機介面 」（Human Machine Interfaces, HMIs）設計的更加友善和符合需求。\n\n## 工業產品存在於混亂複雜的工廠環境\n\n工廠環境基本上是個混亂的世界（幾乎不如我們想像中、電視廣告上展示的樣子），為了進行研究，我們前往了台灣南部的食品工廠進行田野訪查，發現原來中南部大多廠房都是用鐵皮屋搭建而成，幾條生產線佈滿整個工廠環境，容納了各式各樣的產線機器，如填料機、殺菌機、包裝機、開箱機等，這些機器來自不同家廠商也有各自不同的系統介面和操作邏輯，幾乎沒有任何一家廠商可以包辦所有機台，故各個機器之間會盡量設計成能與其他機器設備互通或協同作業。\n\n> **因此我們在進行工業用機器介面設計時，也必須要考量使用者每日要面對多種機台、介面、系統組合這樣的操作環境。**\n\n而通常在工廠的作業環境下，工廠人員和管理階層最大的目標即是能讓生產線運作順利，因每天都有緊湊的製作排程或包裝任務必須完成，如何能夠運用最少時間、最有效率方式指派機器工作，隨時掌握機台的運作狀況並在意外發生前就能提早警告、解決，避免停機或其他麻煩的事件發生，這即是我們在進行介面設計時最需要考量的使用者目標！\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0\\*9cDjnyJXIUKk04Kj)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1856/1\\*6hV1gnUi52A6hDfkV9ghJA.png)\n\n想像中的工廠（圖片來源：Uplash）/ 遊石實際走訪的南部工廠\n\n## 工業產品的多元使用者與利害關係人\n\n工業機台由於硬體生產量大、服務的產業類別多，使用者可能散佈在世界各地且非常多元，如我們這次接觸到的噴碼機使用者和利害關係人就非常多種，這邊主要整理成三個類別：\n\n## **1. 工業產品開發商內部人員**\n\n包含行銷業務團隊、軟硬體工程師、售後服務工程師（FAE）、測試與維修人員等，負責確保機器品質與協助客戶解決問題，期望提供更易用、更具有市場競爭力的機器來滿足客戶的使用需求。\n\n## **2. 委外銷售代理商人員**\n\n世界各地都有負責銷售的代理商，負責販售產品給終端客戶、協助安裝和解決使用上遇到的問題，也會因地制宜提供不同的服務，如台灣代理商因地狹人稠重服務會親自到工廠安裝和排解疑難雜症、澳洲代理商則因所在地幅員廣大只能和客戶做電話或視訊溝通培訓使用者。總歸來說，代理商希望介面好上手、少出錯，能盡量減少培訓和售後服務的成本。\n\n## **3. 終端使用者工廠內部人員**\n\n主要包含管理階層和生產線上的作業員，工廠的產業類別從高科技、木材原料、食品、塑膠到化妝品都有，機器應用的情境多種多樣，而第一線作業人員通常教育背景較低、流動率較高，故管理階層需要控管人員避免發生錯誤操作造成損失，也要負責各條生產線上產品生產的高品質和高效率。\n\n## 人機介面 HMI 五大設計要點\n\n在此專案的過程中，我們運用使用者訪談和易用性測試方法，去確認改版的設計介面是否更貼近使用者需求、變得更加友善，在此幫大家整理了工業機台介面設計的五大設計要點：\n\n## 1. 避免過多的複雜絢麗的圖像設計\n\n雖然圖像化有助於使用者理解，但當沒有增加任何價值的設計被放入機台的介面當中，反而會造成閱讀上過多的視覺雜音和不必要的理解障礙，尤其是大部分工廠內操作機台的功能已經非常多元、複雜了。\n\n> **當加入更多擬真、3D、漸層、過飽和顏色甚至動畫的介面設計，這些不必要的功能和裝飾反而會增加使用者的認知負荷，讓需要每日長時間輪班工作的操作人員更快工作疲乏。**\n\n若以下圖為例，最左邊的蓄電池圖形較擬真、設計樣式也較好看，但展現的資訊卻最少；反而是最右邊的圖示看似扁平單調只有外觀與蓄電池相似，但卻能清晰呈現電量的上限與下限、歷史使用數據趨勢、時間單位等，能操作人員快速判別，增加閱讀效率。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/948/1\\*fCa4wgCQEz0cMT6VW-0cnw.png)\n\n*[資料來源：The High Performance HMI Handbook, by Bill Hollifield, Eddie Habibi, Dana Oliver, and Ian Nimmo](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/11/ux-for-the-industrial-environment-part-3.php)*\n\n## 2. 顏色使用需考量使用情境、硬體限制、慣用顏色，並納入無障礙顏色設計\n\n> **考量使用情境決定介面背景用色**\n\n一開始在顏色部分我們首先要決定使用深色或淺色作為介面底色，於是想先工廠的光線來決定介面用色，但發現不同產業的工廠環境差異實在太大，從明亮到陰暗的工廠環境都可能存在，故才決定捨棄環境影響因子，而改以使用者的情境做為優先考量，像是在使用過程中通常會花最多時間的即是文字訊息編輯或參數設定，故此相關設定的介面我們皆選擇淺色背景，以提供更清楚的編輯畫面，讓使用者操作設定上更精準。\n\n> **考量機台螢幕顯色限制、工廠慣用警示顏色決定用色**\n\n我們還遇到另一個狀況是此噴碼機的顯示螢幕和一般常見的手機、電腦顯色機制相反，當背景顏色越黑反而會消耗越多 CPU 的運算資源，造成運作不順暢甚至停機發生，故考量到此硬體限制我們須避免使用大色塊的黑色背景。另外，工廠已有運行已久的通用顏色規範，包含綠色代表安全、紅色代表危險、黃色代表警戒等，設計需要依循工廠的顏色規範才不至於混淆使用者。\n\n> **考量無障礙顏色設計**\n\n最後，由於使用者非常多元，且可能包含高齡者或是色弱人士，在設計上我們也採用國際通用的「網頁內容無障礙指南」（WCAG 2.0）規範，將背景和顯示內容的「對比值」調整至超過 4.5 : 1 ，確保使用者能夠清楚、快速的辨識顏色與介面呈現內容。\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0\\*aUTcsNvRH7Mi74jy.jpg)\n\n工廠常見的是警示三色燈，紅色、黃色、綠色各有不同的代表含義（[圖片來源](https://www.digitimes.com.tw/iot/article.asp?cat=158&id=0000552974_vyz8g4qc8le84t3bxubv5)）\n\n## 3. 盡量降低使用者操作與學習的門檻\n\n重新設計資訊架構階層（階層是指功能類別，同階層的功能應要互斥，上階層也要能涵蓋下階層）時要盡量簡化操作流程，並採用使用者普遍能理解的由上而下的階層方式（Top-Down Approach），方便使用者從大分類往下找且不需多次點擊才能找到目標功能。\n\n> **另外，也應避免使用工程術語來命名而是用清楚且貼近使用者的命名體系，也增加導覽列和快捷鍵、減少功能之間的超連結，以避免造成使用者在頁面之間迷失方向。**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2G5KMjHwCV7Rz1bbS2eAtw.png)\n\n競品M牌噴碼機的資訊架構堪稱清楚明瞭\n\n## 4. 加強警示功能與防止錯誤\n\n在工廠高速生產的環境中若發生機器故障，造成產線停擺是非常嚴重的事情，再加上工廠環境通常吵雜難以使用蜂鳴器做警報，幫助產線人員在巡邏或操作是能快速判別是否有錯誤發生非常重要。\n\n> **需要在介面上呈現明顯的正常、異常等警示，也要加強減少誤觸、防呆機制、撤銷功能、排除故障的功能，幫助機器在產線上能24小時不間斷的高效運作。**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1332/1\\*1eL4WRznuYlHpGhXfokwnA.png)\n\n競品M牌噴碼機介面以紅色警告產線停止，並出現「故障排除」按鈕幫助使用者立即解決\n\n## 5. 多以圖文並列展示，並考量元件的適應性與通用性\n\n由於使用者來自世界各個角落，其年齡、語言、文化、知識水平、科技熟悉程度、甚至手指粗度都不相同，還有部分操作人員不識字、或來自殖民國家而無法理解官方語言，故介面設計時要考量多個面向，也盡量讓圖示和文字並列，讓不同的使用者能更加理解使用介面。可思考的面相舉例如下：\n\n> **文字和圖示的選用是否足夠通用讓不同文化背景的使用者都能了解？**\n>\n> **多國語言該如何呈現不同的方向和文字長度？**\n>\n> **按鈕是否夠大讓白人或戴手套的人員也能方便操作？**\n>\n> **字體是否夠大夠清晰讓高齡者，甚至戴面罩的操作員都能看到？**\n>\n> **顏色是否清晰和符合網頁內容無障礙指南WCAG 2.0對比值？**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*lQ-bmLLvrmz7rKlH55jIHA.png)\n\n我們參考[Google Material Design Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline)的icons和用字來選取用更具通用性的圖示\n\n## 其他考量因素 — 產品藍圖（Product Roadmap）迭代版本的擴充性\n\n工業產品的軟體介面會受到硬體規格蠻大的影響，像是我們這次專案就遇到因硬體 CPU 規格不足而無法支援多功作業，要到下一代產品的硬體規格才可以支援，但本次所設計出來的軟體系統和介面也須同時考量未來硬體升級後更多整合設備或加入相關功能的狀況。\n\n> **在介面上應考量未來方便系統擴充的彈性，也須要考量到過去機台使用者對於前一代使用介的熟悉感，以及軟體上面操作的延續性，甚至能帶入使用者熟悉的消費性產品思維來進行介面設計，都可以幫助產品更符合客戶的產品發展規劃，以及使用者的使用習慣。**\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **考量工廠環境的限制和規範，避免過於複雜的介面設計造成使用者的認知負荷，顏色選用上也須考量顏色在工廠脈絡下的代表意義**\n2. **透過重整資訊架構、設計導覽系統、注意用字命名來降低介面的學習的門檻；並增加警示和提示，以減少錯誤發生的機會**\n3. **考量多元的使用者需求，盡量做到使用上的通用性並以能適應最大使用族群為目標**\n4. **工業產品需考量前一代和未來升級版本的功能延伸性與擴充性，更可以把消費性產品的思維帶入，幫助使用者更快上手**", "timestamp": 1636662536, "digest": "dM_UNriD9Q4H0yDorEFqKP09h_1C6vBLM5F9olPN3VY", "contributor":

To know where web3 comes from and what intentional direction was set. The intentions of people and how more people hijack them and how even more people come to re-instill them. And the same journeys we take in our innerworlds.\n\nIt’s important to do a Vibe Check!\n\nIt’s a game of building trust. And creating a space, for a centered being to arise.\n\nAnd then in this space, you meet people, from all over the world and worlds. Entrepreuners, Artists, Investors, Builders, Coders, Storytellers, Wanderers, Mystics. One of kind, of every kind.\n\nAnd then we drop all the charade’s of the personality, to be present and share a moment. And in that moment magic happens, intentions manifest through pure connection. A connection beyond time and space.\n\nIt’s a connection with yourself in the other.\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=686](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=686)\n\nCome experience that!\n\nThis is an invitation for those excited by this offering from [@KERNEL0x](https://twitter.com/KERNEL0x) to join the upcoming block KB5, which kicks off on the 28th of January, 2022.\n\nYou may claim this NFT as a referral from your future [friend](https://twitter.com/anujkodam)!\n\nYou still have to apply [here](http://kernel.community/en/).

{"id": "8d_PXaIuDA97PxD_I4AR2M8_rlBW-JoQ3P78tbCJASM", "title": "Delphi：元宇宙拓荒者游戏公会正处于爆发前夕", "body": "> 随着链游行业的强劲发展势头，执行差异化战略的新兴公会无疑拥有广阔的前景。\n\n撰文：Piers Kicks，Jayden Andrew，均供职于 Delphi Digital\\\n编译：Perry Wang\n\n以 Axie Infinity 为首的区块链游戏，将继续成为全球 NFT 交易量的重要推动力。\n\n游戏打金公会则开始通过提供奖学金等产生收益的策略组合，在多个虚拟经济体中推动经济活动。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/d66a0408c34544e68cc20f5bee0050f8\\_HE3DAKRVGEYA.png)\n\nYield Guild 作为链游打金运动的先驱，已经抢在所有竞争对手之前实现了「逃逸速度」，因此他们现正在积极投资其他打金公会以及游戏内资产 (NFT) ，以及其他代币（例如治理代币）。尽管 YGG 声名更为显赫，但实际上另外一家游戏公会 BlackPool 持有的 NFT 资产（尽管其 AUM 相比下要小得多）还要略高于 Yield Guild （1780 万美元对 1760 万美元）。两家公会都非常重视 Axie Infinity 生态系统，但 BlackPool 手中权重最高的项目是 Sorare——它几乎 70% 的收入来自这款游戏。作为参考，Yield Guild 仍然 100% 的收入来自 Axie。\n\n随着投资者对这些令人兴奋的虚拟新经济体的兴趣不断增长，Yield Guild 等项目的资金深度、广度和积极管理性质实际上成了该领域的强大指数。随着区块链游戏领域的强劲发展势头，新兴公会结构的前景一片光明。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/e66da727549048e68741cd6406d2ea4f_HE3DAKRVGEYA.png)\n\nAxie Infinity 作为链游边玩边赚（Play-to-Earn，P2E） 概念的实践先驱，在今年第三季度迅速崛起。就所产生的营收而言，它现在在加密领域中仅次于以太坊。它引起外界对链游这一行业的极大关注，并已成为链游市场整体健康状况的有力指标。其经济和用户群的惊人增长，使得许多人将其与 Candy Crush 等游戏随着移动端的 F2P 模式而出现的曲棍球杆增长相提并论。 Axie 正在积极将数百万链游玩家带进区块链领域，验证了游戏很可能成为全球采用区块链的特洛伊木马这一论点。要更深入地了解 Axie 的崛起，请查看我们对 Axie Infinity 的报告系列，其中解释了这个迷人的虚拟经济背后的一些核心机制。\n\n我们同时看到，在这些经济体中出现了采用多种收益策略的很多打金公会出现，以谋求在链游这一新领域赚得盆满钵满。一般来说，公会活动体现在提供奖学金、投资核心游戏资产（要部署的 NFT + 游戏代币本身），甚至将资源分配给新的公会，正如 Yield Guild Games (YGG) 所率先落实的那样。.\n\nYield Guild 创立了 P2E 链游 DAO 的概念，同时受益于他们的先发优势。在由 Delphi、BITKRAFT 和 a16z 领投的连续多轮投资中，很早就得到了实力雄厚投资机构的支持，已经成为这个新兴行业的强大指数，我们将在下文中具体探讨。 Yield Guild 不仅成功地成为 Axie Infinity 链游中最大的奖学金提供者，而且其投资部门还从许多领先区块链游戏买进了大量资产，并为有希望推出的新项目进行了种子投资。作为最知名的 P2E DAO， Yield Guild 能够获得优惠的投资条款，并作为新兴链游早期玩家的流动性来源。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/3c07512f95c74121a02e0c9fedd75447\\_HE3DAKRVGYZA.png)\n\n自成立以来，Yield Guild 一直打算运营覆盖众多游戏或区域的各种 subDAO，以适应快速增长，并为其用户提供参与的细腻粒度，而不仅限于一个覆盖更广泛的公会。如上图所示，您可以将 YGG 视为一个多细胞有机体，其子单元负责维持整体。下图进一步说明了 subDAO 的概念。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/07703859fb6644b2bd53a79e43d1748d_HE3DAKRVGAZA.png)\n\nYield Guild 早于其他项目实现了逃逸速度，能够为新的第三方公会提供早期财务和运营支持，在其不断发展的生态系统中创造强大的协同效应。 BlackPool 是另一个开始探索与 Yield Guild 类似协同效应的公会（创始人 Julien Bouteloup 是 YGG 顾问）。 该公会成立于 2020 年 9 月，自称拥有更丰富的量化手段。它在战略、游戏重点和整体收入构成方面与 YGG 不同。 我们在下表中对两个公会的高级数据予以了展示。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/1abc479acc394544800e0734d51e4434\\_HE3DAKRVGEYA.png)\n\nAxie Infinity 和 Sorare 两个链游合计占到 Yield Guild Games 和 BlackPool 所拥有的大部分资产 ，如下图所示。 当考虑到公会产生的大部分 P2E 收入来自这两个游戏中，这一构成图是有道理的，我们将在本报告的后面部分进行探讨。随着时间推移，随着越来越多的经济体通过强大的 P2E 经济而上线，我们预计这一市场会进一步呈现多元化。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/d66a0408c34544e68cc20f5bee0050f8\\_HE3DAKRVGEYA.png)\n\n我们已经在这两个公会之间看到了其游戏和资产重点的分歧。随着时间推移，随着虚拟经济的可投资和「可耕种」领域不断扩大，我们很可能会看到不同公会专注深耕某些游戏生态系统和地理区域。这正契合了我们在 Yield Guild 身上看到的「Guild of Guilds」（公会的公会）战略，他们正是通过这一战略在全球范围内广泛吸纳不同链游社区的资产。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/fcaf8739a0424c528c6c826f50ecbb25\\_HE3DAKRVGEYA.png)\n\n上图显示了 Yield Guild 所管理的总资产，包括 NFT 和 ERC-20 代币。 如您所见，从 6 月到 7 月，其总资产管理规模大幅增加。 该公会 7 月 27 日所推出的 YGG 治理代币是个很好的解释。 YGG 代币发布后，133,333,334 个 YGG 代币被添加到 Yield Guild Games 的金库中，用于未来筹款和 DAO 的长期管理。 YGG 价格在 9 月底遇到小幅下滑，是更广泛的市场抛售影响整体治理代币的大趋势结果——YGG 总代币供应的 13.3% 目前由该公会金库持有。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/c11b5fd8280045eeb2e46315666eed88\\_HE3DAKRVGEYA.png)\n\n上面表格突出显示了 Yield Guild Games 在 2021 年在 P2E 系统中所做的投资。他们最近对 Merit Circle 的 17.5 万美元投资，证明了他们对入局的其他公会的合作态度。加密游戏生态系统正在快速发展，因此支持小型项目起步是很有意义的。通过对有前景的新项目进行早期投资，Yield Guild Games 正在巩固自己作为这个新兴领域最大指数的地位，同时最大限度地提高这些早期项目的成功前景。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/f4a32cf2b33f4302a1341ee2b0281bbf_HE3DAKRVGEYA.png)\n\n如上所示，自 2020 年 11 月以来，Yield Guild Games 的 Discord 成员数目显著增加，但真正的增长开始于 2021 年 7 月 YGG 代币推出之时，成为代币成为社区团结起来力量的另一个明显实例。从 6 月到 2021 年 10 月，Yield Guild Games 的 Discord 会员数量从 19,546 人增加到超过 62,545 人，增长了 220%。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/0eb73df783cd4c0395c9e45e1499e18b_HE3DAKRVGEYA.png)\n\n今年早些时候，Axie Infinity 由于存在滥用情况而限制了游戏中的某些行为，这影响了奖学金游戏玩家的成长，如上图所示。尽管存在这个暂时的瓶颈，但预计在不久的将来会实施面向所有人的解决方案。我们预计这将会刺激在 Axie 经济中运作的很多打金公会和奖学金项目的活跃程度。\n\nYield Guild 奖学金玩家、Discord 成员和社区成员的绝对数量增长，更巩固了该公会作为玩家流动性来源的重要地位。 因此，Yield Guild 已成为链游领域新项目一种非常有用的资源，而不仅仅会带来纯粹的财务和运营支持。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/a4defc936a4d40bdb3275bb8cd948c88\\_HE3DAKRVGEYA.png)\n\n自 2021 年初以来，BlackPool 的奖学金玩家社区迅速壮大，如上图所示。从 1 月 1 日的 21 名奖学金玩家到 10 月 3 日的 482 名，增长了 2195%。 继 BlackPool 在 Sorare 抢占主导地位之后，很高兴看到他们的第二个强劲收入来源中取得有利进展。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/b7c6abac9e5641d193dcaea7651611ea_HE3DAKRVGEYA.png)*公会收入。来源 ：Axie Infinity & Sorare*\n\n上图说明了两个公会每周和累积的小爱情药水（SLP）收入。从 Axie Infinity 所获得的 SLP，目前分别占 Yield Guild Games 和 BlackPool Finance 总收入的 100% 和 30.5%。 而随着新的加密游戏经济体的成熟，我们预计其收入来源未来同样会出现多元化趋势。 一个明显的趋势是：SLP 价格对公会盈利能力的主要影响，我们将在下文探讨。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/ca28d345de1d4db69c7935ee4e501aaf_HE3DAKRVGEYA.png)\n\n上图显示 SLP 价格自 7 月下旬以来呈下降趋势。 这与 SLP 净供应量变化在同一时间段内的增长保持了一致。由此我们可以得出，玩家（赢得比赛）所铸造的 SLP 供过于求，而销毁的 SLP(繁殖 Axies) 匹配不足。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/de9c6593861544b3a0a87d0f066c1f8e_HE3DAKRVGEYA.png)\n\n如上图所示，来自 Ronin 区块链的 SLP 净负流量似乎与 SLP 的价格下跌趋势保持了一致。相反，流向 Ronin 的 SLP 净正流量此前已推动了 SLP 的价格上涨。尽管我们需要更多数据来确定这种关系的关联强度，但确实值得深思。最近流向 Ronin 的 SLP 净正流量可能暗示，SLP 价格在不久的将来可能出现趋势逆转，进一步增强了游戏中奖学金计划的吸引力。如果 SLP 价格和 SLP Ronin 网桥净流量之间的动态关系经验证成立，对于那些严重依赖 Axie 创收的人来说，它将被证明是判断 SLP 价格走向以及公会收入的强大先行指标。\n\nSorare 的 P2E 系统与 Axie Infinity 不同，因为 Sorare 中没有类似 AXS 或 SLP 的原生代币。相反，玩家会获得 Sorare NFT （玩家卡本身）。 玩家所获得的 NFT，具体取决于他们在排名中的位置和锦标赛类型。此外，玩家可以根据表现赚取 ETH。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/c0fe748ca27843e09bb32888c2756005\\_HE3DAKRVGQYA.png)\n\n上图显示了 BlackPool 所管理的 Sorare 资产随着时间的变化，其中资产管理规模（AUM）一直在稳步增长。 值得考虑的事情是，Sorare 是一项梦幻足球游戏，意味着每个月具有不同的赛季区别，有时有各支国家队所参加的比赛（没有联赛比赛），而夏天很少有比赛。\n\n最近，我们看到 Sorare 增加了新的动态奖励，登上领奖台的位置可以获得更多 ETH 奖励。几个月前，我们还看到了一个其新推出了一个新的 Unique 分支。其中只允许使用 Unique 卡，获胜者将获得该分区的所有奖励，最高可达 4 ETH。 因此随着时间推移，我们可能预计玩家在 Sorare 中的收入将逐渐由 ETH 而非 Sorare NFT 构成。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/fdd30d02110242c48baff14ff420cef2\\_HE3DAKRVGEYA.png)\n\n如上图所示，自 7 月 27 日在 Sushiswap 的 MISO 平台上市以来，YGG 代币的市场表现优于 BPT。 YGG 背后强大的机构支持，似乎为该代币提供了广泛的支持基础。 Yield Guild Games 在媒体上的曝光率明显更高，且作为该领域率先上市的公会，显然具有强大的品牌吸引力。 值得注意的是，BPT 尚未全额上市，而是对早期社区进行了空投，之后它开始在 SushiSwap 上交易（最初价格为 1.50 美元）。 BPT 代币更大规模的销售可能会在未来的某个时候发生。\n\n### 总结\n\n加密游戏在 2021 年呈现爆炸式增长，Axie Infinity 引发的兴趣特别大，出乎所有人的意料。随着世界慢慢开始关注这种迷人的虚拟经济新范式，投资者正在积极寻求新的途径，多元化地参与该行业。链游的迅猛发展速度，意味着新项目想要后来居上或者追赶领先者的难度很高，因此被动指数对许多人来说是一个有吸引力的参照物。在这些作为链游代理的打金公会中，这些新兴的「P2E」经济体的前沿仍然存在相当激烈的竞争（和被动性）。\n\n例如，更多传统的私募市场投资者无法或不一定想要直接获得代币敞口，但可能会选择投资于（跨平台应用发行商） Animoca Brands 之类的项目。仅在今年，[该公司就凭借其对 Axie Infinity、Immutable 和 Dapper Labs NFT 等链游和基础设施的投资组合](https://www.animocabrands.com/investment-portfolio)，以 20 亿美元估值募集了 2.03 亿美元投资。值得注意的是，我们也开始看到传统公开市场产品提供向元宇宙相关公司的投资组合，例如 Matthew Ball 由 Roundhill （AUM 为 1.23 亿美元）提供支持的 [$META ETF](https://www.ballmetaverse.co/why-a-metaverse)。如果进一步向直接持有代币敞口迈进，我们会看到市场上存在 IndexCoop 的「[元宇宙指数](https://www.indexcoop.com/mvi)」（市值 2362 万美元）或 PieDAO 的「[$PLAY 指数](https://www.piedao.org/#/pie/0x33e18a092a93ff21ad04746c7da12e35d34dc7c4)」（市值 250 万美元）。虽然这两种都是间接持有流动代币的敞口工具，但与 Yield Guild （8.75 亿美元的资产管理规模）这类项目的深度、广度和积极管理的性质相比，它们显得弱不经风。\n\n我们 Delphi 投资 Yield Guild 的部分理论在于， Yield Guild 不仅投资更多早期阶段的链游项目，而且其游戏金库机制实际上可以为元经济中的投资者提供资产代理。您是否更看好一款游戏或地区，胜过另一个游戏？ 您可以专门投资其中某一个 subDAO （或微指数）。如果您更看好在整体公会特定的收益策略，您可以在 YGG 机\\*池中\\*\\*流动性，以获得该特定活动的奖励。对于那些不想过于密切接触的人来说，还有一个机枪池可以从 YGG 的所有策略中获得代币奖，相当于一个超级指数。\n\n除了提供比其他指数颗粒度更高的参与度外， Yield Guild 还能够通过未来令牌简单协议（SAFT）框架、公开销售和其他类型产生收入的游戏内资产，在最早阶段参与最具吸引力的（通常是场外）交易。 许多有前途的新游戏项目都涌向 Yield Guild 寻求支持，因为 Yield Guild 提供了资本、玩家流动性和运营支持的独特组合。由于 Yield Guild 身处 P2E 链游风暴眼的中心，能够投资于自己的 subDAO 以及可能正在运行独特策略的第三方公会——这是一种在其他地方还无法提供的产品。不可否认，对于许多人来说这是一个非常引人注目的价值主张，而他们的社区、管理的资产和市值的快速增长都证明了这一点。\n\n鉴于链游行业的强劲发展势头，执行差异化战略的新兴公会无疑拥有广阔的前景。随着越来越多的公会出现，满足对参与新虚拟经济的结构化机会不断增长的需求，我们很可能会看到这种模式的持续进化演变。随着链游市场的蛋糕快速增大，目前公会之间存在合作的空间——和谐多于矛盾。 不过，在未来十年，随着世界上最大的游戏和公会经济开始成熟，我们很可能会横跨数百个虚拟世界的游戏市场中看到：数以百万人分属众多派系而上演史诗般的争斗。 元宇宙的拓荒者已经到来。\n\n**#欢迎下载链闻 APP

年全球游戏市场报告》，报告内容及相关数据显示，全球游戏市场今年预计将创造超过 1700 亿美元的收入。\n\n另一方面，利用区块链技术解决传统游戏中心化、不透明等痛点的链游的发展同样迅猛。DappRadar 数据显示，截至 2021 年 11 月 10 日，全网累计已有 1070 个游戏类 Dapp 上线部署，并且单日的交易额及用户量分别于 10 月 1 日和 7 日达到峰值，其中最高日交易额达到 4.84 亿美元，单日最大用户量达到 133 万人。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/dfc3d8b3212d48d28481825be906fea6\\_GE2DONRKGU2DQ.png)\\\n\n\n而其中，以 Play-to-Earn（边玩边赚）经济模型为代表的链游近期表现则异常瞩目。11 月 7 日，CMC 数据显示，Play-to-Earn 类代币总市值已突破 250 亿美元，创下了历史新高。\n\n不断攫取游戏玩家、加密从业者目光的同时，机构也被吸引加速进场，无论是传统游戏厂商转型还是加密资本成立的链游平台接下来都将为链游市场注入源源不断的动力，下面区块律动 blockbeats 将为大家盘点众多知名的游戏平台及其链游项目。\n\n#### Animoca Brands\n\nAnimoca Brands 是一家总部位于香港的澳大利亚移动游戏开发公司，成立于 2014 年，其通过收购游戏公司及推出原创游戏，并积极投资相关基础设施及周边公会，如元宇宙 The Sandbox、游戏公会 Yield Guild Games、赛车游戏 REVV Racing、F1 Delta Time 等。\n\n今年 10 月 20 日，Animoca Brands 完成 6,500 万美元融资，融资前估值为 22 亿美元。本轮的投资者包括：自由城风险投资公司（Liberty City Ventures）、育碧娱乐、红杉中国（Sequoia China）、蜻蜓资本（Dragonfly Capital）、Com2uS、Kingsway Capital、10T Holdings、Token Bay Capital、Smile Group、Tess Ventures、MSA Capital、Octava Fund、Adit Ventures、夏焱资本（Summer Capital）、Sigitech Holdings、Black Anthem Ltd、Mirana Corp 以及 Justin Sun。该笔资金将用于资助策略投资和收购、产品开发以及获得流行知识产权的许可权。\n\n#### Dapper Labs\n\nDapper Labs 由加密爱好者 Roham 和 Dieter Shirley 于 2012 年创办，同时创始人 Dieter Shirley 也是 ERC-721 标准的主要发起人之一。2017 年 11 月，Dapper Labs 旗下基于 ERC-721 标准的加密猫游戏 CryptoKitties 正式问世。此外，由于去中心化游戏和加密收藏品等应用对区块链提出了更高的扩展性要求，Dapper Labs 后来开发了快速且更加友好的区块链网络 Flow。\n\n另一方面，今年年初 Dapper Labs 旗下的 NFT 项目 NBA Top Shot 也在行业中快速火热出圈。9 月 22 日，Dapper Labs 宣布完成 Coatue 领投的 2.5 亿美元融资，a16z、Google Ventures、Version One Ventures 参投，Dapper Labs 估值已达 76

"早安，好心情，用手握住人生的缘分，用心守住友谊的情感，用币乎送上心中的祝福，疫情期间，大家照顾好自己，保重！\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211024/a3502af324fc401e90ed1622567f9322\\_GEYDEOBOGAVDCMRTGYXDA.jpeg)\n\n各位家人大家早上好☀☀，欢迎来到我的“小世界”………\n\n雨惜每天与您相约05:55……不见不散！\n\n昨日是双十一，股市三大指数皆收中阳线，指数一走好，大部分个股也跟着走好，反之，9月中旬指数回调以来，期间大部分个股是跟着回调的，以前常听炒股人说炒股不用看指数，那是没有大局观了。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/4401f030f9ee4027ae714cdf55955f14\\_GEYDOOJOGAVDCNJRG4XDA.png)\n\n一位老股民炒股几年亏损了60%，最后总结出来完胜炒股方法\n\n【1、加仓要谨慎，加仓的前提是你准备做一段大趋势，因为如果你只是做短线，不想拿大的行情是没必要考虑加仓的，加仓的本质是你开立了一个新的头寸，由于趋势不会轻易改变，因此在一段大趋势里，如果你在底部进场的，那么你在后期有很大的成本优势，这种优势可以让你轻松面对回调，找机会加仓，这样后面走出来，那么你这次交易将获得巨大的收益，所以要不要加仓首先你要思考你想做的是多大行情。\n\n2、做T是有必要的，我比较推崇涨到短期目标位先出场一部分，这样先把部分盈利拿到自己的口袋，心态上就会比较好，这是一种中庸的交易方法，对大多数人来说也是很适用的，我们知道，纸上盈利并不是真正的盈利，只有到了口袋的钱才是，因此到了上方压力位，预计要回调，可以先出场部分，如果确实如预期回调，那么到了底部再加点仓，如果直接向上突破了，那么起码还有部分仓位在里面。\n\n3、对大盘的判断要结合三大指数：沪指、深指、创业板，要发出大的牛市，三大指数要一齐向上突破了才行，这样每个指数都处在上升过程中，能够实现共振的效果，每天都有一个指数领涨，其他的跟随，而不是这个指数上涨，另一个下跌，这样等于市场上并没有增量资本入场，只是资本在几个指数间不断的切换，进行调仓换股，所以真正的牛市要求是比较高的，没那么容易出现。\n\n4、 强势股上涨的速度会越来越快，强势股一开始是慢慢上涨，随后经过回调后再次拉升，第二次拉升的角度要大于第一次，说明行情在按正常的上涨节奏运行，然后再一次回调，再拉升这样循环上去，如果这段行情很大，那么后面的拉升强度要大于前一次拉升，就是说越到后面上涨的越快，直到反转，如果上涨的斜率降低了，那么就是一个危险信号，提示你上涨趋势在发生改变，要注意风险了。】\n\n炒股我不太懂，但同理和炒币差不多\n\n1、空仓：空仓最大的好处有两点，一是不会赔钱；二是用钱的时候随便你取钱。也就是说，那帐户上的钱是真正属于你的。无论是否是股民还是币友，都要记住中国老百姓那句名谚语：“饭到口，钱到手。”何况，在“一赚二平七亏”的市场里，只要你不亏损，这条习惯带来的收益是30％。\n\n2、赢利才加仓：买一只股票或者币种，第一笔交易赚了钱，才能加仓，这说明你对趋势的判断是正确的，加仓也就顺理成章。第三笔交易如果亏损，连同前面的交易一同卖出。不要相信直觉，要相信现实，一旦交易亏损，要么是市场出了问题，要么是你出了问题，都需要你清仓。这条习惯带来的收益是20％。\n\n3、独来独往：少数人赚钱的定律让我们不得不保持与众不同的思路。买别人不屑于买的股票 币种或者是不敢买的股票 币种，或许能成为赢家，大众情人成不了明星。这条习惯带来的收益在30％左右。\n\n4、休息：休息不一定就是睡觉啊，但休息一定是要你卖出股票停止交易，远离股市一个阶段，可以去学习，可以去娱乐，也可以去做别的事业。要知道，距离产生的不仅仅是美，还有冷静和理智。一个成功的股民的角色绝对不仅仅是个投资者，在别的舞台上你也一定翩翩起舞啊。这条习惯带来的收益是20％左右。\n\n最近，我发现自己越来越“怂”了，准确地说，投资是越来越保守了，这两天有人问及我，最近有没有什么好的投资方向，我告诉他没有，踏踏实实读书学习吧！\n\n现在市场，估计80%的人没有看书阅读的习惯，90%以上的人持币时间不超过1年，特别是持币时间超过3年的人基本上寥寥无了。一个人如果长期养成阅读的习惯，并且经常思考一些投资的理论问题，同时能够耐心持有，不急于变富，这样的人是不可能亏钱的。\n\n微博大佬37度卡农:\n\nA9俱乐部机密富豪币圈经历15\n\n晚上好37，我是小白，17年买过300元的ltc，不怎么会操作不会卖也看不懂合约，被动拿到现在，20年年初买过3500元的eth，也是因为不会操作不会合约拿到了现在。今年八月学会了用物理钱包\\[允悲]。主业电商，这几年看到加密货币的发展，像打开了新世界的大门～身边没有加密货币的圈子，希望跟你们一起玩～\n\n1.91年，北方人在上海生活，主业是品牌电商，类目是电子美容仪。没有特别擅长的，一直用心工作，毕业后到现在8年没换过工作。 2.17年买过300元的ltc，不怎么会操作不会卖也看不懂合约，被动拿到现在，20年年初买过3500元的eth，也是因为不会操作不会合约拿到了现在。今年八月学会了用物理钱包\\[允悲]。没经历过什么大挫折，今年519一下跌走了一半，但也都是盈利，就发了两天呆，别的没什么。反正非常小白，也没有圈子，没有牛逼的经历，本来今年想上半年卖了挖矿，等我学会了卖的方式，挖矿渠道已经被关了…

坚持囤币能跑赢市场大多数人。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/7e8ab79501254479a3de2e3cc7459c9a_GEYDMOBOGAVDGMZWGQXDA.jpeg)\n\n就拿比特币来说\n\n2009年一万个比特币可以购买两个披萨，价值25$\n\n2010年，比特币价格是0.3$\n\n2011年，比特币价格最高到了31.9$\n\n2013年，比特币首次突破1000$\n\n2017年，比特币涨到了20000万$\n\n2021年，比特币价格疯狂上涨，价格一度突破了4万$，从2009到至今比特币最高涨了16000万倍，12年涨幅一千多万，所以从长期来看，囤币是币圈最大的财富密码，当然，囤币囤主流币，囤山寨币的需谨慎。\n\n行情方面:\n\n吴说获悉，随着 BTC 创下6.9万美元的历史新高后跌破6.3万美元，过去24小时全网超过7.06亿美元的合约头寸被清算，其中77%为多头。据 Glassnode 数据显示，BTC 全网未平仓量从最高的268亿美元下降到了248亿美元，ETH

所谓的唯学历论观点早就应该被抛弃了。\n\n我想李佳琦想去镀镀金，提升一下自己的学历不费吹灰之力。国内出来的官员履历可以仔细看一下，研究生博士生都有，曾经我看了也是艳羡不已，后来慢慢才了解到，所谓的成人文凭其实不值一文，所以追逐高学历的怪圈存在是既得利益获得者捍卫自己果实的行为。\n\n而一个不在乎自己学历的人取得了举世瞩目的成就，其实给予我们的启示：一所处的环境是否论资排辈？如果是，你想高升获取利益，只有提高自己的学历，没有最高只有更高。\n\n二假如你不需要这一张文凭来证明自己，你也无所谓去浪费无用功。\n\n三加密货币带给了自己思想自由，不论学历不论背景不论关系只要你有贪求未来的大心脏，这里就适合自己。\n\n感谢阅读。\n\n作者郑重申明：截至发文时，作者与文中提及项目存在利益关系，特此告知。利益关系包括但不限于下述情况：本人为项目团队成员、本人是项目团队成员的直系亲属或配偶、参与投资该项目、持有该项目发行的股份或通证、参与做空或做多该项目、收取回报进行有偿撰文等。\n",

吸引我从事工作的原因之一是，它可以让你过你自己想过的生活。你没有必要为成功而打扮。\n\n2\\. 我工作时不思考其他任何东西。我并不试图超过七英尺高的栏杆：我到处找的是我能跨过的一英尺高的栏杆。\n\n3\\. 我是个现实主义者，我喜欢目前自己所从事的一切，并对此始终深信不疑。作为一个彻底的实用现实主义者，我只对现实感兴趣，从不抱任何幻想，尤其是对自己。\n\n4\\. 要去他们要去的地方而不是他们现在所在的地方。\n\n5\\. 如果发生了坏事情，请忽略这件事。\n\n6\\. 如果你是池塘里的一只鸭子，由于暴雨的缘故水面上升，你开始在水的世界之中上浮。但此时你却以为上浮的是你自己，而不是池塘。\n\n7\\. 正直，勤奋，活力。而且，如果他们不拥有第一品质，其余两个将毁灭你。对此你要深思，这一点千真万确。\n\n8\\. 生活的关键是，要弄清谁为谁工作。\n\n9\\. 当适当的气质与适当的智力结构相结合时，你就会得到理性的行为。\n\n10\\. 人性中总是有喜欢把简单的事情复杂化的不良成分。\n\n11\\. 只有在退潮的时候，你才知道谁一直在光着身子游泳！\n\n12\\. 在拖拉机问世的时候做一匹马，或在汽车问世的时候做一名铁匠，都不是一件有趣的事。\n\n13\\. 任何不能永远前进的事物都将停滞。\n\n14\\. 要量力而行。你要发现你生活与投资的优势所在。每当偶尔的机会降临，即你的这种优势有充分的把握，你就全力以赴，孤注一掷。\n\n15\\. 所有的男人的不幸出自同一个原因，即他们都不能安份地呆在一个房间里。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/23445e38edfe44fc9c1c6d8c646bbbec_GEYDMNBOGAVDEMBQGIXDA.jpeg)\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/1c1cbfd1b18f4e3ea6ebc7bdcb6001a2\\_GEYDQMBOGAVDKMJZHAXDA.jpeg)\n\n偏财居士分享，美国人存不下钱大家都知道。\n\n他们为什么存不下钱呢？\n\n一个美国人存（买理财）一块，华尔街就能把一块变十块。\n\n然后把其中五块钱贷款给公司，自己赚5块。\n\n等公司还钱了，还美国人一块钱，再加一美分利息。\n\n华尔街赚到了钱爽了。\n\n美联储让经济发展爽了。\n\n美国的企业赚到钱也爽了。\n\n贷到款的人赚到了大量的现金价值也爽了。\n\n美国年轻人一看，我就赚一分钱，凭啥啊……\n\n我特么难道我是煞笔吗还存钱给他们爽……\n\n于是，美国的年轻人就存不下钱了。\n\n总之，之所以美国年轻人存不下钱，\n\n是因为他们学会了问老天爷：凭啥呀！\n\n你们不要说什么美国这种是消费主义啥的，人家美国人生活在水深火热里，\n\n赚10块只能花一块，九块钱被华尔街拿走了……\n\n如果不花这一块，一块钱还会被华尔街拿走变成10块钱再从里面拿走九块……\n\n华尔街就是那么刺激，谁管你是不是消费主义，华尔街不在乎。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/7eb2bff141ae4bf4b31883e607fde47b_GEYDQMBOGAVDCOBYGQXDA.jpeg)\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/213faab2ae404d92bba99b85f1a3e38e_GEYDQMBOGAVDENZYG4XDA.jpeg)\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/83ebd54344c3447d93a96eb49916edfa_GEYDQMBOGAVDEOBXGEXDA.jpeg)\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/6d9ce65fc4894618921fb1cae9de5ed9\\_GEYDOOBOGAVDOMZWFYYA.jpeg)\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/b7a683451a5f444da408ff30412f92d6\\_GEYDQMBOGAVDCMRVG4XDA.jpeg)\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/7511ce64cef345248ea3495de2b28871\\_GEYDQMBOGAVDENZTHAXDA.jpeg)\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/37dbdc9774ee4bcbbaf4d7583a480248\\_GEYDQMBOGAVDEMRRG44S4MA.jpeg)\n\n作者郑重申明：截至发文时，作者与文中提及项目存在利益关系，特此告知。利益关系包括但不限于下述情况：本人为项目团队成员、本人是项目团队成员的直系亲属或配偶、参与投资该项目、持有该项目发行的股份或通证、参与做空或做多该项目、收取回报进行有偿撰文等。\n",

强势股上涨的速度会越来越快，强势股一开始是慢慢上涨，随后经过回调后再次拉升，第二次拉升的角度要大于第一次，说明行情在按正常的上涨节奏运行，然后再一次回调，再拉升这样循环上去，如果这段行情很大，那么后面的拉升强度要大于前一次拉升，就是说越到后面上涨的越快，直到反转，如果上涨的斜率降低了，那么就是一个危险信号，提示你上涨趋势在发生改变，要注意风险了。】\n\n炒股我不太懂，但同理和炒币差不多\n\n1、空仓：空仓最大的好处有两点，一是不会赔钱；二是用钱的时候随便你取钱。也就是说，那帐户上的钱是真正属于你的。无论是否是股民还是币友，都要记住中国老百姓那句名谚语：“饭到口，钱到手。”何况，在“一赚二平七亏”的市场里，只要你不亏损，这条习惯带来的收益是30％。\n\n2、赢利才加仓：买一只股票或者币种，第一笔交易赚了钱，才能加仓，这说明你对趋势的判断是正确的，加仓也就顺理成章。第三笔交易如果亏损，连同前面的交易一同卖出。不要相信直觉，要相信现实，一旦交易亏损，要么是市场出了问题，要么是你出了问题，都需要你清仓。这条习惯带来的收益是20％。\n\n3、独来独往：少数人赚钱的定律让我们不得不保持与众不同的思路。买别人不屑于买的股票 币种或者是不敢买的股票 币种，或许能成为赢家，大众情人成不了明星。这条习惯带来的收益在30％左右。\n\n4、休息：休息不一定就是睡觉啊，但休息一定是要你卖出股票停止交易，远离股市一个阶段，可以去学习，可以去娱乐，也可以去做别的事业。要知道，距离产生的不仅仅是美，还有冷静和理智。一个成功的股民的角色绝对不仅仅是个投资者，在别的舞台上你也一定翩翩起舞啊。这条习惯带来的收益是20％左右。\n\n最近，我发现自己越来越“怂”了，准确地说，投资是越来越保守了，这两天有人问及我，最近有没有什么好的投资方向，我告诉他没有，踏踏实实读书学习吧！\n\n现在市场，估计80%的人没有看书阅读的习惯，90%以上的人持币时间不超过1年，特别是持币时间超过3年的人基本上寥寥无了。一个人如果长期养成阅读的习惯，并且经常思考一些投资的理论问题，同时能够耐心持有，不急于变富，这样的人是不可能亏钱的。\n\n微博大佬37度卡农:\n\nA9俱乐部机密富豪币圈经历15\n\n晚上好37，我是小白，17年买过300元的ltc，不怎么会操作不会卖也看不懂合约，被动拿到现在，20年年初买过3500元的eth，也是因为不会操作不会合约拿到了现在。今年八月学会了用物理钱包\\[允悲]。主业电商，这几年看到加密货币的发展，像打开了新世界的大门～身边没有加密货币的圈子，希望跟你们一起玩～\n\n1.91年，北方人在上海生活，主业是品牌电商，类目是电子美容仪。没有特别擅长的，一直用心工作，毕业后到现在8年没换过工作。

所谓的唯学历论观点早就应该被抛弃了。\n\n我想李佳琦想去镀镀金，提升一下自己的学历不费吹灰之力。国内出来的官员履历可以仔细看一下，研究生博士生都有，曾经我看了也是艳羡不已，后来慢慢才了解到，所谓的成人文凭其实不值一文，所以追逐高学历的怪圈存在是既得利益获得者捍卫自己果实的行为。\n\n而一个不在乎自己学历的人取得了举世瞩目的成就，其实给予我们的启示：一所处的环境是否论资排辈？如果是，你想高升获取利益，只有提高自己的学历，没有最高只有更高。\n\n二假如你不需要这一张文凭来证明自己，你也无所谓去浪费无用功。\n\n三加密货币带给了自己思想自由，不论学历不论背景不论关系只要你有贪求未来的大心脏，这里就适合自己。\n\n感谢阅读。\n\n作者郑重申明：截至发文时，作者与文中提及项目存在利益关系，特此告知。利益关系包括但不限于下述情况：本人为项目团队成员、本人是项目团队成员的直系亲属或配偶、参与投资该项目、持有该项目发行的股份或通证、参与做空或做多该项目、收取回报进行有偿撰文等。\n",

所谓的唯学历论观点早就应该被抛弃了。\n\n我想李佳琦想去镀镀金，提升一下自己的学历不费吹灰之力。国内出来的官员履历可以仔细看一下，研究生博士生都有，曾经我看了也是艳羡不已，后来慢慢才了解到，所谓的成人文凭其实不值一文，所以追逐高学历的怪圈存在是既得利益获得者捍卫自己果实的行为。\n\n而一个不在乎自己学历的人取得了举世瞩目的成就，其实给予我们的启示：一所处的环境是否论资排辈？如果是，你想高升获取利益，只有提高自己的学历，没有最高只有更高。\n\n二假如你不需要这一张文凭来证明自己，你也无所谓去浪费无用功。\n\n三加密货币带给了自己思想自由，不论学历不论背景不论关系只要你有贪求未来的大心脏，这里就适合自己。\n\n感谢阅读。\n\n作者郑重申明：截至发文时，作者与文中提及项目存在利益关系，特此告知。利益关系包括但不限于下述情况：本人为项目团队成员、本人是项目团队成员的直系亲属或配偶、参与投资该项目、持有该项目发行的股份或通证、参与做空或做多该项目、收取回报进行有偿撰文等。\n",

**![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/ca863c22846047aab1915e2db5b816d6\\_GEYDQMBOGAVDOMBYGUXDA.jpeg)**\n\n## **威廉博士说的真的感到有点扎心，虽然开心从事着被认为是天底下最光辉的事业，工作虽然稳定，但是每天简单重复的工作，除了认识自己圈子的这些同事，出了单位门口，两眼一抹黑，出去办事，对于其他的岗位并搭不上腔。**\n\n## **挣的这份工资也就是能够维持基本的生活开销。财富自由，也只有想想吧，我只能呵呵了，简直就是异想天开，真的！**\n\n## **我周边很多家长还是希望自己的孩子能够找到一份稳定的而又体面的工作，比如说做公务员，实际上在开心看来，我并不赞同自己的孩子将来从事公务员类的工作。一是我不想让我的孩子做一个他根本不喜欢的职业，而且简单重复，没有什么激情，也没有什么进步，对于孩子来讲，我觉得真的是一种悲哀。**\n\n## **正如威廉大佬所说的，每天拼命于工作，连给自己思考的时间都没有留够，更别说学习了。**\n\n## **有时候时候承担一些风险，我觉得还是值得的，起码给自己一次机会。而且风险和机会永远是并存的。**\n\n## **有安安稳稳的一份稳定的工作，又有什么出息呢？注定也就是过一个一般人的生活。明清我们就要需要的是折腾，想想为什么宝二爷宁愿让自己的孩子从小就有亏钱的经历？**\n\n## **我们在接触一个新事物的时候，最应该先看到的是机会，而不是风险。因为你没有什么可失去的，作为一个底层未来注定是不稳定且动荡的，你以为你的稳定是真的稳定吗？这可未必。**\n\n## **就像开心刚刚接触币圈的时候，真的一脸懵逼的样子，当初甚至你觉到自己好像是穿越来的。竟然不知道天外有天，除了股市，还有个币圈！**\n\n## **在币圈币圈经历久了，我甚至感觉到一些所谓的暴富神话也是真实的，不佩服一些人的学习能力和认知能力，如果在现实的工作岗位当中，有多少人能够提前实现财富自由呢，甚至含辛茹苦的工作一辈子，也未必能够赚够第一个100万。**\n\n## **甚至感觉币圈的机会更多，但是你一定要抓住才可以。例如说你对于虚拟货币不知道买啥好的时候，我们就可以跟从大多数人的思维买入主流币，比如大饼和以太，然后拿住，这就足够了。**\n\n## **只要做到这一点，也许未来几年的时间，你的资产就相当于你在工作岗位中奋斗十年，甚至几十年。**\n\n## **也许你会说，投资虚拟货币是🈶风险的，那是当然，生活当中又有多少是万无一失的呢？如果我们在投资之前，考虑的只是风险，我们又何尝能够奢望回报呢？**\n\n## **我比较同意威廉大佬的说法，那就是拥抱变化，让自己不停的在改变，保存生存的渴望和野心，不求一时的稳定，给自己多一次选择的机会，万一实现了呢？**\n\n## **当然了，在这个到处充斥着夸张宣传和不实报道的世界里，人很容易受到影响，从而做出一些不切实际的幻想，以为自己也能轻易实现财富自由。**\n\n## **现实是，绝大部分人都只不过是别人的垫脚石，任何想要不经过深入学习和持续研究就想实现财富自由的想法都是可笑的。**\n\n## **有一句话说得好：公平竞争的唯一方法就是承担最大的风险，有些人不能承受风险，有些人能接受，有些人愿意搏一搏，有些人追求安定，有些人愿意接受新事物拥抱新事物，有些人抗拒，这要看每个人对风险的承受能力和对未来自己想要干什么的认知高度了。**\n\n## **套利猫，这个貌美如花的A9富婆，她的成功绝对不是偶然的，正如李法师爆料的，他曾经跟猫老师一起吃饭的时候，她居然一直拿着书📖和一个笔记本，见缝插针的提高自己的认知和学习能力，而且她看书的认真的状态，都让李法师大跌眼镜。**\n\n##

**这次质押挖矿仅支持使用欧易的平台币OKB进行质押，所以参与前需要先将OKB转入资金账户。**\n\n## **参与质押挖矿需满足KYC2要求，质押挖矿设有个人质押上限（1,000 OKB），所有用户总质押数量无上限。**\n\n## **之所以喜欢欧易新币挖矿是因为质押的OKB可以随时解押，无锁仓要求。**\n\n##

**另外，最值得大赞的是，挖矿结束后，质押和奖励的币将在活动结束后1小时内自动发放到资金账户。**\n\n## **不得不说，大交易所格局就是大，不像某些三流交易所希望，还要给你锁仓一段时间，这也是开心之所以选择在欧易挖矿的原因之一。**\n\n## **财经博主大V威廉博士谈投资与风险**\n\n## **![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211111/ca863c22846047aab1915e2db5b816d6\\_GEYDQMBOGAVDOMBYGUXDA.jpeg)**\n\n## **威廉博士说的真的感到有点扎心，虽然开心从事着被认为是天底下最光辉的事业，工作虽然稳定，但是每天简单重复的工作，除了认识自己圈子的这些同事，出了单位门口，两眼一抹黑，出去办事，对于其他的岗位并搭不上腔。**\n\n## **挣的这份工资也就是能够维持基本的生活开销。财富自由，也只有想想吧，我只能呵呵了，简直就是异想天开，真的！**\n\n## **我周边很多家长还是希望自己的孩子能够找到一份稳定的而又体面的工作，比如说做公务员，实际上在开心看来，我并不赞同自己的孩子将来从事公务员类的工作。一是我不想让我的孩子做一个他根本不喜欢的职业，而且简单重复，没有什么激情，也没有什么进步，对于孩子来讲，我觉得真的是一种悲哀。**\n\n## **正如威廉大佬所说的，每天拼命于工作，连给自己思考的时间都没有留够，更别说学习了。**\n\n## **有时候时候承担一些风险，我觉得还是值得的，起码给自己一次机会。而且风险和机会永远是并存的。**\n\n## **有安安稳稳的一份稳定的工作，又有什么出息呢？注定也就是过一个一般人的生活。明清我们就要需要的是折腾，想想为什么宝二爷宁愿让自己的孩子从小就有亏钱的经历？**\n\n## **我们在接触一个新事物的时候，最应该先看到的是机会，而不是风险。因为你没有什么可失去的，作为一个底层未来注定是不稳定且动荡的，你以为你的稳定是真的稳定吗？这可未必。**\n\n## **就像开心刚刚接触币圈的时候，真的一脸懵逼的样子，当初甚至你觉到自己好像是穿越来的。竟然不知道天外有天，除了股市，还有个币圈！**\n\n## **在币圈币圈经历久了，我甚至感觉到一些所谓的暴富神话也是真实的，不佩服一些人的学习能力和认知能力，如果在现实的工作岗位当中，有多少人能够提前实现财富自由呢，甚至含辛茹苦的工作一辈子，也未必能够赚够第一个100万。**\n\n## **甚至感觉币圈的机会更多，但是你一定要抓住才可以。例如说你对于虚拟货币不知道买啥好的时候，我们就可以跟从大多数人的思维买入主流币，比如大饼和以太，然后拿住，这就足够了。**\n\n## **只要做到这一点，也许未来几年的时间，你的资产就相当于你在工作岗位中奋斗十年，甚至几十年。**\n\n## **也许你会说，投资虚拟货币是🈶风险的，那是当然，生活当中又有多少是万无一失的呢？如果我们在投资之前，考虑的只是风险，我们又何尝能够奢望回报呢？**\n\n## **我比较同意威廉大佬的说法，那就是拥抱变化，让自己不停的在改变，保存生存的渴望和野心，不求一时的稳定，给自己多一次选择的机会，万一实现了呢？**\n\n## **当然了，在这个到处充斥着夸张宣传和不实报道的世界里，人很容易受到影响，从而做出一些不切实际的幻想，以为自己也能轻易实现财富自由。**\n\n## **现实是，绝大部分人都只不过是别人的垫脚石，任何想要不经过深入学习和持续研究就想实现财富自由的想法都是可笑的。**\n\n## **有一句话说得好：公平竞争的唯一方法就是承担最大的风险，有些人不能承受风险，有些人能接受，有些人愿意搏一搏，有些人追求安定，有些人愿意接受新事物拥抱新事物，有些人抗拒，这要看每个人对风险的承受能力和对未来自己想要干什么的认知高度了。**\n\n## **套利猫，这个貌美如花的A9富婆，她的成功绝对不是偶然的，正如李法师爆料的，他曾经跟猫老师一起吃饭的时候，她居然一直拿着书📖和一个笔记本，见缝插针的提高自己的认知和学习能力，而且她看书的认真的状态，都让李法师大跌眼镜。**\n\n##

要去他们要去的地方而不是他们现在所在的地方。\n\n5\\. 如果发生了坏事情，请忽略这件事。\n\n6\\. 如果你是池塘里的一只鸭子，由于暴雨的缘故水面上升，你开始在水的世界之中上浮。但此时你却以为上浮的是你自己，而不是池塘。\n\n7\\. 正直，勤奋，活力。而且，如果他们不拥有第一品质，其余两个将毁灭你。对此你要深思，这一点千真万确。\n\n8\\. 生活的关键是，要弄清谁为谁工作。\n\n9\\. 当适当的气质与适当的智力结构相结合时，你就会得到理性的行为。\n\n10\\. 人性中总是有喜欢把简单的事情复杂化的不良成分。\n\n11\\. 只有在退潮的时候，你才知道谁一直在光着身子游泳！\n\n12\\. 在拖拉机问世的时候做一匹马，或在汽车问世的时候做一名铁匠，都不是一件有趣的事。\n\n13\\.

{"id": "oR1CaTtn3rJzshkxJTVZDNTVCRasyBxUQKE3xZNxDos", "title": "What matters more, Hard Work or Luck?", "body": "# What matters more, Hard Work or Luck?\n\nRecently there have been some popular content creators diving into the idea of luck vs skill, publishing videos with millions of views. Some popular examples (but not nearly all of them) are below:\n\n﻿[Is Success Luck or Hard Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I) (Veritasium)\n\n﻿[Why Luck Is More Important Than Hard Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbRgeiSiL48)﻿\n\n﻿[Is Success Luck or Hard Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NquuITL9-ZA) (Ali Abdaal)\n\nIn short, these videos focus on the idea:\n\n> *What matters more, Hard Work or Luck?*\n\nAnd for most of them, they argue luck is the primary factor for success.\n\nUnsatisfying as an explanation, these videos often throw some basic numbers at the problem and claim that luck is most important when determining success. Quoting directly from Veritasiums video where he talks about a model he made to represent astronauts being chosen to go to space:\n\n> *The astronauts that were picked were very lucky; they had an average luck score of 94.7%*\n\nThat is some crazy high luck! 94.7%? Who is that lucky? What does that even mean? This left me, and I assume millions of other viewers, thinking that we cannot succeed without some extraordinary luck. Though this question is much more important than simple numerical models can show, let’s dive a bit deeper into the models used to show why this question, and particularly the way it’s presented in these videos, is disastrously flawed.\n\n# Problematic Model, the Sum of Skill and Luck\n\nThe models presented in these videos most often looks something like the following:\n\n1. Generate a population of people\n2. Give each person a score for skill and for luck\n3. Compute the total “success” of each person as the sum of their skill and luck values\n4. The top person in this population is almost certain to have extraordinary luck\n\nDoing this myself on a population of 1,000 people, giving each a random luck and skill value, we can see this play out exactly as advertised:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bi0r9IjkUQq1z6ZODTHHv.png?height=554&width=1412)\n\nWith a thousand people, the person who came out on top has a luck score of 99 / 100. Luck is clearly the only thing that matters here! Or at least this is how it is presented online, but there is a better visualization of the same data.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y1N6KAol9n_R4bjcvH8d-.png?height=672&width=1217)\n\nHere we can see what is really going on. To be the top member of this population you need almost exactly 100 luck and 100 skill, that’s just how the model was designed. Since they are treated interchangeably, given a large enough sample size, the best performer will be one with 100 luck. This diagonal comes from the fact that you cannot score a total value of 150 without having at least 50 luck.\n\nThis model highlights the absolute top if you have a large population, there is pretty much guaranteed to be someone who just chances into every single metric to the max. The top member will always end up like this. We can curiously say the same thing in reverse, the top member of this distribution will also have 100 skill as well, generating an equally misleading chart for the exact opposite point of view.\n\nBut now we ask, is this model really realistic? NO of course not, and for two main reasons.\n\n1. By comparing ourselves to the top position we equate “success” with “being the best in the world” which is two entirely different things and leaves everyone but one person a failure by this metric.\n2. The model assumes skill and luck are equal and fully independent from each other, which anyone will tell you is just not true and highly problematic.\n\nLet’s try some other models and see if we can get some better results. I am not promising they will be remotely good representations of reality, but let’s explore and see what we can see.\n\n# Normal Distribution\n\nThe real world is not often captured by a random value uniformly between 0 and 100. If you have taken statistics you’ll know that reality often falls into a normal distribution. So let’s give that a shot. In addition, we’ll weight the categories to put some more emphasis on skills.\n\nThe new approach:\n\n1. Generate a population of people\n2. Give each person a normally distributed score for skill and for luck\n3. Compute the total “success” of each person as the weighted sum of their skill and luck values\n4. See if this produces different results\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lr59cjF8Xc5DcypPODCJ5.png?height=460&width=1162)\n\nHere we don’t apply a weight to the categories but due to the normal distribution, we see a bit more variation in the total score as there is no “max value” like we had previously. The ratio of skill to luck in the top 10 is approximately 1:1.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A-TuefOLNYCdJwTofkdbD.png?height=550&width=1397)\n\nOnce we add weight, in this case making skill worth 2x as much as luck, we see a drastic switch. The importance of skill spikes up, leaving the luck component 5x times less relevant in the top 10. Why such a disproportionate difference? Since we are using normal distributions, any change to the data has a disproportionate effect on the tails, leading to the example above.\n\nThe takeaway from this approach could be that in a more real-life distribution, one without arbitrary limits and with more weight put towards skill, we see how far the scales can tip in the favor of skill if it is weighted correctly. If we increased the weight of skill to luck until it was 10:1 we would find luck almost disappears from the chart completely.\n\nIs this new model really realistic? NO of course not, there are still lots of issues\n\n1. We have removed some arbitrary values but still, the model is not grounded in reality. No one really has a “Luck Score” or a “Skill Score”\n2. The weight of luck to skill is arbitrary just as before.\n3. Summing luck and skill is a bad way to equate the two.\n\n# We create our own luck\n\nA common phrase is that “We create our own luck”, often meaning something like “Working hard allows you to take advantage of more opportunities and thus appear luckier”. Let’s see if we can put this into practice.\n\nThe new new approach:\n\n1. Generate a population of people\n2. Give each person a normally distributed score for skill\n3. Allow each person a certain number of opportunities based on their skill\n4. Record if a person succeeds on ANY of the opportunities they were presented with\n5. See how the classes differ\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sT5Y14vvCseSl1hwTqwaM.png?height=648&width=1042)\n\nNow we see a vast difference here, those that had higher skill scores got more chances at opportunity than those without, and even though their chances of capitalizing on an opportunity were identical, the ability to have more chanced gave the higher skill scoring individuals a huge advantage. All these numbers are contrived and without units, but the ratio is what is important. In this example, the average skill is 2.5x higher!\n\n# Summary\n\nNone of these examples should be heralded as the true way success is measured. Success is a complicated metric that has no numeric value. What success means is up to each person and not a factor of some dice roll at the beginning of life. These examples can be taken as evidence of the ease with which different models can mislead people from one view to another.\n\nWhen we often look at success, we point to those on the very top. Those who hold multi-billion dollar fortune or command the might of massive countries. A simple explanation of “they were just lucky” is a gross misrepresentation of how complex and nuanced life is. That is not to say luck is not a factor, but simply rolling a dice is far from anything meaningful.\n\nThe code for this project is on my github here is a somewhat messy form:\n\n[https://gist.github.com/eric-robertson/a914dd212a3fc60d92d3867a25004be2](https://gist.github.com/eric-robertson/a914dd212a3fc60d92d3867a25004be2)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636671003, "digest": "Cwk7SenmEfNVNBKgYBiGkxlaVmxitV2WhtXS5iD72TQ", "contributor": "0x700CaF1893E32b48486DeBC39B81471D7e675c54"}

Immutable Type will work to become a meaningful contributor to the Web3 technology ecosystem and help stand up hundreds (even thousands) of multi-sided markets for community members, journalists, contributors, benefactors, and sponsors to further localize information and journalism.  The power to manage information at scale will return to the members of local communities, and the *****flippening***** from corporate media ownership to community-owned media will happen *****Gradually, then suddenly*****, as we like to say these days.  Our corporate media have been on a gradual slide toward moral bankruptcy for decades, and it will seem very sudden when they shut their doors for good.  It will appear inevitable in hindsight of course. **\n\n## **The problems I intend for Immutable Type to solve:**\n\n1.  **Restore trust in journalism by establishing immutable primary source information and reporting**\n2.  **Return local voice to all communities**\n3.  **Provide sustainable and affordable technology**\n4.  **Localize economic impact of operations**\n5.  **Obviate dependence upon ad revenue models**\n6.  **Create incentives for the community to participate in curation**\n7.  **Fund broader networks of contributors**\n8.  **Return data ownership back to users**\n9.  **Reduce deplatforming risk of contributors and communities**\n\n**While this project may solve completely different problems as a result of its existence, I am focused upon these few as a jumping-off point. This is a significant project in size and scope, but we are able to start small and learn along the way.  I briefly cover these nine problems and acknowledge upfront there will likely be significant blindspots uncovered as we progress.  We’re “doing it live” after all, and progress will be more valuable than perfection. **\n\n## **1) Restore Trust in Journalism by Establishing Immutable Primary Source Information and Reporting**\n\n**We’re all taught to avoid saying something we wouldn’t want to be published on the front page of the New York Times, which has always seemed like a great rule to me.  I’m looking to apply that idea to our modern environment by creating a publishing system that offers the same kind of credibility to journalists and publishers by engraving their words in digital stone accessible by billions over an infinite timeline.  People are more honest and deliberate when held to account, and being held accountable “forever” is a great motivator to create trusted work for the public good.  Just as trust is earned through consistent historical performance, it may be enshrined by extending credibility into the future as well.  An accountable journalistic environment will be a trusted information environment.**\n\n**Our trust in journalism today is low because the downside risk for bad actors who publish questionable information is quite small.  The public’s memory is so short that outrage about misinformation doesn’t last for a meaningful length of time, and the analysis required to disprove these pieces requires considerable time and effort, so when the proof is available, the public has moved on and doesn’t want to revisit old news. Any negative reactions initiated by these pieces have already occurred and are sunk costs for the public.  The writers are nearly anonymous order followers, so what little downside costs that could be applied to the authors and publishers would be difficult to make stick.  The fog of time would allow these bit figures to slink away with their reputations unscathed and their wallets unaffected.  The public pays the bill, and the authors and their publishers are not held accountable.  We don’t have a mechanism to hold them accountable, and we are unable to send them their portion of the bill for the damage caused.  Where there is no accountability, there is no reason for trust.**\n\n**Likewise, we have little opportunity to hold great actors high and reward them for excellent work, financially or otherwise.  The opportunity for great work is not limited by the talent of the industry as a whole, nor the interest of the talent to produce great work on behalf of the public.  We have the most talented and information-rich media professionals of all time.  We should be at the height of our accomplishments as an informed and literate society, but all evidence proves we’re tumbling down a steep slope toward complete ignorance.  These folks, after all, are employed by corporations, and those corporations are run by management and investors with agendas, so when push comes to shove, the narrative will be crafted in the best interest of the shareholders and their powerful friends, not the community members of the markets they serve.  So, therein lies the problem of trust:  money over people, narrative over truth.  We are not being serviced with trusted information.  We’re being sold “trust me” information.  What leverage do we have to demand better service from these media companies?  Effectively none at the moment, which is why we need to build a new system based on trust and public good absent the risk of corruptible central figures.  When we solve for trusted information, all actors within the network will benefit via quality work and community rewards.  The system will maintain the immutable record of the published piece, a permanent public record of contributing members, as well as the record of supporters and benefactors who funded the work.  The entire network of participants will receive credit, or scrutiny, for the work and its merits.  It will be there forever.  No one will be able to alter or delete the data, and we will have a perfect account of the network of participants.  This system of transparency and immutability leans hard on the adage to only say or publish what one is confident defending, which is part of the solution to incentivize trusted journalism and community information.  If we *****do good*****, we are held high forever.  We trust that people want to be held high, so we will trust their work within Immutable Type more than if it were to originate from within the current system.**\n\n## **2) Return Local Voice to All Communities**\n\n**Information is abundant, but perspective is scarce.  An informed public is able to understand its position relative to changing environments.  It has an identity to which it is able to retrace during times of confusion or discomfort.  It has a voice that is familiar and trusted and which sets the tone for coordination within the community.  It implies principles and creates trust for its audience to understand urgency within messages.  Our shared voice is a coordination innovation, and when we lose it we become discordant as a community.   **\n\n**When we lost control of our local newspapers and media and replaced them with distributed digital voices, we failed to retain the connection to the reader and his/her community.  The digital voice is truncated and formatted for search engines and social algorithms, not formed for the people who need information with the local context.  The machines of the Internet were developed to format information into structured data to be utilized by other machines and ranked by algorithms for priority display within interfaces for segmented users. The machines did their jobs very, very well, much better than humans with the same task, so our human tone became obsolete when the game changed to optimize for revenue generated by clicks and attention.  The new game was built upon new rules to favor machines, in which the competitor that generated the most attention received the financial rewards.  “Local Voice” was not engineered as part of the prize, nor was local pride, nor was a locally informed public.  The prize was the finite attention of the population from which clicks were extracted.  The local voice has been replaced by the national void. **\n\n**The limitations of the machines limit our ability to emote or achieve any depth of insight about nuanced issues that impact our interests.  The machines reward novelty and recency from publishers that drive “engagement” by “users” because that’s how the machines extract profit.  Publisher rewards include highly-ranked positions within search query results and greater screen time within the scrolling behavior of users of social media platforms.  Extremes are now rewarded, whereas balanced information is not.  “Content” has replaced journalism, because it’s cheaper to produce and increases the frequency of user clicks.  The natural format of successful “content” is shallow and uninformative.  Time is finite, and clicks are the financial rewards that pay the bills.  If a user is not clicking or scrolling, the machines lose the opportunity to generate revenue.  The perfect user, according to the rules of the machines, scrolls and clicks and never reads with depth, never fully considers a piece, and never steps away from the screen to contemplate what they have just read.**\n\n**The only possible result of this feedback loop is the shallowest understanding of ourselves and our neighbors.  Discourse has narrowed to the most popular few perspectives, and many people feel left out and unseen.  Their stories are not popular enough to be told with any depth or frequency, nor be ranked highly by the machines.  The incentives for creators and journalists to explore those stories have drifted away by design.  Their concerns will always be ignored in exchange for frivolous stories that appeal to the widest and most reactionary audience for the briefest amount of time.  One can only imagine how painful it would be for people with real concerns to have to endure a deluge of inane “content” while pleading to be heard and assisted. **\n\n**The local voice of the locally owned media was able to speak for these people and overcome the noise.  In the current state of corporate media, the connection with the journalist and his/her community has been completely broken.  Our local newsrooms are closed or rolled up within the corporate media, and we no longer have conversations about local needs.  We’re distracted by the noises in the bushes and the food on another’s plate.  We’re fixated on the very few national conversations that appeal to the largest audience focused upon the most base fears.  *****“Who is threatening us, and what are we going to do about it?”***** The stories have narrowed and our simple lizard brains merely react to the stimulus without thinking.  Mass road rage online is followed by mass rage clicking, which, of course, generates more attention and more clicks, more scrolling, and more pointless content.  It’s a flywheel, as we say, and it thrives on fear.  Search engines and social media platforms perfectly serve the highest and most reactionary “content” to each targeted individual, and the flywheel momentum increases.  We no longer give a damn about fixing potholes around our own town.  We’re too focused on storming pizza kitchens, or the Capitol.  We’ve completely lost sight of our local environments, and our local voices have vanished.  The newsrooms have been replaced by dumpster fires of corporate “news” coming at us from all angles from trained news actors playing their part and delivering their lines.  We have stopped talking with each other.  We are just fucking yelling into the screens until we’re left without voices at all.**\n\n**We can overcome all of that by simply publishing locally, again.  My rationale for Immutable Type is that by establishing a technical solution for decentralized, local media nodes, as well as an economic and governance system to incentivize local ownership and community curation, communities may take charge to regain their local voice and coordinate to rediscover their identity.  Local authors, journalists, creators, photographers, contributors, and supporters will be able to work together to organize their local narrative and publish their own pieces within their own branded Web3 environment.  These local media nodes will be decentralized publishing platforms completely owned and operated by communities for their own benefit.  **\n\n## **3) Provide Sustainable and Affordable Technology**\n\n**We will want to build the lightest possible cost structure to support even the smallest community and niche social groups.  Historically, local media companies have been rolled up into regional and national corporate media ownership for many reasons, and a significant driver has been the advantage centralized management provides when reducing “redundancies” within these capital-intensive businesses.  Redundancies will typically be duplicative expenses between two operations and include such things as office space, administrative operations, big buildings with a lot of machines and furniture, telephone lines and paper, labor costs, parking spaces, and we should not forget the accountants and the lawyers.  Each media market included the majority of those expense centers in some form or another and each of these small businesses needed to sustain themselves with their own local advertiser market and subscriber base.  Naturally, it would have been preferable if each of these businesses could have found a balance between competing markets and left each business as an ongoing local enterprise, but the businesses were far more profitable rolled up as a corporate media industry with leaner expense centers and fewer labor commitments.  The result of this flagging distribution model within the United States over the last 20 years has been tens of thousands of newsroom layoffs and daily newspaper circulation dropping by tens of millions. Communities lost their local papers, their local jobs, their local voices, and the curation mechanics that identified trustworthy information for local people.  While we may not revive the local daily newspaper under local ownership in a meaningful way, we may deliver on a mission to inform our communities with trustworthy information and return their curated local voices.  **\n\n**To do so, we need to pay the bills and focus revenue upon the most valuable asset, which is information curated by people.  By creating the leanest possible technology solutions to the middle-management problem, we’re able to avoid the risk of top-heavy organizational expenses and push investment to the value drivers of knowledge work; more specifically, pay for outstanding human contributions and curation.  Whereas middle-management is expensive and at risk of their own biases, and machine curation is at risk from poorly evolved KPIs, we will need to build a better mousetrap.  We need the strongest contributors, an engaged community for curation, and efficient low-cost operations.  Though the machines will continue to be tools for people to do their jobs, they should not curate narrative.  We originally created the machines to improve the efficiency of business operations, but now the same machines are creating *****us *****to achieve *****efficient business operations***** by curating the digital environment to initiate our actions to serve their optimization rules.  Human curation needs to take over where the jobs of the machines end, and we shouldn’t make the same mistake and install management to dictate narratives and prioritize what information will make it to the public’s hands.  We’d be reintroducing a failed cost structure and, again, leading ourselves down the path of centralization.   We need a more sustainable business model to create incentives for the best and most talented people to fill the jobs that are currently unoccupied and are left to machine curation.  Local journalists, contributors, creators, and curators are the not-so-secret weapons who will be able to tell our stories authentically.  We must create our own curated environments, and we need to do this job more economically than the machines and more effectively than corporate media.  We need to introduce fruitful disruption by building better business models.**\n\n**Part of the innovation of Web3 is its ability to coordinate incentives that pass through to contributors untouched by central parties.  In the old world, revenue would be captured at the top and then be filtered down the organization in line with budgeted expenses.  Corporate media companies, by design, take bites of the revenue apple as it’s passed around the organization until only the core remains for the actual contributors.  Talent and knowledge work is one of the last to be paid and one of the first to be cut when times get tough.  Web3 innovations allow Immutable Type to flip that concept on its head, so that talent is the most important piece of the pie and the most well funded.  Subscribers of local media nodes will be able to compensate talent and contributors directly, and the node will then be rewarded by the talent.  The local node would then support Immutable Type with a network reward to incentivize the continued development of the technology.  This model has many advantages, the greatest of which may be the ability for the community to reward the contributors directly.  By funding contributors directly from the community members, we are able to cut out the expense of middle management and curate information based upon the needs of the community, thus eliminating two risk factors to sustainability:  bloated expenses and poor quality information.  Put more succinctly, great information creates value, lean technology assures accessibility, and community curation directs funds to great contributors. **\n\n## **4) Localize Economic Impact of Operations**\n\n**This should be an easy point to make:  money leaves local economies when the local media is owned by a centralized entity headquartered elsewhere, whether that entity is a technology company or a media company.  Local ad dollars run through Facebook and Google today, as well as through the local media outlets of national corporations.  This revenue had historically been captured by local newspaper publishers, radio broadcasters, the local nightly news, or even local publishers of independent presses.  Immutable Type, as noted, will be a decentralized platform for local owners of media nodes focused on community information (news).  Owners will be able to plug in and operate their own media business, and the governance model will establish local ownership as the standard.  Local contributors, subscribers, and local business members will be part of the economic base of the community.  While media businesses have typically been assembled as big, lumbering, administrative and operational entities funded by an ad revenue model, this decentralized model will be made up of local owners working on behalf of local contributors to retain economic results within the local economy.  **\n\n## **5) Obviate Dependance Upon Ad Revenue Models**\n\n**Media corporations operate ad-supported businesses that must draw attention to the information within their publications to generate advertising revenue.  The ad spend from advertising clients then creates the need for the media company to provide evidence that the advertiser received value from those ad impressions or from circulation.  The primary method for the media companies to prove results to their clients is by collecting user data and demonstrating how the ads changed the behavior of their users or audience.  This user data is stored in databases the advertisers are able to access for the purpose of generating reports and making decisions about the next allocation of ad dollars to the media company.  The user data is collected via various tracking methods of user activities within the user’s private computers and phones, including user identification, device identification, location, demographic data, and on and on down the privacy rabbit hole.  This data is matched to behavioral data, including what websites the user visits and their social media activities, what type of information they engage with, as well as how they “feel” about that information.  This information is matched within third-party data services to learn what type of cars the user owns, their magazine subscriptions, homeownership status, total household family members and their ages, and even political party affiliation.  All this data is stored by centralized parties and is a product they resell to high bidders who want information about different types of customers.  The buyers of the data include other advertisers, research companies, political parties, governments, and authorities.  That centralized data is vulnerable to exploits that result in user data being stolen and sold on the black market.  These exploits occur frequently to the world’s biggest institutions running advanced security systems.  The fines for companies that fail to protect our data are relatively nominal when compared to the cost to the users whose data has been compromised.  The user is the one who loses because the relationship between the media company and the user is completely lopsided to the benefit of media companies.  Most people believe the product the media companies sell is the newspapers, magazines, network news shows, or social media and search engine access when in actuality the product is the user.  We believe we are the customer when we read a magazine or scroll social media, but in reality, we are the product that is sold to the advertisers as a bundle of target segments.  The ad dollars drive this dynamic of the media capturing user data to refine advertising results, and no amount of legislation or public outcry is going to change their business model.  To change the behavior, we need to move away from advertising revenue and the motive to collect user data.  **\n\n**The goal of the user is to access good information from reliable sources.  Many of the sources of information today are free to users in exchange for their attention to advertisements and for accepting an agreement to allow the media company to collect, store, and sell access to their personal information and data.  The more “free” the information, the greater the incentive for the media company to generate sensationalized information to attract the attention of an audience.  We can flip this dynamic by becoming the customer, instead of being the product.  We become the customer when we pay for something and are the primary source of revenue for the seller of a product or service.  The subscription model removes the incentives inherent in ad-supported media businesses because the purpose of a subscription business is to retain the subscribers by providing access to quality information.  The subscriber ceases to be the product and becomes the customer when they pay for the service because they are the primary source of revenue, thus they gain significant power in the negotiation with the supplier of information.  Free “media” attracts the attention of an audience for the purpose of the media company packaging the viewership as a product to be accessed by the highest paying advertiser; whereas, subscribers support information gathering and curation as the customer who is buying information as the product.  The relationship to the information is completely different.  The purpose of one is to attract our eyeballs, but the purpose of the other is to serve our intellect.**\n\n**A second mechanism to support the departure from an advertising model for journalists and contributors is the use of smart contracts to provide lean and scalable systems for subscribers to fund the work of creators and contributors.  Smart contracts may be coded to fund anything from a single article to a full series (season) of articles, or a new book by an author offering complex royalty structures.  The use of non-fungible tokens (NFT) creates additional flexibility for the supporter to “collect” digital visual proof of their ownership stake(s), as well as automate member access to events and social groups associated with the journalist.  While a subscription may provide a community member with access to general publications of all journalists within an Immutable Type media node, the same subscriber may also choose to fund specialized projects, articles, local photography, graphic design, or research reports by purchasing NFTs from contributors focused on works of interest to the subscriber.  NFT ownership provides opportunities for holders to monetize their NFT in new and unique ways as well.  They may receive royalties or sell the NFT, or they could enjoy the benefit of social capital as a person who has supported important work within the community.  A useful mental model to consider the value of social capital is from existing examples, such as bronze plaques on park benches to commemorate donors of beautification efforts, or, more whimsically, wishing someone “happy birthday” on a jumbo screen at a sporting event.  It’s a public display of support, but with NFTs and smart contracts the  “display” is a digital asset that may hold value beyond the pride of ownership.  The user who funds the contributor directly is executing a meaningful function within the new media environment, as they are skipping all the layers of bloat, bureaucracy, and risk of narrative capture within the corporate media complex by funding the contributor directly.  Doing so eliminates the need for advertising revenue to fund the operation, as subscribers and direct funding through smart contracts will fund the contributor’s work.**\n\n## **6) Create Incentives for Community to Participate in Curation**\n\n**If we’re going to disintermediate the role of middle management within corporate media and turn curation responsibilities over to subscribers and community members, we’re going to need mechanisms to establish prioritization and value.  The management within media companies today, their editors, and the contracted content creators don't really know with precision the value of their work to the community, because they are not part of the community.  They’re managing digital environments at a distance and relying on star ratings, retention results, or engagement metrics to inform their future decisions.  Even when their KPIs increase or decrease, they couldn’t understand the cause of the results, and the lag to receive real feedback via polls or surveys wouldn’t be actionable once it was collected and reported up the chain.  Their work is measured using generalized feedback from poor rating systems which prioritize ad revenue over community satisfaction. **\n\n**We’ll seek to do better than the legacy systems.  Since we’re including the community as its own feedback system, three tactics are included within scope to assure active engagement and quality results: **\n\n1.  **Royalty and reward incentives for participants of the value chain**\n2.  **NFT ownership and transferability **\n3.  **Prediction markets and auction mechanics**\n\n**Each is an extremely powerful tactic to incentivize community engagement with contributors for the purpose of refining the curation quality in coordination with local information demand.  As assembled together these solutions may approach a new format to manage the relationship between patron and creator at scale.  Rather than contributors being instructed by a team of old-school corporate gatekeepers located outside the local community, we will be able to turn curation and funding decisions over to the subscribers and community members.  Royalties and rewards will compensate contributors and subscribers alike for work that finds additional financial success.  NFTs will become collectibles and social signals of work supported.  Prediction markets and auction mechanics will help balance the behaviors of contributors and community members by providing a method to manage disputes.  We will go deeper into how any of these may work in future documentation, but, for now, we accept that we have this opportunity to incentivize community members to act as the middle-management layer of media companies and receive rewards for doing so.  **\n\n**A key expansion of the existing relationship between media and its audience is to provide the opportunity for each to participate as accountable collaborators in the information published.  A story doesn’t have value without audience support, and the audience has never really had skin in the game as an active participant in the value creation of published works.  With all three solutions above, subscribers will be included as recorded participants within the immutable ledger.  I’m very excited about the idea of the community (audience) and its contributors having the opportunity to be linked together for the work the contributor has created on their behalf.  It creates significant responsibility on the part of the community members to support work and contributors which they believe will positively impact the public good.  We, as supporters, should also realize value when funding great work, and we should feel pride in our relationship with great contributors.  Part of my excitement about this concept is that it should propel under-funded geniuses ahead.  The success in doing so may serve to influence folks to participate who would typically sit on the sidelines.  Positive feedback loops will evolve as community members form new connections and find new opportunities to collaborate.  While trust in journalism is a minimum goal to clear the deck for great work, we also need to fund work from creative minds to lift society to its greatest potential.**\n\n## **7) Fund Broader Networks of Contributors**\n\n**If there’s one thing that’s evident about the corporate media complex it’s that it offers a pretty homogeneous perspective and is, quite frankly, intellectually boring and unsatisfying.  We hear from the same or similar perspectives through a narrow band of cultural frequencies and leave some dead air for stories that appeal to narrower markets.  What I enjoyed about the time before cable television and the Internet explosion was the zine culture, alternative and pirate radio, and mixtape DJs who were able to break through network media and stand tall with their “alternative” views.  All that was needed to express our views in those days was a way to print paper booklets, snag some airtime at a college radio station, or create some mixtapes.  [WMHB of Colby College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMHB) was a pinhole to culture for kids in Central Maine, for example, and it was one of the few ways to hear anyone express unscripted and unapproved perspectives using familiar language.  It was analog and accessible for creative minds who wanted to contribute to the greater cultural conversation without being *****down boyed***** by establishment censors, the FCC, or tops-down tastemakers. **\n\n**I believe we lost a level of accessibility for expression from the broader culture during the 2000s, which is being righted today with the unbundling of the digital aggregators and the emergence of Web3.  Part of the unbundling and opportunity to expand our understanding of each other is the ability to fund smaller operations in an economically sustainable manner.  While we have benefited from new publishing platforms and blogs, social media, youtube, podcasting, and the like, most of the economic value was extracted by the platforms themselves leaving the creators with nominal fees.  Those fees ended up being distributed along a Pareto distribution curve, therefore a few new voices were indeed heard, but the vast majority were unable to continue to fund their work with the small fee payments.  We are not going to reach our collective potential if centralized platforms are going to extract value and distribute fees to contributors, because the value for smaller communities will be extracted away to support the primary revenue generators.  There is no reason to be upset about the dynamics of fee distribution by these centralized players, as we’re not going to convince them to make investments that are not competitive with their internal best alternatives.  What we are able to do, however, is build a system that takes into account the economic needs of a wider set of contributors where fees flow upwards from below and are distributed to the network of participants within the community.  This system will take accessibility back to the days of zine publishing when any group was able to represent their perspective and create new publications inexpensively and operate without risk of being censored.  Immutable Type will provide at least that level of accessibility while, also, minting the work as historical records.  Publishers and contributors need only gather users to organize and fund cooperative operations around subjects of deep interest to their community.  The more successful we are at engineering lean technology to reduce onboarding costs and invent new mechanisms to fund ongoing operations, the wider the network of contributors will become.  **\n\n## **8) Return Data Ownership Back to Users**\n\n**Our habit of sharing our personal data has become so common as to impair our reason when discussing user data privacy.  Regardless of surveillance concerns and data breach risks, we have culturally come to a point where we feel obligated to share our personal data when it’s requested of us.  Arguments such as, “What do you have to hide?” are common in the media when it’s suggested we push back on access to our data.  It’s an impossible argument to win.  If we answer with, “I don’t have anything to hide” then it sounds defensive.  If we answer, “It’s none of their business” then we seem like we’re just rude.  Access to our individual and personal data has become so normalized that we just hand it over and agree to website terms-of-service agreements without even thinking about the consequences.  We’re fatigued by the constant requests for our data, and we eventually just give in and provide it to anyone who asks.  We embarrass our friends and family when we refuse to provide the data during public interactions, or even when we inquire what the information will be used for once provided.  So, we give in.  We agree to website pop-up requests, and we input our phone number and email to point-of-sale systems during transactions.  We centralize our identities over and over again into the hands of companies and their databases without the foggiest idea of what they will do with it next.  Those companies become custodians of our data, which means they take on the obligation to secure the data from bad actors.  Marketers, hackers, and even sovereign actors from all over the world want access to user data, and it’s there to be had within a nicely structured database ready to be extracted and sold to anyone who is able to pay the fee.  We’re swimming around like data lemmings being tracked everywhere we go, as we create more and more value for the companies that are collecting our behavioral data and personally identifiable information (PII).  None of these companies will compensate us when they sell the data, nor will they inform us of what information has been collected and what has been sold, or exploited.  It’s quite explicit that we are not the customer within web2, we are the product, so we are freely bought and sold as such.**\n\n**Web3, therefore, is as much of a cultural revolution as a technological one, because the social obligation to be tracked and hand over personal information ends now.  Identifying users and tracking their behavior was necessary for the success of web2 media corporations. Web3, on the other hand, doesn’t need to sell targeted information about its users, because the ownership ethos is to decentralize organizations and return value to community members, not to centralize and extract.  This creates a completely different economic incentive structure with new responsibilities for individuals.  Data ownership and responsibility remain with the user and are committed to the public ledger within each user’s personal preference.  Immutable Type’s economic system will utilize methods of rewards and bounties among its network of community members, therefore advertising by external third parties never enters the platform, so user data will never be tracked or stored outside the user’s decision to commit their data to the public ledger.  Immutable Type will not be crawlable by search engines, nor will it provide access to social media platforms.  Our members will not be the product.  **\n\n**We must be aware that we are attempting a very tricky cognitive flip because we’re so accustomed to being instructed about what to do and how to do it.  This is the point in the movie where the glass shatters and our reality becomes more real because we’re so accustomed to centralized parties owning all the value and making all the rules that becoming the owners of value may be unsettling at first, though so obvious once our eyes adjust to the light.  Those of us who have crossed over to see how perverse the relationship between individual and centralized parties is will have to remember the path and pain traveled to arrive at this perspective.  Perhaps it came easy to some, but most will need to confront the tendency to conform to the more convenient mental models that everything is fine as it is.  *****What’s the big deal if these companies hold all our data, all our money, and all our debt?  It’s more convenient for ‘me’ if they do.*****  Well, we won’t be able to convince anyone who doesn’t want to ask ‘why’ five times in search of understanding, and that’s ok for now.  We just need to provide the rabbit hole for when they are ready to seek the adventure of discovery. **\n\n## **9) Reduce Deplatforming Risk of Contributors and Communities**\n\n**Deplatforming is the action of a centralized governing body actively removing or limiting access to a platform by an individual or group.  Media businesses currently have the right to limit access to their platforms based upon policies or terms-of-use violations, which is a good thing on balance.  Deplatforming, however, is a very dangerous precedent when it risks free speech, encourages censorship, or engages in king-making.  Central governing bodies within media corporations may do their best to arbitrate information disputes and censorship requests, but the results will always represent the opinions of a few people and be at risk of undue influence and eventually come under the oversight of government regulation.  The decisions and motivations of a few people must not dictate communication within a healthy society.**\n\n**A better system is for community members to decide to whom they will lend their support and their time via incentives and rewards.  Rather than voting on which contributor may or may not use a platform, Immutable Type will provide the technology for contributors to publish their work, which the community will fund or not fund.  The use of prediction markets and auction mechanics will balance the value of the work within the community via rewards or fees.  While contentious issues will always be a battle, we can expect cooler heads to prevail over time when incentives are at stake.  Contentious issues are exactly what we should discuss as communities if we’re to make progress and form a consensus on the disputed issues.  We need to consider dissent and allow it to seek its own level within a system that remains a persistent public record of outcomes.  Deplatforming the polarizing contributors will simply push the dissent to the fringes and continue to disenfranchise people who are seeking a voice within a fair forum.  Healthy societies address maladies in an actionable manner, and when earnest discourse is held within bounds they are able to surface opportunities to work together and solve the root cause of the concerns.  Deplatforming extreme views only exclude the disputed perspectives and create rifts.  The contentions will not end when the access is denied.  Indeed, the result of exclusion will cause these disputes to turn into conflicts settled in the streets.**\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n**The prior pages have summarized the problems I believe Immutable Type is able to address with some energy.  My commentary is provided as a guide for color about why I’ve come to believe they are important opportunities.  This post is neither exhaustive nor perfect, but it is an effort to guide progress.  We now have the tools to do something positive with Web3, so it’s really just time to build.**\n\n**Here, again, is the ordered list for convenience:**\n\n1.  **Restore trust in journalism by establishing immutable primary source information and reporting**\n2.  **Return local voice to all communities**\n3.  **Provide sustainable and affordable technology**\n4.  **Localize economic impact of operations**\n5.  **Obviate dependence upon ad revenue models**\n6.  **Create incentives for the community to participate in curation**\n7.  **Fund broader networks of contributors**\n8.  **Return data ownership back to users**\n9.  **Reduce deplatforming risk of contributors and communities**\n\n**My next steps are to review inbound comments and corrections to my logic.  I expect this will become much improved by insights from the community.  **\n\n**I will begin working on product documentation for a post within the newsletter seeking review and community feedback.  **\n\n**I will publish one or two resource newsletters for further reading and some “getting started” references for beginners to Web3.  We can’t onboard significant new community members if we don’t help them overcome the learning curve.**\n\n**I’m going to be looking for participants to help moderate a Discord server and, also, some participants for a podcast about Stadium Gates and our projects. DM or email me directly with interest.**\n\n**I’m looking for assistance to research crypto grants accelerators.  LMK if you have an interest in working on this part of the project.**\n\n**I’ll be looking for a committee to form a marketing plan to grow the community organically.  Please let me know if this is of interest to you.**\n\n**We’ll launch an NFT series for this community, and I’ll create a post for artist submissions.  Please DM if this is your wheelhouse. **\n\n**When I post the product documentation, I’ll be fielding input for proposals to work on the development.  This will be a significant relationship for the community, so we’ll take time in this process.**\n\n**Lastly, I’m going to create a pitch deck to solicit subscribers to fund Immutable Type development, including offering access to the NFT series to help fund product development.  While I will seek strong partners in this industry at the right time, I want to wait to do so for a number of reasons.  It’s important that we start this together and initiate involvement.  Great partners will come at the right time.**\n\n**Thank you for reading.**\n\n**I’m looking forward to the unknown and ambitious. **\n\n**[@damon_peters](https://twitter.com/Damon_Peters) **\n\n**[@stadium_gates](https://twitter.com/stadium_gates)**\n\n**[www.Stadiumgates.com](https://www.stadiumgates.com/welcome)**\n\n**<https://www.linkedin.com/in/damonpeters/>**\n\n[Share](https://www.stadiumgates.com/p/immutable-type-and-9ine-problems?utm_source=substack\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_content=share\\&action=share)\n", "timestamp": 1636672688, "digest": "HLQJL92ef0iDq4X-AITWfl99E5Lhrvo9DkiJMMPz8KY", "contributor": "0x3Bf34aF536E7f2D20172BA58a6E7C781379fB4F3"}

To know where web3 comes from and what intentional direction was set. The intentions of people and how more people hijack them and how even more people come to re-instill them.

Indeed, they are the basis of the very oxygen that we breathe every day,\" he said. \"Yet, that great public benefit that the African ecosystem provides to the world has not yet been fully acknowledged.\"\n\nKenyatta appreciated that investors, consumers and shareholders are beginning to demand companies start the process of decarbonizing their activities and moving toward a carbon neutral world.\n\n**The Giants Club**\n\nHe said Kenya plans to work with African countries from the Giants Club conservation group to raise investment resources in the continent's climate change programs. The Giants Club is a group of African nations, including Kenya, Uganda and Mozambique, partnering in wildlife conservation activities.\n\nEvgeny Lebedev, founder of Lebedev Holdings which co-hosted the event, said the rainforest in the Congo River Basin is one of the strongest remaining defenses against climate change.\n\n\"Unlike other large tropical rainforests, Congo remains a strong net carbon sink,\" he said. \"Currently, it removes 4 percent of the planet's annual carbon emissions. These sprawling landscapes are nature's very own carbon removal devices, absorbing it and sequestering it away.\"\n\nMax Graham, founder and CEO of conservation organization Space for Giants, said the $100 billion that developed countries promised to developing countries sounds like a lot of money, but it is not when compared to the things that people are spending money on.\n\n\"The world spends $623 billion every year on beer. America alone spends $53 billion annually on pets. We collectively spend $90 billion on our hair, $57 billion on ice-cream and over $100 billion on coffee,\" he said. \"If we collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on items that are not essential for our survival, it seems completely inexplicable that we are not paying for the price of something we need for our children's future.\"\n\nAkinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank, said while carbon offset is important for reaching net-zero, the most critical thing is proper pricing of carbon.", "timestamp": 1636675156, "digest": "m7oMoIhEV1QwLghX1tmwxYwoFCIh3FzpTVk9nKiojjs", "contributor": "0x6edd17976B52A22aA4E9BACAdBd59e5EB54a79C2"}

{"id": "jJP2jkuYbo-TIeFdL2PP3U_boVWc3XMSLiKCMCRyPrk", "title": "Unit Testing a Solidity Smart Contract using Chai & Mocha with TypeScript", "body": "## [](#overview)Overview\n\nI've recently been playing around writing some smart contracts for fun with Solidity and the fastest way to validate the logic you wrote works as what you expect it to do is by unit testing. It was also a fun experiencing testing smart contracts with Chai and Mocha together with TypeScript. It made things quick and easy for me. And cheers to Hardhat for making things much more easier and convenient that it automatically generates all the TypeScript typings of a smart contract via Typechain. In this article we're only going to cover how we set it up using Hardhat and how we can make those assertions.\n\nBut why should we unit test our smart contracts? Can't we just deploy it manually using the Hardhat deploy script and from the UI we can point-click and test it from there? Yes, we can but eventually it's going to take us so much time, you can count off how many steps it took to validate that the smart contract that we wrote has been working as what we expect. With unit testing, we can directly make calls to those methods and make the assertions or even console logging if you so desire to in a single test file.\n\nHowever, if you're still new to Ethereum Development or Blockchain Development, then be sure to check out [Nader Dabit's article for a complete guide to Full Stack Ethereum Development](https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-ethereum-development-3j13) 🔥\n\nWith all that being said let's get right on to it. 🚢\n\n## [](#the-stack)The Stack\n\nOutlining the stack that we are using for this tutorial:\n\n*   [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)\n*   [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)\n*   [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)\n*   [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)\n*   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n\n## [](#installation)Installation\n\nAs mentioned above we are going to use Hardhat for this. Just in case you don't know what Hardhat is, it provides a development environment for Ethereum based projects. It's very intuitive I like it and the documentation is also great. You can visit the docs from [here](https://hardhat.org/).\n\nLet's get started.\n\nSetup a new directory called `smart-contract-chai-testing` (Or whichever you prefer to name it)\\\n\n\n    # you can omit the $ sign\n    $ mkdir smart-contract-chai-testing\n\n\n\nThen navigate into the new directory created\\\n\n\n    $ cd smart-contract-chai-testing\n\n\n\nWe'll initialize a local Git repository to make things easier for us to visually see in the source control on what things were recently added or modified (I prefer it this way but you can omit this step)\\\n\n\n    $ git init\n\n\n\nNext is we'll initialize a Hardhat project with the following command (Assuming that you have Node.js installed already in your machine)\\\n\n\n    $ npx hardhat init\n\n\n\nYou should then see the following output in your terminal\n\n[![Image description](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z4XdCeqw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zbe9kwjfoui9eictit9e.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z4XdCeqw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zbe9kwjfoui9eictit9e.png)\n\nAnd proceed to selecting **\"Create an advanced sample project that uses TypeScript\"**, it will just scaffold everything for us. When that gets selected, just say yes (Y) to all questions the CLI asks.\n\n[![Image description](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--epYWAZ4o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/33jcf8kdex57l3owemq7.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--epYWAZ4o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/33jcf8kdex57l3owemq7.png)\n\nNow that's all setup we can open the code in our favorite IDE, the almighty Visual Studio Code.\\\n\n\n    $ code .\n\n\n\nAnd finally stage all the changes and commit with \"Init\" message\\\n\n\n    $ git add . && git commit -m \"Init\"\n\n\n\n## [](#running-a-test)Running a Test\n\nAs you notice like any other Hardhat initial projects, we got a `Greeter` smart contract. In this scaffolding we also have that and got a test case on TypeScript. So to trigger a test execute the following command in your terminal. A test on `test/index.ts` will get executed.\\\n\n\n    $ npx hardhat test \n\n\n\nWhen that is called it is going to compile your smart contract as quickly as possible and with Hardhat's Typechain it's going to auto-generate all the TypeScript typings for that smart contract `Greeter`. That's very convenient isn't it? When writing smart contracts with Hardhat's Typechain plugin or library, there's literally zero boilerplate.\n\nYou can see it for yourself and inspect the directory generated called `typechain` along with the `artifcats` directory that was generated too as the smart contract was compiled.\n\n## [](#updating-the-greeter-smart-contract)Updating the Greeter smart contract\n\nOk so we'll modify our `Greeter` contract to have some slightly interesting test cases. In this smart contract it should do the following:\n\n*   Should have a function `sum` that returns the sum of two numbers provided\n*   A user can store their lucky number, they are only allowed to store a lucky number when they don't have a lucky number stored yet. Otherwise the execution will revert.\n*   A user can update their lucky number, only if they remember correctly their previous lucky number. Otherwise the execution will revert.\n\nThe requirements are a bit confusing aren't they? But that's exactly why we should be writing tests so we exactly know its behavior on-chain and we can fix up bugs during development before it gets finally deployed to Mainnet.\n\nYou can update your `Greeter` smart contract and we'll then create test cases for it.\\\n\n\n    //SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense\n    pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n\n    import \"hardhat/console.sol\";\n\n    contract Greeter {\n        mapping(address => uint256) public ownerToLuckyNumber;\n\n        constructor() {\n            console.log(\"Deployed Greeter by '%s'\", msg.sender);\n        }\n\n        function sum(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {\n            return a + b;\n        }\n\n        function getMyLuckyNumber() external view returns (uint256) {\n            return ownerToLuckyNumber[msg.sender];\n        }\n\n        modifier luckyNumberGuard() {\n            /// @dev if it's not 0 then owner already has a lucky number\n            require(\n                ownerToLuckyNumber[msg.sender] == 0,\n                \"You already have a lucky number.\"\n            );\n            _;\n        }\n\n        modifier luckyNumberNotZero(uint256 _luckyNumber) {\n            require(_luckyNumber != 0, \"Lucky number should not be 0.\");\n            _;\n        }\n\n        function saveLuckyNumber(uint256 _luckyNumber)\n            external\n            luckyNumberGuard\n            luckyNumberNotZero(_luckyNumber)\n        {\n            ownerToLuckyNumber[msg.sender] = _luckyNumber;\n        }\n\n        modifier shouldMatchPreviousLuckyNumber(uint256 _luckyNumber) {\n            require(\n                ownerToLuckyNumber[msg.sender] == _luckyNumber,\n                \"Not your previous lucky number.\"\n            );\n            _;\n        }\n\n        function updateLuckyNumber(uint256 _luckyNumber, uint256 _newLuckyNumber)\n            external\n            shouldMatchPreviousLuckyNumber(_luckyNumber)\n        {\n            ownerToLuckyNumber[msg.sender] = _newLuckyNumber;\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\nI've written few functions and few modifiers just to make things a bit interesting to test.\n\n## [](#writing-our-tests)Writing our tests\n\nNow we got our smart contract up to date to the requirements, the fun starts and we'll start testing it. Also I like to group my tests by function names on those function I am going to test it, it makes things easier to navigate in this test suite when things get bigger. Not only that but it helps me navigate easily when after a few months I have to look back at it again.\n\nSo basically I have the following structure:\\\n\n\n    describe(\"Greeting\", () => {\n      describe(\"functionName\", () => {\n            it(\"should return when given\", async () => {\n                // ...\n        })\n      })\n    })\n\n\n\nThe first `describe` is the smart contract name and each child `describe`s are all the functions that are in that smart contract. But you can structure your tests in any way shape or form that you think it's much easier to go with.\n\n### [](#writing-a-test-for-function-sum)Writing a test for function sum\n\nHere's a test case for testing the `sum` function\\\n\n\n    import { expect } from \"chai\";\n    import { ethers } from \"hardhat\";\n    import { Greeter } from \"../typechain\";\n\n    describe(\"Greeter\", function () {\n      let contract: Greeter;\n\n      beforeEach(async () => {\n        const Greeter = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"Greeter\");\n        contract = await Greeter.deploy();\n      });\n\n      describe(\"sum\", () => {\n        it(\"should return 5 when given parameters are 2 and 3\", async function () {\n          await contract.deployed();\n\n          const sum = await contract.sum(2, 3);\n\n          expect(sum).to.be.not.undefined;\n          expect(sum).to.be.not.null;\n          expect(sum).to.be.not.NaN;\n          expect(sum).to.equal(5);\n        });\n      });\n    });\n\n\n\nFor a quick breakdown, I created a local variable and used `let` to reassign it but have a type of `Greeter` which was generated by Typechain as the smart contract was compiled. And on the `beforeEach` for every test case it's going to execute that and set the value for the `contract` variable. So basically in all test cases we can just directly grab it off from there and not having to copy-paste the contract in each single test cases.\n\nNow run the tests by the following command\\\n\n\n    $ npx hardhat test\n\n\n\nYou might want to make the script a bit shorter if you're using `yarn` or `npm` so open up your `package.json` file and add a script for it.\\\n\n\n    // package.json\n    {\n        // ...  \n\n        \"scripts\": {\n          \"test\": \"hardhat test\"\n        },\n\n        // ...\n    }\n\n\n\nAnd now we can run the tests by `yarn test` or `npm test` then we get the following result\n\n[![Image description](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XteRai-r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m13w3tprwi45zy8ssyaa.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XteRai-r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m13w3tprwi45zy8ssyaa.png)\n\n### [](#writing-a-test-for-getmyluckynumber-function)Writing a test for getMyLuckyNumber function\n\nBefore we can assert `getMyLuckyNumber` we'll first have to save our lucky number into the smart contract to set the state in `ownerToLuckyNumber` and grab the value from there. For a short breakdown on what's happening on the test below. We have the contract deployed and we called `saveLuckyNumber` and pass down a value of `5` and once that's done we call `getMyLuckyNumber` and store it to a local variable `myLuckyNumber` we then proceed to assert and expect it to be not `undefined` and to be not `null` and finally since `uint256` is considered a `BigNumberish` type we just then convert it to a simple JavaScript friendly number by calling `toNumber` on object type `BigNumberish` which is our `myLuckyNumber` local variable. Then just expect it to equal to `5` because we previously called `saveLuckyNumber` with value of `5`.\\\n\n\n    import { expect } from \"chai\";\n    import { ethers } from \"hardhat\";\n    import { Greeter } from \"../typechain\";\n\n    describe(\"Greeter\", function () {\n      let contract: Greeter;\n\n      beforeEach(async () => {\n        const Greeter = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"Greeter\");\n        contract = await Greeter.deploy();\n      });\n\n      // ...\n\n      describe(\"getMyLuckyNumber\", () => {\n        it(\"should return 5 when given 5\", async () => {\n          await contract.deployed();\n\n          await contract.saveLuckyNumber(5);\n          const myLuckyNumber = await contract.getMyLuckyNumber();\n\n          expect(myLuckyNumber).to.be.not.undefined;\n          expect(myLuckyNumber).to.be.not.null;\n          expect(myLuckyNumber.toNumber()).to.equal(5);\n        });\n      });\n\n      // ...\n    });\n\n\n\nNow run that test by `yarn test` or `npm test` then we get the results\n\n[![Image description](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gbSK4HEq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jvso9q3561w5z1kq4wxe.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gbSK4HEq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jvso9q3561w5z1kq4wxe.png)\n\n### [](#writing-tests-for-saveluckynumber-function)Writing tests for saveLuckyNumber function\n\nNow here we can test out and expect reverts when a condition in the modifier does not satisfy.\\\n\n\n    import { expect } from \"chai\";\n    import { ethers } from \"hardhat\";\n    import { Greeter } from \"../typechain\";\n\n    describe(\"Greeter\", function () {\n      let contract: Greeter;\n\n      beforeEach(async () => {\n        const Greeter = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"Greeter\");\n        contract = await Greeter.deploy();\n      });\n\n      // ...\n\n      describe(\"saveLuckyNumber\", () => {\n        it(\"should revert with message 'Lucky number should not be 0.', when given 0\", async () => {\n          await contract.deployed();\n\n          await expect(contract.saveLuckyNumber(0)).to.be.revertedWith(\n            \"Lucky number should not be 0.\"\n          );\n        });\n\n        it(\"should revert with message 'You already have a lucky number.', when owner already have saved a lucky number\", async () => {\n          await contract.deployed();\n\n          await contract.saveLuckyNumber(6);\n\n          await expect(contract.saveLuckyNumber(7)).to.be.revertedWith(\n            \"You already have a lucky number.\"\n          );\n        });\n\n        it(\"should retrieve 66 when recently given lucky number is 66\", async () => {\n          await contract.deployed();\n\n          await contract.saveLuckyNumber(66);\n          const storedLuckyNumber = await contract.getMyLuckyNumber();\n\n          expect(storedLuckyNumber).to.be.not.undefined;\n          expect(storedLuckyNumber).to.be.not.null;\n          expect(storedLuckyNumber).to.be.not.equal(0);\n          expect(storedLuckyNumber).to.be.equal(66);\n        });\n      });\n\n      // ...\n    }); \n\n\n\nFor the first 2 tests, we intently make it fail by going against the modifiers that we defined. The modifiers are there to protect anything from unexpected behaviors, thus reverts it when it fails to satisfy the modifier.\n\nFor a breakdown of each test cases on `saveLuckyNumber`:\n\n*   On the first test case, we pass down a value of `0` into `saveLuckyNumber` and on the smart contract on `saveLuckyNumber` we have a modifier attached to the function prototype. It expects a lucky number value anything other than `0`. So when it's `0` it will always fail and will revert. Thus we have our expect assertion that the call will be reverted with the following message `\"Lucky number should not be 0.\"`.\n*   On the second test case, on the `saveLuckyNumber` function again we have a modifier defined that they will never be able to set a new lucky number from calling `saveLuckyNumber` because it's going to check into the mapping `ownerToLuckyNumber` to see if they have already a lucky number stored. If they do we'll never allow it to update the state in `ownerToLuckyNumber` of their address. Thus reverting with message `\"You already have a lucky number.\"`\n*   On the third test case, we just simply call and pass down a value of `66` to `saveLuckyNumber` and eventually just call `getMyLuckyNumber` and expect it to return `66`\n\nNow we'll run the tests again by `yarn test` or `npm test` and we have the following result\n\n[![Image description](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--71z4llCj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4jhrrz29ltoug5ls2ndm.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--71z4llCj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4jhrrz29ltoug5ls2ndm.png)\n\n### [](#writing-tests-for-updateluckynumber)Writing tests for updateLuckyNumber\n\nFinally for the last function that we will be testing. This function allows the User to update their existing lucky number on-chain only if so they remember their previous lucky number. If they don't remember then they can just check for it by calling `getMyLuckyNumber`\\\n\n\n    import { expect } from \"chai\";\n    import { ethers } from \"hardhat\";\n    import { Greeter } from \"../typechain\";\n\n    describe(\"Greeter\", function () {\n      let contract: Greeter;\n\n      beforeEach(async () => {\n        const Greeter = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"Greeter\");\n        contract = await Greeter.deploy();\n      });\n\n      // ...\n\n      describe(\"updateLuckyNumber\", () => {\n        it(\"should revert with message '', when the given lucky number does not match with their existing lucky number\", async () => {\n          await contract.deployed();\n          await contract.saveLuckyNumber(6);\n\n          await expect(contract.updateLuckyNumber(8, 99)).to.be.revertedWith(\n            \"Not your previous lucky number.\"\n          );\n        });\n\n        it(\"should update their lucky number, when given the exact existing lucky number stored\", async () => {\n          await contract.deployed();\n          await contract.saveLuckyNumber(2);\n\n          await contract.updateLuckyNumber(2, 22);\n          const newLuckyNumber = await contract.getMyLuckyNumber();\n\n          expect(newLuckyNumber).to.be.not.undefined;\n          expect(newLuckyNumber).to.be.not.null;\n          expect(newLuckyNumber.toNumber()).to.be.equal(22);\n        });\n      });\n    });\n\n\n\nTo break it down for you:\n\n*   On the first test, we intently make the test fail. Say for a given scenario the User forgets their previous lucky number saved on-chain. So it shouldn't allow them to update their lucky number. So in the test we'll make them save lucky number of `6` and then some time around in the future they want to update it. So we call `updateLuckyNumber` where we pass value of `8` as the first function argument which is their \"previous\" lucky number because they believe so it was `8` and `99` as the second function argument which is the new lucky number they want to replace. So the smart contract will most likely prevent updating the state or their lucky number stored on-chain. Now we can safely assert that it was reverted with the message `\"Not your previous lucky number.\"` (For now it's that, error message not too detailed but we're not concerned about good design in the scope of this tutorial)\n*   On the second test, say User actually remembered their previous lucky number and they want to update it to a new lucky number. Then we assert the new lucky number which has a value of `22`\n\nFinally we'll run the tests one more time\n\n[![Image description](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9DyhF0Zv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/phaj9nti1gvurx026h6f.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9DyhF0Zv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/phaj9nti1gvurx026h6f.png)\n\nAnd every thing passed! That gave us the assurance that our smart contract works as what we expect it to do. So that's a wrap!\n\n## [](#conclusion)Conclusion\n\nWe've covered creating a new project and a setup for Hardhat using the template that they provided which was extremely cool where we don't have to worry as much setting up those configurations ourselves. We've also learned how to make assertions in Chai and to expect certain values and expect a reversion with a revert message. And finally we notice how Typechain is working so well, it does most of the work for us by generating those types automatically every time we compile the smart contract, that was very convenient!\n\nThat's it for me, I hope you enjoy reading and hope that you learned something.

{"id": "8g9CLFIyxqKc3qJDeQoOGBv4x3gdGGQb59hAiVP5GXE", "title": "Laravel Inversion of Control Implementation using Contextual Binding", "body": "## [](#introduction)Introduction\n\nIn this post, we will tackle about \"Inversion of Control\" principle. We will learn when to use it and how we can use it with Laravel using [Contextual Binding](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/container#contextual-binding) in the [Service Container](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/container). Although this topic assumes that you have the basic knowledge with Laravel and a general OOP concepts.\n\nAt the time of writing this, the current version for Laravel is on version 8.\n\n## [](#what-is-inversion-of-control)What is Inversion of Control?\n\nIf you know what is [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) then it's basically just a reverse of it. For Dependency Injection the code typically depends directly on the [class](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_oop_classes_objects.asp). With [Inversion of Control (IoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) we invert it, the code does not depend on the class directly but only to the interface and we bind it in the [service container](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/container). So when we Inject dependency to a certain class or [Controller](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/controllers) we call the [Interface](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_oop_interfaces.asp) and not the class.\n\n## [](#when-to-use-inversion-of-control)When to use Inversion of Control?\n\nOne must be aware and has to fully understand the scenario or what problem or certain feature to be implemented. There are a lot of problems and are a lot of ways to address it. But to choose the proper method of addressing the problem is a good way to approach it. Things does not have to be complex and should just be simple as possible.\n\nOther than that, say for a given scenario, your client wants to support multiple payment providers for the project that you are building. At your first glance you might think that you'll have to create a lot of classes for it and have different implementation details on each one of them, but the problem arises that you might have to inject a lot these in your Controllers or that you might have to put up some conditional logics just to use the correct payment provider.\n\nThat can work but it may not the ideal implementation. Then that's the time we will make use of abstraction using Inversion of Control, we can then only inject a single dependency to a Controller or whatever class it requires and that leaves us lesser code to write. It keeps it simple, and that also means it'll be easier to maintain it in the long term.\n\n## [](#creating-a-paymentinterface)Creating a PaymentInterface\n\nJust for a quick, simple, and straight-forward example let's have a `PaymentInterface` that requires 1 method to implement whichever a class implements this interface or abstract.\n\nSo let's just create a directory under `app` directory of a fresh Laravel project, and call this directory as `Interfaces` and have a file created named as `PaymentInterface.php` and for its content, we have this\\\n\n\n    <?php\n\n    namespace App\\Interfaces;\n\n    interface PaymentInterface\n    {\n      /**\n       * @param float $amount \n       * @return mixed \n       */\n      public function pay(float $amount): string;\n    } \n\n\n\nWe only require classes to implement `pay` method that takes an argument `$amount` type hinted with `float` and it returns a `string`\n\n## [](#creating-payment-services-that-implements-paymentinterface)Creating payment services that implements PaymentInterface\n\nLet's say the client wants to have at least 3 payment providers, let's just call it whatever we want in this case.\n\n*   Paypal\n*   SquarePay\n*   Stripe\n\nWe have at least 3 payment providers but with different implementation details because we might have to setup a few configuration for each of these third party APIs. Typically we want these configuration setup private and should not be exposed publicly, we only expose what is defined in the `PaymentInterface`\n\nSo let's define these services, we'll start off with `Paypal`\\\n\n\n    <?php\n\n    namespace App\\Services;\n\n    use App\\Interfaces\\PaymentInterface;\n\n    class PaypalService implements PaymentInterface\n    {\n        public function pay(float $amount): string\n        {\n            return \"From PaypalService $amount\";\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\nThe `PaypalService` implements the `PaymentInterface` and the `pay` method as well, and as defined from the abstract class or interface that `pay` should return a `string` then we'll return it with a type of `string` so we basically just know right away what we should be returning.\n\nFor the `SquarePayService`\\\n\n\n    <?php\n\n    namespace App\\Services;\n\n    use App\\Interfaces\\PaymentInterface;\n\n    class SquarePayService implements PaymentInterface\n    {\n        public function pay(float $amount): string\n        {\n            return \"From SquarePayService $amount\";\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\nFor the `StripeService`\\\n\n\n    <?php\n\n    namespace App\\Services;\n\n    use App\\Interfaces\\PaymentInterface;\n\n    class StripeService implements PaymentInterface\n    {\n        public function pay(float $amount): string\n        {\n            return \"From StripeService $amount\";\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\nNow we have those defined and implemented the `PaymentInterface` we can move on to having to dynamically bind the interface with the corresponding class or payment provider.\n\n## [](#exposing-the-payment-service-providers-to-rest-api)Exposing the payment service providers to REST API\n\nNow let's go over and create the controllers for each of these payment service providers that we defined. If you are coding along then open up your terminal and let's create these controllers using the artisan commands.\\\n\n\n    # Will create a directory called \"PaymentProvider\" and have \n    # the controller named as defined \"PaypalController\" for example\n\n    # Paypal\n    php artisan make:controller PaymentProvider/PaypalController\n\n    # Stripe\n    php artisan make:controller PaymentProvider/StripeController\n\n    # SquarePay\n    php artisan make:controller PaymentProvider/SquarePayController\n\n\n\nThen we'll go over each of these controllers and we will inject `PaymentInterface` into the constructor and pass it down into a private field.\n\n`PaypalController`\\\n\n\n    <?php\n\n    namespace App\\Http\\Controllers\\PaymentProvider;\n\n    use App\\Http\\Controllers\\Controller;\n    use App\\Contracts\\PaymentInterface;\n    use Illuminate\\Http\\Request;\n\n    class PaypalController extends Controller\n    {\n        private $paymentService;\n\n        public function __construct(PaymentInterface $paymentService)\n        {\n            $this->paymentService = $paymentService;\n        }\n\n        public function index()\n        {\n            return response()->json([\n                'data' => $this->paymentService->pay(250.0),\n            ]);\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\n`StripeController`\\\n\n\n    <?php\n\n    namespace App\\Http\\Controllers\\PaymentProvider;\n\n    use App\\Http\\Controllers\\Controller;\n    use App\\Contracts\\PaymentInterface;\n    use Illuminate\\Http\\Request;\n\n    class StripeController extends Controller\n    {\n        private $paymentService;\n\n        public function __construct(PaymentInterface $paymentService)\n        {\n            $this->paymentService = $paymentService;\n        }\n\n        public function index()\n        {\n            return response()->json([\n                'data' => $this->paymentService->pay(10.0),\n            ]);\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\n`SquarePayController`\\\n\n\n    <?php\n\n    namespace App\\Http\\Controllers\\PaymentProvider;\n\n    use App\\Http\\Controllers\\Controller;\n    use App\\Contracts\\PaymentInterface;\n    use Illuminate\\Http\\Request;\n\n    class SquarePayController extends Controller\n    {\n        private $paymentService;\n\n        public function __construct(PaymentInterface $paymentService)\n        {\n            $this->paymentService = $paymentService;\n        }\n\n        public function index()\n        {\n            return response()->json([\n                'data' => $this->paymentService->pay(5.0),\n            ]);\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\nOnce that's done, we can then expose these controllers as an endpoint to the REST API.\n\nWe define it in `api.php`\\\n\n\n    <?php\n\n    use App\\Http\\Controllers\\PaymentProvider\\PaypalController;\n    use App\\Http\\Controllers\\PaymentProvider\\SquarePayController;\n    use App\\Http\\Controllers\\PaymentProvider\\StripeController;\n    use Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Route;\n\n    Route::get('pay-with-paypal', [PaypalController::class, 'index']);\n    Route::get('pay-with-stripe', [StripeController::class, 'index']);\n    Route::get('pay-with-squarepay', [SquarePayController::class, 'index']);\n\n\n\nI just defined it with `GET` request HTTP method just for simplicity of the tutorial. But for actual payment implementations, prefer to use `POST` instead that it contains a payload data of payment information containing the amount, the account ID and any other sensitive information.\n\nSo there we defined it, you might be tempted to test it out with your HTTP client to see if it works. But actually it won't work yet as we didn't define it to act that way. So let's proceed to using Contextual Binding implementation.\n\n## [](#contextual-binding)Contextual Binding\n\nWe will be defining these bindings in the `AppServiceProvider` or you can create a different service provider that is relevant to its implementation, it can be `PaymentServiceProvider` (or any other name as you prefer) and have it registered in `AppServiceProvider`. But just for the sake of simplicity for the tutorial I will just bind the interface and their corresponding services directly into the `AppServiceProvider`.\\\n\n\n    <?php\n\n    namespace App\\Providers;\n\n    use App\\Http\\Controllers\\PaymentProvider\\PaypalController;\n    use App\\Http\\Controllers\\PaymentProvider\\SquarePayController;\n    use App\\Http\\Controllers\\PaymentProvider\\StripeController;\n    use App\\Interfaces\\PaymentInterface;\n    use App\\Services\\PaypalService;\n    use App\\Services\\SquarePayService;\n    use App\\Services\\StripeService;\n    use Illuminate\\Http\\Request;\n    use Illuminate\\Support\\ServiceProvider;\n\n    class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider\n    {\n        /**\n         * Register any application services.\n         *\n         * @return void\n         */\n        public function register()\n        {\n            $this->app->when(PaypalController::class)\n                ->needs(PaymentInterface::class)\n                ->give(PaypalService::class);\n\n            $this->app->when(StripeController::class)\n                ->needs(PaymentInterface::class)\n                ->give(StripeService::class);\n\n            $this->app->when(SquarePayController::class)\n                ->needs(PaymentInterface::class)\n                ->give(SquarePayService::class);\n        }\n\n        /**\n         * Bootstrap any application services.\n         *\n         * @return void\n         */\n        public function boot()\n        {\n            //\n        }\n    } \n\n\n\nOn the `register` method of the `AppServiceProvider` is where we define the Contextual Binding, as you can see it checks on the `Controller` using the `when` method then the `needs` is referring to the dependency of that particular controller, and the last method chaining is `give` which is what we want to bind it to, these are the service classes that we defined `PaypalService`, `StripeService`, and `SquarePayService`.\n\nIn other words, if the `PaypalController` injects the `PaymentInterface` the service container would know that its corresponding binding will result to `PaypalService` and the same goes for `StripeController` and `SquarePayController`.\n\nNow that we defined that in the service container, we can proceed to testing it out manually using our HTTP or just the browser to see if it worked.\n\n## [](#manually-testing-in-browser)Manually Testing in browser\n\nIt's just a simple test. So make sure you have an active server running via `php artisan serve` and then just put up the endpoints that we defined in `api.php`; We have the following:\n\n*   `/api/pay-with-paypal`\n*   `/api/pay-with-stripe`\n*   `/api/pay-with-squarepay`\n\nNow let's see each of these if it returns the actual implementation from each services that we defined above when creating them.\n\n`/api/pay-with-paypal`\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dwFM3ZmY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s7efoxj18glnbabpi3nv.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dwFM3ZmY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s7efoxj18glnbabpi3nv.png)\n\nThat is exactly what we wrote in `PaypalService` to return a string from the `pay` method and we even specified it with \"PaypalService\" just for us to indicate where the implementation is coming from. So using Contextual Binding works and it solves our problem!\n\n`/api/pay-with-stripe`\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1aMmStSm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vpymv4072dydw0wma3bg.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1aMmStSm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vpymv4072dydw0wma3bg.png)\n\nAnd this is for Stripe.\n\n`/api/pay-with-squarepay`\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CUlV1HBY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/irqy89t91rz22z0jjams.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CUlV1HBY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/irqy89t91rz22z0jjams.png)\n\nAnd our last payment provider that our client wants. We got it.\n\n## [](#conclusion)Conclusion\n\nNow that we learned how to tackle multiple payment providers using the **Inversion of Control (IoC)** principle, we learned how to implement it with Laravel's service container using Contextual Binding, and we understand that we'll always go with the best approach to address a problem. Don't use Inversion of Control when it's not really relevant solution at all, no need to add complexity. Only use it when it seems the best solution.\n\nI hope this was useful and that you have learned something new.

{"id": "WT93nDs201KRRicwLqJW8v1hJTlBqcYyVbGWTSFoEo0", "title": "Generating Fake Data in Flutter using the Factory Pattern for Unit Testing", "body": "### Introduction\n\nIn this article we will learn how we can seamlessly generate fake data in Flutter that we can use with-in our test suites, or just for some placeholder data in our app when the backend is not completely setup yet or any other scenario that we just need a fake data in general. You will also learn how to create a Flutter package and use that package with-in your application, it can be used both in `lib` and `test` folder. And lastly you will learn how to setup a basic monorepo for your future projects, however I am not going to tackle about monorepos in this post on what are its pros and cons.\n\nHowever, if you don't really need the monorepo setup, just skip over to the actual implementation of the Factory Pattern.\n\n### Packages\n\nWe will only require the following packages for us to seamlessly generate fake data.\n\n* [faker](https://www.notion.so/Generating-Fake-Data-in-Flutter-using-the-Factory-Pattern-a420815e30e14b8b882c76b0b4410943): Will handle generating of random data of any data type.\n* [uuid](https://www.notion.so/Generating-Fake-Data-in-Flutter-using-the-Factory-Pattern-a420815e30e14b8b882c76b0b4410943): Will generate a random uuid for us.\n* [build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner): Responsible for auto-generating us some boilerplate code.\n* [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed): Is where we create our data models.\n  * [freezed_annotation](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed_annotation)\n  * [json_annotation](https://pub.dev/packages/json_annotation)\n  * [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable)\n\n### Setup\n\nTo follow along, we'll start to setup a monorepo, first create your terminal and navigate into that directory on where you put up all your projects. I prefer to have mine under `/dev/personal-projects` so I'll `cd` into it.\n\nNext up is create a directory and call it \"flutter-fake-data-factory-pattern\" via `mkdir` terminal command.\\\\\n\n```\nmkdir flutter-fake-data-factory-pattern\n```\n\nThen next is to initialize Git in this directory so we can start up to track changes. Or maybe upload this into your repository or not. Whichever you prefer.\\\\\n\n```\ncd flutter-fake-data-factory-pattern && git init\n```\n\nCreate a new directory called `packages` and create a Flutter package inside that directory and call it `app_core`\n\n```\nmkdir packages\n\ncd packages\n\nflutter create --template=package app_core\n```\n\nOnce that is done you can proceed with installing the dependencies mentioned above.\n\nHave the following in your dependencies `pubspec.yaml` file\\\\\n\n```\n# Add this so our local package will not be published to pub.dev\npublish_to: \"none\"\n\ndependencies:\n    freezed_annotation: ^0.14.2\n    json_annotation: ^4.0.1\n    faker: ^2.0.0\n    uuid: ^3.0.4\n\ndev_dependencies:\n    build_runner: ^2.0.5\n    freezed: ^0.14.2\n    json_serializable: ^4.1.3\n```\n\nInstall the dependencies afterwards.\\\\\n\n```\ncd app_core && flutter pub get\n```\n\nNext is to create a Flutter project is where our Flutter app lives. Now go up 2 directories via\\\\\n\n```\ncd ../..\n```\n\nThen create another directory and call it \"apps\", it is where we will house our Flutter apps.\\\\\n\n```\nmkdir apps\n\nflutter create client_app\n```\n\nThen finally, just import the local package in \"client_app\" `pubspec.yaml`\n\n```\napp_core:\n    path: ../../packages/app_core\n```\n\nNow that it is all setup and done we can proceed with the implementation of the Factory Pattern.\n\nKeep in mind that since we have this kind of setup, all of our data models will be coming from the local package that we created `app_core`\n\n### Creating the ModelFactory abstract\n\nWe'll want to create an abstract class for our factory classes so that they will be aligned with the actual implementation, then we'll just have a generic type argument to pass down to differ its results when other classes implements the abstract.\\\\\n\n```\nimport 'package:faker/faker.dart';\nimport 'package:uuid/uuid.dart';\n\nabstract class ModelFactory<T> {\n  Faker get faker => Faker();\n\n  /// Creates a fake uuid.\n  String createFakeUuid() {\n    return Uuid().v4();\n  }\n\n    /// Generate a single fake model.\n  T generateFake();\n\n  /// Generate fake list based on provided length.\n  List<T> generateFakeList({required int length});\n}\n```\n\nWe are only keeping it simple, we just want a single item and a List of items of a particular data model.\n\n* The getter `faker` is the `Faker` instance that got instantiated, it is where we grab all random data of any type.\n* Next is the `createFakeUuid` method which is responsible for generating us a fake uuid out of the fly. Typically uuids are used when you have a data provider like Firestore or NoSQL databases like MongoDB, or a relational database that has a primary key type of uuid. But you can switch this up any however you want it to be.\n* The `generateFake` is responsible for creating a single data model that requires implementation details; We'll have the implementation details for this in the factory class that extends this abstract class.\n* Lastly, the `generateFakeList` will return a list, implementation details are not concerned here as well and it is being handled in the factory class the implements this abstract. It will just simply return a list of what is returned from `generateFake` method.\n\n### Defining our data models\n\nWe'll just have it simple, we'll want two for now a `User` and a `Tweet` data model.\\\\\n\n```\nimport 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';\n\npart 'user.g.dart';\npart 'user.freezed.dart';\n\n@freezed\nclass User with _$User {\n  factory User({\n    required String id,\n    required String name,\n    required String email,\n    int? age,\n    @Default(false) bool suspended,\n  }) = _User;\n\n  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);\n}\n\n\n\nimport 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';\n\npart 'tweet.g.dart';\npart 'tweet.freezed.dart';\n\n@freezed\nclass Tweet with _$Tweet {\n  factory Tweet({\n    required String id,\n    required String content,\n    @Default([]) List<String> replies,\n    @Default(0) int likes,\n    @Default(0) int retweets,\n  }) = _Tweet;\n\n  factory Tweet.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$TweetFromJson(json);\n}\n```\n\nDon't forget to run `build_runner` to let it generated the boilerplate code for us. Run it via this terminal command (You have to be in `app_core` directory otherwise this won't run):\\\\\n\n```\nflutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs\n```\n\nIf you want to learn more about data modeling with `freezed` package, read more about it from this [tutorial that I wrote](https://dev.to/carlomigueldy/data-modeling-with-flutter-using-freezed-package-4p69).\n\n### Creating a factory class\n\nNow to implement the abstract class `ModelFactory`\n\n```\nimport 'package:app_core/app_core.dart';\n\nclass UserFactory extends ModelFactory<User> {\n  @override\n  User generateFake() {\n    return User(\n      id: createFakeUuid(),\n      email: faker.internet.email(),\n      name: '${faker.person.firstName()} ${faker.person.lastName()}'.trim(),\n      age: faker.randomGenerator.integer(25),\n      suspended: faker.randomGenerator.boolean(),\n    );\n  }\n\n  @override\n  List<User> generateFakeList({required int length}) {\n    return List.generate(length, (index) => generateFake());\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nimport 'package:app_core/app_core.dart';\n\nclass TweetFactory extends ModelFactory<Tweet> {\n  @override\n  Tweet generateFake() {\n    return Tweet(\n      id: createFakeUuid(),\n      content: faker.lorem.words(99).join(' '),\n      likes: faker.randomGenerator.integer(5000),\n      retweets: faker.randomGenerator.integer(2500),\n      replies: List.generate(\n        faker.randomGenerator.integer(105),\n        (index) => faker.lorem.words(120).join(' '),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n\n  @override\n  List<Tweet> generateFakeList({required int length}) {\n    return List.generate(length, (index) => generateFake());\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Sample usage for generating fake data from the factory class\n\nIt's so easy and straight forward just like what you are thinking right now on how we can use these factory classes to generate us some fake data.\\\\\n\n```\n/// A new instance of [UserFactory]\nfinal userFactory = UserFactory();\n\n/// Generates a [User] data model\nfinal fakeUser = userFactory.generateFake();\n\n/// Will generate a [List] of 10 [User] data model\nfinal fakeUsers = userFactory.generateFakeList(10);\n```\n\nWe can just basically import it anywhere and we don't have to manually set up the values for each property a User data model has.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe learned how to use `Faker` package and applied abstraction to avoid writing up the same code again and again for other data models to generate fake data. This would come quite so handy when we write a lot of unit tests with mocking as we don't have to create a data model instance and define each properties for each test case. And lastly we can also make use of this in the UI for placeholder data when the API is not yet ready to integrate with the frontend app.\n\nFull source code can be found from the repository\n\n[https://github.com/carlomigueldy/flutter-fake-data-factory-pattern](https://github.com/carlomigueldy/flutter-fake-data-factory-pattern)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636676522, "digest": "wIZiwP0808pu6SMO4jTZh5c3TZZAXfxuyjDowWCMWL8", "contributor": "0x3E8c686F499C877D8f4aFB1215b6f0935796b986"}

We will be using [JSONPlacheolder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to consume a REST API with [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) as our HTTP client and create a data model for the `/users` endpoint to the Flutter application.\n\nData modeling is a process of creating a visual representation of information that describes the a business entity of a software project. It is a technique that is being often used in most applications. A data model can also represent relationship between each business entities. Or if you know about relational databases then for a quick comparison, a data model can be an SQL table that represents it.\n\nYou can read more in depth about [data modeling here](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/data-modeling)\n\n## [](#installation)Installation\n\nFirst we will begin with installing a fresh Flutter project, so go over and open up your terminal and execute the following command below.\\\n\n\n    flutter create freezed_data_modeling\n\n\n\nThen open the project in your IDE (Visual Studio Code) and open up the `pubspec.yaml` file and add up the following dependencies that we require,\n\n*   dependencies:\n\n    *   freezed_annotation\n\n*   dev_dependencies:\n\n    *   build_runner\n    *   freezed\n\n<!---->\n\n    dependencies:\n      flutter:\n        sdk: flutter\n      freezed_annotation:\n        dio:\n\n      # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.\n      # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.\n      cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2\n\n    dev_dependencies:\n      flutter_test:\n        sdk: flutter\n      build_runner:\n      freezed:\n\n\n\nAnd finally execute `flutter pub get` when you've added those dependencies.\n\nNext you can launch an emulator and run the project in it, but you can do it later.\n\n## [](#jsonplaceholder-response)JSONPlaceholder response\n\nBefore we start creating our data models, we should know what resources are getting returned to the application. It wouldn't make sense to create data models when the data model you created does not reflect in the backend. Take a look at it carefully and identify which properties are of type `String` , `double` , `int` , and etc.\\\n\n\n    // https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users\n    [\n      {\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"name\": \"Leanne Graham\",\n        \"username\": \"Bret\",\n        \"email\": \"Sincere@april.biz\",\n        \"address\": {\n          \"street\": \"Kulas Light\",\n          \"suite\": \"Apt. 556\",\n          \"city\": \"Gwenborough\",\n          \"zipcode\": \"92998-3874\",\n          \"geo\": {\n            \"lat\": \"-37.3159\",\n            \"lng\": \"81.1496\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"phone\": \"1-770-736-8031 x56442\",\n        \"website\": \"hildegard.org\",\n        \"company\": {\n          \"name\": \"Romaguera-Crona\",\n          \"catchPhrase\": \"Multi-layered client-server neural-net\",\n          \"bs\": \"harness real-time e-markets\"\n        }\n      },\n\n      ...\n    ]\n\n\n\nWhen taking a closer look at it we can identify the following,\n\n*   `id` is of type `int` because it returns a single digit\n\n*   `name` contains various characters, so this is a `String`\n\n*   `username` is a `String`\n\n*   `email` is a `String`\n\n*   `address` is a JSON object, so we'll require to create its own data model as well because we don't wanna put up a type for that as `Map<String, dynamic>` that would make less robust\n\n    So let's identify the property types for each property in `address` field:\n\n    *   `street` is a `String`\n\n    *   `suite` is a `String`\n\n    *   `city` is a `String`\n\n    *   `zipcode` is a `String`\n\n    *   `geo` is another JSON object, so we'll do the same thing as what we are currently doing for `address`\n\n        *   `lat` can be a `String` but since we know it is \"latitude\" and usually they are in decimal values, so we'll use `double` for that instead\n        *   `lng` is `double`\n\n*   `phone` is a `String`\n\n*   `website` is a `String`\n\n*   `company` is a JSON object\n\n    *   `name` is a `String`\n    *   `catchPhrase` is a `String`\n    *   `bs` is a `String`\n\n## [](#creating-a-data-model-without-freezed)Creating a data model without freezed\n\nUsually when we start to create our data models is that we use this approach, also means that we are writing out a lot of \"boilerplate\" code which isn't very ideal when you have a large complex application. One could be spending a lot of time just writing up data models this way, manually adding method calls like `toJson()` to convert the data model into a JSON format which is the typical format we use when we are creating requests to a REST API, GraphQL API or any sort of backend service that you could be using.\\\n\n\n    class Geo {\n      final double lat;\n      final double lng;\n\n      Geo({\n        this.lat = 0.0,\n        this.lng = 0.0,\n      });\n\n      Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {\n        return {\n          'lat': lat,\n          'lng': lng,\n        };\n      }\n    }\n\n    class Address {\n      final String? street;\n      final String? suite;\n      final String? city;\n      final String? zipcode;\n\n      Address({\n        this.street,\n        this.suite,\n        this.city,\n        this.zipcode,\n      });\n\n      Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {\n        return {\n          'street': street,\n          'suite': suite,\n          'city': city,\n          'zipcode': zipcode,\n        };\n      }\n    }\n\n    class Company {\n      final String? name;\n      final String? catchPhrase;\n      final String? bs;\n\n      Company({\n        this.name,\n        this.catchPhrase,\n        this.bs,\n      });\n\n      Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {\n        return {\n          'name': name,\n          'catchPhrase': catchPhrase,\n          'bs': bs,\n        };\n      }\n    }\n\n    class User {\n      final int id;\n      final String? username;\n      final String? email;\n      final Address? address;\n      final String? phone;\n      final String? website;\n      final Company? company;\n\n      User({\n        required this.id,\n        this.username,\n        this.email,\n        this.address,\n        this.phone,\n        this.website,\n        this.company,\n      });\n\n      Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {\n        return {\n          'id': id,\n          'username': username,\n          'email': email,\n          'address': address?.toJson(),\n          'phone': phone,\n          'website': website,\n          'company': company?.toJson(),\n        };\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\nThis would take up a lot of your time and could even be counterproductive for you as a developer.\n\nAlso notice how I am putting up with the `?` annotation in each of the properties since they could potentially be `null` and that would be considered a bug and will produce crashes in the application during run time or if when our users are using our application.\n\nYou can learn more about [null-safety here](https://flutter.dev/docs/null-safety)\n\nThere are quite a lot of problems that this gives us when writing our applications since there comes a point where when we will have to copy all values and replace with a new value. In JavaScript we can simply do that with the \"triple dot\" notation to create a new object from an existing object.\\\n\n\n    const person = {\n      name: \"Carlo Miguel Dy\",\n      age: 23,\n    }\n\n    console.log(person)\n    // { \"name\": \"Carlo Miguel Dy\", \"age\": 23 }\n\n    const newPerson = {\n      ...person,\n      name: \"John Doe\",\n    }\n\n    console.log(newPerson)\n    // { \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": 23 }\n\n\n\nBut unfortunately we can't do that with Dart yet. We can do that but it's quite a lot of \"boilerplate\" code.\n\n## [](#creating-a-data-model-with-freezed)Creating a data model with freezed\n\nA lot of the \"boilerplate\" code is eliminated when we are using the `freezed` package, what it does is it generates all those \"boilerplate\" code for us, we can also make use of its annotations which comes very handy. To mention a few these are `@Default` for providing a default value when this property is `null` and we also use `@JsonKey` to override the JSON key just in case the conventions is different from the backend. Some do use `camelCasing` , `snake_casing` and `PascalCasing` so these are the kind of problem it can solve with only a few lines of code.\\\n\n\n    import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';\n\n    part 'freezed_datamodels.freezed.dart';\n    part 'freezed_datamodels.g.dart';\n\n    @freezed\n    class Geo with _$Geo {\n      const factory Geo({\n        @Default(0.0) double lat,\n        @Default(0.0) double lng,\n      }) = _Geo;\n\n      factory Geo.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$GeoFromJson(json);\n    }\n\n    @freezed\n    class Address with _$Address {\n      const factory Address({\n        @Default('') String street,\n        @Default('') String suite,\n        @Default('') String city,\n        @Default('') String zipcode,\n        Geo? geo,\n      }) = _Address;\n\n      factory Address.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) =>\n          _$AddressFromJson(json);\n    }\n\n    @freezed\n    class Company with _$Company {\n      const factory Company({\n        @Default('') String name,\n        @Default('') String catchPhrase,\n        @Default('') String bs,\n      }) = _Company;\n\n      factory Company.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) =>\n          _$CompanyFromJson(json);\n    }\n\n    @freezed\n    class User with _$User {\n      const factory User({\n        required int id,\n        required String username,\n        required String email,\n        Address? address,\n        @Default('') String phone,\n        @Default('') String website,\n        Company? company,\n      }) = _User;\n\n      factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);\n    } \n\n\n\nWe only have to write a few lines of code to create the data models and we are utilizing on the annotations that the `freezed` package provides for us.\n\nTo break down each data model I defined above for you,\n\n*   `Geo`\n\n    *   The `lat` property is non-nullable but has a default value of `0.0` when this value is empty\n    *   The `lng` property is non-nullable but has a default value of `0.0` when this value is empty\n\n*   `Address`\n\n    *   The `street` property is non-nullable but has a default value of `''` which means it will be an empty string when this value is empty\n    *   The `suite` property is non-nullable but has a default value of `''` which means it will be an empty string when this value is empty\n    *   The `city` property is non-nullable but has a default value of `''` which means it will be an empty string when this value is empty\n    *   The `zipcode` property is non-nullable but has a default value of `''` which means it will be an empty string when this value is empty\n\n*   `Company`\n\n    *   The `name` property is non-nullable but has a default value of `''` which means it will be an empty string when this value is empty\n    *   The `catchPhrase` property is non-nullable but has a default value of `''` which means it will be an empty string when this value is empty\n    *   The `bs` property is non-nullable but has a default value of `''` which means it will be an empty string when this value is empty\n\n*   `User`\n\n    *   The `id` property is non-nullable but is `required` and this property should never be `null`\n    *   The `username` property is non-nullable but is `required` and this property should never be `null`\n    *   The `email` property is non-nullable but is `required` and this property should never be `null`\n    *   The `address` property is nullable\n    *   The `phone` property is non-nullable but has a default value of `''` which means it will be an empty string when this value is empty\n    *   The `website` property is non-nullable but has a default value of `''` which means it will be an empty string when this value is empty\n    *   The `company` property is nullable\n\n## [](#generating-code-using-buildrunner-package)Generating code using build_runner package\n\nAs the code snippet above you will notice that we have 2 lines of code that uses `part` and it contains `freezed` and `g` these are the ones that will let `freezed` package to recognize that it requires to generate a code whenever we execute the `build_runner` to build generate code for us.\n\nTo start generating code for us, execute the following command with-in the root directory of your Flutter project.\\\n\n\n    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs\n\n\n\nTo break it down what each does, the `flutter pub run` will allow us to run script coming from a package like `build_runner` and the `build` is the command or script to tell the `build_runner` package to start generating code for us. It will look for files that contains the following `*.freezed.dart` and `*.g.dart` the `*` is just a wild card that means any file name that contains it will be recognized by the `build_runner` and lastly the `--delete-conflicting-outputs` flag will tell the `build_runner` package to delete any existing `*.freezed.dart` and `*.g.dart` files to prevent duplicate outputs or that it could potentially conflict with those.\n\nSo every time you might have to update your data model with new properties, you will always have to execute this the command snippet above to tell `build_runner` to generate code for us.\n\nYou can take a peek at what code was generated from the repository or directly from the links below:\n\n*   [freezed_datamodels.freezed.dart](https://github.com/carlomigueldy/freezed_data_modeling/blob/main/lib/models/freezed_datamodels.freezed.dart)\n*   [freezed_datamodels.g.dart](https://github.com/carlomigueldy/freezed_data_modeling/blob/main/lib/models/freezed_datamodels.g.dart)\n\n## [](#copying-values-from-a-data-model-but-only-change-values-of-specific-properties)Copying values from a data model but only change values of specific properties\n\nComing back with copying values of an object in JavaScript, we can now simply do that as well with our data model that is using the `freezed` package.\\\n\n\n    final person = User(\n      id: 1,\n      username: 'carlomigueldy',\n      email: 'carlomigueldy@gmail.com',\n    );\n\n    person.toJson();\n    // { \"id\": 1, \"username\": \"carlomigueldy\", \"email\": \"carlomigueldy@gmail.com\", ... }\n\n    final newPerson = person.copyWith(\n      username: 'johndoe123',\n    );\n\n    newPerson.toJson();\n    // { \"id\": 1, \"username\": \"johndoe123\", \"email\": \"carlomigueldy@gmail.com\", ... }\n\n\n\nThat's really powerful.\n\n## [](#consuming-the-rest-api)Consuming the REST API\n\nWe just got a basic application installed, so remove all those comments that make the code too long in `main.dart` file.\\\n\n\n    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n\n    void main() {\n      runApp(MyApp());\n    }\n\n    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n      // This widget is the root of your application.\n      @override\n      Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n        return MaterialApp(\n          title: 'Flutter Demo',\n          theme: ThemeData(\n            primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n          ),\n          home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),\n        );\n      }\n    }\n\n    class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {\n      MyHomePage({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key);\n\n      final String title;\n\n      @override\n      _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();\n    }\n\n    class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {\n      int _counter = 0;\n\n      void _incrementCounter() {\n        setState(() {\n          _counter++;\n        });\n      }\n\n      @override\n      Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n        return Scaffold(\n          appBar: AppBar(\n            title: Text(widget.title),\n          ),\n          body: Center(\n            child: Column(\n              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n              children: <Widget>[\n                Text(\n                  'You have pushed the button this many times:',\n                ),\n                Text(\n                  '$_counter',\n                  style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,\n                ),\n              ],\n            ),\n          ),\n          floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(\n            onPressed: _incrementCounter,\n            tooltip: 'Increment',\n            child: Icon(Icons.add),\n          ),\n        );\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\nCreate a final field with type `Dio` and instantiate it with a new `Dio` instance, then create a function called `fetchUsers` that will fetch data from this endpoint [`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and set it in a private property with type `List<User>` called as `_users` , we can call this function when you will click on the `FloatingActionButton` or for call this function inside the `initState` lifecycle hook of a `StatefulWidget` , for convenience I will just have the code here below for you to reference on if you prefer to write it out yourself.

There are a lot of use cases that you might require to use `copWith` method from a `freezed` data model.\n\nFor the sake of demonstration purposes, we will implement the following for when a user taps on any of the `ListTile` under the `ListView` we will change the value of the `username` property and append a string with value of \" CLICKED\", so for instance when \"Bret\" is tapped then we will have it display \"Bret CLICKED\". To put things into action, let's create a function that will take an argument as the index of that item of a `ListTile` then attach it on to the `onTap` property of a `ListTile` and just pass in the current `index` of that item.\\\n\n\n    void appendUsername(int index) {\n        setState(() {\n          _users[index] = _users[index].copyWith(\n            username: '${_users[index].username} CLICKED',\n          );\n        });\n      }\n\n    // ... \n\n    body: ListView.builder(\n            itemCount: _users.length,\n            itemBuilder: (context, index) {\n              final user = _users[index];\n\n              return ListTile(\n                title: Text(user.username),\n                subtitle: Text(user.email),\n                onTap: () => appendUsername(index),\n              );\n            },\n          ),\n\n\n\nThen we'll have the following output when any of the `ListTile` is tapped.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FX5pGcQl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ivr1mldz020csa5wsivr.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FX5pGcQl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ivr1mldz020csa5wsivr.png)\n\n## [](#example-usage-for-raw-jsonkey-endraw-annotation)Example usage for `@JsonKey` annotation\n\nThere are certain cases that we can make use of `@JsonKey` annotation when creating our data models, say we have this data model and we have a property named as `catchPhrase` when this gets generated from the `build_runner` package, the JSON property will be equivalent to `catchPhrase` so basically it will result to something like this `json['catchPhrase']`\n\nIn the current API we will be consuming, there'd be no problem since it uses `camelCasing` convention so we can just have that as is\n\nBut what happens if the API will have different set of conventions, and we don't do something about it, so eventually our property `catchPhrase` in our `Company` data model will always be `null` since it will never match `CatchPhrase` or `catch_phrase` that is returned in the application when it is trying to retrieve its value by `json['catchPhrase']`\\\n\n\n    @freezed\n    class Company with _$Company {\n      const factory Company({\n        @Default('') String name,\n        @Default('') String catchPhrase,\n        @Default('') String bs,\n      }) = _Company;\n\n      factory Company.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) =>\n          _$CompanyFromJson(json);\n    }\n\n\n\nSo to fix that we will make use of the `@JsonKey` annotation, just add it before the `@Default` annotation in this case, then we can specify the JSON object property name like so\\\n\n\n    @freezed\n    class Company with _$Company {\n      const factory Company({\n        @Default('') String name,\n        @JsonKey(name: 'catch_phrase') @Default('') String catchPhrase,\n        @Default('') String bs,\n      }) = _Company;\n\n      factory Company.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) =>\n          _$CompanyFromJson(json);\n    }\n\n\n\nThen whenever we call `Company.fromJson(json)` it will parse that coming from a JSON format into the actual `Company` data model that we defined into our application. Instead of having it retrieve by `json['catchPhrase']` we now retrieving it by what we defined in the `name` property of the `@JsonKey` annotation so in this case it will be `json['catch_phrase']`\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\nAnother way of how we can make use of it is when we require to convert a property into a JSON format. For example, for our `User` data model it contains a property for `Company` data model and an `Address` data model. So when we print it out we will have the following value.\\\n\n\n    // Where `user` is of type `User`\n\n    print(user.toJson());\n    // {id: 4, username: Karianne, email: Julianne.OConner@kory.org, address: Address(street: Hoeger Mall, suite: Apt. 692, city: South Elvis, zipcode: 53919-4257), phone: 493-170-9623 x156, website: kale.biz, company: Company(name: Robel-Corkery, catchPhrase: Multi-tiered zero tolerance productivity, bs: transition cutting-edge web services)}\n\n\n\nYou will notice that the `address` property is not in its JSON format, it has the following value instead which tells us it is a class with the its corresponding property and values. Which isn't very ideal whenever we will have to pass this information back into the API, it will throw an exception instead. But this doesn't happen to often when you have to pass back a huge payload to the API.\\\n\n\n    address: Address(street: Hoeger Mall, suite: Apt. 692, city: South Elvis, zipcode: 53919-4257)\n\n\n\nThe way we can fix that up is by using the property `fromJson` and `toJson` converters from the `@JsonKey` annotation. We declare it again before the `@Default` annotation when there exists, otherwise it's just the same spot before the actual property.\\\n\n\n    @freezed\n    class User with _$User {\n      const User._();\n      const factory User({\n        required int id,\n        required String username,\n        required String email,\n        @JsonKey(\n          fromJson: User._addressFromJson,\n          toJson: User._addressToJson,\n        )\n            Address? address,\n        @Default('')\n            String phone,\n        @Default('')\n            String website,\n        @JsonKey(\n          fromJson: User._companyFromJson,\n          toJson: User._companyToJson,\n        )\n            Company? company,\n      }) = _User;\n\n      static Address? _addressFromJson(Map<String, dynamic>? json) {\n        if (json == null) return null;\n\n        return Address.fromJson(json);\n      }\n\n      static Map<String, dynamic>? _addressToJson(Address? address) {\n        if (address == null) return null;\n\n        return address.toJson();\n      }\n\n      static Company? _companyFromJson(Map<String, dynamic>? json) {\n        if (json == null) return null;\n\n        return Company.fromJson(json);\n      }\n\n      static Map<String, dynamic>? _companyToJson(Company? company) {\n        if (company == null) return null;\n\n        return company.toJson();\n      }\n\n      factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);\n    }\n\n\n\nTo break it down for you,\n\nThe `address` we used the `@JsonKey` annotation and passed down the properties for `fromJson` with what we defined as a `static` member of the class which returns the same type of what the property `address` has (`Address?`) which is of type `Address` but is nullable. As per `freezed` package instructions on accessing the same member of the class, it is required that we will have to call this `const User._();`\\\n\n\n    @freezed\n    class User with _$User {\n      const User._();\n\n      const factory User({\n          // ...\n        @JsonKey(\n          fromJson: User._addressFromJson,\n          toJson: User._addressToJson,\n        )\n            Address? address,\n            // ...\n      }) = _User;\n\n      static Address? _addressFromJson(Map<String, dynamic>? json) {\n        if (json == null) return null;\n\n        return Address.fromJson(json);\n      }\n\n      static Map<String, dynamic>? _addressToJson(Address? address) {\n        if (address == null) return null;\n\n        return address.toJson();\n      }\n\n        // ...\n    }\n\n\n\nThe private static method `_addressFromJson` takes a first argument of type `Map<String, dynamic>` which represents a JSON value and is nullable, then in this method we check if the `json` argument is `null` and if that evaluates to `true` then we'll just return `null` otherwise we can call `Address.fromJson(json)` and have it return an instance of a data model `Address` that we defined.\\\n\n\n    static Address? _addressFromJson(Map<String, dynamic>? json) {\n        if (json == null) return null;\n\n        return Address.fromJson(json);\n      }\n\n\n\nThe private static method `_addressToJson` takes a first argument of type `Address` which the data model that we defined is nullable, then in this method we check if the `address` argument is `null` and if that evaluates to `true` then we'll just return `null` otherwise we can call `address.toJson()` and have it return a JSON representation of it.\\\n\n\n    static Map<String, dynamic>? _addressToJson(Address? address) {\n        if (address == null) return null;\n\n        return address.toJson();\n      }\n\n\n\n## [](#finalizing-our-data-models)Finalizing our data models\n\n    import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';\n\n    part 'freezed_datamodels.freezed.dart';\n    part 'freezed_datamodels.g.dart';\n\n    @freezed\n    class Geo with _$Geo {\n      const factory Geo({\n        @Default(0.0) double lat,\n        @Default(0.0) double lng,\n      }) = _Geo;\n\n      factory Geo.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$GeoFromJson(json);\n    }\n\n    @freezed\n    class Address with _$Address {\n      const Address._();\n      const factory Address({\n        @Default('')\n            String street,\n        @Default('')\n            String suite,\n        @Default('')\n            String city,\n        @Default('')\n            String zipcode,\n        @JsonKey(\n          fromJson: Address._geoFromJson,\n          toJson: Address._geoToJson,\n        )\n            Geo?

But there are many ways to do that, but the team decided to only go with `provide()` so it can supply data to components.\n\n*Note: The example scenario may not be so ideal but just to demo how `provide()` and `inject()` works*\\\n\n\n    <template>\n      <AppFirstChild />\n      <AppSecondChild />\n      <AppThirdChild />\n    </template>\n\n    <script>\n    import { defineComponent, provide } from \"@vue/runtime-core\";\n    import AppFirstChild from \"./components/AppFirstChild.vue\";\n    import AppSecondChild from \"./components/AppSecondChild.vue\";\n    import AppThirdChild from \"./components/AppThirdChild.vue\";\n\n    export default defineComponent({\n      name: \"App\",\n\n      components: {\n        AppFirstChild,\n        AppSecondChild,\n        AppThirdChild,\n      },\n\n      setup() {\n        provide(\"user\", \"Carlo Miguel Dy\");\n      },\n    });\n    </script>\n\n    <style>\n    #app {\n      font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n      -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n      -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\n      text-align: center;\n      color: #2c3e50;\n      margin-top: 60px;\n    }\n    </style>\n\n\n\nBut we can just use props instead? We can definitely pass down props from Parent to child component and this child component passes down this prop to its other child components, and when that child component also has its own child components that needs the data from the root component you pass down props as well.\n\nActually this is a problem and things might not be that consistent across our application. So the solution to that problem is to use dependency injection with `provide()` and have all the nested child components use `inject()` to get the provided data.\n\n## [](#inject-dependency)Inject Dependency\n\nThe one way we can use or get the value from `provide()` is to use `inject()`. We'll import that also from `@vue/runtime-core`. Now let us inject the provided data from our Parent component.\n\nFor component `AppFirstChild`\\\n\n\n    <template>\n      <h1>{{ user }}</h1>\n\n      <AppFirstChildChild />\n    </template>\n\n    <script>\n    import { defineComponent, inject } from \"vue\";\n    import AppFirstChildChild from \"./AppFirstChildChild.vue\";\n\n    export default defineComponent({\n      components: {\n        AppFirstChildChild,\n      },\n\n      setup() {\n        const user = inject(\"user\");\n\n        return {\n          user,\n        };\n      },\n    });\n    </script>\n\n\n\nAs you see `AppFirstChild` component also has a child component. We can also use `inject()` to get the data provided from the root Parent component easily.\n\nfor component `AppFirstChildChild`\\\n\n\n    <template>\n      <h1>AppFirstChildChild: {{ user }}</h1>\n    </template>\n\n    <script>\n    import { defineComponent, inject } from \"vue\";\n\n    export default defineComponent({\n      setup() {\n        const user = inject(\"user\");\n\n        return {\n          user,\n        };\n      },\n    });\n    </script>\n\n\n\n## [](#provide-any-data)Provide any data\n\nWe are not only limited to provide values as string, we can pass down any type of data. It can be an array, a number, or an object.\n\nSo let us provide another data with emojis\\\n\n\n    export default defineComponent({\n      name: \"App\",\n\n      components: {\n        AppFirstChild,\n        AppSecondChild,\n        AppThirdChild,\n      },\n\n      setup() {\n        provide(\"user\", \"Carlo Miguel Dy\");\n        provide(\"emojis\", {\n          fire: \"🔥\",\n          star: \"⭐\",\n          pizza: \"🍕\",\n        });\n      },\n    });\n\n\n\n## [](#demo)Demo\n\nOur client is happy with the functionality that we created, cheers!\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5PeQ4UrM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7yle3ewwhx1iavk7sfcg.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5PeQ4UrM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7yle3ewwhx1iavk7sfcg.png)\n\n## [](#conclusion)Conclusion\n\nWhen we want to be consistent in passing down values to other child components across our entire application, we should use `provide()` and `inject()` instead as it saves us the time and all the frustrations when just using props.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read, hope you had a wonderful weekend!\n", "timestamp": 1636676685, "digest": "h9y-zgBsU3tBs8SsB3syzwGWmkgQkJA_ov8NQwb82cg", "contributor": "0x3E8c686F499C877D8f4aFB1215b6f0935796b986"}

For now let's put the `--quickstart` flag, this basically just selects the database which will be SQLite and other default configurations just to setup our Strapi backend quick.\n\nAnd of course, we can use any other SQL databases with Strapi.\\\n\n\n    $ npx create-strapi-app backend --quickstart\n\n\n\nIt will then take awhile for the Strapi installation so wait up for about 5 minutes maximum or less. Once that is done it will launch a page and asks you to create an admin account.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zqp1aZV3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rqmxspg5l1clhllp6431.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zqp1aZV3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rqmxspg5l1clhllp6431.png)\n\nJust create a simple account that is easy to remember, for example:\\\n\n\n    First Name: Admin\n    Last Name: Admin\n    Email: admin@admin.com\n    Password: Password123!\n\n\n\nOnce that is done, the Strapi Admin dashboard should be opened by now.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JwV7EEmV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4i8nlnt1z88kc6m0wlej.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JwV7EEmV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4i8nlnt1z88kc6m0wlej.png)\n\nThen up next will be to create our Next.js app\\\n\n\n    $ npx create-next-app frontend\n\n\n\nAfter installing Next.js let's add TypeScript for our Next.js\\\n\n\n    $ touch tsconfig.json\n\n\n\nThen run the app and it should throw us an error in the CLI and will ask us to install the following\\\n\n\n    # If you’re using npm\n    $ npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node\n\n    # If you’re using Yarn\n    $ yarn add --dev typescript @types/react @types/node\n\n\n\nOnce that is done we can run our Next.js server again and it should be ready. Then all of our files will end with `.tsx` so we can use TypeScript in writing code and it will be much easier for us to write code for the application.\n\n## [](#creating-a-post-collection)Creating a Post Collection\n\nFor a single post in our blog application, we'll have the following fields like `title`, and `content`. So that's all we have for now we'd like to keep it simple since this is just a simple blog application.\n\nFor our TypeScript datamodel, we'll have something like\\\n\n\n    export interface Post {\n      id: number;\n      title: string;\n      content: string;\n      created_at: any;\n      updated_at: any;\n      published_at: any;\n    }\n\n\n\nThe other fields like `id`, `created_at` and `published_at` are being generated by Strapi.\n\nSo let's proceed to creating a Collection Type in Strapi. Now on the side menu / sidebar, hover over the \"Content-Types Builder\" and click it and it should navigate us to this page.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ROmm8KEN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ntgovcu9mxy9ruwzai2u.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ROmm8KEN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ntgovcu9mxy9ruwzai2u.png)\n\nOnce you are already in that page, then click on \"Create new collection type\"\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kWqRg92v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a92xjfrl1y18vandzd28.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kWqRg92v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a92xjfrl1y18vandzd28.png)\n\nA modal should then open with a field labelled as \"Display Name\", then just put \"Post\",\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mnIzw9IR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y46nki15g6rmv8bmdg85.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mnIzw9IR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y46nki15g6rmv8bmdg85.png)\n\nWe want it to be in a form of a singular word than plural because Strapi will then read this as plural word when generating API endpoints. So basically if we have a Collection named as \"Post\" then our RESTful API endpoints that are generated will have `/posts`, and `/posts/:id`.\n\nClick \"Continue\" to proceed.\n\nWhile we only have two fields for this Collection, we simply want \"Text\" for our `title` field and \"Rich Text\" for the `content`.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vgi1Gl56--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0fk831wf0mzntw7nkt8c.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vgi1Gl56--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0fk831wf0mzntw7nkt8c.png)\n\nOnce that is done, click on \"Save\"\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6IZQ1QUE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p52pu5e98qkwtxwu24ao.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6IZQ1QUE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p52pu5e98qkwtxwu24ao.png)\n\nAnd after that, we already have a REST API that was generated by Strapi itself! We will also have the following CRUD feature up and ready, so let's visit the page under Strapi dashboard.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oOkDQL5u--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6eoduj6tnh5jb7wwkri8.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oOkDQL5u--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6eoduj6tnh5jb7wwkri8.png)\n\nThen we can create a few posts then we'll test our API.\n\n## [](#creating-posts)Creating Posts\n\nClick the \"Create\" button on the top right portion and you should then navigate into this page with the form.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ACXt3CWc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7wudpd3y4p9r6brdjfg5.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ACXt3CWc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7wudpd3y4p9r6brdjfg5.png)\n\nClick \"Save\" when done, then wait a bit and finally click \"Publish\" so we can see this getting returned from the REST API when we are requesting the data.\n\n## [](#allow-read-access-to-public)Allow read access to Public\n\nBefore anything else, we will have to allow reads. To do that, navigate into \"Settings\" page and click on the \"Roles\" tab under \"Users & Permissions Plugin\" section. Then on the table click on the row \"Public\" then we can allow reads publicly.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UooUtykA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uyin92vhe1tatbowco9g.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UooUtykA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uyin92vhe1tatbowco9g.png)\n\nOnce that is done be sure to click \"Save\", and we can proceed to testing our API manually in the browser or you can do it using Insomnia. Whichever you prefer.\n\n## [](#testing)Testing\n\nJust to make it quick and easy because it's just basically the same thing. Open this in a new tab `http://localhost:1337/posts` and it should return an array of objects.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--\\_8Tz5Ww3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yl0a4uucrdr76439uzgi.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--\\_8Tz5Ww3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yl0a4uucrdr76439uzgi.png)\n\n## [](#frontend)Frontend\n\nWe can setup our frontend and make it read the posts that is created from Strapi. But before that I'll want to use `axios` for HTTP calls.\n\nSo to install on a new fresh terminal and make sure you are under `frontend` directory\\\n\n\n    $ cd frontend\n\n\n\nThen install the package\\\n\n\n    $ npm install axios\n\n\n\nFor the look, let's use Chakra UI. To install it,\\\n\n\n    $ npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^4\n\n\n\nThen make the following changes of your Next application if you haven't already.\n\nChange `_app.js` to `_app.tsx` then add the `AppProps` type on the first destructured parameter.\n\nThen the `index.js` page to `index.tsx`.\n\nThe moving back under `_app.tsx` file, wrap the `<Component {...pageProps} />` around the component `ChakraProvider`\n\nIt should then look like this when done correctly.\\\n\n\n    import { ChakraProvider } from \"@chakra-ui/react\";\n    import { AppProps } from \"next/dist/next-server/lib/router/router\";\n\n    function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n      return (\n        <ChakraProvider>\n          <Component {...pageProps} />\n        </ChakraProvider>\n      );\n    }\n\n    export default MyApp;\n\n\n\nThen the `index.tsx` file, remove everything from there and replace the following code:\\\n\n\n    import { GetServerSideProps, GetStaticProps } from \"next\";\n    import axios from \"axios\";\n    import { Box, Heading } from \"@chakra-ui/layout\";\n\n    interface Post {\n      id: number;\n      title: string;\n      content: string;\n      created_at: any;\n      updated_at: any;\n      published_at: any;\n    }\n\n    interface PostJsonResponse {\n      data: Post[];\n    }\n\n    export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {\n      const response = await axios.get(\"http://localhost:1337/posts\", {\n        headers: {\n          Accept: \"application/json\",\n        },\n      });\n      const data: Post[] = response.data;\n\n      return {\n        props: {\n          data,\n        },\n      };\n    };\n\n    const IndexView = ({ data }: PostJsonResponse) => {\n      return (\n        <>\n          <Box height=\"100vh\" padding=\"10\">\n            <Heading>My Blog</Heading>\n            <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>\n          </Box>\n        </>\n      );\n    };\n\n    export default IndexView;\n\n\n\nTo break it down for you. Under `index.tsx` file, that is our main view and the route path is `/`, basically this is the first page.\n\nWe created an interface of `Post` from the one I mentioned above and a `PostJsonResponse` as we'll provide that type to the first parameter of our React component which is the props.\n\nWe also used `getStaticProps` for fetching data from our Strapi backend. While this is just a simple blog application and there's not many posts to create we'll use `getStaticProps` as it will pre generate these data during build time as JSON files. Basically making reads blazing fast.\n\nAnd on the template, we used the `Box` component from Chakra UI just for the layout and providing us padding and a height of `100vh`.\n\nThen just to see the JSON data we called it in the template `<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>` and the `pre` tag just to make it look \"pretty\" and easier to read the JSON format.\n\nSo that's about it. So this is how it looks as of the moment.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LVq\\_9MHS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yrjujxq5t2w7x2kbe96u.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LVq\\_9MHS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yrjujxq5t2w7x2kbe96u.png)\n\n## [](#creating-a-postcard-component)Creating a PostCard component\n\nJust to make things look better, let's create a `PostCard` component that will have an `onClick` prop so whenever we click on the card it will redirect us to a Post detail view to read more of the contents from each of our posts that we created from Strapi.\n\nTo do that, create a directory under `frontend` directory and name it as `components` then create the file called `PostCard.tsx`.\n\nThen the code would be as follows\\\n\n\n    import { Button } from \"@chakra-ui/button\";\n    import { Box, Heading, Text } from \"@chakra-ui/layout\";\n\n    export type PostCardProps = {\n      title: string;\n      publishedAt: string;\n      onClick: VoidFunction;\n    };\n\n    const PostCard = ({ title, publishedAt, onClick }: PostCardProps) => {\n      return (\n        <>\n          <Box\n            padding=\"30px\"\n            width=\"500px\"\n            shadow=\"lg\"\n            borderRadius=\"md\"\n            marginBottom=\"30px\"\n            onClick={onClick}\n          >\n            <Box display=\"flex\" justifyContent=\"space-between\">\n              <Text fontWeight=\"bold\" fontSize=\"24px\">\n                {title}\n              </Text>\n              <Button colorScheme=\"facebook\">Read</Button>\n            </Box>\n            <Text size=\"10px\">Published at {new Date(publishedAt).toLocaleDateString()}</Text>\n          </Box>\n        </>\n      );\n    };\n\n    export default PostCard;\n\n\n\n## [](#use-the-postcard-component)Use the PostCard component\n\nThen head on over back to our `index.tsx` file and update that code that will be using the newly created dumb component. It is a dumb component since it doesn't handle any state, only receiving input props from a parent component.\\\n\n\n    import { GetServerSideProps, GetStaticProps } from \"next\";\n    import { Box, Center, Heading, VStack } from \"@chakra-ui/layout\";\n    import { useRouter } from \"next/router\";\n    import axios from \"axios\";\n    import PostCard from \"../components/PostCard\";\n\n    interface Post {\n      id: number;\n      title: string;\n      content: string;\n      created_at: any;\n      updated_at: any;\n      published_at: any;\n    }\n\n    interface PostJsonResponse {\n      data: Post[];\n    }\n\n    export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {\n      const response = await axios.get(\"http://localhost:1337/posts\", {\n        headers: {\n          Accept: \"application/json\",\n        },\n      });\n      const data: Post[] = response.data;\n\n      return {\n        props: {\n          data,\n        },\n      };\n    };\n\n    const IndexView = ({ data }: PostJsonResponse) => {\n      const router = useRouter();\n      const toPostView = (id: number) => router.push(`/posts/${id}`);\n      const posts = data.map((post) => (\n        <PostCard\n          key={post.id}\n          title={post.title}\n          publishedAt={post.published_at}\n          onClick={() => toPostView(post.id)}\n        />\n      ));\n\n      return (\n        <>\n          <Box height=\"100vh\" padding=\"10\">\n            <Heading>My Blog</Heading>\n\n            <Center>\n              <VStack>{posts}</VStack>\n            </Center>\n          </Box>\n        </>\n      );\n    };\n\n    export default IndexView;\n\n\n\nAnd our application will look like this by now.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--82KS0xrv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3821t39clnz1qie9nnng.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--82KS0xrv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3821t39clnz1qie9nnng.png)\n\nYou may notice I have imported the `useRouter()` hook from `next/router` and I have put an on click handler on to the button \"Read\" and that it should navigate into the post detail view. When you click on it now, it will return you a 404 error.\n\nSo let's create that view.\n\n## [](#post-detail-view)Post detail view\n\nCreate a new folder under `pages` directory and name it as `posts` then create a file and name it as `[id].tsx` where the brackets will make this view to render with dynamic route parameters. This way we can handle different Post IDs.\n\nThen have the following code,\\\n\n\n    import { GetStaticPaths, GetStaticProps } from \"next\";\n    import { useRouter } from \"next/router\";\n    import { Post } from \"../../models/Post\";\n    import { Button } from \"@chakra-ui/button\";\n    import { Box, Divider, Heading, Text } from \"@chakra-ui/layout\";\n    import axios from \"axios\";\n\n    export type PostDetailViewProps = {\n      data: Post;\n    };\n\n    export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {\n      const response = await axios.get(\"http://localhost:1337/posts\");\n      const posts: Post[] = await response.data;\n\n      const paths = posts.map((post) => {\n        return {\n          params: { id: String(post.id) },\n        };\n      });\n\n      return {\n        paths,\n        fallback: false,\n      };\n    };\n\n    export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {\n      const { data } = await axios.get(`http://localhost:1337/posts/${params.id}`);\n\n      return {\n        props: {\n          data,\n        },\n      };\n    };\n\n    const PostDetailView = ({ data }: PostDetailViewProps) => {\n      const router = useRouter();\n\n      return (\n        <>\n          <Box padding=\"10\">\n            <Button onClick={() => router.back()}>Back</Button>\n            <Heading>{data.title}</Heading>\n            <Text>{data.published_at}</Text>\n            <Divider marginTop=\"10\" marginBottom=\"10\"></Divider>\n            <Text>{data.content}</Text>\n          </Box>\n        </>\n      );\n    };\n\n    export default PostDetailView;\n\n\n\nTo break it down for you. We used `getStaticPaths` to fetch all of the posts and map it down to shape as a `path` that `next` knows about. Since `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` will be executed during build time and generates static content therefore it should make sense by now having called all posts inside a post detail view on `getStaticPaths`.\n\nWe then used `getStaticProps` and we have our first argument as the context but destructured it to only retrieve the `params` property which have access to the parameters of the current route. That's how we retrieve the `id` from the `[id].tsx` file name. While we have that we can make a call to a specific post.\n\nThen on the template, we just added a \"Back\" button so we imported `useRouter` from `next/router`, next is we display the `title` field, `published_at` field and then the `content`. But for now I just didn't install a react markdown. Typically you should use react-markdown or any similar library to display the markdown contents properly.\n\nThis is how it looks by the way.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MxLsZ6o5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6omexd7fhj4jj8mvskf4.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MxLsZ6o5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6omexd7fhj4jj8mvskf4.png)\n\n## [](#summary)Summary\n\nWe learned how to build a blog using Strapi and Next.js and also understand some of the concepts Next.js has regarding `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` for static site generation. By now you should be able to build out a simple blog on your own or you might a blog but has other use cases but simple CRUD functionalities are mostly required then usnig Strapi would definitely be a good pick. Otherwise if the project requires some customization, then consult Strapi's official documentation to understand/learn how you will implement it using Strapi.\n\nIf you've ever reached here at the bottom part of this article, then thank you so much for taking the time to read.

Postgres is also a relational database which is also open source and a powerful tool.\n\nWe will learn and build a simple grocery application using Flutter with Supabase.\n\nI am not going to go over setting up Flutter step by step since how I built it uses the Stacked architecture which follows an MVVM style so I will just show you how to write Supabase code in Dart with-in a Flutter application instead.\n\nYou can learn more about Stacked architecture at [FilledStacks](https://www.filledstacks.com/) :D\n\nMy repository for SupaGrocery will be shared at the end of this tutorial. So you can go ahead and download it.\n\n## [](#demo)Demo\n\n[![SupaGrocery Demo](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--\\_-u8-GYz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://img.youtube.com/vi/MEVGRYElPnU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEVGRYElPnU)\n\n## [](#database-design)Database Design\n\nBut before we start everything else, we'll take a look at our database design. See attached image below.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---XG-zVbA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/suilro2gdbj4vei269l4.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---XG-zVbA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/suilro2gdbj4vei269l4.png)\n\nFor our simple grocery app, we'll only require 4 of these tables.\n\n*   `app_users`: This is the table where we will store our users, it will have the same primary ID with the supabase auth users. I was not able to use just the `users` table since it cannot be read publicly so I had to create this table.\n*   `groceries`: All the grocery list of each user will be stored in this table.\n*   `products`: All of the products created by the user will be stored in this table.\n*   `grocery_products`: This is where we sort of link the products with a grocery. This is what we call a pivot table.\n\n## [](#relationships)Relationships\n\nIn relation databases, table relationships are very common thing and is what I love the most about in relational databases.\n\nThese two are the most common relationships:\n\n*   One to One\n*   One to Many\n*   Many to Many (Pivot table)\n\nOur `app_users` table has a One to Many relationship with the two tables we created namely `products` and `groceries` since a user can have many grocery listing and can also have many products in that grocery listing.\n\nThen for our `groceries` table we have the `created_by` column as a foreign key so that will link to the `app_users` table which will then identify it as part of the user's grocery listing in our application.\n\nThe same goes for `products` table with the `created_by` column as a foreign key as well.\n\nThen for our pivot table which is a Many to Many relationship, because a grocery listing can have many products and a product can belong to many grocery listing.\n\n## [](#supabase-setup)Supabase setup\n\nCreate your first Supabase account!

There is some sort of bug which I cannot have a default value for the `uuid` key to just generate a `uuid` when a new record is created.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EEi_TlwA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m8h06rakmolnkciu5jab.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EEi_TlwA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m8h06rakmolnkciu5jab.png)\n\nThen just click on \"Save\" at the upper right corner to finally create the table.\n\nWhen that table is created, we can proceed to add our primary key which is a `uuid`. Click ahead on that plus icon to add a new column for the table.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OGMgMoNO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zxor6o90gzw1020uqyg9.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OGMgMoNO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zxor6o90gzw1020uqyg9.png)\n\nThen name the column as `id` and it will be a primary key and a type of `uuid` then have the default value \"Automatically generate UUID\" and click \"Save\" once that is done.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KAnthn0s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vbl4lcdy5sdaon5y58e9.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KAnthn0s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vbl4lcdy5sdaon5y58e9.png)\n\nOnce that is done, we can proceed to create more of those columns that we defined from our database design.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P6UOgyJ8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sqskongwnjc47rrfbknj.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P6UOgyJ8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sqskongwnjc47rrfbknj.png)\n\nNext is we will create a table for `products` and we'll have a foreign key setup with this table since a product belongs to a user. So we'll learn how to do that quickly.\n\nSo given that you already created a primary key `id` and its corresponding column `name` as a varchar, let's create one last field which is `created_by` and setup this as a foreign key that links up with the `app_users` table.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LioXBEc1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xxc641voxkq1wzp8b94p.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LioXBEc1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xxc641voxkq1wzp8b94p.png)\n\nNow click on \"Add foreign key relation\" button at the bottom\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tbC8KZeP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nkmv58z0g31yowj8na59.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tbC8KZeP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nkmv58z0g31yowj8na59.png)\n\nThen select the table `app_users` and the `id` field, when that is done click \"Save\"\n\nShould then show you it is now linked up with the `app_users` table, so that is pretty amazing.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--30n6T3D7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4z6nwx60x0m867kf4oof.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--30n6T3D7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4z6nwx60x0m867kf4oof.png)\n\nThat is all you need to know for setting up foreign keys. Now the rest of the tables is up to you now.

Just check on the project API which will be dynamically generated for you whenever you update table or change any columns.\n\nTo compare it, this is a RAW SQL query.\\\n\n\n    SELECT * FROM products\n\n\n\nAnd this is how you write queries with Supabase in Dart\\\n\n\n    supabase.from(\"products\").select().execute();\n\n\n\nMake sure you always have the `execute` at the last part otherwise it will not get all data from `products` table.\n\nWhat about querying for a single record?\n\nIn SQL we have,\\\n\n\n    SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = \"uuid-string\";\n\n\n\nIn Supabase Dart we have,\\\n\n\n    supabase.from(\"products\").select().eq(\"id\", \"uuid-string\").single().execute();\n\n\n\nThere are more queries to show from your Supabase project, so be sure to check it out here\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T6XfTl_l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mv7e4x6k7xs1pd65nf7t.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T6XfTl_l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mv7e4x6k7xs1pd65nf7t.png)\n\n## [](#authentication)Authentication\n\nIn every application, one thing you can secure your user's data is to have an authentication system. So with Supabase it is very easy to get started with authentication right away as they provide a very simple and intuitive API!\\\n\n\n    class AuthenticationService {\n      final _logger = Logger();\n      final _localStorageService = locator<LocalStorageService>();\n\n      AppUser? _user = null;\n      AppUser? get user => _user;\n      bool get hasUser => _user != null;\n\n      Future<void> initialize() async {}\n\n      Future<AppUser?> signIn({required AuthDto payload}) async {}\n\n      Future<AppUser?> signUp({required AuthDto payload}) async {}\n\n      Future<void> signOut() async {}\n\n      Future<AppUser?> fetchUser({required String id}) async {}\n\n      Future<PostgrestResponse> _createUser(User user, AuthDto payload) {}\n    }\n\n\n\nTo the code above, to break it down. This is dependent with the local storage service (Shared Preferences) which is where we will store out JWT auth token / refresh token and the Logger which can be useful for debugging. So I like to have a Logger with me.\n\nWe have a private propery `_user` which is where we store our user with its own getter and a boolean getter to check if the user is logged in if the `_user` property is not null.\n\nInside the `initialize()` method is where we will perform auto login. So if the user has a refresh token stored in their local storage, we will proceed to login this user and get user data and store it in `_user` property so the `hasUser` boolean getter will be true.\\\n\n\n    Future<void> initialize() async {\n        final accessToken = await _localStorageService.getItem('token');\n        _logger.i(accessToken);\n\n        if (accessToken == null) {\n          return;\n        }\n\n        final response = await supabase.auth.api.getUser(accessToken);\n\n        if (response.error != null) {\n          return;\n        }\n\n        final user = response.data!;\n        _logger.i(user.toJson());\n        await fetchUser(id: user.id);\n      }\n\n\n\nNext is the `signIn` method which has an argument of `AuthDto` that contains `email` and `password` field. When a user provided correct and existing email, we will take their access token and store it in local storage.\\\n\n\n    Future<AppUser?> signIn({required AuthDto payload}) async {\n        final response = await supabase.auth.signIn(\n          email: payload.email,\n          password: payload.password,\n        );\n\n        if (response.error != null) {\n          _logger.e(response.error!.message);\n          return null;\n        }\n        _logger.i(response.data);\n        await _localStorageService.setItem('token', response.data!.accessToken);\n        return await fetchUser(id: response.data!.user!.id);\n      }\n\n\n\nWe use the `signUp` method whenever we have a new user that wants to use our app. When a new user is created, we take the access token and save it to local storage. We will also proceed to creating a new user record in the `app_users` table but it will be in a different method called `_createUser`\\\n\n\n    Future<AppUser?> signUp({required AuthDto payload}) async {\n        final response =\n            await supabase.auth.signUp(payload.email, payload.password);\n\n        if (response.error != null) {\n          _logger.e(response.error!.message);\n          return null;\n        }\n\n        final user = response.data!.user!;\n        _logger.i(user.toJson());\n        await _createUser(user, payload);\n        await _localStorageService.setItem('token', response.data!.accessToken);\n        return await fetchUser(id: user.id);\n      }\n\n\n\n`_createdUser` will create a new user record inside `app_users` table.\\\n\n\n    Future<PostgrestResponse> _createUser(User user, AuthDto payload) {\n        return supabase\n            .from(\"app_users\")\n            .insert(\n              AppUser(\n                id: user.id,\n                name: payload.name!,\n                email: user.email,\n              ),\n            )\n            .execute();\n      }\n\n\n\nThen the `signOut` which is already self explanatory. Here we just remove the access token from the local storage when user decides to `signOut`\\\n\n\n    Future<void> signOut() async {\n        final response = await supabase.auth.signOut();\n\n        if (response.error != null) {\n          _logger.e(response.error!.message);\n          return;\n        }\n        _logger.i(response.rawData);\n        await _localStorageService.removeItem('token');\n        return;\n      }\n\n\n\nAnd lastly we have the `fetchUser` method, that will fetch the user record that is currently authenticated so we'll have their information across the entire application whenever we need it.\\\n\n\n    Future<AppUser?> fetchUser({required String id}) async {\n        final response = await supabase\n            .from(\"app_users\")\n            .select()\n            .eq('id', id)\n            .single()\n            .execute();\n\n        _logger.i(\n          'Count: ${response.count}, Status: ${response.status}, Data: ${response.data}',\n        );\n\n        if (response.error != null) {\n          _logger.e(response.error!.message);\n          return null;\n        }\n\n        _logger.i(response.data);\n        final data = AppUser.fromJson(response.data);\n        _user = data;\n\n        return data;\n      }\n\n\n\n## [](#supabase-service)Supabase Service\n\nWe finished handling our data models and authentication, then we can create and handle read write operations for our application. Thanks to the concept of abstraction, we don't have to write up a lot of code for the same functionality, we will be writing less code and have this functionality extended to other service that requires it.\n\nThe following will be the abstract class that handles CRUD operations (Cread, Read, Update, Delete)\\\n\n\n    import 'package:logger/logger.dart';\n    import 'package:postgrest/postgrest.dart';\n    import 'package:supagrocery/app/app.locator.dart';\n    import 'package:supagrocery/app/supabase_api.dart';\n    import 'package:supagrocery/services/authentication_service.dart';\n\n    abstract class SupabaseService<T> {\n      final _authService = locator<AuthenticationService>();\n      final _logger = Logger();\n\n      String tableName() {\n        return \"\";\n      }\n\n      Future<PostgrestResponse> all() async {\n        _logger.i(tableName());\n        final response = await supabase\n            .from(tableName())\n            .select()\n            .eq('created_by', _authService.user!.id)\n            .execute();\n        _logger.i(response.toJson());\n        return response;\n      }\n\n      Future<PostgrestResponse> find(String id) async {\n        _logger.i(tableName() + ' ' + id);\n        final response = await supabase\n            .from(tableName())\n            .select()\n            .eq('id', id)\n            .single()\n            .execute();\n        _logger.i(response.toJson());\n        return response;\n      }\n\n      Future<PostgrestResponse> create(Map<String, dynamic> json) async {\n        _logger.i(tableName() + ' ' + json.toString());\n        final response = await supabase.from(tableName()).insert(json).execute();\n        _logger.i(response.toJson());\n        return response;\n      }\n\n      Future<PostgrestResponse> update({\n        required String id,\n        required Map<String, dynamic> json,\n      }) async {\n        _logger.i(tableName() + ' ' + json.toString());\n        final response =\n            await supabase.from(tableName()).update(json).eq('id', id).execute();\n        _logger.i(response.toJson());\n        return response;\n      }\n\n      Future<PostgrestResponse> delete(String id) async {\n        _logger.i(tableName() + ' ' + id);\n        final response =\n            await supabase.from(tableName()).delete().eq('id', id).execute();\n        _logger.i(response.toJson());\n        return response;\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\nThis abstract class has a dependency on the `AuthenticationService` that we just created so we'll be able to attach the user's ID every time they create records in our database.\n\nAnd we'll have the `tableName` to override for each feature services that requires it. So when creating our `ProductService` and `GroceryService`, we simply extend this class and that override `tableName` with their corresponding table names.\n\nThis is an example for `ProductService`\\\n\n\n    import 'package:postgrest/postgrest.dart';\n    import 'package:supagrocery/app/app.locator.dart';\n    import 'package:supagrocery/app/supabase_api.dart';\n    import 'package:supagrocery/datamodels/application_models.dart';\n    import 'package:supagrocery/services/authentication_service.dart';\n    import 'package:supagrocery/services/supabase_service.dart';\n\n    class ProductService extends SupabaseService<Product> {\n      final _authService = locator<AuthenticationService>();\n\n      @override\n      String tableName() {\n        return \"products\";\n      }\n\n      Future<PostgrestResponse> fetchProducts() async {\n        return await supabase\n            .from(\"products\")\n            .select(\"*\")\n            .eq('created_by', _authService.user!.id)\n            .execute();\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\nThis will also have the methods from `SupabaseService` abstract class that we created and won't have to rewrite anything of it, we only need to override the `tableName` and return the name of that table. With that inside the `ProductService` we can then write up any method that is relevant to the business logic.\n\nThen this is our `GroceryService`\\\n\n\n    import 'package:postgrest/postgrest.dart';\n    import 'package:supagrocery/app/app.locator.dart';\n    import 'package:supagrocery/app/supabase_api.dart';\n    import 'package:supagrocery/datamodels/application_models.dart';\n    import 'package:supagrocery/services/supabase_service.dart';\n\n    import 'authentication_service.dart';\n\n    class GroceryService extends SupabaseService<Grocery> {\n      final _authService = locator<AuthenticationService>();\n\n      @override\n      String tableName() {\n        return \"groceries\";\n      }\n\n      Future<PostgrestResponse> fetchGroceryList({required String id}) async {\n        return await supabase\n            .from(\"groceries\")\n            .select(\"*, grocery_products(*, products(*) )\")\n            .eq('id', id)\n            .eq('created_by', _authService.user!.id)\n            .single()\n            .execute();\n      }\n\n      Future<PostgrestResponse> addProductsToList({\n        required String id,\n        required List<Product?> products,\n      }) async {\n        return await supabase\n            .from(\"grocery_products\")\n            .insert(\n              products.map((e) {\n                return GroceryProductDto(\n                  groceryId: id,\n                  productId: e!.id,\n                ).toJson();\n              }).toList(),\n            )\n            .execute();\n      }\n\n      Future<PostgrestResponse> markProductChecked(\n          {required GroceryProduct payload}) async {\n        return await supabase\n            .from(\"grocery_products\")\n            .update(payload.toJson())\n            .eq('id', payload.id)\n            .execute();\n      }\n\n      Future<PostgrestResponse> removeProduct({required String id}) async {\n        return await supabase\n            .from(\"grocery_products\")\n            .delete()\n            .eq('id', id)\n            .execute();\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\n## [](#summary)Summary\n\nWe covered database design, setting up Supabase, implementing an authentication system with Supabase API, and using abstraction to easily implement new features.\n\nI hope this gave you an idea and was useful in any sort of way.\n\nThanks for reading and hope you enjoyed!\n\n[Link to Repository](https://github.com/carlomigueldy/supagrocery)\n", "timestamp": 1636676641, "digest": "4eu5OlKhb3XGQs_WlhHhWirIzrADhQxnDejGIpQN7-g", "contributor": "0x3E8c686F499C877D8f4aFB1215b6f0935796b986"}
{"id": "FyujfEjYUKP_1WUIfGjv4LqRnVQlvEPqgI9nNwk9nAo", "title": "Building a RESTful API with NestJS and MongoDB (Mongoose)", "body": "## [](#introduction)Introduction\n\nWe will learn how to implement a RESTful API for a simple todo application using NestJS framework. But what is NestJS?\n\n> \"A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.\"\n\nYou can read more about NestJS [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/).\n\nIn this article, it assumes you have at least the basic understanding of TypeScript and even better with NodeJS and ExpressJS. However if you aren't familiar with these requirements, I will list down you what I recommend you to watch to learn from:\n\n*   TypeScript by [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM)\n*   NodeJS by [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENrzD9HAZK4)\n*   ExpressJS by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE)\n\nI also recommend you to subscribe on those YouTube channels as they produce high quality content and it's for free! I have other favorite YouTube channels as well but I will write it in another article.\n\nAnd if you are a frontend developer and have been using Angular for awhile, then this should be very familiar to you since NestJS is very similar with how Angular code is structured! Dependency injections, modules, generate code using CLI, and so much more!\n\n## [](#installation)Installation\n\nThis installation guide will be based on for Linux since I am using WSL2 on Windows and it is my preference and find it more convenient. I believe installation process is very similar but in case for other platforms I suggest you to consult the documentation that can be found [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps)\n\n## [](#installing-nest-cli)Installing Nest CLI\n\nOpen up your terminal and execute this command to install Nest CLI\\\n\n\n    sudo npm install -g @nestjs/cli\n\n\n\nTo test it out if it has been successfully installed just execute the command below and that should tell you the current version installed for Nest CLI\\\n\n\n    nest -v\n\n\n\n## [](#create-a-new-nest-project)Create a new Nest project\n\nNavigate to your projects directory or in any directory whichever you prefer and run this command below to install you a new project\\\n\n\n    nest new todo-rest-app\n\n\n\nIf it asks you which package manager to select from, just choose anything you prefer but in this article I will select NPM.\n\nAnd now wait for the entire CLI to scaffold the new starter project for you.\n\n## [](#open-the-project-in-your-ide)Open the project in your IDE\n\nOnce that is done installing, open it on your preferred code editor. In my case I will open it with VSCode (Visual Studio Code), so I will execute in the terminal with this command\\\n\n\n    cd todo-rest-app && code .\n\n\n\nThen that should open up your IDE.\n\n## [](#creating-todo-feature)Creating \"Todo\" feature\n\nWe can easily generate code for the Module class, Service class, Controller class by using the powerful CLI.\n\nOne thing to take note is that when creating a new feature, you should start by generating a module class for the particular feature. So for instance `TodoModule` is being generated first.\n\nSo let us generate them right on!\\\n\n\n    # TodoModule\n    nest g module Todo\n    # Using alias: nest g mo Todo\n\n    # TodoService\n    nest g service Todo\n    # Using alias: nest g s Todo\n\n    # TodoController\n    nest g controller Todo \n    # Using alias: nest g co Todo \n\n\n\nThis should create a folder called \"todo\" and it will also add the `TodoService` under the `providers` array in `TodoModule` and the `TodoController` in the `controllers` array.\n\n## [](#creating-a-todo-modelschema)Creating a Todo model/schema\n\nBefore we proceed to writing the code for handling data and exposing it to the REST API we first create a data model for Todo. So let us create a schema using Mongoose package, so let's install it\\\n\n\n    npm install --save @nestjs/mongoose mongoose\n\n\n\nRight after installation make sure to add `MongooseModule` into the imports array. We'll want to import this under `AppModule` so we let the application know where the MongoDB is coming from.\n\nHowever if you don't have MongoDB installed in your system you can use [this as reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database#install-mongodb) if you are using Linux based system\\\n\n\n    // app.module.ts\n\n    import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';\n    import { MongooseModule } from '@nestjs/mongoose';\n\n    @Module({\n      imports: [MongooseModule.forRoot('mongodb://localhost/nest')],\n    })\n    export class AppModule {}\n\n\n\nAfter adding `MongooseModule.forRoot()` in `AppModule` we can then proceed to defining our Todo schema, so head on over to \"todo\" directory as this feature directory has been generated by the CLI, so under this directory create a folder named \"schemas\" and it's where the Todo schema resides\n\nOr you can do so by using this terminal commands\\\n\n\n    mkdir src/todo/schemas && touch src/todo/schemas/todo.schema.ts\n\n\n\nThen let us define our Todo schema\\\n\n\n    import { Prop, Schema, SchemaFactory } from '@nestjs/mongoose';\n    import { Document } from 'mongoose';\n\n    export type TodoDocument = Todo & Document;\n\n    @Schema()\n    export class Todo {\n      @Prop({ required: true })\n      title: string;\n\n      @Prop()\n      description?: string;\n\n      @Prop()\n      completedAt?: Date;\n\n      @Prop({ required: true })\n      createdAt: Date;\n\n      @Prop()\n      deletedAt?: Date;\n    }\n\n    export const TodoSchema = SchemaFactory.createForClass(Todo);\n\n\n\nThen let's create a DTO (Data Object Model) for creating and updated a Todo. But first I want to create a base class DTO\\\n\n\n    mkdir src/todo/dto\n\n    touch src/todo/dto/base-todo.dto.ts\n\n\n\nThen we define the class and properties\\\n\n\n    // todo/dto/base-todo.dto.ts\n    export class BaseTodoDto {\n       title: string\n       description?: string\n    }\n\n\n\nThen let us create a DTO for Create and Update that will extend this `BaseTodoDto` so for all properties defined under `BaseTodoDto` will carry over the new classes and so we won't have to rewrite all of these properties. So in a sense we aren't writing any boilerplate code in this case.\\\n\n\n    touch src/todo/dto/create-todo.dto.ts\n\n    touch src/todo/dto/update-todo.dto.ts\n\n\n\nThen we can define it\\\n\n\n    // todo/dto/create-todo.dto.ts\n    import { BaseTodoDto } from \"./base-todo.dto\";\n\n    export class CreateTodoDto extends BaseTodoDto {}\n\n    // todo/dto/update-todo.dto.ts\n    import { BaseTodoDto } from './base-todo.dto';\n\n    export class UpdateTodoDto extends BaseTodoDto {\n      completedAt: Date;\n    }\n\n\n\nWe added `completedAt` field on the `UpdateTodoDto` so we'll allow this field to update with that particular field we specified.\n\nAfter defining out model make sure to import this under `TodoModule` so this will be recognized as a `Model` in the codebase.\\\n\n\n    import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';\n    import { TodoService } from './todo.service';\n    import { TodoController } from './todo.controller';\n    import { MongooseModule } from '@nestjs/mongoose';\n    import { Todo, TodoSchema } from './schemas/todo.schema';\n\n    @Module({\n      providers: [TodoService],\n      controllers: [TodoController],\n      imports: [\n        MongooseModule.forFeature([{ name: Todo.name, schema: TodoSchema }]),\n      ],\n    })\n    export class TodoModule {}\n\n\n\n## [](#injecting-the-model-in-todoservice)Injecting the Model in TodoService\n\nUnder class `TodoService`, is here we want to define the logic for handling data. So in the constructor we will then inject the Model as our dependency for this class. The model I am referring to is what we just added into the `imports` array of the `TodoModule`\\\n\n\n    import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';\n    import { InjectModel } from '@nestjs/mongoose';\n    import { Model } from 'mongoose';\n    import { Todo, TodoDocument } from './schemas/todo.schema';\n\n    @Injectable()\n    export class TodoService {\n      constructor(@InjectModel(Todo.name) private readonly model: Model<TodoDocument>) {}\n    }\n\n\n\nIn the constructor we use `@InjectModel(Todo.name)` annotation and we pass in the name of the model and we set it as a private property and gave it a type of `Model` where we also pass a generic type of `TodoDocument` that we defined from the Todo model from `todo.schema.ts`. This will give us all the methods from Mongoose for querying, altering ang creating data for MongoDB which is very convenient as it gives us the auto-completion.\n\nYou may also notice that it has the `@Injectable()` annotation which is very similar to Angular's service classes. This annotation creates the meta data and this makes the class recognized in the service locator other classes will be available to use this class as their dependency.\n\n## [](#defining-crud-functionalities)Defining CRUD functionalities\n\nNow let us proceed with defining the usual CRUD methods. We will have the following methods to write up the implementation details, `findAll()`, `findOne(id: string)`, `create(createTodoDto: CreateTodoDto)`, `update(id: string, updateTodoDto: UpdateTodoDto)`, and `delete(id: string)`.\\\n\n\n    import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';\n    import { InjectModel } from '@nestjs/mongoose';\n    import { Model } from 'mongoose';\n    import { CreateTodoDto } from './dto/create-todo.dto';\n    import { UpdateTodoDto } from './dto/update-todo.dto';\n    import { Todo, TodoDocument } from './schemas/todo.schema';\n\n    @Injectable()\n    export class TodoService {\n      constructor(\n        @InjectModel(Todo.name) private readonly model: Model<TodoDocument>,\n      ) {}\n\n      async findAll(): Promise<Todo[]> {\n        return await this.model.find().exec();\n      }\n\n      async findOne(id: string): Promise<Todo> {\n        return await this.model.findById(id).exec();\n      }\n\n      async create(createTodoDto: CreateTodoDto): Promise<Todo> {\n        return await new this.model({\n          ...createTodoDto,\n          createdAt: new Date(),\n        }).save();\n      }\n\n      async update(id: string, updateTodoDto: UpdateTodoDto): Promise<Todo> {\n        return await this.model.findByIdAndUpdate(id, updateTodoDto).exec();\n      }\n\n      async delete(id: string): Promise<Todo> {\n        return await this.model.findByIdAndDelete(id).exec();\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\n## [](#defining-methods-and-route-endpoints-in-todocontroller)Defining methods and route endpoints in TodoController\n\nIt is very easy to define routes in our Controller class and all thanks to TypeScript for these annotations just made everything a breeze! We have to inject the `TodoService` as our dependency for this `Controller` class and then define all methods with its corresponding annotation as this will handle which HTTP method it will be used to access the functionality.\n\nWe will use the following names in the `Controller` where `index()` is for querying all Todo, `find()` to query a single Todo, `create()` is to add a Todo in DB, `update()` to update an existing Todo based on given ID, and lastly `delete()` to delete a Todo.\\\n\n\n    import {\n      Body,\n      Controller,\n      Delete,\n      Get,\n      Param,\n      Post,\n      Put,\n    } from '@nestjs/common';\n    import { CreateTodoDto } from './dto/create-todo.dto';\n    import { UpdateTodoDto } from './dto/update-todo.dto';\n    import { TodoService } from './todo.service';\n\n    @Controller('todos')\n    export class TodoController {\n      constructor(private readonly service: TodoService) {}\n\n      @Get()\n      async index() {\n        return await this.service.findAll();\n      }\n\n      @Get(':id')\n      async find(@Param('id') id: string) {\n        return await this.service.findOne(id);\n      }\n\n      @Post()\n      async create(@Body() createTodoDto: CreateTodoDto) {\n        return await this.service.create(createTodoDto);\n      }\n\n      @Put(':id')\n      async update(@Param('id') id: string, @Body() updateTodoDto: UpdateTodoDto) {\n        return await this.service.update(id, updateTodoDto);\n      }\n\n      @Delete(':id')\n      async delete(@Param('id') id: string) {\n        return await this.service.delete(id);\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\n## [](#testing-it-with-a-rest-client)Testing it with a REST client\n\nYou can use any REST client of your choice, but for me I prefer Insomnia. Once you have your REST client opened by now we can proceed to testing the REST API we created so we can expect to add a todo, update a todo, delete a todo, read a todo.\n\nFirst let's make a GET request to `todos` endpoint.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PBZb\\_7w7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pv8sgmc11c1e92e4zz26.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PBZb\\_7w7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pv8sgmc11c1e92e4zz26.png)\n\nIt just returned an empty array, and it only makes sense since we did not create any todo. So let's create one!\n\nMake this as the request payload then make a POST request to the same endpoint and that it should return as the new document from MongoDB with an `_id` field since that is auto generated for us.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4j1\\_WmaM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dbjnjxicndxzjcovpyhh.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4j1\\_WmaM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dbjnjxicndxzjcovpyhh.png)\n\nYou can create more todos, but for now we can check again with the same endpoint but using `GET` method.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U0agwhrg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6cdgiuqam5jsrew2kiu4.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U0agwhrg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6cdgiuqam5jsrew2kiu4.png)\n\nNow it returns as a array with our recently created todo.\n\nNow let's update this todo, to change its title. First copy `_id` field from the response. Now using this ID, let's create a PUT request with the same payload but now we add the `completedAt` field\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sag-uzxs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3lnvta6qy12w5a2sqzoz.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sag-uzxs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3lnvta6qy12w5a2sqzoz.png)\n\nAs you can see we have filled up the `completedAt` field. On the first request that you make which returns 200 response but the response data is still the same, don't worry because behind the scenes the document was really updated. You can proceed to check again by GET request method to see the changes, alternative way is to update the document again. So double the PUT request we are making right now and you should see the changes.\n\nNow we want to delete this todo, then let's use the DELETE method in this case using the same endpoint but different HTTP method. It will return us the document deleted.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DQ5G2mYp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6zvxzpx45i1wz9u3wg8w.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DQ5G2mYp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6zvxzpx45i1wz9u3wg8w.png)\n\nAnd that is all we have for now.\n\n## [](#conclusion)Conclusion\n\nWhen you want to create a quick REST API with NodeJS and you also love TypeScript, then NestJS is the way to go! Not only this is good for \"quick\" implementation for REST APIs but NestJS is also great for huge projects since the framework itself encourages the developer to use Domain Driven Design.\n\nHope you enjoyed this tutorial, be sure to hit thumbs up or upvote if you liked it.

Repositories are classes or components that encapsulate the logic required to access data sources. They centralize common data access functionality, providing better maintainability and decoupling the infrastructure or technology used to access databases from the domain model layer.\n\nSource: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/infrastructure-persistence-layer-design#:\\~:text=of%20Work%20patterns.-,The%20Repository%20pattern,from%20the%20domain%20model%20layer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/infrastructure-persistence-layer-design#:%7E:text=of%20Work%20patterns.-,The%20Repository%20pattern,from%20the%20domain%20model%20layer).\n\n## [](#create-a-fresh-laravel%C2%A0project)Create a fresh Laravel project\n\nNow open up a terminal and install a fresh Laravel project,\\\n\n\n    composer create-project laravel/laravel laravel-repository-pattern\n\n\n\nThen open this in your code editor (VS Code).\n\nI am not going to go through the installation process since this article does not aim to teach about installing a Laravel project. Go to the official docs for reference instead, <https://laravel.com/docs/8.x#installation-via-composer>\n\n## [](#creating-a-base-interface-and-base-repository-class)Creating a base interface and base repository class\n\nCreate a directory inside the app and name it as Repository and inside it create another directory Eloquent then create a file named `BaseRepository.php` inside Eloquent directory and create an interface and name it `EloquentRepositoryInterface.php` inside Repository . If you did it correctly you will have the following file structure.\\\n\n\n    - app\n      - Repository\n        - Eloquent\n          - BaseRepository.php\n        - EloquentRepositoryInterface.php\n\n\n\nThen inside the interface EloquentRepositoryInterface.php , write an interface that will contain all the common methods that are used when we are accessing our database to retrieve, store, and remove data. (CRUD)\n\nWe also want to set standards when creating our repository interface, because we want the method names to be self-describing and that we should know what we get when we use the method. We can use the following verbs: 'find', 'get', 'remove', 'update' and etc that simply describes what it does.\n\nThe interface does not care about the implementation details, we only define the method names, what arguments are being passed into it and what we expect it returns. We can simply do that by type hinting it. This what makes it beautiful because whenever we had to change a Data Provider (I am talking about Eloquent ORM, DB, or any 3rd party APIs if there's any), we only have to create another class specifically for it and we do not need to replace code.\n\n## [](#defining-methods-inside-the-eloquentrepositoryinterface)Defining methods inside the EloquentRepositoryInterface\n\nNow let us define the methods that we will be using throughout our entire application in this interface.\\\nHere is an example,\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IcfYTEA0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kktlg68m2e3r0hwr6925.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IcfYTEA0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kktlg68m2e3r0hwr6925.png)\n\nAs you may have noticed the method names are verbose and contains the verbs we just described. Making method names verbose actually makes everything easier.\n\n## [](#implementing-the-eloquentrepositoryinterface-inside-the-baserepository-class)Implementing the EloquentRepositoryInterface inside the BaseRepository class\n\nInside the `BaseRepository` we created a protected property named as $model and it will receive an instance of class Model. In our constructor we inject the Model class and assign the instance into the $model property so it will be available to all methods. These are the important part of our `BaseRepository` class since any new repositories will be extending to this base repository and they won't have to rewrite what we just wrote regarding the implementation details that we interfaced against the `EloquentRepositoryInterface`.\n\nHere is an example,\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--g4JhcNb8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dgihckmhr5kxr8xyoskb.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--g4JhcNb8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dgihckmhr5kxr8xyoskb.png)\n\n## [](#binding-the-interface-and-the-repository-class-in-repositoryserviceprovider-class)Binding the interface and the repository class in RepositoryServiceProvider class\n\nTo your terminal and execute this command to create the class,\\\n\n\n    php artisan make:provider RepositoryServiceProvider\n\n\n\nThen inside that class, inside `register()` method is here me bind the `EloquentRepositoryInterface.php` and the actual repository, in this case it it the `BaseRepository.php` that we created.\\\nMake sure to import these files into the `RepositoryServiceProvider` class.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--\\_1bPJ5NR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jsqocemz0ifwjzk7hd5v.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--\\_1bPJ5NR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jsqocemz0ifwjzk7hd5v.png)\n\nAnd now to make these changes available in our entire application, we register the `RepositoryServiceProvider` class inside the `AppServiceProvider`\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wVHxwrYk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pxjnxj7cgph4q7q8c7zj.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wVHxwrYk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pxjnxj7cgph4q7q8c7zj.png)\n\nThen execute this composer command in your terminal to read the bindings,\\\n\n\n    composer dump-autoload\n\n\n\nIf it doesn't work you must delete the cache manually if you are having problems. These files should be deleted specifically as they will get auto-generated by Laravel whenever we run a caching command. And normally these files are being ignored by git.\\\n\n\n    - app\n      - bootstrap\n        - cache (Delete these files below)\n          - config.php\n          - packages.php\n          - services.php\n\n\n\n## [](#adding-a-userrepository)Adding a UserRepository\n\nNow that we have a our BaseRepository defined, when we create another module or feature it should give us a boost in development time since we eliminated it by applying abstraction using the Repository Pattern.\n\nNow just create another interface and a repository class.\\\nIn your terminal execute these commands to create the files,\\\n\n\n    touch app/Repository/UserRepositoryInterface.php\n    touch app/Repository/Eloquent/UserRepository.php\n\n\n\nNow inside `UserRepositoryInterface` we only have to define the interface and extend on to the `EloquentRepositoryInterface`\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---nAeUd5M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oj5qh1e4zxfu0hege3b7.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---nAeUd5M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oj5qh1e4zxfu0hege3b7.png)\n\nAnd then inside the `UserRepository` class, we still implement the `UserRepositoryInterface` that we just created and extend `BaseRepository` class, by doing this we are applying Inheritance, we inherit all the methods that we just defined from our `BaseRepository` class and we will be able to access to the fields inside `BaseRepository` class so we do not have to rewrite everything. One thing we only want to override is the first parameter in our constructor, from the base repository it is the Model class, but since it is a user repository then we should replace it with the User model.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PDz4szmY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/huplf6ced8vhe3dq3ii9.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PDz4szmY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/huplf6ced8vhe3dq3ii9.png)\n\nAnd now inside our user repository also contains the methods that we implemented inside the base repository.\n\nAnd now bind the UserRepositoryInterface with the UserRepository inside the RepositoryServiceProvider class so our application will recognize this new repository that we created in the entire application.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---jonewb\\_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tgnfg25epej6u2ucwo5t.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---jonewb\\_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tgnfg25epej6u2ucwo5t.png)\n\nThen execute the command again,\\\n\n\n    composer dump-autoload\n\n\n\nI typically execute this command every time I add a new repository, if I don't then Laravel does not know or recognize about this new repository that we just created.\n\n## [](#creating-a-usercontroller-and-applying-dependency-injection-to-use-userrepository)Creating a UserController and applying Dependency Injection to use UserRepository\n\nIn your terminal execute this command,\\\n\n\n    php artisan make:controller UserController\n\n\n\nand define a route inside `routes/api.php`,\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--APCJGpsn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v9hlbz4592q874mivdww.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--APCJGpsn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v9hlbz4592q874mivdww.png)\n\nAnd now inside our `UserController` let us define method index() but before that in our constructor we want to inject the `UserRepository` into the `Contoller` so that we will have all the methods available at our disposal. In this case the index() method in the Controller is commonly known to return a list of resources, so let's make that as is.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CSp7rtpQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sy03wq4avouxcm0myo3q.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CSp7rtpQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sy03wq4avouxcm0myo3q.png)\n\nThe Repository Pattern also allows us to write less code inside our Controllers and that makes it even better rather having a giant code in the Controller which isn't what we want if we are aiming for better maintainability and readability. Let's keep it that way, clean controllers.\n\nIn case you don't agree with me because I am only showing a simple example and it's for retrieving all users only, then for creating a new user and sometimes we have to put some logic into it, maybe some if-else statements, that actually is considered a code smell and we don't want to do that. And also what about if you have to use the same logic in a different Controller, without creating a repository you will have to copy and paste these code. So when we are using the Repository Pattern we just inject it to the class that we need it for without having to rewrite logic.\n\nSo let us test that the route that we created by accessing this link in your browser `http://localhost:8000/api/users`\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RnYvSA7n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pm2qs33ntzcd1xbcszgs.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RnYvSA7n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pm2qs33ntzcd1xbcszgs.png)\n\nWe should see an empty set. That means everything we did worked and it makes sense because we haven't created any users yet.\n\nSo let us create users using the factory, open to your terminal and go to tinker CLI,\\\n\n\n    php artisan tinker\n\n\n\nThen execute this command to create 10 users\\\n\n\n    User::factory(10)->create()\n\n\n\nThen go back to your browser and hit refresh and you should see 10 users being returned from the API.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Bl11xlfJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6nljem0ne2a5l7rql35q.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Bl11xlfJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6nljem0ne2a5l7rql35q.png)\n\nAnd there we have it!\n\n## [](#conclusion)Conclusion\n\nIn leveraging on this design pattern we took some time to set it up in exchange for better readability and maintainability of our codebase. By doing abstraction and encapsulation we eliminate code duplications as we created a `BaseRepository` that shares all the common methods in every new repository that uses Eloquent ORM.\n\nSo for any small changes that we will make in the future, we don't have to bother updating every single file because we extended the common methods and by apply a single change saves us ample time and reduces cognitive load and that makes us happy.\n\nOn the other hand, this will make our code testable and we can easily scale it. But this isn't a silver bullet unfortunately, we might have sacrificed a little bit of performance as having these repositories are at the center between our data provider and our Controllers or any class that we might need to get data from.\n\nIf you aren't using Repository Pattern yet, make sure to try it out yourself. Thank you for taking the time to read and I hope this helps you out in getting started with Repository Pattern in Laravel.\n\nFull source code: <https://github.com/carlomigueldy/laravel-repository-pattern>\n", "timestamp": 1636676736, "digest": "gRbj2R30fKHH_9VE3BItOxu63AJnatOlR9BQRgCt77g", "contributor": "0x3E8c686F499C877D8f4aFB1215b6f0935796b986"}

The app that we will be building for this tutorial is just a basic Todo app, since the scope of this tutorial is to teach you how you will be able to use AWS Amplify with Nuxt.\n\nI prefer to use TypeScript in this article, but you can still use just plain JavaScript whichever you prefer still results to same Todo app we will be building. But before we continue, let us understand what is Serverless? What does it actually mean?\n\nServerless does not mean there are no servers. There are still servers that run on the cloud but we don't manage them, meaning we don't have to deal with deploying web servers using Nginx or Apache2, we don't have to provision AWS EC2 instances or GCP Compute Engine instances, we only have to worry about directly to the business logic of the application. Isn't that cool?\n\nFor more explanation I will quote a definition from Cloudflare:\n\n> Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. A serverless provider allows users to write and deploy code without the hassle of worrying about the underlying infrastructure. A company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on their computation and do not have to reserve and pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers, as the service is auto-scaling. Note that despite the name serverless, physical servers are still used but developers do not need to be aware of them.\n\nTaken from [source](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/what-is-serverless/)\n\n## [](#setting-up-an-aws-account)Setting up an AWS Account\n\nYou can skip this step if you already have setup an AWS account. Otherwise go to this URL <https://aws.amazon.com/console/> and proceed to creating your AWS account! And click on the button that says \"Create a Free Account\". You will need a credit card to setup your AWS account otherwise you can't create one.\n\n[![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--irXu7BlR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616983401420/zmGuyQAGx.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--irXu7BlR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616983401420/zmGuyQAGx.png)\n\nI am not going to go over how to setup an AWS account in here since it is an out of scope for this tutorial. But I will give you some links for my recommendation.\n\n*   <https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/>\n*   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html>\n\nAlso make sure to create an IAM user since AWS best practices for security is to not use the root user, instead create an IAM user and give it admin privileges and this is the only account you will be using from now on. You will only use the root user to create an admin user for your AWS account.\n\n## [](#installing-aws-amplify-cli)Installing AWS Amplify CLI\n\nOnce you are done with setting up your AWS account, let us then proceed to installing the AWS Amplify CLI! We will be using NPM and install to globally on your system, don't forget to add `sudo` otherwise you will experience permissions error.\\\n\n\n    $ npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli\n\n\n\nwith `sudo`,\\\n\n\n    $ sudo npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli\n\n\n\nJust to make everything clear, just in case.\n\nOnce you are done installing aws-amplify globally on your machine, let's then proceed to setting up configuration details so you can integrate this with-in your AWS account as it will ask you to sign in to AWS Console.\n\nFurther steps should be continued from the [official docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli) as they provide you the complete steps in setting up your account.\n\n## [](#installing-nuxt)Installing Nuxt\n\nOpen up your terminal and navigate into your projects directory or any directory that you prefer to install the Nuxt app. For me I prefer it to be placed under \"tutorials\" directory since I am creating a tutorial on how to setup Nuxt with AWS Amplify.\\\n\n\n    $ cd ~/tutorials\n\n\n\nThen proceed to execute the command to start the installation process.\\\n\n\n    # Where <project_name> is the name of the Nuxt project\n    # In this case I will name it as \"nuxt-aws-amplify-todo-app\"\n\n    $ npx create-nuxt-app <project_name>\n\n\n\nIn selecting the installation options, for the programming language I select TypeScript since it is my preferred choice and my \"go-to\" language. Package manager would just be NPM. And the UI library I select \"Vuetify.js\" I prefer this one since it provides a lot of Material design components out of the box, but you can select any UI library whichever you prefer. For the Nuxt modules, these are optional and you can select anything. For now I will select neither of these modules. Just hit ENTER key to continue without selection.\n\n[![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--\\_bGo3moI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616984483595/KpY08JQA2.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--\\_bGo3moI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616984483595/KpY08JQA2.png)\n\nSame applies to Linting tools and Testing framework just nothing.\n\n[![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jvcHn7SE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616984726555/2zLTOkBgd.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jvcHn7SE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616984726555/2zLTOkBgd.png)\n\nWe will select rendering mode to be a Single Page Application, and deployment target would be Static since we do not need anything server side rendered. And for the development tools, if you select TypeScript you don't have to choose `jsconfig.json` otherwise you can. For the other options I will not select any of them for now.\n\n[![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2HSq2zc9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616984824157/-TztF6NpN.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2HSq2zc9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616984824157/-TztF6NpN.png)\n\nNow to sum it all up regarding our installation selection, this is what we have.\n\n[![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--edDL-bo7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616984859286/Wd\\_\\__YVM11.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--edDL-bo7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616984859286/Wd\\_\\__YVM11.png)\n\nProceed to opening the new generated Nuxt project in your IDE (Visual Studio Code), do it via\\\n\n\n    $ cd nuxt-aws-amplify-todo-app && code .\n\n\n\nThis will then open up Visual Studio Code.\n\n## [](#optional-installing-nuxt-dependencies)(Optional) Installing Nuxt Dependencies\n\nThese are optional but you can follow as well. I will be installing the following:\n\n*   `@nuxtjs/composition-api`: This module is not recommended for production but soon it will be once Nuxt 3 comes out. When you are using this package, there will be bugs so keep that in mind in case you might get stuck then you can create an issue from the repository on Github and that counts as your contribution to the package.\n\nNote: I will not cover how to setup this module but you can refer on the [official docs](https://composition-api.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/setup) instead.\n\n*   `@nuxtjs/google-fonts`: I want to use \"Sora\" font just because FeedHive was using this and I think it's a cool font.\n\nNote: I will not cover how to setup this module but you can refer on the [official docs](https://github.com/nuxt-community/google-fonts-module) instead.\n\nWe'll also want to customize some of the default SCSS variables for Vuetify.js on some components and to apply \"Sora\" font-family as the main font to be used globally.\n\nTo customize, head on over to `nuxt.config.js` and on to the `vuetify` property, just add `treeShake` property with value of `true`, make sure to have `treeShake` set to `true` otherwise overriding SCSS variables for Vuetify will not work.\n\nAlso to verify you can reference on the code below on how I setup my `nuxt.config.js` file for these changes.\\\n\n\n    export default {\n       // ... other properties\n       buildModules: [\n          // ... \n\n          '@nuxtjs/composition-api',\n          '@nuxtjs/google-fonts'\n       ],\n\n       vuetify: {\n          customVariables: [\"~/assets/variables.scss\"],\n          treeShake: true\n       },\n\n       googleFonts: {\n          families: {\n             Sora: true\n          }\n       }\n    }\n\n\n\nThen edit the `variables.scss` file and setup the following SCSS variables.\\\n\n\n    $body-font-family: \"Sora\", sans-serif;\n    $btn-letter-spacing: 0px !default;\n    $btn-text-transform: none;\n\n\n\nAnd that's all we have for customizing the look for our Todo application we can then proceed with integrating AWS Amplify into our project.\n\n## [](#integrating-aws-amplify-in-the-nuxt-project)Integrating AWS Amplify in the Nuxt project\n\nBefore we start, install the library so we'll have access to its core.\\\n\n\n    $ npm i aws-amplify\n\n\n\nNow let us setup our backend using AWS Amplify. Given that you already have opened your Nuxt project right after installation then proceed to opening a new terminal instance under your IDE (Visual Studio Code) or if you prefer it in a different window that's fine as well but be sure you are in the root directory of your project.\n\nThen execute this command to initialize or create a new AWS Amplify project.\\\n\n\n    $ amplify init\n\n\n\nWhen presented with the questions, I have selected the default settings and modified only the \"Source Directory Path\" to `.` and for the \"Build Command\" is set to `npm run build && npm run generate` since we are going for a Nuxt Static SPA, and lastly the \"Start Command\" which is `npm run start`. I believe these build and start commands will be used if you prefer to host it on AWS ecosystem (S3 Bucket)\n\n[![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fRgKtEiP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616986687789/XyZFGsvAu.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fRgKtEiP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616986687789/XyZFGsvAu.png)\n\nOnce the initialization process is done, it should look similar to this by now.\n\n[![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LxkRtygb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616986856661/1SYE6MNXX.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LxkRtygb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616986856661/1SYE6MNXX.png)\n\nNext and very important step, you must setup the `aws-exports.js` plugin. Create a file under `plugins` directory and name it as `aws-amplify.js` then copy the following code and paste on to it\\\n\n\n    import Amplify from \"aws-amplify\";\n    import aws_exports from \"~/aws-exports\";\n\n    Amplify.configure(aws_exports);\n\n\n\nThen go to `nuxt.config.js` and add the following into the `plugins` array\\\n\n\n    export default {\n       // ...\n\n       plugins: [\"~/plugins/aws-amplify\"]\n    }\n\n\n\nSince we are building a Todo app, then we will need a place to store our data. AWS Amplify can provide us a data store using DynamoDB. So let us continue setting up and add a backend API with the following command.\\\n\n\n    $ amplify add api\n\n\n\nYou can follow with my selection:\n\n[![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DrjjRQNg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616987267374/aO21QSkCIc.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DrjjRQNg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616987267374/aO21QSkCIc.png)\n\nAWS Amplify already have an existing example for a Todo App so we'll use that one.\n\nAnd once everything is set up correctly and is done, there are files generated for you with the GraphQL schema, resolvers, all those good stuff. So your project folder would look something like this by now.\n\n[![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6Zsz_lFv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616987374966/rXt3-qP04.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6Zsz_lFv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616987374966/rXt3-qP04.png)\n\nDon't worry about the other files the were generated, you don't have to bother with them those are just the configurations files so that AWS Amplify will understand which server instance we are talking to behind the scenes. At least that's how I understand it.\n\nWe can take a look at our GraphQL schema that was auto generated by AWS Amplify for us.\n\n[![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dZ21tJNW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616987398745/ciYR6KVsI.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dZ21tJNW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616987398745/ciYR6KVsI.png)\n\nThen let us proceed to deploying these into AWS. Let us execute the following command below so we can start making requests to the server via GraphQL.\\\n\n\n    $ amplify push\n\n\n\nYou will be then asked some questions to select from by the CLI.\n\n[![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s9latpk7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616988225520/BrcURL-ud.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s9latpk7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616988225520/BrcURL-ud.png)\n\nTo break it down for you, we tell CLI we want to auto generate GraphQL code, we select TypeScript as the output of the generated code, the filename pattern will reside in a `graphql` directory, we want AWS Amplify CLI to auto generate us all the possible operations/queries/resolvers that we might use for our Todo App, and the file name of the generated code will reside under `api` directory with file name as `index.ts`\n\nRight after the installation process you will then be presented the GraphQL endpoint and the GraphQL API KEY which I don't want to expose it in here.\n\nNow that it's all set up we can then proceed to building the UI of our app.\n\n## [](#user-interface)User Interface\n\nI am just going to make it simple but of course feel free to build the UI in any form you want. For the UI we will have a form and a list that will list out the todos. Before we start building out the UI, open a server for the Nuxt app. In your terminal execute the command.\\\n\n\n    npm run serve\n\n\n\nThat will then provide you a URL for the app, typically it is `http://localhost:3000` so open it up in your browser.\n\nOnce that is done, I made some modifications the following are:\n\n*   I have deleted two files under `components` directory those are `Logo.vue` and `VuetifyLogo.vue`\n*   I have deleted all the code for the app layout which can be found under `layouts` directory with file name of `default.vue`.\n\n<!---->\n\n    <template>\n        <v-app app>\n           <Nuxt />\n        </v-app>\n    </template>\n\n\n\n*   I have also deleted `inspire.vue` under `pages` directory.\n*   And removed all code for `index.vue` under `pages` directory and replaced it with the following:\n\n<!---->\n\n    <template>\n      <div></div>\n    </template>\n\n    <script lang=\"ts\">\n    import { defineComponent } from \"@vue/composition-api\";\n\n    export default defineComponent({\n      setup() {}\n    });\n    </script>\n\n\n\nIt will be a grid layout, on the left side will be the form and on the right side will be the list.\\\n\n\n    <template>\n      <div>\n        <v-row>\n          <v-col cols=\"12\" xs=\"12\" sm=\"12\" md=\"4\" lg=\"4\" xl=\"4\">\n            <v-form></v-form>\n          </v-col>\n          <v-col cols=\"12\" xs=\"12\" sm=\"12\" md=\"8\" lg=\"8\" xl=\"8\">\n            <v-list>\n              <v-list-item></v-list-item>\n            </v-list>\n          </v-col>\n        </v-row>\n      </div>\n    </template>\n\n\n\n## [](#creating-a-todo)Creating a Todo\n\nThen we proceed to writing out the code to create our first Todo! Take a look at the code under.\n\nHTML template,\\\n\n\n    <template>\n      <div>\n        <v-row>\n          <v-col cols=\"12\" xs=\"12\" sm=\"12\" md=\"6\" lg=\"6\" xl=\"6\">\n            <v-form ref=\"formRef\" @submit.prevent=\"submit\">\n              <v-text-field\n                label=\"Name\"\n                v-model=\"formData.name\"\n                :rules=\"requiredRule\"\n              ></v-text-field>\n              <v-textarea\n                label=\"Description\"\n                v-model=\"formData.description\"\n              ></v-textarea>\n              <v-btn color=\"primary\" class=\"my-5\" large depressed type=\"submit\">\n                Submit\n              </v-btn>\n            </v-form>\n          </v-col>\n          <v-col cols=\"12\" xs=\"12\" sm=\"12\" md=\"6\" lg=\"6\" xl=\"6\">\n            <v-list>\n              <v-list-item v-for=\"(item, index) in todos\" :key=\"index\">\n                <v-list-item-content>\n                  <v-list-item-title>{{ index }}</v-list-item-title>\n                  <v-list-item-subtitle>Description</v-list-item-subtitle>\n                </v-list-item-content>\n                <v-list-item-action>\n                  <v-btn color=\"transparent\" depressed fab>\n                    <v-icon>mdi-delete-outline</v-icon>\n                  </v-btn>\n                </v-list-item-action>\n              </v-list-item>\n            </v-list>\n          </v-col>\n        </v-row>\n      </div>\n    </template>\n\n\n\nTypeScript code,\\\n\n\n    import { defineComponent, computed, ref } from \"@vue/composition-api\";\n    import { createTodo } from \"~/graphql/mutations\";\n    import { API } from \"aws-amplify\";\n\n    type Todo = {\n      name: string;\n      description?: string;\n    };\n\n    const createTodoDtoDefaults: Todo = Object.freeze({\n      name: \"\",\n      description: \"\"\n    });\n\n    export default defineComponent({\n      setup() {\n        const formData = ref<Todo>({\n          ...createTodoDtoDefaults\n        });\n        const todos = ref<Todo[]>([]);\n\n        const formRef = ref();\n\n        const requiredRule = computed(() => [\n          (v: string) => !!v || \"This field is required\"\n        ]);\n\n        async function submit() {\n          if (formRef.value.validate()) {\n            await API.graphql({\n              query: createTodo,\n              variables: {\n                input: formData.value\n              }\n            });\n\n            // reset the `formData` values\n            formData.value = {\n              ...createTodoDtoDefaults\n            };\n          }\n        }\n\n        return {\n          todos,\n          formData,\n          formRef,\n          submit,\n          requiredRule\n        };\n      }\n    });\n\n\n\nBy now we already have our form setup and it is using validation from one of the built-in feature of Vuetify's VForm component which is pretty convenient. A user can write a Todo now by typing in to the form, but whenever a user clicks the Submit button when the title field is empty, then it should not continue and therefore the app will not dispatch a call to the GraphQL API to create a new todo. Otherwise the Todo will be created!\n\nCurrently this is how the app looks from my end,\n\n[![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--70GI9IMx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616991313890/EZKvTsNr7.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--70GI9IMx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616991313890/EZKvTsNr7.png)\n\n## [](#fetching-all-todo)Fetching all Todo\n\nWhen you tried to create a Todo by now, and sure there wasn't any data returned yet. So let us proceed to fetching all Todos from the API.\\\n\n\n    export default defineComponent({\n      setup() {\n        // ...\n\n        const todos = ref<Todo[]>([]);\n\n        // ...\n\n        async function fetchAllTodo() {\n          const response = await API.graphql({\n            query: listTodos\n          });\n          // @ts-ignore\n          todos.value = response.data.listTodos.items as Todo[];\n        }\n\n        async function submit() {\n          if (formRef.value.validate()) {\n            await API.graphql({\n              query: createTodo,\n              variables: {\n                input: formData.value\n              }\n            });\n\n            // reset the `formData` values\n            formData.value = {\n              ...createTodoDtoDefaults\n            };\n            fetchAllTodo();\n          }\n        }\n\n        onMounted(() => {\n          fetchAllTodo();\n        });\n\n        // ...\n      }\n    });\n\n\n\nSo we defined `fetchAllTodo()` method that handles to fetch all Todos from the API by making a request to GraphQL using the query that was auto-generated for us! We will call this method in two places, under `submit()` method is when user's form input is valid and a Todo will be created then we should re-fetch the data to show the created Todo on the list. And the other place is from the `onMounted` life cycle, we are using composition functions so we call it from `onMounted(() => {})` as that will handle calling to the API for fetching the Todos that are stored every time a User opens the app the first time.\n\nSo for the last time, this is the entire code for this Todo App.\\\n\n\n    <template>\n      <div>\n        <v-row>\n          <v-col cols=\"12\" xs=\"12\" sm=\"12\" md=\"6\" lg=\"6\" xl=\"6\">\n            <v-form ref=\"formRef\" @submit.prevent=\"submit\">\n              <v-text-field\n                label=\"Name\"\n                v-model=\"formData.name\"\n                :rules=\"requiredRule\"\n              ></v-text-field>\n              <v-textarea\n                label=\"Description\"\n                v-model=\"formData.description\"\n              ></v-textarea>\n              <v-btn color=\"primary\" class=\"my-5\" large depressed type=\"submit\">\n                Submit\n              </v-btn>\n            </v-form>\n          </v-col>\n          <v-col cols=\"12\" xs=\"12\" sm=\"12\" md=\"6\" lg=\"6\" xl=\"6\">\n            <v-list>\n              <v-list-item v-for=\"(item, index) in todos\" :key=\"index\">\n                <v-list-item-content>\n                  <v-list-item-title>{{ item.name }}</v-list-item-title>\n                  <v-list-item-subtitle>\n                    {{ item.description }}\n                  </v-list-item-subtitle>\n                </v-list-item-content>\n              </v-list-item>\n            </v-list>\n          </v-col>\n        </v-row>\n      </div>\n    </template>\n\n    <script lang=\"ts\">\n    import {\n      defineComponent,\n      computed,\n      ref,\n      onMounted\n    } from \"@vue/composition-api\";\n    import { createTodo } from \"~/graphql/mutations\";\n    import { API } from \"aws-amplify\";\n    import { listTodos } from \"~/graphql/queries\";\n\n    type Todo = {\n      name: string;\n      description?: string;\n    };\n\n    const createTodoDtoDefaults: Todo = Object.freeze({\n      name: \"\",\n      description: \"\"\n    });\n\n    export default defineComponent({\n      setup() {\n        const formData = ref<Todo>({\n          ...createTodoDtoDefaults\n        });\n        const todos = ref<Todo[]>([]);\n\n        const formRef = ref();\n\n        const requiredRule = computed(() => [\n          (v: string) => !!v || \"This field is required\"\n        ]);\n\n        async function fetchAllTodo() {\n          const response = await API.graphql({\n            query: listTodos\n          });\n          // @ts-ignore\n          todos.value = response.data.listTodos.items as Todo[];\n        }\n\n        async function submit() {\n          if (formRef.value.validate()) {\n            await API.graphql({\n              query: createTodo,\n              variables: {\n                input: formData.value\n              }\n            });\n\n            // reset the `formData` values\n            formData.value = {\n              ...createTodoDtoDefaults\n            };\n            fetchAllTodo();\n          }\n        }\n\n        onMounted(() => {\n          fetchAllTodo();\n        });\n\n        return {\n          todos,\n          formData,\n          formRef,\n          submit,\n          requiredRule\n        };\n      }\n    });\n    </script>\n\n\n\n## [](#conclusion)Conclusion\n\nSo we learned how to setup AWS Amplify for our Nuxt app with Composition API and TypeScript. If you have been planning to use AWS Amplify with Nuxt, then I hope this tutorial was helpful for you. However I might have only covered fetching and creating a Todo but as you see it the article has been very long, so I chose not to include those functionalities but you can explore more about AWS Amplify from the official documentation.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and if you liked this be sure to like the post as well and if ever you want any future Nuxt tutorials like this let me know!\n\nFull source code can be found from the [repository](https://github.com/carlomigueldy/nuxt-aws-amplify-todo-app) for your reference\n", "timestamp": 1636676715, "digest": "mTrNg7_mmWGbeZiALASCPONe9XuavZdaoyx34P2jSbQ", "contributor": "0x3E8c686F499C877D8f4aFB1215b6f0935796b986"}
{"id": "VvWo2UtQKql2KCRBtkpdtRNfuqM9BzCQY0zfP3p68z8", "title": "Getting started with Vue 3 + Pinia Store + TypeScript by building a Grocery List App", "body": "## [](#introduction)Introduction\n\nLet's build a grocery list application using Vue 3 with Typescript and the Vue store Pinia! I just found out that [Edward](https://twitter.com/posva) have tweeted about publishing the documentation for Pinia so I thought I'd share how we can create a simple application using this store.\n\nI will only be covering the very basic implementation of the Pinia store.\n\n## [](#prerequisites)Pre-Requisites\n\nThis article assumes the basic knowledge and understanding or familiarity with:\n\n*   Vue 3 (Composition API)\n*   TypeScript\n*   Prior understanding of what State Management is\n\nI will be using TypeScript for this application so I hope you understand at least the basic type annotations. Otherwise let's get right at it and start building this app!\n\n## [](#installation)Installation\n\nIf you don't have the Vue CLI installed yet then make sure to install it, or if your Vue CLI isn't updated yet then make sure it is on the latest version.\\\n\n\n    $ npm i -g @vue/cli\n\n\n\nIf you are on a Linux distro then add `sudo` at the beginning of the command since we are installing Vue CLI globally.\n\nAnd once that is done let's ask Vue CLI to scaffold a Vue 3 project for us. Make sure you have selected Vue 3.\\\n\n\n    $ vue create vue-3-pinia-grocery-app\n\n\n\nAnd once that is done navigate into the app and open the project in your IDE.\\\n\n\n    $ cd vue-3-pinia-grocery-app && code .\n\n\n\nThen let us add our sugar, TypeScript.\\\n\n\n    $ vue add typescript\n\n\n\nFor now these are my selected options, you can choose on your own if you prefer.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N\\_3yevrn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d130vmi6u96bn1l0xy4z.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N\\_3yevrn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d130vmi6u96bn1l0xy4z.png)\n\nNext is to install Pinia as the dependency for this project.\\\n\n\n    $ npm install pinia@next\n\n\n\nAnd lastly install faker since I am kind of lazy to create forms for this tutorial and creating a form and validating it is sort of an out of scope. So to make things quick, let's just generate some random data from this faker package.\\\n\n\n    $ npm install faker\n    $ npm install --save @types/faker\n\n    $ npm install uuid\n    $ npm install --save-dev @types/uuid\n\n\n\nSince I plan to use some fake data for quick data generation. Update your model code as I will have a method called `generateFakeData()` to generate an Item.\\\n\n\n    import { v4 as uuidv4 } from \"uuid\";\n    import * as faker from \"faker\";\n\n    export interface Item {\n      id: string;\n      name: string;\n      description?: string;\n      quantity: number;\n      createdAt: Date;\n      deletedAt?: Date;\n    }\n\n    export function generateFakeData(): Item {\n      return {\n        id: uuidv4(),\n        quantity: Math.random(),\n        name: faker.lorem.word(),\n        description: faker.lorem.words(),\n        createdAt: new Date(),\n      };\n    }\n\n\n\nAnd once that is done let us run our Vue application.\\\n\n\n    $ npm run serve\n\n\n\n## [](#data-model)Data Model\n\nSince we are building a Grocery List application then we should model our data. The core model to have is an Item.\n\nSo to define the model,\\\n\n\n    export interface Item {\n      id: string;\n      name: string;\n      description?: string;\n      quantity: number;\n      createdAt: Date;\n      deletedAt?: Date;\n    }\n\n\n\nSo under the `src` directory create a `models` directory and it's where this Item model will reside. So create a file name it as `item.model.ts`.\n\nThen we'll have the following,\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Xt3IgqtK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mykn0xuhq8nbqohahdnu.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Xt3IgqtK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mykn0xuhq8nbqohahdnu.png)\n\n## [](#pinia-setup)Pinia Setup\n\nOpen the `main.ts` file under the `src` directory and make sure to chain the following method `use()` and pass in `createPinia()` as the first parameter.\\\n\n\n    import { createPinia } from \"pinia\";\n    import { createApp } from \"vue\";\n    import App from \"./App.vue\";\n\n    createApp(App)\n      .use(createPinia())\n      .mount(\"#app\");\n\n\n\nNext is to create a directory and name it as `store` and inside it create a file called `index.ts`\n\nThen to define this main store,\\\n\n\n    import { generateFakeData, Item } from \"@/models/item.model\";\n    import { defineStore } from \"pinia\";\n\n    export type RootState = {\n      items: Item[];\n    };\n\n    export const useMainStore = defineStore({\n      id: \"mainStore\",\n      state: () =>\n        ({\n          items: [],\n        } as RootState),\n\n      actions: {\n        createNewItem(item: Item) {\n          if (!item) return;\n\n          this.items.push(item);\n        },\n\n        updateItem(id: string, payload: Item) {\n          if (!id || !payload) return;\n\n          const index = this.findIndexById(id);\n\n          if (index !== -1) {\n            this.items[index] = generateFakeData();\n          }\n        },\n\n        deleteItem(id: string) {\n          const index = this.findIndexById(id);\n\n          if (index === -1) return;\n\n          this.items.splice(index, 1);\n        },\n\n        findIndexById(id: string) {\n          return this.items.findIndex((item) => item.id === id);\n        },\n      },\n    });\n\n\n\nWe have defined the most basic functionality, creating, updating an deleting an item from our grocery list. And that is more done enough for getting to know how to setup Pinia as your Vue store.\n\n## [](#demo)Demo\n\nThis is the best looking UI... Yeah.\n\n[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---vJd1xkg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bfaxskf0s0ph40wc9n5m.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---vJd1xkg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw\\_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bfaxskf0s0ph40wc9n5m.png)\n\n[Demo](https://youtu.be/CIjFs7Ax6Mg)\n\nAs you can see from this setup we are able to use the Pinia store, that we are able to add an Item, update it and delete it.\n\n## [](#summary)Summary\n\nWe learned how to setup Pinia with Vue 3 and TypeScript. What I like Pinia is that it is built with TypeScript already that means the store provides us all the auto-completion that we want and the reason we love about TypeScript. Pinia is also very intuitive which we notice it was very similar to how Vuex is implemented.\n\nBut there are more of its features that you can read about from the [official documentation](https://pinia.esm.dev/)\n\nI hope you find this useful, cheers!\n\nFull source code can be found from the [repository](https://github.com/carlomigueldy/vue-3-pinia-grocery-app)\n", "timestamp": 1636676699, "digest": "C1vjz8F1HFfE-tdbJqFl0kZ-4uKMmGMBPcv3IQYX9kk", "contributor": "0x3E8c686F499C877D8f4aFB1215b6f0935796b986"}

为首的区块链游戏，将继续成为全球 NFT 交易量的重要推动力。\n\n游戏打金公会则开始通过提供奖学金等产生收益的策略组合，在多个虚拟经济体中推动经济活动。\n\nYield Guild 作为链游打金运动的先驱，已经抢在所有竞争对手之前实现了「逃逸速度」，因此他们现正在积极投资其他打金公会以及游戏内资产 (NFT) ，以及其他代币（例如治理代币）。尽管 YGG 声名更为显赫，但实际上另外一家游戏公会 BlackPool 持有的 NFT 资产（尽管其 AUM 相比下要小得多）还要略高于 Yield Guild （1780 万美元对 1760 万美元）。两家公会都非常重视 Axie Infinity 生态系统，但 BlackPool 手中权重最高的项目是 Sorare——它几乎 70% 的收入来自这款游戏。作为参考，Yield Guild 仍然 100% 的收入来自 Axie。\n\n随着投资者对这些令人兴奋的虚拟新经济体的兴趣不断增长，Yield Guild 等项目的资金深度、广度和积极管理性质实际上成了该领域的强大指数。随着区块链游戏领域的强劲发展势头，新兴公会结构的前景一片光明。\n\nAxie Infinity 作为链游边玩边赚（Play-to-Earn，P2E） 概念的实践先驱，在今年第三季度迅速崛起。就所产生的营收而言，它现在在加密领域中仅次于以太坊。它引起外界对链游这一行业的极大关注，并已成为链游市场整体健康状况的有力指标。其经济和用户群的惊人增长，使得许多人将其与 Candy Crush 等游戏随着移动端的 F2P 模式而出现的曲棍球杆增长相提并论。 Axie 正在积极将数百万链游玩家带进区块链领域，验证了游戏很可能成为全球采用区块链的特洛伊木马这一论点。要更深入地了解 Axie 的崛起，请查看我们对 Axie Infinity 的报告系列，其中解释了这个迷人的虚拟经济背后的一些核心机制。\n\n我们同时看到，在这些经济体中出现了采用多种收益策略的很多打金公会出现，以谋求在链游这一新领域赚得盆满钵满。一般来说，公会活动体现在提供奖学金、投资核心游戏资产（要部署的 NFT + 游戏代币本身），甚至将资源分配给新的公会，正如 Yield Guild Games (YGG) 所率先落实的那样。.\n\nYield Guild 创立了 P2E 链游 DAO 的概念，同时受益于他们的先发优势。在由 Delphi、BITKRAFT 和 a16z 领投的连续多轮投资中，很早就得到了实力雄厚投资机构的支持，已经成为这个新兴行业的强大指数，我们将在下文中具体探讨。 Yield Guild 不仅成功地成为 Axie Infinity 链游中最大的奖学金提供者，而且其投资部门还从许多领先区块链游戏买进了大量资产，并为有希望推出的新项目进行了种子投资。作为最知名的 P2E DAO， Yield Guild 能够获得优惠的投资条款，并作为新兴链游早期玩家的流动性来源。\n\n自成立以来，Yield Guild 一直打算运营覆盖众多游戏或区域的各种 subDAO，以适应快速增长，并为其用户提供参与的细腻粒度，而不仅限于一个覆盖更广泛的公会。如上图所示，您可以将 YGG 视为一个多细胞有机体，其子单元负责维持整体。下图进一步说明了 subDAO 的概念。\n\nYield Guild 早于其他项目实现了逃逸速度，能够为新的第三方公会提供早期财务和运营支持，在其不断发展的生态系统中创造强大的协同效应。 BlackPool 是另一个开始探索与 Yield Guild 类似协同效应的公会（创始人 Julien Bouteloup 是 YGG 顾问）。 该公会成立于 2020 年 9 月，自称拥有更丰富的量化手段。它在战略、游戏重点和整体收入构成方面与 YGG 不同。 我们在下表中对两个公会的高级数据予以了展示。\n\nAxie Infinity 和 Sorare 两个链游合计占到 Yield Guild Games 和 BlackPool 所拥有的大部分资产 ，如下图所示。 当考虑到公会产生的大部分 P2E 收入来自这两个游戏中，这一构成图是有道理的，我们将在本报告的后面部分进行探讨。随着时间推移，随着越来越多的经济体通过强大的 P2E 经济而上线，我们预计这一市场会进一步呈现多元化。\n\n我们已经在这两个公会之间看到了其游戏和资产重点的分歧。随着时间推移，随着虚拟经济的可投资和「可耕种」领域不断扩大，我们很可能会看到不同公会专注深耕某些游戏生态系统和地理区域。这正契合了我们在 Yield Guild 身上看到的「Guild of Guilds」（公会的公会）战略，他们正是通过这一战略在全球范围内广泛吸纳不同链游社区的资产。\n\n上图显示了 Yield Guild 所管理的总资产，包括 NFT 和 ERC-20 代币。 如您所见，从 6 月到 7 月，其总资产管理规模大幅增加。 该公会 7 月 27 日所推出的 YGG 治理代币是个很好的解释。 YGG 代币发布后，133,333,334 个 YGG 代币被添加到 Yield Guild Games 的金库中，用于未来筹款和 DAO 的长期管理。 YGG 价格在 9 月底遇到小幅下滑，是更广泛的市场抛售影响整体治理代币的大趋势结果——YGG 总代币供应的 13.3% 目前由该公会金库持有。\n\n上面表格突出显示了 Yield Guild Games 在 2021 年在 P2E 系统中所做的投资。他们最近对 Merit Circle 的 17.5 万美元投资，证明了他们对入局的其他公会的合作态度。加密游戏生态系统正在快速发展，因此支持小型项目起步是很有意义的。通过对有前景的新项目进行早期投资，Yield Guild Games 正在巩固自己作为这个新兴领域最大指数的地位，同时最大限度地提高这些早期项目的成功前景。\n\n如上所示，自 2020 年 11 月以来，Yield Guild Games 的 Discord 成员数目显著增加，但真正的增长开始于 2021 年 7 月 YGG 代币推出之时，成为代币成为社区团结起来力量的另一个明显实例。从 6 月到 2021 年 10 月，Yield Guild Games 的 Discord 会员数量从 19,546 人增加到超过 62,545 人，增长了 220%。\n\n今年早些时候，Axie Infinity 由于存在滥用情况而限制了游戏中的某些行为，这影响了奖学金游戏玩家的成长，如上图所示。尽管存在这个暂时的瓶颈，但预计在不久的将来会实施面向所有人的解决方案。我们预计这将会刺激在 Axie 经济中运作的很多打金公会和奖学金项目的活跃程度。\n\nYield Guild 奖学金玩家、Discord 成员和社区成员的绝对数量增长，更巩固了该公会作为玩家流动性来源的重要地位。 因此，Yield Guild 已成为链游领域新项目一种非常有用的资源，而不仅仅会带来纯粹的财务和运营支持。\n\n自 2021 年初以来，BlackPool 的奖学金玩家社区迅速壮大，如上图所示。从 1 月 1 日的 21 名奖学金玩家到 10 月 3 日的 482 名，增长了 2195%。 继 BlackPool 在 Sorare 抢占主导地位之后，很高兴看到他们的第二个强劲收入来源中取得有利进展。\n\n*公会收入。来源 ：Axie Infinity & Sorare*\n\n上图说明了两个公会每周和累积的小爱情药水（SLP）收入。从 Axie Infinity 所获得的 SLP，目前分别占 Yield Guild Games 和 BlackPool Finance 总收入的 100% 和 30.5%。 而随着新的加密游戏经济体的成熟，我们预计其收入来源未来同样会出现多元化趋势。 一个明显的趋势是：SLP 价格对公会盈利能力的主要影响，我们将在下文探讨。\n\n上图显示 SLP 价格自 7 月下旬以来呈下降趋势。 这与 SLP 净供应量变化在同一时间段内的增长保持了一致。由此我们可以得出，玩家（赢得比赛）所铸造的 SLP 供过于求，而销毁的 SLP(繁殖 Axies) 匹配不足。\n\n如上图所示，来自 Ronin 区块链的 SLP 净负流量似乎与 SLP 的价格下跌趋势保持了一致。相反，流向 Ronin 的 SLP 净正流量此前已推动了 SLP 的价格上涨。尽管我们需要更多数据来确定这种关系的关联强度，但确实值得深思。最近流向 Ronin 的 SLP 净正流量可能暗示，SLP 价格在不久的将来可能出现趋势逆转，进一步增强了游戏中奖学金计划的吸引力。如果 SLP 价格和 SLP Ronin 网桥净流量之间的动态关系经验证成立，对于那些严重依赖 Axie 创收的人来说，它将被证明是判断 SLP 价格走向以及公会收入的强大先行指标。\n\nSorare 的 P2E 系统与 Axie Infinity 不同，因为 Sorare 中没有类似 AXS 或 SLP 的原生代币。相反，玩家会获得 Sorare NFT （玩家卡本身）。 玩家所获得的 NFT，具体取决于他们在排名中的位置和锦标赛类型。此外，玩家可以根据表现赚取 ETH。\n\n上图显示了 BlackPool 所管理的 Sorare 资产随着时间的变化，其中资产管理规模（AUM）一直在稳步增长。 值得考虑的事情是，Sorare 是一项梦幻足球游戏，意味着每个月具有不同的赛季区别，有时有各支国家队所参加的比赛（没有联赛比赛），而夏天很少有比赛。\n\n最近，我们看到 Sorare 增加了新的动态奖励，登上领奖台的位置可以获得更多 ETH 奖励。几个月前，我们还看到了一个其新推出了一个新的 Unique 分支。其中只允许使用 Unique 卡，获胜者将获得该分区的所有奖励，最高可达 4 ETH。 因此随着时间推移，我们可能预计玩家在 Sorare 中的收入将逐渐由 ETH 而非 Sorare NFT 构成。\n\n如上图所示，自 7 月 27 日在 Sushiswap 的 MISO 平台上市以来，YGG 代币的市场表现优于 BPT。 YGG 背后强大的机构支持，似乎为该代币提供了广泛的支持基础。 Yield Guild Games 在媒体上的曝光率明显更高，且作为该领域率先上市的公会，显然具有强大的品牌吸引力。 值得注意的是，BPT 尚未全额上市，而是对早期社区进行了空投，之后它开始在 SushiSwap 上交易（最初价格为 1.50 美元）。 BPT 代币更大规模的销售可能会在未来的某个时候发生。\n\n### 总结\n\n加密游戏在 2021 年呈现爆炸式增长，Axie Infinity 引发的兴趣特别大，出乎所有人的意料。随着世界慢慢开始关注这种迷人的虚拟经济新范式，投资者正在积极寻求新的途径，多元化地参与该行业。链游的迅猛发展速度，意味着新项目想要后来居上或者追赶领先者的难度很高，因此被动指数对许多人来说是一个有吸引力的参照物。在这些作为链游代理的打金公会中，这些新兴的「P2E」经济体的前沿仍然存在相当激烈的竞争（和被动性）。\n\n例如，更多传统的私募市场投资者无法或不一定想要直接获得代币敞口，但可能会选择投资于（跨平台应用发行商） Animoca Brands 之类的项目。仅在今年，[该公司就凭借其对 Axie Infinity、Immutable 和 Dapper Labs NFT 等链游和基础设施的投资组合](https://www.animocabrands.com/investment-portfolio)，以 20 亿美元估值募集了 2.03 亿美元投资。值得注意的是，我们也开始看到传统公开市场产品提供向元宇宙相关公司的投资组合，例如 Matthew Ball 由 Roundhill （AUM 为 1.23 亿美元）提供支持的 [$META ETF](https://www.ballmetaverse.co/why-a-metaverse)。如果进一步向直接持有代币敞口迈进，我们会看到市场上存在 IndexCoop 的「[元宇宙指数](https://www.indexcoop.com/mvi)」（市值 2362 万美元）或 PieDAO 的「[$PLAY 指数](https://www.piedao.org/#/pie/0x33e18a092a93ff21ad04746c7da12e35d34dc7c4)」（市值 250 万美元）。虽然这两种都是间接持有流动代币的敞口工具，但与 Yield Guild （8.75 亿美元的资产管理规模）这类项目的深度、广度和积极管理的性质相比，它们显得弱不经风。\n\n我们 Delphi 投资 Yield Guild 的部分理论在于， Yield Guild 不仅投资更多早期阶段的链游项目，而且其游戏金库机制实际上可以为元经济中的投资者提供资产代理。您是否更看好一款游戏或地区，胜过另一个游戏？ 您可以专门投资其中某一个 subDAO （或微指数）。如果您更看好在整体公会特定的收益策略，您可以在 YGG 机枪池中提供流动性，以获得该特定活动的奖励。对于那些不想过于密切接触的人来说，还有一个机枪池可以从 YGG 的所有策略中获得代币奖，相当于一个超级指数。\n\n除了提供比其他指数颗粒度更高的参与度外， Yield Guild 还能够通过未来令牌简单协议（SAFT）框架、公开销售和其他类型产生收入的游戏内资产，在最早阶段参与最具吸引力的（通常是场外）交易。 许多有前途的新游戏项目都涌向 Yield Guild 寻求支持，因为 Yield Guild 提供了资本、玩家流动性和运营支持的独特组合。由于 Yield Guild 身处 P2E 链游风暴眼的中心，能够投资于自己的 subDAO 以及可能正在运行独特策略的第三方公会——这是一种在其他地方还无法提供的产品。不可否认，对于许多人来说这是一个非常引人注目的价值主张，而他们的社区、管理的资产和市值的快速增长都证明了这一点。\n\n鉴于链游行业的强劲发展势头，执行差异化战略的新兴公会无疑拥有广阔的前景。随着越来越多的公会出现，满足对参与新虚拟经济的结构化机会不断增长的需求，我们很可能会看到这种模式的持续进化演变。随着链游市场的蛋糕快速增大，目前公会之间存在合作的空间——和谐多于矛盾。 不过，在未来十年，随着世界上最大的游戏和公会经济开始成熟，我们很可能会横跨数百个虚拟世界的游戏市场中看到：数以百万人分属众多派系而上演史诗般的争斗。 元宇宙的拓荒者已经到来。\n\n免责声明：作为区块链信息平台，本站所发布文章仅代表作者个人观点，与链闻 ChainNews 立场无关。文章内的信息、意见等均仅供参考，并非作为或被视为实际投资建议。", "timestamp": 1636679434,

This population is underrepresented and underserved, not just in the US though, but around the world. Many populations worldwide struggle to find proper banking and consequently are denied access to advanced financial features that wealthier people have at their disposal. The unbanked are unable to generate wealth because they are unable to put their money back to work for them and they can’t do that because they are blocked from the simplest financial entry point: The banking system. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, aims to change that and is the only viable solution to this problem that has a working proof of concept already operational worldwide.\n\nThe concept of DeFi is simple. While in a traditional banking system, the bank is the ledger holder that manages all transactions, processes payments, writes out IOUs, etc, in DeFi everyone becomes their own bank and has access to that ledgering system (the blockchain, or rather, a blockchain in this case). Since everyone has access to this technology, everyone now has access to financial services that would normally be denied them. Things like the ability to earn higher interest rates, leverage money for larger investments, flash loans at better rates — all becomes available. DeFi enables an unbanked population to come online and inject liquidity into worldwide markets. As cryptocurrencies become worldwide defacto tender this will enable new wealth generation at scale and allow a new class of people to become impactful owners that are able to create their own value for their communities.\n\nThe future of decentralized finance is one of optimism and hope, a future where everyone is able to truly own their money, investing it where they see value, all while still having direct access to their funds for use. There’s not really foreseeable way around adoption from where I stand: The alternative is for a large swath of the population to both remain unbanked and also remain unaware of the existence of banking alternatives like DeFi. Remember, this is a difference of requiring a bank, handing over deeply personal information to said bank, and trusting the bank to properly handle and manage your money while also allowing them to limit what you can and can’t do with that same money or generating a seed phrase and clicking a “Connect Wallet” button. While there is a deep learning curve that differentiates DeFi from the well entrenched systems most people are more comfortable with, the difference when put like that should be clear to any up and coming generation: Banking, at least in the traditional sense, is on its way out. And I can’t really say I’m sorry to see it go. In order to have a financially free society, we must accept the responsibility of banking ourselves. Once we have gotten over that mountain, the rest will become molehills.", "timestamp": 1636680887, "digest": "zm3Qev_rWTN3GuRZb3ngqEyRPC8SU-qoiEDjIYC8osM", "contributor": "0x39138f92CC1553CD216A1273Bbe408aaff90ee5E"}

This is amazing! Due in no small part to BTC, we are undoubtedly becoming the most financially-literate generation in history. Most of us get involved in crypto because we want to make quick money and get a piece of the action. That mentality will get you rekt and is not going to lead to long-term wealth. Trust me, been there. Instead, treat crypto as the doorway into understanding financial markets, investing mentality, and long term wealth creation. I have had significant losses, but I treat these as relatively cheap lessons and my core thesis surrounding investments and crypto has not changed.\n\n\n***\n\nIn todays writeup I'm going to give an overview of a few concepts that if you are new to investing/economics/crypto - I think are very important to understand.\n\n\nNow you won't understand everything at first, that's okay. This is just a small part of the financial education that school never taught you. Make no mistake, noone is going to do this for you, and noone cares how you spend your time. You've got to take initiative and understand that it is your responsibility to educate yourself, and to use your time wisely. We are living through a cambrian explosion of technology and innovation. Change is innevitable, but profiting from it is far from guaranteed!\n\n\nWe can only try to share, learn from each other and ask questions - we all have to start somewhere right?\n\n\nNow with this comes a disclaimer. I will no doubt gloss over some things and am by no means an expert - if you would like to correct something or contribute then please leave a comment! None of this is financial advice and as always DYOR! (do your own research)!\n\n\n\\-- I use USD in this post, but the concepts apply to most countries economies.\n\n\n***A STORY OF MONEY***\n\n\nLet's start with an analogy...\nSay I dig you a hole. Its a nice hole, took me hours to dig. We could come to an agreement between each other and say that at some point in the future, you owe me a similar sized hole. You agree. Brilliant! We have ourselves a contract of sorts, I do something of value for you - and you promise to return the value at some point in the future.\nNow what if I dig you 3 holes because I'm really really good at it - but I don't want 3 holes dug in exchange. What do we do? I've done something for you. Given you value through my labour. But we cant come to an agreement because you dont have anything I want in return.\nOkay, such a weird example I know. BUT - this hopefully illustrates the issue of barter. If we dont want what the other has, then we need some sort of medium of exchange (money/currency) in order to successfully transact with each other and with anybody else.\n\n\nThis leads to...\n\n\nMONEY!!! What is money? \n\nMoney can be anything. Precious metals like gold and silver have been used many times. Even tulips were considered money at one point in history. The point is that 'money' is not a pre-defined thing. Its whatever we humans give value to, and use to convey value between each other. One of the most important aspects of money is that it is scarce. That means I can't just go and create more of it - otherwise there would be no 'trust' in the money.\n\n\nLets use gold as an example. You can't go and create gold, and there is therefore a finite and limited supply of gold here on earth. It has some useful properties as well, like being corrosion and rust resistant, bright and shiny etc. But mostly it is this scarcity that gives gold its status as a 'store of value' and 'money'.\n\n\nNow we used precious metals for hundreds of years, in a variety of empires, but as you can imagine people got really tired of carrying around lumps of gold and silver to the markets. They're not the most convenient of moneys. So, in the 13th century, the Chinese developed the first paper money that was representative of gold. You could theoretically take your paper to the bank and exchange it for gold. Not many people decided to do this, because there was not really any point. Everybody accepted that the paper could be exchanged for real world items like food and clothing - nobody needed the actual gold because there was *trust* in the paper.\n\n\nNow of course, this eventually didn't end well, the empire collapsed, people lost faith in the paper etc etc. But this is important as it was one of the first cases of 'representative money'. Meaning that the paper actually represented something tangible, inherently scarce, and that it could be exchanged for the underlying 'asset' - the gold!\n\n\nFlash forward to 1971 - US president Nixon famously declares that the US dollar will no longer be exchangeable for gold. No longer will it be tied 1:1 to gold. This new unbacked paper money is known as FIAT - an important term in crypto.\n\n\nThe fact that the USD is no longer backed by gold upset a lot of people, but ultimately everybody kept accepting USD as payment, and the trust in the money continued. The Federal Reserve in the US is responsible for the supply of USD and plays a very important role in the global economy.\n\n\nNow to the fun part, INFLATION.\n\n\nThis is a relatively well known and accepted part of our economics. Simply put, INFLATION is the increase in the money supply, leading to less purchasing power per $USD. Makes sense right?\nThe more USD there is, the less valuable it is. Now we have all accepted that our money becomes worth 2-3% less per year on average. Meaning that if you save your money in a bank, your money is going to get you 2-3% LESS goods/services after 1yr. If you had your money INVESTED in some sort of appreciating asset, then you would generally grow your money more than that 2-3% and therefore outpace inflation.\n\n\nNow the real driver of inequality is inflation. AGAIN.\nThe real driver of INEQUALITY is INFLATION.\n\nEverybody talks about taxing the rich and how capitalism is the devil, but very few seem to acknowledge the role of inflation. Perhaps this is because its not very sexy and is difficult to make into a buzzfeed headline. Anyway... An asset is something that increases in value and/or earns you money. Stocks, property, bonds etc. The poor don't have assets. Inflation boosts asset prices. Think about what has happened in the past 2 years. Stock markets are at ATH, Crypto markets are at ATH, Property markets are at ATH. Since COVID, Govts have printed huge amounts of money in order to keep everything moving. This has flowed straight into the financial markets and anybody with assets has done rather well over the last 18months. This is fact. Meanwhile, the poorer among us, those without assets, are having their cost of living increase while their wages try to keep pace. Increasing the gap between those with assets and those without. Inequality is more of an economic issue than a social or political one. \n\nThere will no doubt be inflation. The cost of goods and services will increase in the coming years because the amount of USD has doubled over the past 18months. The term 'transitory' is being thrown around less and less. Now its important to mention that there are also 'deflationary' forces such as automation, robotics, AI, that could counteract the inflationary forces. We shall see. \n\nOne reason many have become interested in crypto and fallen down the BTC rabbit hole is because of the loss of trust in our Govts and Institutions. The meme 'Money printer go Brrr' has done more to illuminate the masses than a million posts like this one. Apart from increasing the value of your fiat, holding BTC is a massive middle finger to the govts and institutions of our world. It's opting out of the traditional banking system and rejecting state-controlled money. Straight from the BTC whitepaper - \"***The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust\".***\n\n\nBitcoin is most likened to digital gold. It is internet-native money. It is by the people, for the people. BTC can't be inflated by a govt or institution and this makes it an excellent place to store your hard-earned fiat. As more people purchase and hold BTC as a store of value, the demand increases and the price goes up. It has been the best performing asset for the last 10 years, and I believe will continue to be. Short of WW3 or some major economic shock, we will continue to see BTC and other cryptocurrencies increase in value as we become a more digitalised society.\n\n\nIn code we trust. lol.\n\nNot FA...

Rollups have the potential to scale the Ethereum network, but each rollup creates a siloed environment for its applications. Moving assets between rollups and the layer-1 network is slow and expensive, diminishing the savings users gain by using the rollup. The Hop protocol allows assets to be moved directly from rollup to rollup, providing cost savings and enabling cross-rollup composability of applications\n\n**[Website](https://hop.exchange/)** | **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/HopProtocol)**[ ](https://twitter.com/HopProtocol)|[ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/maticnetwork/)**[Discord](https://discord.gg/PwCF88emV4)** |[\\*\\* \\*\\*](https://t.me/maskbook_group)[\\*\\*Medium \\*\\*](https://medium.com/hop-protocol)| **[GitHub](https://github.com/hop-protocol)**\\*\\* \\*\\*| **[WhitePaper](https://hop.exchange/whitepaper.pdf)**", "timestamp": 1636681519, "digest": "z_etJMdsSe9-aqizthNrgHhYFRPdE6CgmKe16cZiavo", "contributor": "0xf14a9FA917a5517867e4e0018f320c1F6BF6f182"}

The Prophet blessed the world with 21 million coins, to be allocated and held by the righteous. To be scorned and sold by the damned. \n - Teachings of Saint Kevin, Anno Satoshi 15*\n\n*And though the demons of government fiat had been struck down. Satoshi looked upon the world and still wept, for the Prophet's followers had blasphemed by creating false coins in Bitcoin's image. Thus, the Holy Church was formed to ensure purity in value, for there is only value in the pure. \n - The Holy Ledger of the Orthodox Church of Bitcoin*\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\nBrother Vikram coughed as the dust overwhelmed him after he unsealed the heavy stone door to the sanctus sanctorum. Lamp raised high, he made his way into the cold and darkness of the Saint’s home. The Feast of Saint Carter Tang and the accompanying 21 days of Private Key Veneration began tomorrow, and Brother Vikram had come for the holy reliquary.\n\nUnlike the grand orders of Saint Winklevii or Saint Draper, the Order of Saint Carter Tang was a modest one - as befit the modest holdings and life of the Saint. Saint Tang sold his earthly possessions to join the Holy Crusade of Bitcoin in Anno Satoshi 10. And unlike the blessed evangelists, he lived as a hermit, spending his days drinking naught by Soylent and tending the Holy Blockchain. In Anno Satoshi 256, the Abbey was consecrated when the Holy Church saw fit to finally canonize Saint Tang for the purity of his earthly devotion to the Holy Coin. The Brothers of Saint Tang lived mendicant lives to this day in honor of their namesake's devotion - wearing nothing but coarse-cloth hoodies and drinking sacred Soylent for nourishment.\n\nBrother Vikram did not mind the harsh life, for he was content in his service to the Holy Church and Holy Coin. And he was dutifully honored and humbled to have been chosen by the Abbot for this most sacred of tasks.\n\nAs per tradition, he was to retrieve the reliquary from the Saint's old home for the Feast and Veneration. The reliquary contained an ancient hard drive that held the private key to the Saint's very own wallet of 10 Bitcoins. The more superstitious townsfolk would flock to the Abbey, lining up to gaze upon the lockbox under the belief that it could cure the sick and strengthen the weak. This idolatry was officially condemned by the Church as the veneration of private keys was uncomfortably close to the sin of valuing the physical over the digital, but the monks of St. Tang made no serious effort to combat this belief. The Abbey knew the lives of the common people were hard, and that this sin was minor compared to the virtues of strengthening their faith in the Holy Coin.\n\nBrother Vikram peered through the dark and cluttered room and spotted the reliquary beside the Sanctus Computatrum. He was not an uneducated peasant, but even he could not help being overwhelmed by the sight. Moved by devotion, he placed the lamp down and prostrated in front of the reliquary while reciting the Hodler's prayer. After he had collected himself and prepared to rise, he saw his lamplight illuminate several papers underneath one of the Saint's cabinets.\n\n\"Holy writings by the Saint! There aren't supposed to be anymore left!\" Brother Vikram thought as he spied the papers.\n\nHe knew he was only supposed to retrieve the holy reliquary and leave the Saint's home undisturbed, but... the thought of undiscovered writings by Saint Tang.... no, he had to see them.\n\nReaching under the cabinet, he carefully took hold of the brittle yellowing papers.\n\nTaking a calming breath and thanking the Prophet Satoshi for granting him this blessed miracle, he began to read.\n\nHis face contorted in confusion as he saw, “Account Statement - JPMorgan Chase”, in fading black type on the first sheet.\n\nBrother Bikram’s confusion gave way to shock and horror as he read on.\n\n\"No, no ... it can't be....\"\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\n\"These records... I can scarcely bring myself to say what they reveal. Saint. Tang... a financier, a trader... a purveyor of the lies of government fiat? Selling the Holy Coin to live a life of decadence? No, no, no... they must have been forged somehow! It must be the Apostate Etherumites who planted these documents. They've come back! I've always known Brother Josiah was soft-hearted in his suppression of the heretics - the Holy Inquisition dev-list must be informed, we must round the townsfolk and -\"\n\n\"They were not planted\", the Abbot said quietly as he stared out the chamber's windows.\n\nBrother Vikram was stunned.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nSighing, the Abbot turned to Brother Vikram and calmly explained, \"I said they were not planted. This... unpleasantness has been known to us at Saint Tang's for many years\".\n\n\"You - you knew?\"\n\n\"Yes, a few of the Elder Brothers know the true history as well. It is quite unfortunate you found those documents.\"\n\n\"But we must reveal the truth - \"\n\nThe Abbot held up a hand to stop Brother Vikram.\n\n\"Think of the good the Abbey does. We teach the virtues of hodling and stamp down on blasphemers attempting to debase the Holy Coin. Common knowledge of the sins of Saint Tang would be... disastrous - for not only our Order but for our Holy Church as well.\"\n\nBrother Vikram could not believe what he was hearing. His wise Abbot was consoling a cover-up?\n\n\"Abbot, I - I cannot condone this. As the Church teaches, the truth is paramount - this is the sacred motivation for the Holy Blockchain. I - I must report this to the Inquisition... I - I will report this to the Inquisition.\"\n\nThe Abbot looked sadly at Brother Vikram.\n\n\"There is no need to summon the Inquisition.\"\n\n\"Abbot, I appreciate all you have done for me and the Abbey, but I must inform them of this. As Prophet Satoshi said...\"\n\nThe door to the chamber opened, and four red-hoodied Inquisitors stepped in.\n\nThe Abbot spoke quietly, \"I'm sorry Brother Vikram, you forget that the Prophet Satoshi also said that the truth of the Holy Blockchain is held through consensus...\"\n\nBrother Vikram heard an Inquisitor behind him unsheathe a dagger.\n\n\"... And we cannot let you break consensus.\"", "timestamp": 1636681926, "digest": "RQXtIbt0I7MN2VKH5HgiSRI-YrssYWH6sXsxJMe4PE4", "contributor": "0xfFD12A75a46D8153F369178b68Dd72429E89256f"}

Calderon decided to go after the zombies, of which there were only 88 in the whole set. Whenever he saw a Punk with bloodshot eyes and putrid green skin, he made note of its corresponding number and executed the smart contract command to claim it. By the time he ran out of ether, he had grabbed 34 zombies, a Punk that reminded him of his wife, and another that he thought resembled a friend. “I felt a little foolish,” he says, “but it felt right.”The initial buzz carried over to the secondhand market. Collectors began meeting on the [Discord](https://www.wired.com/tag/discord/) platform to boast and gawk and talk about sales. They honed their collections using marketplace commands in the Larva Labs smart contract, such as offerPunkForSale() and buyPunk(). Prices rose quickly, from $3 to $100 to $300. On July 1—when the CryptoPunks project was all of three weeks old—an alien sold for $2,680. That September, Jonathan Mann, a musician who has written a song every day for a decade and now sells them as NFTs, [wrote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fZso2DocSs) about the Punks. One line went, “A crypto fever dream, tell me, what does it mean?”\n\nTwo months later, a Canadian venture firm called Axiom Zen used elements of the CryptoPunks smart contract to launch its own [line of NFTs](https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-boom-collectors-shell-out-crypto/), the CryptoKitties. Collectors could breed colorful, bug-eyed cats to produce new creatures, which could in turn be sold and bred. With its gamelike nature and its promise of profit, CryptoKitties drove the fever up and up. Within days, the price of rare Crypto­Kitties soared to more than $100,000.\n\nFever dreams are a classic symptom of capitalism, familiar to anyone who has hit it big or lost it all in the past 400 years. At their core is a belief in the value of an asset. For this crypto dream to work, people have to take it on faith that when you link a digital file to a blockchain, you’re able to make an infinitely copyable object unique. It’s still a niche conviction, but people seem to come to it in waves, like congregants to a summertime tent revival. The lulls in between are known as crypto winters. If you’re strong and lucky, you get through winter and ride the next wave to a payout.In the spring of 2020, Calderon sold off five zombies for about $15,000 each. He and his wife used the money to build a second home made of shipping containers on land they owned in the arty enclave of Marfa, Texas. He nicknamed it the Zombie House. Later that year, as prices skyrocketed again, he launched an NFT sales platform of his own.\n\nBut the Punks’ power has gone well beyond funding one family’s desert retreat. They have created whole new communities. They have infiltrated fine art auction houses; in one wild moment in June, an auctioneer at Sotheby’s banged his gavel at $11.75 million for an alien wearing a surgical mask. The total value of Crypt­oPunk sales—all the money people have spent on Punks to date—has surpassed $1.5 billion. They have driven both Jay-Z and Snoop to adopt look-alike Punks as their Twitter avatars. They have thrown into question the nature and value of art. But can they answer the question in Mann’s song? Can they explain how a group of people came to believe that a bunch of images and a rough-edged technology could be worth such staggering sums?\n\nJOHN WATKINSON AND Matt Hall, the two-man team at Larva Labs, stumbled on the idea for Crypto­Punks while talking about their childhoods. They didn’t know each other as kids, but they might as well have: They both grew up in Ontario, both collected hockey cards and Magic: The Gathering cards. They both got hooked on computers early—Hall after discovering a friend’s Atari and Watkinson after playing games on a friend’s Commodore 64. “I just loved that this was the ultimate creative tool,” Watkinson says.\n\nBoth were also lanky, T-shirt-and-jeans-wearing computer science majors at the University of Toronto. They became friendly while working on a class project, but they didn’t start hanging out until after graduation. One day they ran into each other on the street and ended up talking about their shared love of creative programming. “It was almost like asking each other out on a date,” Watkinson remembers. “Like, do you like to work on weird projects with computers?” They started meeting every Tuesday night at Hall’s apartment to code for fun.When it came time to find a cool tech job in Toronto, they both felt stuck. “I thought I was going to be at a job at an insurance company, writing insurance software,” Hall says. In 1999, the friends independently decided to move to New York to search for something better. When they realized they had drafted the same plan, they figured they should just become roommates. They both bounced from job to job but kept up their habit of coding together at night and on weekends. A few years later, as smartphones were emerging, they found a niche developing apps for an early handset, the T-Mobile Sidekick, and committed to their creative partnership full-time. They gave themselves the name Larva Labs. In 2011 they coded an app for Google called Androidify, which let people customize the company’s green Android mascot into a personal avatar by selecting its skin tone, clothing, and accessories. The app was a surprise hit, and for a while fans of Google’s operating system used the avatars as their profile pictures on Twitter. Through that app and others, Watkinson and Hall developed a nostalgic look, rooted in the limited graphics of the computers they grew up with—simple, cartoonish shapes with clean lines and bright colors that seem to belong nowhere more than on a screen.\n\nDespite their successes, though, the duo felt like they weren’t living up to their potential as a team. At one point they tried to launch a legal-documents startup, but they failed to raise the needed money. They worried they were swerving from project to project without real direction.One day in the spring of 2017, the two men were talking about Watkinson’s nieces; the girls had started collecting different kinds of toys with an enthusiasm that reminded them of their own youthful hobbies. Watkinson wondered what it would take for someone to feel as excited about collecting digital trading cards. The main problem, of course, was that because any digital good can exist in limitless, identical copies, no single instance of it is special. To be collectible, the two knew, an object had to be scarce. The toy company Ty started selling Beanie Babies in 1993, but the collecting craze didn’t begin until the maker stopped producing some of its original designs.\n\nSo how do you make a digital object seem hard to get? Hall, who had been reading about Bitcoin, thought a [blockchain](https://www.wired.com/story/guide-blockchain/), with its time-ordered record of transactions, might be useful. People put a certain price on bitcoins because everyone agrees on how many of them exist. “That’s digital rarity,” he figured.\n\nHall poked around online and discovered that another developer, Joe Looney, had used the Bitcoin blockchain to trade digital images of [Pepe](https://www.wired.com/story/pepe-meme-evolution/), the Trumpist right’s frog mascot. That project relied on an extra technological layer Hall didn’t understand, and he couldn’t figure out how to procure a Pepe.\n\nHe kept researching and soon decided that Ethereum was a better starting point. In a 2013 white paper, the cryptocurrency’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, had pitched a blockchain that, unlike Bitcoin’s, came with its own fully functional programming language. The language could be used to write small programs—smart contracts—that would allow people to do more than just exchange money. People could record property ownership, offer insurance, start a decentralizedcorporation—or trade digital assets.Hall and Watkinson started to learn one of the Ethereum programming languages, Solidity, and dug into writing their own smart contract. They discovered they could create things called tokens to represent any digital asset. When a person bought some, the smart contract would store the balance and link it to the buyer’s identifying address.\n\nFor Hall and Watkinson, though, the idea was only a partial solution. The Ethereum tokens were all interchangeable, but for a set of digital collectibles they needed to track the identity of individual tokens. After a bit of tinkering, they discovered they could get the blockchain to associate a person’s address with a token’s identifying number. With that small insight, the two had found a way to make fungible tokens non-fungible.\n\nWatkinson had been working on designing a set of digital cards that were compelling enough to be worth collecting. He made some basic heads, along with accessories to layer over them, and then worked away at a piece of software—the “generator” in the generative art—that could compose thousands of unique but plausible faces. Loosely inspired by his experience with Androidify, Watkinson played around with the characters’ looks, adding hair styles, pipes, hats. He zeroed in on a punky look, which he felt resonated with crypto enthusiasts’ defiant bent. “I liked that it was very counterculture and sort of funky and kind of flying in the face of the establishment,” Watkinson says.\n\nWhen the generator was nearly finished, Watkinson joined Hall in figuring out how to write the basics of a marketplace into their smart contract, so that people could buy and sell Punks.The biggest issue was getting their wares onto the Ethereum blockchain. If they uploaded each face individually, the transaction fees would be far too high. This was a problem. If the images weren’t themselves on the blockchain, would anyone believe they owned a CryptoPunk? Watkinson and Hall decided to go with an imperfect solution: a hash. They fed a composite image of all the Punks—the grid of 10,000 faces—into a hashing algorithm called SHA-256, which cranked out a 64-digit signature. Hall tucked the number into their smart contract. If anyone tried to tamper with the master image (by, say, transforming the pyrite of a stringy-haired goatee guy into the gold of an alien), a skeptic could ­double-check the image by running it through that algorithm. Only the original image, with every pixel precisely intact, would generate the signature.\n\nIn their smart contract, they reserved the first 1,000 Punks for themselves. Hall published the contract to the blockchain and posted a link to their website on Twitter and Reddit.\n\nThey were met, mostly, with silence. In the first five days, a handful of people, Calderon among them, found the project and snapped up the rarest Punks. “We were feeling sort of silly,” Watkinson says, when only a few dozen of them had been claimed. Then, on June 16, the tech site Mashable published a post with an eye-catching headline: “This Ethereum-­Based Project Could Change How We Think About Digital Art.”Within 24 hours, all the Punks were gone; one man who saw the post amassed 758 of them.\n\nWithin days, collectors started to buy and sell—but right away, they ran into trouble. When someone tried to buy a Punk, a horrific bug in the smart contract caused the payment to travel not from the buyer to the seller—but to go straight back to the buyer. The lucky buyer ended up with both the Punk *and* the money being offered, and the seller got nothing. Roughly a dozen people were burned, and Hall felt terrible. “That was a complete disaster,” Watkinson says. “It’s like, well, our marketplace is toast.” They posted urgent updates on their website and Twitter telling people to stop trading. Then they wrote a new smart contract in which they undid all the trades, and, several days later, they rolled it out.\n\nNow that the marketplace was working, Larva Labs created the Discord channel where collectors such as Calderon reveled in the Punks’ details, dreamed up personalities for their purchases, and brainstormed other projects involving digital collectibles. Watkinson and Hall’s passion project had kicked off a buzzing community, and they were thrilled. They figured their work was basically done. \n  \n **THE FIRST TIME** that Anne Bracegirdle heard Watkinson speak about the Crypto­Punks, at a blockchain art meetup in downtown Manhattan in early 2018, she became determined to meet the pair. Bracegirdle was a photography specialist at Christie’s at the time. In her nearly 10 years at the auction house, she had seen how hard it was to verify the provenance of a work. And assuring potential buyers of the rarity of a photograph was a challenge when, for example, a living photographer could on a whim decide to issue more prints. The Punks and the blockchain presented an exciting solution to both problems.Right away, Bracegirdle saw a parallel in Hall and Watkinson’s work: “It immediately became clear to me they were like Andy Warhol,” she says. Hall and Watkinson were “critiquing and exploring the way we consume now,” she says, just as Warhol did with his *Campbell’s Soup Cans*. Bracegirdle invited the two to a blockchain-themed event she was planning to hold at Christie’s in London. Just like that, they were catapulted into the rarefied world of fine art.\n\nThat July, Watkinson and Hall flew to London. At the auction house, they paused to take pictures of themselves under a Christie’s sign. About 350 people in pressed shirts and jackets gathered in the building. Contemporary works from an upcoming auction were installed throughout. Onone wall was *Yellow Lambo*, a 10-foot-long yellow neon sign composed of 42 digits, the smart contract address for a cryptocurrency of the same name. The work was by Kevin Abosch, an artist who once sold a picture of a potato for $1 million.\n\nThree hours in, Hall, wearing a dark blazer over his usual T-shirt, climbed onto the stage for a panel on crypto art. The moderator, a generative art buff named Jason Bailey, turned to him with a deceptively simple question: What do people own when they buy a CryptoPunk?\n\nBailey was alluding to the issue of whether the image itself was on the blockchain. Hall replied that his answer had a way of making people mad. “You own something on the blockchain—you own a record that you own it,” he said. “You own the right to sell it in the future.” He didn’t explicitly say, however, that Larva Labs retained the copyright, so it wasn’t even obvious if owners could reproduce their Punks. Their project was so new and complicated that the details got thorny fast.After the panel, a curator named Georg Bak cornered Hall and Watkinson to ask if he could exhibit their work in a gallery in Zurich. “Guys, what you did is art history,” he remembers saying. “I have to show it.” Bak was organizing a blockchain-themed art show that included Abosch and Ai Weiwei; he thought Larva Labs belonged there too. For Hall and Watkinson, the whole trip had been surreal, so why not throw in a gallery show in Switzerland? They said yes.\n\n“I’m not sure they were aware they were artists,” Bak says now.\n\nAfter almost a week in London, Hall and Watkinson flew home to New York and faced, with some queasiness, the question of what to exhibit. Bak didn’t give them much direction, but they worked in a shared office space alongside designers and artists. The duo peppered their neighbors with questions. They settled on producing prints of some of the Punks they owned, which they would sell with an envelope containing an Ethereum passphrase—the access code for the wallet in which the digital Punk resides. They then designed a custom seal featuring a CryptoPunk, and practiced melting sticks of red wax over a candle. With their officemates’ help, they produced prints of 12 of their Punks, rolled them up into a mailer tube, built a big protective box for the envelopes and their fragile seals, and shipped it off to Switzerland.\n\nAt the converted-loft gallery in Zurich, art handlers framed the prints and hung nine of them side by side on a raw concrete wall. Then they tucked three into storage.Watkinson flew in for the show, and Bak invited him to talk about the CryptoPunks at a dinner for crypto finance people. As soon as the event ended, Bak was bombarded with interest from buyers. By the time the exhibit opened, he had sold most of the Punks. On the day of the opening, Bak says, “one guy was running to the gallery, just straight away came to me and says he wants to buy one.” Bak dug the last print out of storage for him. A few days later, Watkinson flew home, and he and Hall painstakingly printed and shipped 12 more CryptoPunks. Those sold out too.\n\nNavigating the art world, facing questions about what—and where—the art was, got Hall and Watkinson thinking: Could they make the link between an artwork and the blockchain stronger and more straightforward? In the fall of 2018, the two went to a digital art show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, where they saw one of the American artist Sol LeWitt’s many wall drawings. For the series, LeWitt left a set of instructions—often with ample room for interpretation—for assistants, who in turn execute them on a wall. Watkinson and Hall started wondering what it might look like if a blockchain issued drawing instructions to a computer.\n\nJust as they got going on the project, though, invitations to cool art world events petered out, and interest in the Crypto­Punks slowed to a crawl. Crypto winter had set in. But Bak was organizing another show and urging them to produce new work, so they pushed through.In April 2019, Watkinson and Hall released [Autoglyphs](https://larvalabs.com/autoglyphs), a reimagining of LeWitt’s wall drawings for the Ethereum age. It was a generative art project, but this time the generator itself was in the smart contract. When a person bought a work, the accompanying blockchain transaction triggered the generator to crank out a unique drawing.\n\nTheir stripped-down piece of software was set up to produce 512 works consisting of black-and-white lines and circles arranged in a square, like an arty QR code or an abstract snowflake. No faces, no personalities. Just shapes. They decided to charge each claimer a fee of 0.2 ether (at the time about $35). A few lines in their smart contract would send the fee directly to the wallet address of a climate-change nonprofit, as a donation. But they weren’t feeling optimistic. “I don’t even know if anyone cares anymore about NFTs,” Watkinson remembers thinking. \n \n\n![The Autoglyphs / When the Larva Labs guys created their second blockchain art project, the code to create the pieces was, as their website says, “tiny and optimized to run efficiently on Ethereum nodes.” COURTESY OF LARVA LABS](https://media.wired.com/photos/618c233d1667c44ded070515/master/w_1600,c_limit/autoglyph.jpg)\n\nA core community of CryptoPunk fans still revered their work. The pieces sold out in hours. This time, however, the rest of the world didn’t pay much attention. At Bak’s new show, only one of the Autoglyph prints sold. When Hall went to update the Larva Labs website to include media coverage of the project, he realized there was almost nothing to post. “It was like, hmm, update complete,” he says.\n\nWhat they couldn’t see was that the season of crypto was turning. Within a few months, the Crypto­Punks began changing hands more often. “It started to get a pulse,” Watkinson says. “It found another little gear.” Soon, Autoglyph sales perked up too. Crypto­currency prices were on the rise, and fast. NFTs were ready for their breakout.\n\n**CLAIRE SILVER**, AN artist who lives in the Midwest, had kind of forgotten about her Punks. Unemployed, living with a debilitating illness and prone to bouts of depression, Silver (her pseudonym) had spent the previous five years dabbling in cryptocurrencies. In 2017 she befriended a security professional in a crypto chat room. He happened to be the person who’d claimed 758 Punks, and they bonded over a shared sense that the blockchain would revolutionize art. In June, he gave her three Punks. He was convinced that they belonged in New York’s Museum of Modern Art, and he and Silver vowed that, no matter how high prices might climb, they wouldn’t sell until mainstream arbiters of culture caught up to them. He gave away several more Punks and started going by the name Mr703.Crypto winter had been difficult for Silver; seeing her savings tank demoralized her, and she withdrew from her chat rooms. She and Mr703 fell out of touch. She turned back to her own art. She bought a secondhand iPad on Craigslist and spent $10 for an app called ProCreate. She used it to make collages with photographs of her earlier work, public-domain images, and her doodles.\n\nShe starting thinking about artificial intelligence and whether it might help people like her, people with disabilities, in the future. If AI could augment a person’s abilities, would it alleviate their suffering? On the other hand, would the loss of pain diminish their depth of spirit? Her curiosity sent her in search of ways to experiment with AI in her art. She found a tool called Ganbreeder that allowed her to train a machine-learning algorithm on images of her choice and to produce new ones. She selected some of these generated images and incorporated them into larger works.\n\nIn January 2021, Silver noticed on Twitter that people kept mentioning the Crypto­Punks and that people were buying NFTs for heaps of money. She found a pair of platforms, Rarible and OpenSea, where she could create NFTs of her own work and put them up them for sale. She minted her first work on January 9, paid the $50 Ethereum transaction fee, and listed it for 0.5 ether (about $630).\n\nNothing happened.\n\nDiscouraged, she thought about her Punks. She’d noticed that people who used one as an avatar seemed to get clout in online discussions, as if owning a Punk was evidence of wisdom or investment prowess.In late February, [Silver](https://twitter.com/ClaireSilver12) changed her Twitter profile picture from one of her own works to Punk No. 1629, a pink-haired girl with a black hat. “I started getting a thousand followers a month, and a ton of engagement, and a ton of DMs for opportunities,” Silver says. An artist embodying a CryptoPunk and making her own NFTs was a delicious clash of memes, just the sort of thing the internet rewards.\n\nA birder and NFT enthusiast named Tom Marsan-Ryan became the first person to buy one of Silver’s pieces—an image of a crow seeming to perch on a branch made of flowers. Then Mr703 bought 12 moody portraits of figures in the palette of the old masters­—all made with AI. The roughly $6,000 worth of ether that landed in her crypto wallet from these sales was enough to cover half a year of rent and groceries.\n\nSilver’s life, in a rural town surrounded by cornfields, was changed. When she was a child, she says, her family relied on food donated by a local church, and as an adult she steered herself to the middle aisles of Walmart’s food section, where the cheapest groceries are kept. The store had always been a place that pummeled her with reminders of things she couldn’t afford. Now, with a few thousand dollars’ worth of ether in her crypto wallet, she felt light-headed when she drifted down the aisles.Silver realized that Twitter and Discord were her conduits to a better life. One day a photographer named Justin Aversano, who cofounded a nonprofit that uses empty billboards and other advertising space to promote art, sent her a message asking her if he could use Punk No. 1629. She agreed. In May, on 55th Street in Manhattan, just three blocks from MoMA, the pink-haired Punk appeared on a screen atop a public Wi-Fi kiosk. It was *almost* as if Mr703’s prediction had come true. “Surreal doesn’t begin to cover it,” she tweeted after seeing a photo of the installation.\n\nSilver wanted to see 1629’s pixels in the flesh, so she shoved a futon into the back of her Dodge Grand Caravan and set off from her sleepy town on a three-day drive to New York. Each night as it got dark, she navigated to a Walmart parking lot and bunked down in the back of her car. In the morning she headed to the store’s restroom, then hit the road again.\n\nUnder a blanket of clouds that threatened rain, she piloted her minivan down Manhattan’s packed avenues and parked a few blocks away from MoMA. She pulled a black hat over her hair and walked fast to 1629. She felt like she was staring at her reflection. Silver pulled out a scrap of paper, scribbled the name “Claire” on it, and drew a tiny flower next to her name. She held it up in front of the digital billboard and snapped a photo. Only the black cuff of her sleeve and her flawless black press-on nails, which she’d coordinated with her Punk’s black hat, appear in the image. She posted the shot on Twitter. It was the first time she’d shown her followers any part of her physical self.“Lifetime highlight reel unlocked,” she tweeted as the likes and replies poured in. Then, nervous about the pandemic, she got back in her car and drove to the Connecticut coast to treat herself to a lobster roll.\n\nAs the summer wore on, Silver’s popularity online kept growing, but sales of her NFTs were spotty. Sometimes she went weeks with no income. During one dry stretch, her mother was due for a surgery, and Silver wanted to rent an Airbnb so she could be nearby. She decided it was time to sell a Punk—a woman with a shock of red hair and pink eyeshadow that Silver had nicknamed Strawberry Marla. A first-time Punk collector picked it up for about $63,000. Silver booked the Airbnb. She also bought NFTs by a woman artist in the Philippines whom she admired. Not long after, she sold another of her own works for $18,000.\n\nSilver’s burgeoning career and social life now seemed on solid ground. They were also inextricably tied to her online image; in fact, her sense of self was fusing with 1629. When she tried to paint a self-­portrait, 1629 kept materializing on the canvas. She cut her hair into a bob with bangs, just like her Punk’s. “I sort of feel like I live in the metaverse now, and the physical world is slowing me down,” she says. There, she has to break to eat, sleep, and take medicine. She gets extremely tired. She mostly stays inside her apartment. She doesn’t have many real-world companions. Online she counts a lot of people, mostly other Punk owners, as true friends. For years now, the physical world hadn’t measured up.Silver even started to feel as if her physical body wasn’t her anymore. She considered dyeing her hair but settled on a pink wig instead, which she often wears. “I’ve had a lot of other Punks say similar things, that you slowly turn into your digital identity,” she says. She hadn’t expected it to happen to her; she worried that transforming into her Punk was a pathetic thing to do. Finally, she decided she didn’t care. This Punk had launched her art career. It had given her a community.\n\nIN ANOTHER CORNER of the Punkiverse, Erick Calderon, the zombie tycoon, had spent four years collecting Punks and Autoglyphs and dreaming about starting his own blockchain-­based generative art shop. In 2018 he sold off several zombies to hire developers, who helped him start to code his dream into existence. In late November 2020, Calderon launched [Art Blocks](https://www.artblocks.io/). The idea was to have a place where lots of generative artists could sell their works. It quickly became much more.\n\nEvery few days or weeks, Art Blocks released a generative art project very much in the vein of Autoglyphs. In effect, each project is a vending machine set by an artist to crank out between 500 and 1,000 works. As with Autoglyphs, when a person spends some ether to buy a work, that blockchain transaction triggers the artist’s algorithm to create a new, random work, which lands as a surprise in the buyer’s crypto wallet. But unlike Autoglyphs, which is written in Solidity and *runs* on the blockchain, this code is written in JavaScript and is only stored there. These algorithms run in your browser, a distinction that allows them to be more visually rich and more computationally demanding than Larva Labs’ project.For the first eight months of the company’s existence, Calderon priced the mints at no more than $1,000 each, so that more people might find them affordable. But every time a new project launched, eager buyers swarmed to his company’s Discord, flooded the blockchain, and grabbed all the available works within minutes. The Discord server was bustling even between drops, with collectors gathering after a sale to suss out the pieces they scored and to see what others had gotten. And they kept chatting for weeks and months after a purchase.\n\nCalderon realized that the social validation collectors found in chat rooms was as important as the art—that the conversation was a huge part of what made Art Blocks addictive. As special as the generative art might be, “we wouldn’t be here without Discord,” he says.\n\nTo offer up more projects, he added sections to the Art Blocks site: one where projects were more heavily curated and two less restrictive areas. They sold out too. Thousands of new people joined the Art Blocks Discord each month, drawn by the alchemical mix of affordable-ish art, the thrill of the hunt, and a ready-made social environment in which to hash out the experience.But it wasn’t just the buzz that made Art Blocks an overnight sensation. It was the promise of a swift profit. Calderon estimates about half of Art Blocks’ buyers immediately flip their works on OpenSea, where the cheapest curated pieces go for about $3,000. Calderon was happy that artists were benefiting from the speculation (the Art Blocks smart contract gives a 5 percent cut of secondary sales to the artist), but he didn’t love that by keeping prices low, he’d created a way for people to make a quick buck. Worse, the big gap in original and resale prices had attracted a handful of buyers with armies of bots at their disposal that could beat out regular humans when a project went on sale. Calderon worried that these bot-wielding speculators would suck the joy out of the art-loving community he’d spun into existence.So he changed the pricing structure. In August, Art Blocks started selling pieces using a Dutch auction format, where the prices start sky-high and then fall in increments until all the works are claimed. “Now you’re not guaranteed a profit,” he says. “If the Dutch auction is working, there’s less speculation, people settle down a bit, and it leaves room for others.” The change didn’t fully solve the bot problem, but it did make it more difficult for them to game a sale.\n\nOn September 3, Art Blocks dropped a project called [Trossets](https://www.artblocks.io/project/147), by Anna Carreras, an artist who teaches creative coding in Barcelona. The Dutch auction began slowly, as it should, starting at 15 ether (about $60,000). Carreras wasn’t too well known, and with only one work minted at the outset—a grid of green circles and squiggly lines—it was impossible for collectors to imagine what compositions might appear. But then a few people bought in. Their pieces showed up on the Art Blocks website and on Discord, and the shape of Trossets slowly emerged. \n  \n                         “***For a decade,” Punk6529 trumpeted on Twitter, “our enemies have turned tulips against us. Today we reclaim the tulip for crypto***.” \n  \n  \n Colorful and dynamic, the images resembled a reimagined game of Chutes and Ladders. Now and then a surprising arrangement of swoops and dots would pop up like an Easter egg. In a channel devoted to Carreras on the Art Blocks Discord, people commented on the pieces they liked best and sent shout-outs to the artist: “Congrats on the awesome art!” and “What a beautiful project.”\n\nOnce the price got down to 5 ether ($19,800), the bidding picked up and turned into a frenzy, and soon all 1,000 works sold out. The project netted about $10 million. Subtracting the 10 percent that went to Art Blocks and two charitable donations chosen by the artist totaling about $2 million, Carreras had the equivalent of $7 million in ether before taxes.\n\nThree weeks later, Trossets collectors stumbled on a surprise. On September 23, they were sharing the images they owned in Carreras’ channel on the Art Blocks Discord when a person who went by noonatnite wrote, “I see uve found the rubber duckies.”\n\nIn one Trosset, negative space around green snakelike tubes and a smattering of dots looked like several chubby little bath ducks. Carreras jumped in: “Yyeeesss, you saw them,” she typed. “Some duckies and birds are hidden in Trossets. You are the 1st one to mention it!” That sent others hunting through their Trossets. One person spotted two ducks kissing. A few days later someone posted that, after staring at a single work for hours, they had spotted a dragon, birds,elephants, paw prints, and Mickey Mouse. Another piece hosted an armada of alien spaceships. Carreras pointed out to one person that their piece contained a butterfly. “Ooohh. Now I see it,” they replied. “Thank you. Love your work.”Similar moments had propelled a handful of Art Blocks images to the top of the NFT rankings, alongside the Crypto­Punks’ aliens, apes, and zombies. One of the currently most prized pieces comes from the artist and coder Dmitri Cherniak’s [Ringers](https://www.artblocks.io/project/13), a project where a generator produced 1,000 variations of a string wrapped around a random arrangement of pegs. Shortly after the pieces were all minted, collectors in Cherniak’s Art Blocks Discord channel noticed that one Ringer stood out: It evoked a white-necked bird stretching its yellow wings. Cherniak and other enthusiasts immediately started calling it *[The Goose](https://opensea.io/assets/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/13000879)*. On August 27, *The Goose* sold for $5.8 million, and it soon went on display in a real-world gallery in Hong Kong.\n\nTyler Hobbs’ [Fidenza](https://www.artblocks.io/project/78), a series where ribbons of varying colors and scales flow across a digital canvas, produced another standout. In one, bars of color arc into the organic shape of petals; it is known as *The Tulip*. A collector who uses a Punk as their digital identity—@Punk6529 on Twitter—bought it for $3.3 million and announced he’d never sell it. In a [tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/punk6529/status/1429863145607159809), he reminded people of the many times crypto culture has been compared to the famous spike in tulip bulb prices in the 1630s, considered the first speculative bubble in history. “For a decade,” Punk6529 trumpeted on Twitter, “our enemies have turned tulips against us. Today we reclaim the tulip for crypto, with one of the most remarkable pieces of art ever recorded on the blockchain.”If spending this kind of money on something as flimsy as a JPEG seems absurd, recall that collectors have bought empty space, a closed gallery, and a duct-taped banana. The fine art world hasn’t been held back by such concerns. Conceptual art can be an investment, sure, but it’s also a way to distinguish yourself as a wealthy person with a nose for the future. When a *New York Times* reporter asked the founder of a gallery that displayed Maurizio Cattelan’s banana about its sale, he replied that the fact that someone bought the banana is what made the piece. “They buy an idea, they buy a certificate,” he told her. A Ringer, a Fidenza, a CryptoPunk: an idea and a certificate, and instant membership in a new community.\n\nIN THE FALL, Jonathan Mann—Mr. Fever Dream—was busy cranking out songs and videos about NFTs. “GM!” [he sang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o2Gxp5tvHQ) in one of them. “**GM GM GM GM GM**!” He meant *good morning*, one of the many bits of **NFT** vernacular that fill up Twitter and Discord. “Am I,” he asked over the jaunty strums of a guitar, “GMI?” Was he *going to make it*? He looked up to the sky with angst in his eyes. “NGMI!” replied a demonic version of his face surrounded by flames. “No,” Mann retorted. “What?” said the demon. “GMI!” Mann hollered.\n\nFour years along, Mann was deep into NFTs, slinging lingo and lightly critiquing it in verse. His supporters—his fans and the people who buy his songs as NFTs—all get it. The words are part of the glue holding this corner of the internet together. Just as they’d decided that digital collectibles were worth owning, and they’d decided to use this language, they decided their NFTs were Going to MakeIt.That faith, of course, is a social construct. The worth of art is too: It’s how the artist Yves Klein, who considered reality his medium, could sell eight editions of *Zone of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility*, his work made up of empty space. Value is forged in the messy crucible of human interaction.\n\nIn October, over Zoom, Hall talked about his surprise that the CryptoPunks had spawned a social network and kicked a subculture into a higher gear. Spontaneous communities pop up with ease in the NFT world’s fertile soil, he said: “It’s not an app you download, like, ‘Here’s the NFT social network app.’ It’s more, ‘I use my avatar here, and I say these words, and I’m in the inside group.’” On the internet as on the playground, people see others having fun and want to be included. That’s what fuels the fever dream.\n\nNowadays, NFT enthusiasts consider CryptoPunks to be digital antiques, the Fabergé eggs of an emergent culture. Not quite so edgy anymore. Miami’s Institute of Contemporary Art acquired one. Even Visa, the multinational finance conglomerate, bought a Punk.\n\nAll the mainstream attention got some members of the CryptoPunk community dwelling on the one major weakness in the project’s design: that the images themselves weren’t on the blockchain—only their hash was. Whenever an outsider discovered the CryptoPunks, they would almost certainly end up puzzling over those same old questions of where and what the art was. Shouldn’t the preeminent NFT images have some kind of long-term storage plan?A few months ago, Calderon and [a friend](https://twitter.com/_deafbeef) approached Watkinson and Hall with a proposal for just that. The Punks’ faces had a lot of redundant features and pixels, they noted. A compression algorithm could make good use of that fact. They showed Watkinson and Hall their code for shrinking the Crypto­Punks’ image grid and a small program that could expand the image back to its original size. The idea involved some clever engineering, and Watkinson and Hall loved it. With their community’s help, they were finally able to settle old, unfinished business.\n\nThe pair made some tweaks to the code, wrote up a smart contract, and published it. Just like that, the Punks landed on the blockchain. This time, for real. \n \n\n**This article was published on November/12, 2021**", "timestamp": 1636682190, "digest": "Uao9v2UwPdmenw4jw_op4zPeaVleAsjU4Q0yUiJdqFY", "contributor": "0xD60e645C391ED4374829D7Ec6439B7E1C7a5438c"}

By integrating the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, WePiggy has access to high-quality, tamper-proof price feeds needed to price crypto assets in our lending market when issuing loans and checking collateralization. This will provide our users with stronger assurances that their collateral assets will consistently track global markets and won’t be affected by price manipulation.\n\nOur initial integration involves Chainlink Price Feeds for the following assets: ETH, WBTC, LINK, and DAI. We chose Chainlink as our go-to oracle solution because its infrastructure is seamless to integrate and time-tested in production. Chainlink already helps secure leading DeFi protocols responsible for tens of billions of dollars in smart contract value, maintaining robust security and high availability even amidst unexpected events, such as exchange downtime, flash crashes, and [data manipulation attacks via flash loans](https://blog.chain.link/flash-loans-and-the-importance-of-tamper-proof-oracles/).\n\nWePiggy focuses on building an open-source, non-custodial crypto-asset lending market protocol that helps users realize asset appreciation and maximize utilization across many blockchain networks.\n\nIn order to help secure our lending markets, we needed access to fresh asset prices that are supplied directly on-chain in a highly reliable manner. Fair market asset prices should reflect a volume-weighted average from all trading environments. Thus, we needed to make use of an oracle to fetch aggregated price data off-chain and deliver it on-chain to be consumed by our application.\n\nAfter reviewing various oracle solutions, we integrated Chainlink Price Feeds because they provide a multitude of critical features such as:\n\n* **High-Quality Data** — Chainlink Price Feeds source data from numerous premium data aggregators, leading to price data that’s aggregated from hundreds of exchanges, weighted by volume, and cleaned of outliers and wash trading. Chainlink’s data aggregation model generates more precise global market prices that are inherently resistant to inaccuracies or manipulation of any single or small set of exchanges.\n* \\*\\*High Update Frequency \\*\\*— Chainlink Price Feeds can perform frequent price updates at minimal costs on Arbitrum, resulting in precise price data that consistently reflects current market conditions.\n* \\*\\*Secure Node Operators \\*\\*— Chainlink Price Feeds are secured by independent, security-reviewed, and Sybil-resistant oracle nodes run by leading blockchain DevOps teams, data providers, and traditional enterprises. Chainlink nodes have a strong track record of reliability, even during high gas prices and infrastructure outages.\n* \\*\\*Decentralized Network \\*\\*— Chainlink Price Feeds are decentralized at the data source, oracle node, and oracle network levels, generating strong protections against downtime and tampering by either the data provider or oracle network.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*o5qJKNF_iIEJARYd)\n\nWePiggy actively creates a more diverse lending market and expands more dimensions of the business logic, on the premise of giving priority to funding security. Chainlink provides reliable and secure services to help ensure that the WePiggy lending platform can expand and diversify DeFi on Arbitrum and grow the overall DeFi on Layer-2 ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, under the WePiggy multi-chain deployment plan, WePiggy is live or working to launch on Ethereum, OKExChain, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Huobi Eco Chain, Arbitrum, and various other innovative public and Layer-2 networks. On this path, WePiggy will always take Chainlink as the first choice oracle provider.\n\n***“The integration of Chainlink Price Feeds allows us to provide users with more robust and transparent asset pricing, reducing the possibility of disputes and single points of failure. Chainlink is also blockchain agnostic, and already live on many of WePiggy’s target chains, simplifying the development requirements to scale WePiggy.”***\n\n– Ron Zheng, Founder and CEO of WePiggy\n\n## **About Chainlink**\n\nChainlink is the industry standard for building, accessing, and selling oracle services needed to power hybrid smart contracts on any blockchain. Chainlink oracle networks provide smart contracts with a way to reliably connect to any external API and leverage secure off-chain computations for enabling feature-rich applications. Chainlink currently secures tens of billions of dollars across DeFi, insurance, gaming, and other major industries, and offers global enterprises and leading data providers a universal gateway to all blockchains.\n\nLearn more about Chainlink by visiting [chain.link](https://chain.link/) or read the documentation at [docs.chain.link](http://docs.chain.link/).

{"id": "n-OcEuxdBuuCxGrZPdXJcIUmF0d_A2dh6QaR0oyVoMQ", "title": "Consensus", "body": "*In nomine Satoshi, habemus fide. \n In nomine Codex Sancti, et noli vendere.* * \n - The Hodler's Prayer*\n\n*The miracle of fiat was granted but once to Prophet Satoshi. The Prophet blessed the world with 21 million coins, to be allocated and held by the righteous. To be scorned and sold by the damned. \n - Teachings of Saint Kevin, Anno Satoshi 15*\n\n*And though the demons of government fiat had been struck down. Satoshi looked upon the world and still wept, for the Prophet's followers had blasphemed by creating false coins in Bitcoin's image. Thus, the Holy Church was formed to ensure purity in value, for there is only value in the pure. \n - The Holy Ledger of the Orthodox Church of Bitcoin*\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\nBrother Vikram coughed as the dust overwhelmed him after he unsealed the heavy stone door to the sanctus sanctorum. Lamp raised high, he made his way into the cold and darkness of the Saint’s home. The Feast of Saint Carter Tang and the accompanying 21 days of Private Key Veneration began tomorrow, and Brother Vikram had come for the holy reliquary.\n\nUnlike the grand orders of Saint Winklevii or Saint Draper, the Order of Saint Carter Tang was a modest one - as befit the modest holdings and life of the Saint. Saint Tang sold his earthly possessions to join the Holy Crusade of Bitcoin in Anno Satoshi 10. And unlike the blessed evangelists, he lived as a hermit, spending his days drinking naught by Soylent and tending the Holy Blockchain. In Anno Satoshi 256, the Abbey was consecrated when the Holy Church saw fit to finally canonize Saint Tang for the purity of his earthly devotion to the Holy Coin. The Brothers of Saint Tang lived mendicant lives to this day in honor of their namesake's devotion - wearing nothing but coarse-cloth hoodies and drinking sacred Soylent for nourishment.\n\nBrother Vikram did not mind the harsh life, for he was content in his service to the Holy Church and Holy Coin. And he was dutifully honored and humbled to have been chosen by the Abbot for this most sacred of tasks.\n\nAs per tradition, he was to retrieve the reliquary from the Saint's old home for the Feast and Veneration. The reliquary contained an ancient hard drive that held the private key to the Saint's very own wallet of 10 Bitcoins. The more superstitious townsfolk would flock to the Abbey, lining up to gaze upon the lockbox under the belief that it could cure the sick and strengthen the weak. This idolatry was officially condemned by the Church as the veneration of private keys was uncomfortably close to the sin of valuing the physical over the digital, but the monks of St. Tang made no serious effort to combat this belief. The Abbey knew the lives of the common people were hard, and that this sin was minor compared to the virtues of strengthening their faith in the Holy Coin.\n\nBrother Vikram peered through the dark and cluttered room and spotted the reliquary beside the Sanctus Computatrum. He was not an uneducated peasant, but even he could not help being overwhelmed by the sight. Moved by devotion, he placed the lamp down and prostrated in front of the reliquary while reciting the Hodler's prayer. After he had collected himself and prepared to rise, he saw his lamplight illuminate several papers underneath one of the Saint's cabinets.\n\n\"Holy writings by the Saint! There aren't supposed to be anymore left!\" Brother Vikram thought as he spied the papers.\n\nHe knew he was only supposed to retrieve the holy reliquary and leave the Saint's home undisturbed, but... the thought of undiscovered writings by Saint Tang.... no, he had to see them.\n\nReaching under the cabinet, he carefully took hold of the brittle yellowing papers.\n\nTaking a calming breath and thanking the Prophet Satoshi for granting him this blessed miracle, he began to read.\n\nHis face contorted in confusion as he saw, “Account Statement - JPMorgan Chase”, in fading black type on the first sheet.\n\nBrother Bikram’s confusion gave way to shock and horror as he read on.\n\n\"No, no ... it can't be....\"\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\n\"These records... I can scarcely bring myself to say what they reveal. Saint. Tang... a financier, a trader... a purveyor of the lies of government fiat? Selling the Holy Coin to live a life of decadence? No, no, no... they must have been forged somehow! It must be the Apostate Etherumites who planted these documents. They've come back! I've always known Brother Josiah was soft-hearted in his suppression of the heretics - the Holy Inquisition dev-list must be informed, we must round the townsfolk and -\"\n\n\"They were not planted\", the Abbot said quietly as he stared out the chamber's windows.\n\nBrother Vikram was stunned.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nSighing, the Abbot turned to Brother Vikram and calmly explained, \"I said they were not planted. This... unpleasantness has been known to us at Saint Tang's for many years\".\n\n\"You - you knew?\"\n\n\"Yes, a few of the Elder Brothers know the true history as well. It is quite unfortunate you found those documents.\"\n\n\"But we must reveal the truth - \"\n\nThe Abbot held up a hand to stop Brother Vikram.\n\n\"Think of the good the Abbey does. We teach the virtues of hodling and stamp down on blasphemers attempting to debase the Holy Coin. Common knowledge of the sins of Saint Tang would be... disastrous - for not only our Order but for our Holy Church as well.\"\n\nBrother Vikram could not believe what he was hearing. His wise Abbot was consoling a cover-up?\n\n\"Abbot, I - I cannot condone this. As the Church teaches, the truth is paramount - this is the sacred motivation for the Holy Blockchain. I - I must report this to the Inquisition... I - I will report this to the Inquisition.\"\n\nThe Abbot looked sadly at Brother Vikram.\n\n\"There is no need to summon the Inquisition.\"\n\n\"Abbot, I appreciate all you have done for me and the Abbey, but I must inform them of this. As Prophet Satoshi said...\"\n\nThe door to the chamber opened, and four red-hoodied Inquisitors stepped in.\n\nThe Abbot spoke quietly, \"I'm sorry Brother Vikram, you forget that the Prophet Satoshi also said that the truth of the Holy Blockchain is held through consensus...\"\n\nBrother Vikram heard an Inquisitor behind him unsheathe a dagger.\n\n\"... And we cannot let you break consensus.\"", "timestamp": 1636682165, "digest": "RQXtIbt0I7MN2VKH5HgiSRI-YrssYWH6sXsxJMe4PE4", "contributor": "0xfFD12A75a46D8153F369178b68Dd72429E89256f"}

It certainly feels like we are in the midst of a technological and cultural movement and at the forefront of something truly big.\n\nUltimately, everyone will explore and enter the Web3 ecosystem in their own way.

In the past year, many community DAOs have risen to prominence, ranging from [digitally native social clubs](https://www.fwb.help/) to [NFT curator groups](https://flamingodao.xyz/) to [professional guilds](https://www.lexdao.coop/) (for more on DAOs, check out this great [beginners’ guide](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o) by Linda Xie).\n\nWhile I am still learning along my Web3 journey, I wanted to share some of my early thoughts on DAOs and why I am so excited about them from a community perspective.\n\n### The DAO boom\n\nDAOs have grown rapidly in the past year — there are now 1.3M DAO members globally, and DAOs manage over $14B in assets. Dan Wu coined the term “[DAO boom](https://mirror.xyz/danwu.eth/tshaD9QvkFLl8iLmzZjZ3g-0IcWWUY7App6SHTg5wDY)” to describe this explosion of the DAO ecosystem.\n\n![Source: Deep DAO (November 7, 2021)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*DQ5H5oD21Ek1ZaJX0209Bg.png)\n\nFundamentally, the growth of DAOs has been driven by many of the same tailwinds that Web2 communities are experiencing. Amid [rising loneliness](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2021/01/feature-the-loneliness-pandemic), people are increasingly searching for connection within digital communities — a trend that was only accelerated by pandemic lockdowns. On top of this, people are dramatically [rethinking their relationship with work](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1007914455/as-the-pandemic-recedes-millions-of-workers-are-saying-i-quit) and consumer adoption of crypto is accelerating — all of which is driving more people into DAOs.\n\nDAOs are not just another use case of Ethereum — they are organizations that give users a home to explore the entire Web3 ecosystem. Packy McCormick wrote in [The Dao of DAOs](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos-5b9): “If blockchains, NFTs, smart contracts, DeFi protocols, and DApps are the what, DAOs are the how.”\n\n![Source: Aaron Wright (@awrigh01)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*-GmAouO9JHLKXJgx)\n\nThe same forces that make Web2 communities so powerful (network effects, organic growth, collective wisdom, etc.) are the reason DAOs will ultimately play such a big role in Web3 discovery, exploration, and creation.\n\n## Web2 vs. Web3 communities\n\nIn the context of Web2, I generally thought about two types of organizations:\n\n1. **Community-led businesses**: Companies that invest in their community as an important moat or asset to the business, but make money from a separate product or service\n2. **Communities as businesses**: Communities that are expanding their monetization (i.e., paid communities), creating business models around community as the product\n\nWith Web3, DAOs combine the best of both constructs. They are communities at their core, so building a successful community is a first priority of the organization (unlike in traditional companies, where community can be one of many priorities). They also have a sustainable businesses model built-in because tokenization unlocks a multitude of potential revenue streams.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*N7URm25jGhmiA5InutHeMw.png)\n\nDavid Spinks wrote a great Twitter thread on [how DAOs solve important community problems](https://twitter.com/davidspinks/status/1455548391744700431), including contribution compensation (DAO members get financial upside for creating more value for the community), member decision-making (DAO members have real influence through voting), and measuring community value (the value of the DAO is reflected in the value of the token).\n\nAs I thought about all of the other challenges facing Web2 community builders, I really got excited about the potential of DAOs:\n\n* **Monetization** — Monetizing is a huge challenge for Web2 communities (creators still rely on brand deals and ads for [80%+ of their income](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-influencers-make-money-poparazzi-pops-to-the-top)) and requires a different skill set than building a community. With DAOs, every community member can earn through the value of their membership tokens. DAO monetization is still in its early days, but there are already many [widely used strategies](https://p.mirror.xyz/cVN3KOss0uqpZwxHQKtC4Syvn1RfXaxofFKHJuKLWS4), including NFT drops, membership fees, and token investments. This enables niche communities to become real businesses that earn income.\n* **Membership** — Web2 communities often struggle to define who is a member vs. a follower or subscriber (the age old community vs. audience debate). This ambiguity around membership makes it difficult for community builders to understand and serve their core communities. With DAOs, membership (and ownership) is measured in tokens, which gives members access to gated content, voting rights, etc. and a clear way for DAOs to think about their core membership.\n* **Scalability** — Community builders think a lot about how to maintain the quality and sense of intimacy of a community as it grows. I think this will be a challenge across both Web2 and Web3 communities, but the concept of working groups in DAOs helps with scalability. Within a working group, active contributors can make decisions within a specific purview, which means that groups of members can stay highly engaged and have clear impact even as the broader community scales.\n* **Engagement** — Many Web2 community leaders have talked about the concept of a “Dunbar’s numbers for communities” —that is, there are only so many communities that each person can meaningfully engage in. As a result, many communities have to invest significant resources and put in active effort (content, events, etc.) to keep their members engaged. With DAOs, members who hold tokens should be financially incentivized to contribute to the community on an ongoing basis.\n* **Data** — Web2 community data often lives in siloes, and entity resolution is difficult as members may use various aliases (names, email addresses, etc.) across different platforms. With Web3, digital identity is tied to a user’s wallet, which serves as their username and login to every platform, including DAOs. This (along with open-source data) should enable DAO leaders to have much greater data visibility across their communities.\n\nClearly, many of the advantages of DAOs stem from the promise of ownership, which blockchain enables. This is why many have called DAOs the [next evolution in online communities](http://next%20evolution%20in%20online%20communities).\n\n## Observations and opportunities\n\nWith the explosion of DAOs, [dozens of tools](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/organization-legos-the-state-of-dao-tooling-866b6879e93e) have already emerged to serve their growing needs. While it is true that DAO tooling is [nascent and insufficient](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze/status/1442674731627466753) today, I have been struck by how quickly DAO platforms have emerged.\n\nWith Web2, community operating systems like [Commsor](https://commsor.com/), [Orbit](https://orbit.love/), and [Common Room](https://www.commonroom.io/) came about to solve the data and workflow problems that already existed in the community tech stack and to coordinate across hundreds of existing point solutions. In contrast, even in the earliest days of DAOs, there are already many operating systems available ([Aragon](https://aragon.org/), [DAOstack](https://daostack.io/), [Colony](https://colony.io/), [Syndicate](https://syndicate.io/), and [Orca](http://orcaprotocol.org/), to name a few). This is no doubt because DAOs require plenty of complex infrastructure (on-chain governance, treasury management, compensation, etc.) in order to launch compared to Web2 communities, which can develop more organically and with less technical involvement. In any case, these DAO operating systems have become the central platforms for DAOs, which would imply that the ecosystem of DAO tools that is emerging should have a strong foundation to plug into.\n\n[https://twitter.com/JulzRoze/status/1452614226502107138](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze/status/1452614226502107138)\n\nOne thing that DAOs have in common with Web2 communities is that each community has its own unique goals and needs. Consequently, there is no one-size-fits-all solution that will work for every community. As noted in the Tweet above, modularity will be critical for DAO infrastructure long-term. Like Web2 communities, DAOs must be able to plug and play different solutions over time as their needs evolve. Given the existence of robust operating systems today, this type of flexible ecosystem should be very viable for DAOs.\n\nWhat seems to be a big gap right now between Web2 and Web3 communities is thinking about the end-to-end member journey. There is loads of friction throughout the process of joining a DAO. For new Web3 users, some of this friction comes from just setting up their basics (wallet, ENS domain, etc.) and getting educated on Web3 in general. But even for existing Web3 users, joining a DAO is a difficult and confusing journey. From my own experience, lack of context seems to be a major problem (i.e., what is this DAO and why should I join?).\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1443697228737138690](https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1443697228737138690)\n\nThere is a lot of opportunity for DAOs to implement some of the best practices that Web2 communities are already doing around onboarding, cohort-based learning, member management and connection, content production and delivery, etc. — all of which makes joining a community more approachable and more fun.\n\nAs the DAO ecosystem matures, not all DAOs will find product-market fit. Right now, there is a lot of hype around DAOs, but every DAO will need to build a sustainable community in the long run — especially as competition for high quality members increases. To that end, there is a huge opportunity to [bring Web2 community leaders into Web3](https://twitter.com/davidspinks/status/1455401264968200194) (which may also become inevitable as more Web2 communities turn into DAOs).\n\nFinal thoughts — I think DAOs are an incredibly powerful way of bringing people into the Web3 ecosystem. People are more willing to explore new things when they are a part of a community, and that is exactly what DAOs promise. I am incredibly excited to continue to exploring the space as DAOs become the online communities of the future.\n\n\n---\n\nI am still learning and building my knowledge and network in Web3, and I would welcome the opportunity to connect with more people in the space.

If you live in New York like I do, you may have noticed that the city was absolutely buzzing with activity (read: [parties](https://twitter.com/lisaaxu/status/1456101000801046529)) last week around [NFT.NYC](https://www.nft.nyc/). It certainly feels like we are in the midst of a technological and cultural movement and at the forefront of something truly big.\n\nUltimately, everyone will explore and enter the Web3 ecosystem in their own way. For me, what has been most fascinating in Web3 has been the communities. Earlier this year I wrote about the importance of [community teams and software in the modern enterprise](https://lisamxu.medium.com/the-rise-of-the-community-department-232d427de65f), as well as the opportunity for [infrastructure to democratize digital community building](https://lisamxu.medium.com/the-next-generation-of-community-infrastructure-f9fc04031a9c).\n\nIn the context of Web3, communities are decentralized and they have a name: DAOs. DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and they are communities that are hosted on the blockchain and collectively owned by their members. In the past year, many community DAOs have risen to prominence, ranging from [digitally native social clubs](https://www.fwb.help/) to [NFT curator groups](https://flamingodao.xyz/) to [professional guilds](https://www.lexdao.coop/) (for more on DAOs, check out this great [beginners’ guide](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o) by Linda Xie).\n\nWhile I am still learning along my Web3 journey, I wanted to share some of my early thoughts on DAOs and why I am so excited about them from a community perspective.\n\n### The DAO boom\n\nDAOs have grown rapidly in the past year — there are now 1.3M DAO members globally, and DAOs manage over $14B in assets. Dan Wu coined the term “[DAO boom](https://mirror.xyz/danwu.eth/tshaD9QvkFLl8iLmzZjZ3g-0IcWWUY7App6SHTg5wDY)” to describe this explosion of the DAO ecosystem.\n\n![Source: Deep DAO (November 7, 2021)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*DQ5H5oD21Ek1ZaJX0209Bg.png)\n\nFundamentally, the growth of DAOs has been driven by many of the same tailwinds that Web2 communities are experiencing. Amid [rising loneliness](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2021/01/feature-the-loneliness-pandemic), people are increasingly searching for connection within digital communities — a trend that was only accelerated by pandemic lockdowns. On top of this, people are dramatically [rethinking their relationship with work](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1007914455/as-the-pandemic-recedes-millions-of-workers-are-saying-i-quit) and consumer adoption of crypto is accelerating — all of which is driving more people into DAOs.\n\nDAOs are not just another use case of Ethereum — they are organizations that give users a home to explore the entire Web3 ecosystem. Packy McCormick wrote in [The Dao of DAOs](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos-5b9): “If blockchains, NFTs, smart contracts, DeFi protocols, and DApps are the what, DAOs are the how.”\n\n![Source: Aaron Wright (@awrigh01)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*-GmAouO9JHLKXJgx)\n\nThe same forces that make Web2 communities so powerful (network effects, organic growth, collective wisdom, etc.) are the reason DAOs will ultimately play such a big role in Web3 discovery, exploration, and creation.\n\n## Web2 vs. Web3 communities\n\nIn the context of Web2, I generally thought about two types of organizations:\n\n1. **Community-led businesses**: Companies that invest in their community as an important moat or asset to the business, but make money from a separate product or service\n2. **Communities as businesses**: Communities that are expanding their monetization (i.e., paid communities), creating business models around community as the product\n\nWith Web3, DAOs combine the best of both constructs. They are communities at their core, so building a successful community is a first priority of the organization (unlike in traditional companies, where community can be one of many priorities). They also have a sustainable businesses model built-in because tokenization unlocks a multitude of potential revenue streams.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*N7URm25jGhmiA5InutHeMw.png)\n\nDavid Spinks wrote a great Twitter thread on [how DAOs solve important community problems](https://twitter.com/davidspinks/status/1455548391744700431), including contribution compensation (DAO members get financial upside for creating more value for the community), member decision-making (DAO members have real influence through voting), and measuring community value (the value of the DAO is reflected in the value of the token).\n\nAs I thought about all of the other challenges facing Web2 community builders, I really got excited about the potential of DAOs:\n\n* **Monetization** — Monetizing is a huge challenge for Web2 communities (creators still rely on brand deals and ads for [80%+ of their income](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-influencers-make-money-poparazzi-pops-to-the-top)) and requires a different skill set than building a community. With DAOs, every community member can earn through the value of their membership tokens. DAO monetization is still in its early days, but there are already many [widely used strategies](https://p.mirror.xyz/cVN3KOss0uqpZwxHQKtC4Syvn1RfXaxofFKHJuKLWS4), including NFT drops, membership fees, and token investments. This enables niche communities to become real businesses that earn income.\n* **Membership** — Web2 communities often struggle to define who is a member vs. a follower or subscriber (the age old community vs. audience debate). This ambiguity around membership makes it difficult for community builders to understand and serve their core communities. With DAOs, membership (and ownership) is measured in tokens, which gives members access to gated content, voting rights, etc. and a clear way for DAOs to think about their core membership.\n* **Scalability** — Community builders think a lot about how to maintain the quality and sense of intimacy of a community as it grows. I think this will be a challenge across both Web2 and Web3 communities, but the concept of working groups in DAOs helps with scalability. Within a working group, active contributors can make decisions within a specific purview, which means that groups of members can stay highly engaged and have clear impact even as the broader community scales.\n* **Engagement** — Many Web2 community leaders have talked about the concept of a “Dunbar’s numbers for communities” —that is, there are only so many communities that each person can meaningfully engage in. As a result, many communities have to invest significant resources and put in active effort (content, events, etc.) to keep their members engaged. With DAOs, members who hold tokens should be financially incentivized to contribute to the community on an ongoing basis.\n* **Data** — Web2 community data often lives in siloes, and entity resolution is difficult as members may use various aliases (names, email addresses, etc.) across different platforms. With Web3, digital identity is tied to a user’s wallet, which serves as their username and login to every platform, including DAOs. This (along with open-source data) should enable DAO leaders to have much greater data visibility across their communities.\n\nClearly, many of the advantages of DAOs stem from the promise of ownership, which blockchain enables. This is why many have called DAOs the [next evolution in online communities](http://next%20evolution%20in%20online%20communities).\n\n## Observations and opportunities\n\nWith the explosion of DAOs, [dozens of tools](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/organization-legos-the-state-of-dao-tooling-866b6879e93e) have already emerged to serve their growing needs. While it is true that DAO tooling is [nascent and insufficient](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze/status/1442674731627466753) today, I have been struck by how quickly DAO platforms have emerged.\n\nWith Web2, community operating systems like [Commsor](https://commsor.com/), [Orbit](https://orbit.love/), and [Common Room](https://www.commonroom.io/) came about to solve the data and workflow problems that already existed in the community tech stack and to coordinate across hundreds of existing point solutions. In contrast, even in the earliest days of DAOs, there are already many operating systems available ([Aragon](https://aragon.org/), [DAOstack](https://daostack.io/), [Colony](https://colony.io/), [Syndicate](https://syndicate.io/), and [Orca](http://orcaprotocol.org/), to name a few). This is no doubt because DAOs require plenty of complex infrastructure (on-chain governance, treasury management, compensation, etc.) in order to launch compared to Web2 communities, which can develop more organically and with less technical involvement. In any case, these DAO operating systems have become the central platforms for DAOs, which would imply that the ecosystem of DAO tools that is emerging should have a strong foundation to plug into.\n\n[https://twitter.com/JulzRoze/status/1452614226502107138](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze/status/1452614226502107138)\n\nOne thing that DAOs have in common with Web2 communities is that each community has its own unique goals and needs. Consequently, there is no one-size-fits-all solution that will work for every community. As noted in the Tweet above, modularity will be critical for DAO infrastructure long-term. Like Web2 communities, DAOs must be able to plug and play different solutions over time as their needs evolve. Given the existence of robust operating systems today, this type of flexible ecosystem should be very viable for DAOs.\n\nWhat seems to be a big gap right now between Web2 and Web3 communities is thinking about the end-to-end member journey. There is loads of friction throughout the process of joining a DAO. For new Web3 users, some of this friction comes from just setting up their basics (wallet, ENS domain, etc.) and getting educated on Web3 in general. But even for existing Web3 users, joining a DAO is a difficult and confusing journey. From my own experience, lack of context seems to be a major problem (i.e., what is this DAO and why should I join?).\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1443697228737138690](https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1443697228737138690)\n\nThere is a lot of opportunity for DAOs to implement some of the best practices that Web2 communities are already doing around onboarding, cohort-based learning, member management and connection, content production and delivery, etc. — all of which makes joining a community more approachable and more fun.\n\nAs the DAO ecosystem matures, not all DAOs will find product-market fit. Right now, there is a lot of hype around DAOs, but every DAO will need to build a sustainable community in the long run — especially as competition for high quality members increases. To that end, there is a huge opportunity to [bring Web2 community leaders into Web3](https://twitter.com/davidspinks/status/1455401264968200194) (which may also become inevitable as more Web2 communities turn into DAOs).\n\nFinal thoughts — I think DAOs are an incredibly powerful way of bringing people into the Web3 ecosystem. People are more willing to explore new things when they are a part of a community, and that is exactly what DAOs promise. I am incredibly excited to continue to exploring the space as DAOs become the online communities of the future.\n\n\n---\n\nI am still learning and building my knowledge and network in Web3, and I would welcome the opportunity to connect with more people in the space.

If you live in New York like I do, you may have noticed that the city was absolutely buzzing with activity (read: [parties](https://twitter.com/lisaaxu/status/1456101000801046529)) last week around [NFT.NYC](https://www.nft.nyc/). It certainly feels like we are in the midst of a technological and cultural movement and at the forefront of something truly big.\n\nUltimately, everyone will explore and enter the Web3 ecosystem in their own way.

{"id": "Gw9NX24KhPvO425tVwxGji5d5JPGsLUd_boGjTs8GOc", "title": "Super human(超级人类4）", "body": "看着莫小兰从大厦里走出来，阿鹿赶紧把头盔带好，从大厦门口到最新款超级跑车之间有着七八米的距离，这七八米被保镖挡成人墙，在一个个脑袋的间隙里，阿鹿看见穿着白色裙子的莫小兰。\n\n柠檬推了推阿鹿说，看什么呢？人家可是这座大厦的老板娘呢？\n\n阿鹿双手握着油门扭过头来说了声，抓好了，出发。\n\n头盔里的眼泪在没被风吹干，在脸颊上留下一片晕热，不是同一个世界的人了，祝她快乐就好。\n\n时光晃过一年，坊间开始流传上层的强硬派人物开始把矛头对准了智商平庸的穷人，因为穷人浪费了太多的社会资源，交通因为穷人变的拥堵，街道因为穷人变的肮脏，治安也因为穷人变的需要更多的经费去维护，这一切本来都可以被机器人替代。\n\n时光变的很煎熬，有些人开始害怕，但是又不敢议论纷纷，在街头巷尾只能从彼此的眼神里看出恐慌，毕竟科技让一切变的透明，每个人都像被黏在蜘蛛网上的猎物，战战兢兢。\n\n柠檬每天会把家里收拾的干干净净，做菜的手艺也了得，阿鹿星光常常拿柠檬开玩笑说要请她去餐厅当主厨，柠檬总说除了你们俩有这好命，这世上再也没第三个人了，只是星光每天早上都会对着电子秤吼，老子又怕胖了。\n\n有天下班的路上，一群保安队的人拦住了阿鹿和星光，他们没有查看身份证，然后直接把星光推倒旁边的树上控制住，把阿鹿带上了车，然后把星光放了，阿鹿被封住了嘴巴和眼睛带走。\n\n在一栋阴暗的密室里，忽然间灯打开，门外站在几个黑衣服的保镖，阿鹿惊恐地大叫起来，这是哪里，我犯了什么错，你们保安队凭什么可以乱抓人？\n\n四周安静的除了回声什么也没有，门口的保安像哑巴一般一声不吭，阿鹿喊叫累了，靠在墙上，过了很久门打开了，阿鹿看着那一束光忽然间恍若隔世的感觉。\n\n莫小兰走了进来，他把白色的手套抓在手上，站在阿鹿身边说，最近会有一场城市保安队选拔，你去参加，我帮你当上城市保安。\n\n阿鹿没有缓过神来，只是机械地说，我做不了那事，我只想安安静静做个服务生。\n\n莫小兰说，要保命的话，就去做城市保安。\n\n为什么？阿鹿叫起来。\n\n莫小兰叹了口气说，你别问了，我花了这么大功夫带你来这里，就是想救你，这里很安全，没有任何监控，不像外面，你们是没有自由的，你们的一举一动都可以看得清清楚楚。\n\n阿鹿木然地站在原地。\n\n莫小兰说，我得走了，听我的话。\n\n她缓缓走到门口，停顿了一下。\n\n阿鹿说，你还好吗？\n\n她点了点头，然后消失在门外。\n\n接着那几个黑衣人重新把他的眼睛和嘴巴封住，等他听到车门打开的声音，便被人用力一推下了车，他摘掉眼罩和嘴里的软塞，到了自家的门口，走上楼的时候，星光在那里打电话，看见阿鹿回来了大吃一惊。\n\n他把电话扔在沙发上，冲过来上下打量着阿鹿说，你没事啊，那些人是城市保安队的吗？\n\n阿鹿说，明天开始我们要锻炼身体。\n\n星光跳起来摸了摸阿鹿的脑袋说，你被抓去干嘛了，变傻了？说什么胡话，觉都不够睡，谁早起谁傻子。\n\n阿鹿说，我是认真的。\n\n星光摆了摆手躺在沙发上把被子盖在脸上说，你自己锻炼去，吃错药了什么药。\n\n柠檬从外面回来，看见阿鹿说，你终于回来了，吓死我了。\n\n阿鹿说，我没事，那些人抓错人了，到保安所就把我放了。\n\n柠檬拍了拍胸口说，那就好，那就好，我以为我们这些人真的要遭殃了，看见你回来就好，最近你们俩都别加班了，早点回来，现在听人说，很多地方都敢随便辞退人了，放在以前肯定是没人敢的，现在还有人违反规定在一些基础服务行业使用机器人替代。\n\n阿鹿想了想说，柠檬，明天开始你也和我们一起运动。\n\n柠檬看着星光。\n\n星光摊了摊手说，谁知道他犯了什么病，反正我是不起来。\n\n柠檬说，我也不起来，我要睡美容觉。\n\n阿鹿斩钉截铁地说，不可以拒绝，我明早叫你们，就这样。\n\n然后他走回房间，留下柠檬和星光面面相觑。\n\n柠檬悄咪咪地走到星光身边指着阿鹿的房间说，这是怎么了？\n\n星光两只脚架在茶几上说，谁知道发什么神经，可能是被吓傻了，他每天总是愁眉苦脸，看起来活的真累。\n\n柠檬说，就你天天活的快活，是不是又去撩小姑娘了。\n\n星光说，不撩小姑娘我干嘛，活着多没意思，所以别喜欢我，我可不会负责。\n\n柠檬说，你迟早有一天会死在这里。\n\n星光哇哇哇地叫起来，好啊，女人真狠，以前喜欢的我死去活来，现在咒我死呢？\n\n柠檬哼了一声站起来，拿起桌上的牛奶喝了一大口说，我以前瞎了眼。\n\n说着转身走到自己的房间。\n\n正如莫小米所说的。\n\n忽然间保安所全城发出了招募城市保安的信息，城市保安是令人向往的职业，所以报名的人很多很多。\n\n阿鹿拉着星光和柠檬去报名，从人群里挤进去，拿了三张表格钻出来，阿鹿说，赶紧填，一定要当上城市保安。\n\n星光满脸不情愿地说，我不是当保安的料。\n\n阿鹿按住星光说，快填，别废话了，等下太阳要下去了。\n\n台上的保安拿着扩音喇叭维持秩序，填完表格，阿鹿请他们去外面加餐。\n\n走在路上，星光和柠檬追追打打，明晃晃的路灯照的树影婆娑，路边的小吃街显得落寞，现在出来吃宵夜的人很少，阿鹿推开一家店门，洁白的墙壁上投影着最新新闻，科学在迅猛地前进，只是这一切都与穷人区的人们无关，这里的人们千百年来仿佛没有进步过，依旧沿用着古老的方式生存着。\n\n这世界的法则好像是不断地在划界限，曾经因为火的发现，人类和动物之间画了一条界限，如今随着科学的迅猛发展，富人和穷人之间的界限也被深深地划出来，等有一天富人看穷人，是否会和人类看动物一样？\n\n想到这里阿鹿不禁打了一个寒颤。\n\n星光和柠檬拿着菜单点菜，星光说，阿鹿请客，我们放开了吃。于是在点菜单上大笔划了很多，柠檬抢过菜单说，你又吃不完。然后轻轻将几个贵的菜擦掉，一边擦一边说，最近房租又开始涨价了，我们要省点花钱。\n\n星光靠着椅子满不在乎地说，省钱省钱，你省一辈子买的起一个智慧芯片吗，打的起一支超级疫苗吗？你这个人怎么这么想不明白，今朝有酒今朝醉，明日愁来明日忧的道理你懂吗？\n\n柠檬略略略地吐舌头说，就你厉害，有本事喝酒的时候别要阿鹿买单啊，被人扣在酒吧多少次了？\n\n星光站起来捂住柠檬的嘴说，阿鹿都没意见，你瞎说什么，我会还的。\n\n柠檬用力推开星光，然后俯下身去吐了两口口水看着星光说，得了吧，就你。\n\n阿鹿从柠檬手上把菜单给老板，然后说，来一箱啤酒。\n\n老板接过菜单给厨房，接着搬了一箱啤酒放在他们的桌角。\n\n阿鹿拿起一瓶用牙齿咬开，给每人倒了一杯，柠檬说，我不喝酒。\n\n阿鹿说，这次得喝。\n\n柠檬看了眼阿鹿，然后没有说话，这些日子阿鹿就像那个家的大哥，虽然常常苦着脸，但很让人感到心安，星光就像个孩子，每天吵吵闹闹，不管明天地活着。\n\n菜慢慢端上来，头顶的灯光氤氲而下，外面的城市有些清冷，阿鹿喝着酒说，不管以后怎样，我们都要像兄弟姐妹一样。\n\n星光笑起来说，你一直是我们的哥啊，难道要拜个把子，哈哈哈。\n\n柠檬挥了挥手打断星光说，你别添乱。然后看着阿鹿说，怎么了，这些日子你总是奇奇怪怪的。\n\n阿鹿喝了一大口酒，然后拍了拍柠檬和星光的肩膀说，都努力先当上城市保安。\n\n老板一直靠在椅子上看着新闻发呆，厨房里的厨师坐在角落里打着瞌睡，冰冷的窗户上贴着最新优惠信息，灯箱在风里像海面上的孤灯。\n\n第二天早上，阿鹿从宿醉里醒来，走出房间的时候没有看见星光，他心里想着这家伙昨天不会又出去玩了吧，然后到隔壁去敲了敲柠檬的门，敲了很久依旧没有动静，他叫了几声还是一片安静，揉了揉有些疼的脑袋走到窗前把窗帘拉开，外面雾蒙蒙地一片，这个年代科技如此发达，对于大自然却依旧丝毫没有办法。\n\n他拿出手机打电话给星光，关机。\n\n再打给柠檬，依旧关机。\n\n这是怎么了？今天是去警察所考试的日子，两个人怎么都关机了，阿鹿努力回忆着昨晚回来的情景，三个人上了出租车，然后…….\n\n然后脑袋里是一片空白，忽然间一个想法从阿鹿的脑袋里闪过，这两个人不会是去酒店了？", "timestamp": 1636685462, "digest": "thABAFMIRkEjtmv4HZXdXsXWSTC6_QHhW0kOHdWDMMs", "contributor": "0x31c1571941298b11bECA2F61BEF50F8303D08ddF"}

{"id": "u8X03NnvgK_2x_BMxV46FkIszw9SBijHsBcxmTf7r7I", "title": "DAOs: Communities of the Future", "body": "## Some thoughts on community evolution from Web2 to Web3\n\nTo say that there has been a lot of excitement around [Web3](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-web3/) lately would be an understatement. If you live in New York like I do, you may have noticed that the city was absolutely buzzing with activity (read: [parties](https://twitter.com/lisaaxu/status/1456101000801046529)) last week around [NFT.NYC](https://www.nft.nyc/). It certainly feels like we are in the midst of a technological and cultural movement and at the forefront of something truly big.\n\nUltimately, everyone will explore and enter the Web3 ecosystem in their own way. For me, what has been most fascinating in Web3 has been the communities. Earlier this year I wrote about the importance of [community teams and software in the modern enterprise](https://lisamxu.medium.com/the-rise-of-the-community-department-232d427de65f), as well as the opportunity for [infrastructure to democratize digital community building](https://lisamxu.medium.com/the-next-generation-of-community-infrastructure-f9fc04031a9c).\n\nIn the context of Web3, communities are decentralized and they have a name: DAOs. DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and they are communities that are hosted on the blockchain and collectively owned by their members. In the past year, many community DAOs have risen to prominence, ranging from [digitally native social clubs](https://www.fwb.help/) to [NFT curator groups](https://flamingodao.xyz/) to [professional guilds](https://www.lexdao.coop/) (for more on DAOs, check out this great [beginners’ guide](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o) by Linda Xie).\n\nWhile I am still learning along my Web3 journey, I wanted to share some of my early thoughts on DAOs and why I am so excited about them from a community perspective.\n\n### The DAO boom\n\nDAOs have grown rapidly in the past year — there are now 1.3M DAO members globally, and DAOs manage over $14B in assets. Dan Wu coined the term “[DAO boom](https://mirror.xyz/danwu.eth/tshaD9QvkFLl8iLmzZjZ3g-0IcWWUY7App6SHTg5wDY)” to describe this explosion of the DAO ecosystem.\n\n![Source: Deep DAO (November 7, 2021)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*DQ5H5oD21Ek1ZaJX0209Bg.png)\n\nFundamentally, the growth of DAOs has been driven by many of the same tailwinds that Web2 communities are experiencing. Amid [rising loneliness](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2021/01/feature-the-loneliness-pandemic), people are increasingly searching for connection within digital communities — a trend that was only accelerated by pandemic lockdowns. On top of this, people are dramatically [rethinking their relationship with work](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1007914455/as-the-pandemic-recedes-millions-of-workers-are-saying-i-quit) and consumer adoption of crypto is accelerating — all of which is driving more people into DAOs.\n\nDAOs are not just another use case of Ethereum — they are organizations that give users a home to explore the entire Web3 ecosystem. Packy McCormick wrote in [The Dao of DAOs](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos-5b9): “If blockchains, NFTs, smart contracts, DeFi protocols, and DApps are the what, DAOs are the how.”\n\n![Source: Aaron Wright (@awrigh01)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*-GmAouO9JHLKXJgx)\n\nThe same forces that make Web2 communities so powerful (network effects, organic growth, collective wisdom, etc.) are the reason DAOs will ultimately play such a big role in Web3 discovery, exploration, and creation.\n\n## Web2 vs. Web3 communities\n\nIn the context of Web2, I generally thought about two types of organizations:\n\n1. **Community-led businesses**: Companies that invest in their community as an important moat or asset to the business, but make money from a separate product or service\n2. **Communities as businesses**: Communities that are expanding their monetization (i.e., paid communities), creating business models around community as the product\n\nWith Web3, DAOs combine the best of both constructs. They are communities at their core, so building a successful community is a first priority of the organization (unlike in traditional companies, where community can be one of many priorities). They also have a sustainable businesses model built-in because tokenization unlocks a multitude of potential revenue streams.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*N7URm25jGhmiA5InutHeMw.png)\n\nDavid Spinks wrote a great Twitter thread on [how DAOs solve important community problems](https://twitter.com/davidspinks/status/1455548391744700431), including contribution compensation (DAO members get financial upside for creating more value for the community), member decision-making (DAO members have real influence through voting), and measuring community value (the value of the DAO is reflected in the value of the token).\n\nAs I thought about all of the other challenges facing Web2 community builders, I really got excited about the potential of DAOs:\n\n* **Monetization** — Monetizing is a huge challenge for Web2 communities (creators still rely on brand deals and ads for [80%+ of their income](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-influencers-make-money-poparazzi-pops-to-the-top)) and requires a different skill set than building a community. With DAOs, every community member can earn through the value of their membership tokens. DAO monetization is still in its early days, but there are already many [widely used strategies](https://p.mirror.xyz/cVN3KOss0uqpZwxHQKtC4Syvn1RfXaxofFKHJuKLWS4), including NFT drops, membership fees, and token investments. This enables niche communities to become real businesses that earn income.\n* **Membership** — Web2 communities often struggle to define who is a member vs. a follower or subscriber (the age old community vs. audience debate). This ambiguity around membership makes it difficult for community builders to understand and serve their core communities. With DAOs, membership (and ownership) is measured in tokens, which gives members access to gated content, voting rights, etc. and a clear way for DAOs to think about their core membership.\n* **Scalability** — Community builders think a lot about how to maintain the quality and sense of intimacy of a community as it grows. I think this will be a challenge across both Web2 and Web3 communities, but the concept of working groups in DAOs helps with scalability. Within a working group, active contributors can make decisions within a specific purview, which means that groups of members can stay highly engaged and have clear impact even as the broader community scales.\n* **Engagement** — Many Web2 community leaders have talked about the concept of a “Dunbar’s numbers for communities” —that is, there are only so many communities that each person can meaningfully engage in. As a result, many communities have to invest significant resources and put in active effort (content, events, etc.) to keep their members engaged. With DAOs, members who hold tokens should be financially incentivized to contribute to the community on an ongoing basis.\n* **Data** — Web2 community data often lives in siloes, and entity resolution is difficult as members may use various aliases (names, email addresses, etc.) across different platforms. With Web3, digital identity is tied to a user’s wallet, which serves as their username and login to every platform, including DAOs. This (along with open-source data) should enable DAO leaders to have much greater data visibility across their communities.\n\nClearly, many of the advantages of DAOs stem from the promise of ownership, which blockchain enables. This is why many have called DAOs the [next evolution in online communities](http://next%20evolution%20in%20online%20communities).\n\n## Observations and opportunities\n\nWith the explosion of DAOs, [dozens of tools](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/organization-legos-the-state-of-dao-tooling-866b6879e93e) have already emerged to serve their growing needs. While it is true that DAO tooling is [nascent and insufficient](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze/status/1442674731627466753) today, I have been struck by how quickly DAO platforms have emerged.\n\nWith Web2, community operating systems like [Commsor](https://commsor.com/), [Orbit](https://orbit.love/), and [Common Room](https://www.commonroom.io/) came about to solve the data and workflow problems that already existed in the community tech stack and to coordinate across hundreds of existing point solutions. In contrast, even in the earliest days of DAOs, there are already many operating systems available ([Aragon](https://aragon.org/), [DAOstack](https://daostack.io/), [Colony](https://colony.io/), [Syndicate](https://syndicate.io/), and [Orca](http://orcaprotocol.org/), to name a few). This is no doubt because DAOs require plenty of complex infrastructure (on-chain governance, treasury management, compensation, etc.) in order to launch compared to Web2 communities, which can develop more organically and with less technical involvement. In any case, these DAO operating systems have become the central platforms for DAOs, which would imply that the ecosystem of DAO tools that is emerging should have a strong foundation to plug into.\n\n[https://twitter.com/JulzRoze/status/1452614226502107138](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze/status/1452614226502107138)\n\nOne thing that DAOs have in common with Web2 communities is that each community has its own unique goals and needs. Consequently, there is no one-size-fits-all solution that will work for every community. As noted in the Tweet above, modularity will be critical for DAO infrastructure long-term. Like Web2 communities, DAOs must be able to plug and play different solutions over time as their needs evolve. Given the existence of robust operating systems today, this type of flexible ecosystem should be very viable for DAOs.\n\nWhat seems to be a big gap right now between Web2 and Web3 communities is thinking about the end-to-end member journey. There is loads of friction throughout the process of joining a DAO. For new Web3 users, some of this friction comes from just setting up their basics (wallet, ENS domain, etc.) and getting educated on Web3 in general. But even for existing Web3 users, joining a DAO is a difficult and confusing journey. From my own experience, lack of context seems to be a major problem (i.e., what is this DAO and why should I join?).\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1443697228737138690](https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1443697228737138690)\n\nThere is a lot of opportunity for DAOs to implement some of the best practices that Web2 communities are already doing around onboarding, cohort-based learning, member management and connection, content production and delivery, etc. — all of which makes joining a community more approachable and more fun.\n\nAs the DAO ecosystem matures, not all DAOs will find product-market fit. Right now, there is a lot of hype around DAOs, but every DAO will need to build a sustainable community in the long run — especially as competition for high quality members increases. To that end, there is a huge opportunity to [bring Web2 community leaders into Web3](https://twitter.com/davidspinks/status/1455401264968200194) (which may also become inevitable as more Web2 communities turn into DAOs).\n\nFinal thoughts — I think DAOs are an incredibly powerful way of bringing people into the Web3 ecosystem. People are more willing to explore new things when they are a part of a community, and that is exactly what DAOs promise. I am incredibly excited to continue to exploring the space as DAOs become the online communities of the future.\n\n\n---\n\nI am still learning and building my knowledge and network in Web3, and I would welcome the opportunity to connect with more people in the space.

网能做的那些事情？面对这样的质疑，比尔盖茨都没有非常准确地回答出，什么样的模式才是真正属于互联网商业模式。\n\n我们认为区块链这样的挣扎阶段是需要有耐心和长期坚持的过程。当然我们要往前看，随着区块链技术的不断发展和演进，各种基础设施、工具、服务也在不断的完善。我们认为**区块链技术遍地开花的时候，一定是大家都已经忘记最底层的技术到底是什么****的时候**。\n\n最终我们会产生很多新的商业生态，也会摩擦出很多新的火花。我们相信未来一定是会有类似于互联网时代的Google、亚马逊这样的区块链的公司诞生出来。现阶段就是区块链企业正在努力的过程。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20211110/41ec2c674b2c4d4db7efd87bc0fa3bba_HA3TCKRWGY4A.jpeg)\\\n\n\n**胡捷**：其实我不太喜欢用“避实就虚”这种笼统的概念去描述区块链技术应用的过程。很多东西你很难说它是虚还是实。\n\n刚才几位老师都提到应用的递进过程。我们类比一下，互联网刚出来的时候，它在应用的路径上是有一个递进的关系的。\n\n最开始互联网就是做电子邮件，电子邮件可以说是虚的，可以说是实的。接下来是BBS，看起来也蛮虚的，但也可以是实的。戴尔卖电脑就在BBS上卖，原来是靠电话卖，后来就往BBS上迁移，后来做成电商。\n\n互联网再后来是信息门户，之后很快就开始出现电商和游戏。其实发邮件也可以服务于比较实在的事，比如工厂之间的沟通。\n\n再往后电商带来支付，支付再带来金融业务的线上化。再后来O2O，线上线下的配合，所谓新零售就是数据驱动的零售模式。\n\n互联网的发展一直是看上去有点虚，解决的都是信息传递。信息传递某种意义上确实有点虚。但我们的所谓实体经济也和信息的产生和传递息息相关、不可分割。\n\n我是想说，**区块链技术本身是中性的，拿它可以干很多的事情****，****一般都会从一些最容易入手的地方去做。**很难说哪些事儿是纯虚的，哪些事儿是纯实的。\n\n技术本身的发展和应用是有个过程的。我们不太必要把概念硬往上套。我更愿意从其他角度剖析区块链怎么用。\n\n我们看待技术问题，更多还要从逻辑层面讲。这个工具能解决现实生活当中的哪些问题。至于这种问题把它归成是虚的还是实的，这个问题本身就有点虚。\n\n有一个点我愿意重新提出来分享。大家刚才在讲区块链有没有杀手级应用？我觉得很多领域都可能会出现杀手级应用。比如权益的重新表达，以及在重新表达基础上的交易。我们都看到，已经冒出杀手级应用的苗头了。\n\n美国的联储行的经济学家最近做了一个报告。探讨了**区块链技术支撑之下的一些新的金融模式****对****传统金融可能带来的颠覆**。是哪个分支也不展开去讲，我想大家多少有所耳闻。\n\n我再讲一个事情。**区块链技术**很大的潜在应用和一个差异化的特点，它**能够带来协作方利益****重新****分配格局的变化**。同样一个生产，同样一个业务，如果利益攸关方、协作方相互之间生产关系做一些重新的调整，可能生产模式都会发生变化。但这一方面的潜力目前完全没发挥出来。\n\n再举个例子。比如一个电商平台，现在的终极受益者就是它的股东。但是电商平台有没有可能以某种方式与所有的卖家和所有的买家来共享平台最终的收益？包括平台的广告商、各种服务商之类的第三方利益相关者。玩家还是那些玩家，买家、卖家和各种服务商，交易的核心内容还是买卖。但是其中的利益关系可不可以重新构建？这是有很多想象空间的。\n\n这方面现在还在探索比较早期，区块链的潜力和差异化的特点还没有被充分的挖掘。如果这方面有所注意，杀手级应用有可能会一个个的出来。\n\n以上是笔记最后一部分的全部内容。\n\n[第一篇笔记在这里](https://bihu.com/article/1793157016)  [第二篇笔记点我](https://bihu.com/article/1030587424)\n",

{"id": "rxOsYe3vm9uH5RMlwPBwrYBHTOKzy2o1JDHhUMVIP6w", "title": "加密笔记-CityDAO详解", "body": "## 最激进的CityDAO，为何吸引V神进入社区关注？\n\n在美国怀俄明州西北角，有一块大约40英亩（约161874平方米）的土地。从卫星地图俯瞰，土地的地势较高，周围没有什么绿色植被。\n\n11月2日，一个名为“CityDAO”的去中心化自治组织发推文宣布购买了这块土地的所有权，并且还把组织旗帜插在上面。CityDao是以太坊上一个社区区块链城市项目，于今年7月由互联网停车项目AirGarage（a16z参与投资）的联合创始人Scott正式发起成立。根据OpenSea显示，截至目前，已经有来自世界各地的1000多人通过购买社区NFT代币“citizen”成为社区一份子。特别是，V神也进入项目的Discord社区，探讨区块链城市的好处。\n\n接下来，CityDao会利用citizen对土地进行社区化建设、运营，等模式成熟之后再购买更多的土地，最终实现区块链城市的目标。过去几年，人们一直在实验区块链技术和城市结合的方案，不过大都没有与链下实体真正结合，更多是基于现有的城市基础设施，进行局部的数字化、去中心化创新。例如，区块链发票、区块链产权证书上链、城市区块链代币、NFT城市艺术等。像CityDAO这样买地建城，还是头一次。历史表明，大多数土地管理模式的变化都是渐进的、微小的，那些过于创新的尝试往往会失败。要想让土地资产上链，产权自由交易，然后再实现有效的DAO治理实际上并非易事。那么，CityDAO是如何解决有效的社区治理、资产上链的挑战？目前项目进展如何，是否到了可以投资的tipping piont？\n\n分层式社区\n\nCityDAO社区和大多数的项目社区有些不同，它的主要特点是分层，让社区保持去中心化的同时，又拥有相对集中的特点。理论上，持有citizenNFT即享有CityDAO社区相应的所有权，可以获得土地NFT投放，可以在土地上定居，能够对社区决策投票；同时也承担着社区责任，如土地管理、冲突解决、税收等。然而，在社区成员的组成结构上，成员的身份不是清一色的一致，而是有一定差别。CityDAO官网上展示了3种不同的citizenNFT，每一种对应一种社区身份。第一种是普通的citizen，价格为0.25ETH，总供应量为10000枚；第二种是创世citizen总供应为50枚，地板价为10ETH，第三个是第一citizen，总供应为1枚，最终销售价格为6.52ETH。三种citizenNFT都有投票权，主要区别是获取土地NFT投放顺序上。第一citizen优先获取，创世citizen次之，普通citizen最后获取。\n\n在治理方面，CityDAO核心特点是二元，由社区DAO和投资者DAO构成。社区DAO是第一级的治理主体，由普通投资者和对社区有价值的贡献者组成，管理并决定土地的使用和购买，不直接参与项目具体管理、执行。当决定具体社区事物时，每一个社区成员的投票权并不一样，而是根据社区活跃程度进行分配，经常参与社区投票的成员投票权重会高，不活跃的成员投票权会下降。如此，就把普通的社区成员和积极的社区成员进行区分，吸引能够给社区带来价值的群体。投资者DAO是次一级的治理主体，由社区DAO投票选举出99个合格投资者组成，负责具体管理事物，执行投票通过的提案。比如，社区DAO通过购买怀俄明州土地的提案，一个投资者DAO和有限责任公司就会成立，利用社区资金实现这个提案。\n\n所有权方面，允许合格投资者投资投资者DAO，一个合格投资者最多可以享有10%的社区所有权。如此，投资者DAO的内部权力也进行了权重区分，提升了投资决策的效率。另外，该投资者DAO还能以社区DAO投票权形式获得回报，随着时间推移，有机会拥有社区DAO更多的话语权。还有更多的细节就不在文章中阐述，感兴趣的读者可以参看此链接。总之，围绕社区治理高效化，CityDAO借鉴了物理社区已有的治理思路，进行了多方面的分层创新，以促使社区力量更加凝聚，治理更加高效。社区化资产上链当前，市场上有不少团队在尝试解决大规模资产上链的问题，但是还没有看到特别成功的案例。一方面是传统系统与区块链系统之间缺乏互操作性，监管也缺乏清晰度；另一方面，项目产品也没有和市场产生契合，大多时候是项目方单方面假设市场存在需求。\n\n拿unisocks产权交易为例，虽然链上可以证明unisocks代币交易了，可链下的实体袜子有没有被交易很难知晓。人们还是需要一个链下的信任中介去证明，这无疑抬高了交易成本。另外，像unisocks这类单一物品产权毕竟价值很小，很难吸引市场持续交易。涉及到土地产权交易就更加复杂，除了要解决地域限制，还需要中介支持、需要大量资金、需要法律制度的完善等。2021年7月1日，怀俄明州DAO有限责任公司（DAOllc）法案生效，这让CityDAO看见了机会。\n\n根据法案：“除非组织章程或运营协议中另有规定，否则去中心化自治组织的管理应归属于其成员（如果由成员管理）或智能合约（如果通过算法管理）（第 11 页）。”DAO和智能合约得到法律上的认可，DAO社区成员可以免除诉讼，资产上链项目可以在怀俄明州注册成一个DAO公司，通过法律协议将DAO 公司分成许多部分、代币化，规定代币持有者为该公司的成员，这种通过产权股份化的方式，实现资产上链的方式，绕开了资产可转让性、投资期限、合法所有权等方面的一些限制。\n\nCityDAO的方式更巧妙。它先根据怀俄明州的法案注册成DAO，它没有任何资产，可以理解为一个空壳公司。然后通过发行销售citizenNFT众筹资金，最后再购买土地资产。根据CityDAO财政库钱包地址显示，有约529ETH、113600USDC、4967BACON，这些资产当前总市值为约为252万美元。行业对于资产上链通常思路是，先确定资产，再想办法上链。CityDAO则绕开了这个思路，先描绘一个未来愿景，通过众筹确定组织群体，再确定要上链的资产。再以前面提到的unisocks为例，在这种模式下，CityDAO只要购买unisocks全部资产，社区代币就代表unisocks的所有权。对于看好unisocks的投资者来说，他可以购买一部分社区代币。如此，就实现了资产权益的转移，而不必再用信任中介来证明。\n\nCityDAO项目发展路线图这种社区化模式很好地化解了资产上链的阻碍，解决了资产与市场需求的难点。但是，与此同时也让投资者承担了更多来自社区的不确定性。未来并非坦途现在来看，CityDAO围绕社区治理和资产上链进行了创新，似乎未来十分有前景。可仔细观察，项目未来发展或许并非坦途。\n\n拿治理来说，CityDAO实际表现并不理想，显示出低效、处于摸索的状态。可能是CityDAO缺少专业土地运营管理的人才，社区对土地购买、土地利用的规划并不清晰，基本是临时讨论，走一步看一步。例如，9月份讨论购买第一块土地时，社区选择两个交通便利，面积相对较大，可以容纳各种用途的土地。比如，开发成一个户外旅游的场所，可以让停房车，让人们露营，参与狩猎。然而，这个想法最后被推翻，理由是没有考虑到水源问题。那个地方每年降雨量只有6-10英寸，如此少的降水量，很难发展建设，更不用提建设新的区块链城市了。到了10月份，社区成员还想以3000ETH在怀俄明州购买一处大牧场，但是，社区并没有想清楚买牧场做什么。而且，就目前的社区仅有的几百个ETH，还远远不支持购买牧场。最后，该方案也被社区放弃。社区购买的第一个地块的基础条件也不好，没有什么自然资源，交通位置也不方便，周围大部分是土丘，很荒凉。虽然这一次有了水源，而且还有了电，但是，只有一口井。根据现场照片，那里没有什么植被，未来如果开发起来，水源可能依然是一个问题。至于下一步要怎么利用土地，怎么解决开发建设所需的大量资金，社区也没有明确的规划，还在讨论当中。\n\n另外，围绕区块链的法律制度刚起步，还有需要完善的地方。怀俄明州的DAO法案解决了注册成实体的的问题，涉及DAO发币融资、税收、产权交易等还需要更加明晰的指导。也就是说，CityDAO即使获得一块基础条件优良的土地，前期发展顺利，后面也会遇到一些法律制度上的挑战。例如，OpenSea曾因为CityDAO的NFT代币涉及土地资产把其下架了，后来找到了OpenSea内部才得以重新上架。\n\n还有，尽管每一个社区成员都有机会选举为合格投资者，但是，根据美国证券法案只有真正获得法律认可的合格投资者才能购买土地。来自他国的CityDAO的成员几乎不可能进入投资者DAO社区，参与具体的资产管理。那么，按照其社区治理规则，理论上他国投资者会随着时间推移，社区所有权逐步降低。\n\n“数字化、去中心化并不会突然改善一个系统的治理和运营方式，带来的影响可能是渐进的，逐步减少限制。”一位评论者如是说道。对此，CityDAO不以为然，发推文表示，就像信息的数字化让教育民主，让普通民众也能获得过去富人才能享有的教育。CityDAO今后前景到底如何，在想象张力和西部狂野属性兼具的区块链世界下定论还为时过早。但不管怎样，CityDAO向大家呈现了人与土地，人与城市的一种新的未来可能关系。 \n\n转载：PANews", "timestamp": 1636689666, "digest": "UQd_ZoHFq4kSnln2DQWdBFnFIYFvt8Kcmz13ky1ro0M", "contributor": "0x2AaA51943Ed1A78678f0Bd2f414Dd9913d339516"}

{"id": "PT_gP9_4bZjCIMV9KS0TRx5rusEOkke9WRKY5ZwHFvg", "title": "MARTIAL GOD ASURA（Chapter 2 ：Beauty Elder）", "body": "Chu Feng wasn't really from the Chu family. He was an adopted son by “Chu Yuan”, the fifth oldest in the Chu family.\n\nThat caused Chu Feng to be pushed aside and to be humiliated at a small age. If it wasn’t for Chu Yuan’s protection, he would have already been kicked out of the Chu family. Because of that, Chu Feng was very thankful towards Chu Yuan, and swore to become the pride of Chu Yuan and to win back some honor.\n\nFive years ago, Chu Feng was exactly ten years old and it was the best age to train in the martial arts.\n\nThe him at that time had many expectations for training, because he felt that the time to prove himself had arrived.\n\nHowever, he never would have thought after entering the Azure Dragon School for one month, lightning would strike his body and enter his dantian.\n\nAt first, Chu Feng even thought it was good luck, because when he started training, his speed of improvement was astonis.h.i.+ng. In two short months, he arrived at the 2nd level of the Spirit realm.\n\nThat speed was completely abnormal, and because of that, Chu Feng didn’t dare to tell it to anyone so he hid his strength and continued training.\n\nBut the good scene did not last long. Just as Chu Feng thought he became a genius, change happened within his body.\n\nBecause of that change, it made it so his cultivation stopped and did not move forward, and he was labeled to have the most horrible talent of a lifetime.\n\n\\*bzz\\*\n\nAt that time, the Saint Spirit Gra.s.s in Chu Feng’s hands was being refined and absorbed by his dantain.\n\nHis refining speed was extremely fast and it exceeded common sense. Normally, with Chu Feng’s strength, it would take at least one month to refine the Saint Spirit Gra.s.s.\n\nHowever, looking at it now, it was already half-way refined just after a short while, and Chu Feng’s dantian that felt like a never-ending cave also had a feeling of being full.\n\n\\*bzz\\* Suddenly, light floated over Chu Feng’s hand and the other half of the Saint Spirit Gra.s.s instantly disappeared.\n\nAlso, at the same time, everything changed in Chu Feng’s dantian.\n\nThe nine lightning beasts interwove with each other. It was hurriedly moving, and it was actually condensing. Finally, it turned into a pill-like object.\n\nAfter the pill formed itself, endless spiritual energy surged out from it like a tide was.h.i.+ng Chu Feng’s body. Very soonly, it permeated through his entire body.\n\n\\*whoosh\\*\n\nChu Feng suddenly opened his eyes, and there were traces of lightning in them! An indescribable expression hung on his face.\n\n“I succeeded. After five years, I finally succeeded.” Chu Feng was incomparably joyful. He jumped down from the bed, and as he walked around, he sized up his body.\n\nIn the journey of martial cultivation, the known realms were the following:\n\nSpirit, Origin, Profound, and Heaven. Those were the four big realms, and every realm was divided into nine levels.\n\nThe 1st level of the Spirit realm. The main point of it was to train the physical body with special methods, and to increase strength.\n\nBut after reaching the 2nd level of the Spirit realm, one must use ways to condense spiritual energy. Only people who successfully condensed their spiritual energy in their dantian could truly start their path in martial cultivation.\n\nChu Feng’s body changed and it made it unable to condense spiritual energy. The Divine Lightning in his dantian were like nine hungry wild beasts. The spiritual energy that Chu Feng condensed would always be engulfed by that Divine Lightning.\n\nBut he didn’t give up. It was because he found out that although the Divine Lightning did engulf his spiritual energy, there was a limit. As long as he kept on providing spiritual energy towards his dantian, he could fill it up one day.\n\nAnd today, he finally succeeded.\n\n“This is a really strong feeling. Endless amounts of spiritual energy is surging into my body, as though it was going to break through my body.”\n\nThis feeling was inconceivable to Chu Feng. He never would have thought that the Divine Lightning would directly condense into a pill and occupy a place in the dantian. The spiritual energy that the Divine Lightning was giving off was very dense and it was beyond imagination.\n\nHe knew that even with his five years of non-stop cultivation, he could not condense such strong spiritual energy. The reason why he could was because of that Divine Lightning.\n\n\\*bzz\\* But just at that time, Chu Feng’s body suddenly became stiff, and his expression also changed greatly.\n\nThe Divine Lightning was changing. His power instantly increased by several times, and he suddenly broke through again and stepped into the 4th level of the Spirit realm.\n\n“Have the hard times stopped and the good times come?”\n\nChu Feng tightly clenched his fist and he felt that the explosive power in his body was worth his five years of suffering.\n\nSuddenly continuously breaking through two levels, the unexplainable method of becoming strong finally returned.\n\nHe used a severe gaze to look towards the direction of the inner court and muttered, “Chu Zhen, I’ll be taking your Saint Spirit Grass.”\n\nThe Azure Dragon School’s disciple recruitment only happened once a year and every time, it lasted for ten days.\n\nAfter ten days, the annual inner disciple exam would start. This time, Chu Feng who had been silent for five years would also participate.\n\nThe exam location was a huge underground palace. Within the main hall of the underground palace, the number of people were like oceans and mountains and there were most likely over ten thousand people.\n\nMost of the people there were at the 3rd level of the Spirit realm because everyone knew that the inner disciple exam required one to be at least in the 3rd level to pa.s.s.\n\nHowever, there was also a small portion of disciples at the 2nd level and they wanted to try to pa.s.s it within the confusion. There were people like that every year, but most of them ended with failures.\n\nThe thing worth mentioning though, was that there were also a small portion of 4th levels there. They were not mediocre people who trained slow, and in fact, some of them were even geniuses.\n\nThey intentionally waited until they were at the 4th level of the Spirit realm before partic.i.p.ating in the inner disciple exam. The reason? For the reward.\n\nWhen one reached the 3rd level, they could start training martial skills.\n\nMartial skills were very strong attacking methods. Not only could they thoroughly display strength, they could also make people gain power that exceeded the limits of their body.\n\nBecause of that, martial skills were very precious, and even the rich and powerful families that has been existing for generations didn’t have them. That was the reason why all sorts of families had to send their young generations into various schools for cultivation.\n\nIn every school, there were a large amount of martial skills, and within the Azure Dragon School, as long as you become an inner court disciple, you could start cultivating the martial skills.\n\nMartial skills were also divided into ranks, and from the weakest to the strongest, there were nine ranks.\n\nWithin the inner court, the best martial skill book was only a rank 3 one.\n\nBut, within the annual inner disciple exam, the first person to pa.s.s it would get a rank 4 martial skill book.\n\nThat was why those people would rather train in the outer court and not enter the inner court. It was for the rank 4 martial skill book.\n\n“Look, isn’t that Yang Tian Yu?”\n\n“Waa, it really is him. He’s already at the 4th level of the Spirit rank by the age of thirteen. It seems like first place in this exam will be him.”\n\nIn the ocean of people, one young man grabbed people’s’ attention. To be more precise it was a boy.\n\nThere were dozens of thousands of disciples in the outer court and most of them were unknown characters. However, the focal figures that people paid attention to were mostly geniuses, in which this Yang Tian Yu was one of them.\n\n“That may not be so. No matter how much aptitude Yang Tian Yu has, he is, at the end, a child. It would be very hard for him to get first.”\n\n“There are many unknown talents in Azure Dragon School, and sometimes geniuses may not be able to beat the mediocre. For example, that Duan Yuxuan.” Another outer court disciple pointed with his fingers at a cold young man.\n\nThat person was called Duan Yuxuan. He has been in the Azure Dragon School for 6 years and he was also originally an unknown character.\n\nBut a few months ago, he unexpectedly defeated an inner disciple who was in the 4th level of the Spirit realm. Because of that, his name was widespread and he became the focal character of the outer court.\n\n“Silence.” Suddenly, a loud and clear sound echoed.\n\nLooking at the source, everyone couldn’t help but stare blankly. They saw a dozen or so silhouettes appear on the high platform in the hall.\n\nMost of them were aged, old people, and they were the outer court elders. But not only was the leader young, she was even a beautiful female.\n\nThe female was wearing a red, skintight dress and it outlined her alluring curves. Especially under the dress, there were two straight, snow-white legs, and it could be said that they were perfect.\n\nNot only was her body attractive, her appearance was also extremely lovely. With round eyes, red lips, and an oval face, it was just like a fox face.\n\nShe was the famous beauty elder of Azure Dragon School, Su Rou.\n\nSu Rou was a top-cla.s.s character. She entered the Azure Dragon School at the age of 10, entered the inner court at the age of 12, and became a core disciple at the age of 15.\n\nBut just as everyone were optimistic and thought that she would become Azure Dragon School’s #1 disciple, she suddenly became an elder.\n\nNo one had the inside information about this change, and up to today, it was still a mystery and it was discussed enthusiastically by people.\n\n“Waa, it’s Su Rou! Wasn’t she supposed to be an elder in the inner court? Why did she come to the outer court?” With the appearance of Su Rou, all of the male disciples opened their mouths and some even drooled.\n\nThe outer court disciples were very young. Most of them were teenagers and some were even children. To them at their age, a mature female like Su Rou had the most charm.\n\nSu Rou didn’t have the air of the elders as she charmingly smiled towards the crowd and said gently, “The exam rules are very simple. Enter the gate behind me and come out from the other gate. With that, you pa.s.s the exam.”\n\n“The only difference is that the first person to pa.s.s will get a rank 4 skill book. You can’t even get this in the inner courts.”\n\n“But something worth mentioning is that the person who is first this year will get another special reward.”\n\n“Depending on one's perspective, this reward could be even more precious than the previous one\\~” After saying that, Su Rou intentionally lengthened the intonation. The enchanting air filled the entire hall.", "timestamp": 1636691386, "digest": "aB3vCePSsfyxVmZjtILucA2BbolHDExBmzMZGYV8IDQ", "contributor": "0x56fb8c7B0B9a310c47b56b69537035133Cf01bb9"}
{"id": "fWFtiGvNOiLoYcxir6se-ZW3PvVXk0D3q1SYVxwvZNM", "title": "NFT 101: Getting To Know The Basics", "body": "Have you ever imagined a future of buying jpegs? Or maybe even tweets?\n\nRemember the side-eyeing Chloe meme? Or nyan cat? These were bought for a whopping $76,377.50 and $590,000, respectively.\n\nWhat about this [tweet](https://twitter.com/jack/status/20?lang=en) that sold for $2.9 million? Or maybe a digital artwork by Beeple for $69 million?\n\nAnd lastly, that short clip of Lebron James dunking for $200,000. Might as well buy several cars, right?\n\n \n\nNFTs, collectively, have gone up to around $2.5B in sales. And that’s just for the first half of 2021. Now, what are these NFTs that have been selling for such an amount? These stand for Non-Fungible Tokens, which are digital assets that are unique and cannot be duplicated. These come in many forms – digital collectibles, music, art, in-game tokens/characters/skins. Some popular examples are Axies, which are tiny little monsters from the famous game Axie Inifinity. But we’ll get to that later.\n\n \n\nNFTs are one of the many new notable assets in the cryptocurrency space. These can be sold in (NFT) marketplaces such as Rarible, Opensea, Enjin, and many more including cryptocurrency exchanges/platforms such as Binance, crypto.com, and etc. Unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs have different values that vary. Similarly, both have values that fluctuate and differ.\n\nNow, there are a lot of factors that contribute to its value, such as ownership history, reputation, rarity, utility, and etc. For example, that artwork that was sold for $69 million is by Beeple, a well known digital artist. Another example is when Dolce & Gabbana sold their first NFT collection that sold for around $5.7 million.\n\n \n\nSo, going back to NFT basics – one might argue that you can just right click and save the picture, and in that way, you can get the picture for free. Well, technically, anyone can do this. But the difference is, one has value, and the other does not. Just like when you print a picture of the famous Mona Lisa from the internet. It isn’t the same as owning the original. What makes buying different is that you get a digital certificate, which serves as a proof of ownership. You, and everyone else can access and see who previously owned the NFT. This is made possible by the blockchain. But take note that only one person can own an NFT at a time, except for fractional (ownership) NFTs. And yes, you can buy and sell NFTs - and also make one! Some have had major life changes selling their work. And even flipping NFTs (both positive and negative changes though). The process is a bit comparable to flipping houses *IRL.* Making your own NFT brand is also somewhat similar to opening a business - wherein the success of it depends on several factors such as marketing, quality, and so much more.\n\nSpending massive amounts for jpegs, videos, or whatnot might seem absurd. But when you think about it, it’s not too far from collecting paintings, bags, Funko Pops, shoes, and etc. Some people also buy it for bragging rights. Going back, these can be an investment and/or collection for some. A lot of celebrities and artists like Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ellen DeGeneres, Steve Aoki, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, Reese Witherspoon, and many more have gotten into buying NFTs.** \n **\n\nFor artists and creators, NFTs are a *huge* advantage as it enables them to have control over their work and their ownership - especially for those that greatly value intellectual property rights, software licensing, and the like. Artists also get a royalty fee whenever their work is resold; unlike for physical paintings that will only allow the artist to earn after it being sold for the first time. Talk about giving credit where it’s due, right?\n\nOverall, NFTs look like they’re *probably* here to stay, as it offers a huge improvement in the digital world - both for the creators and users. The concept of collecting is no different than the concept of collecting designer shoes. This one only comes with extra steps though, but the concept of it is somewhat the same. As for those that flip NFTs, it comes with risk too, just as with any other investments - even outside the cryptocurrency space.", "timestamp": 1636691735, "digest": "ISc79ey8_8pjoRnlxNw2jATjottouURvswRJUqRCftA", "contributor": "0x4ee97cd6c432dBDb0059Da2010e5D8d0566D390d"}

{"id": "hwJgkypflBjZnWNljY8ytx5tG8tRuHXY-fNmLjWjEGw", "title": "MARTIAL GOD ASURA（Chapter 1 ：Outer Court Disciple）", "body": "Night. The round moon was hanging high and stars filled the sky.\n\nHowever, within the river of stars, there were 9 -coloured lights lingering amongst them and they were especially dazzling.\n\n“Abnormal signs appear in the sky, which means a Divine Body will descend.”\n\nOn the summit of the Imperial City in the Nine Provinces. An old man in golden clothes stood with his hand behind his back and he was looking up into the night sky.\n\nBehind him were tens of thousands of Imperial City experts. All of them were half-kneeled as if waiting for some command.\n\nSuddenly, the lights condensed and formed into 9-coloured lightning. It came striking down from above the river of stars and the heavens.\n\nAt that instant, the black night became a white day. Even before the strike of the lightning, the ground was already rumbling and fiercely trembling.\n\nBut that 9-coloured lightning. The moment it collided with the land, it did not do any terrifying damage. Rather, it completely disappeared.\n\nAt the same time, the world was enveloped by the night once again. The originally bright night sky darkened quite a bit, as if some important essence was removed, and the former senere days were restored.\n\nThe old man’s eyes were abnormally bright and his excited body was even trembling. He pointed towards the location in which the lightning had landed, “Within the borders of the Azure Province, bring all the infants that were born tonight back to the Imperial City!”\n\n“Yes sir!”\n\nThe thunder-like response resonated past the horizon and tens of thousand Imperial City experts headed towards the Azure Province. They swore to look for the Divine Body and give it to the imperial court for use.\n\nTime pa.s.sed. 5 years elapsed with a blink and although people still remembered the frightening scene that year, no one knew the actions of the imperial court.\n\nWithin the borders of the Azure Province of the Nine Provinces. Amongst the countless of schools, the Azure Dragon School was one of them.\n\nToday, once again, it was the annual recruitment of disciples for the Azure Dragon School. There were oceans of people outside of the school.\n\nEvery time, the busiest people were the outer court disciples. All the responsibilities of the admittance for the school were all pushed onto their heads.\n\nOuter court disciples. They were the ones that did the hard and thankless tasks. Not only were their position lowest in the school, they were even looked down upon by outsiders.\n\nThe reason was very simple. If they were an outer court disciple, it meant that their aptitude was horrible and in their entire life, it would be very hard for them to have any big achievements, so naturally. they were despised upon.\n\n“Oi, what’s with this attitude? Do you know who I am?” A lady who wore gorgeous clothes had a boy with her as she pointed and loudly yelled at a young man.\n\n“I am very sorry. It is already late now and the school will close soon. Please come back tomorrow.” The young man’s delicate face was still young and tender, but between his eyebrows, he had a bit of heroic spirit.\n\nHe was called Chu Feng. He was 15 this year and he was one of the tens of thousands of outer court disciples in the Azure Dragon School.\n\nAlthough he was an outer court disciple, Chu Feng was different from all the others. He did not feel inferior to others and he did not degrade himself. He did not feel afraid or scared while treating others and he was very calm.\n\n“Come back tomorrow…You think I’m an idiot? These are the mountains! Where are you even going to let us sleep?”\n\n“You must arrange a place of residence for me, or else I’ll go find your elders for reasoning.” The lady did not listen and did not care. She even grabbed onto Chu Feng’s clothes.\n\n“Chu Feng, have you met with trouble?” But just at that time, a sweet voice could be heard.\n\nLooking at that direction, a young female who wore purple was walking over. Although there was a faint smile on her mouth, her eyes were fierce and they tightly stared at the lady.\n\nAs she saw the young female, the colour of the lady’s face instantly changed and a strong expression of fear gushed out.\n\nIt was not because of anything else. It was just because the young female was wearing the purple robe, and that was a mark of the inner disciples.\n\nThe lady hiddenly cursed. She originally thought she could use her status to make things difficult for the young man in front of her.\n\nWho would have thought that the unremarkable young man in front of her had the support of an inner disciple? The inner disciples were an existence that she couldn’t offend.\n\n“It’s nothing it’s nothing, I was just inquiring some things from him.” The lady explained while smiling.\n\nThe young female glared at her and only said one word, “Scram.”\n\nAt that instant, the lady’s body couldn’t help but tremble and her face was already ashen.\n\nBut she did not hesitate at all. She pulled the boy and quickly left, and under the panic she even tripped, which made her look very rough.\n\nSeeing that, Chu Feng helplessly shook his head and said politely to the young female next to him, “Thank you very much Chu Yue.”\n\n“No need to be so polite, we’re family right?” Chu Yue was a bit displeased.\n\nShe was correct. They were indeed family. They came from the same family, Chu.\n\nChu Yue was Chu Feng cousin, from Chu Feng’s father’s brother line and she was only 1 year older than Chu Feng.\n\nHowever, Chu Yue already pa.s.sed the inner disciple exam 3 years ago and became an inner disciple. She was now in the 4th level of the Spirit realm.\n\n“We need to follow the school rules.” Chu Feng said with a brilliant smile.\n\n\\[TN: What he meant by following the school rules was being respectful to elders, as inner court disciples > outer court disciples\\]\n\nLooking at Chu Feng behaving like that, Chu Yue’s heart ached, “Chu Feng, are you still not going to participate in this year’s inner disciple exam? Or is it that you still haven’t reached the 3rd level of the Spirit realm?”\n\nChu Feng did not respond and a faint smile still hung on his face. No one knew what he meant.\n\nSeeing that, Chu Yue took off a bag from her waist and put it in Chu Feng’s hands, “Refine it. Perhaps it’ll help you break through the 3rd level.”\n\nChu Feng opened the bag and instantly, strong spiritual energy was emitted from it. A bright, sparkling, transparent Saint Spirit Grass that was the size of a finger laid within.\n\n“Chu Yue. This is too precious, I can’t take it.” Chu Feng hurriedly returned it back to Chu Yue.\n\nSaint Spirit Grass. It was like a panacea for martial training and it was extremely precious. It had endless usefulness for those within the Spirit realm.\n\nTo increase their training speed, the Chu family would supplement one Saint Spirit Grass to the Chu family members every year.\n\nChu Yue was also supplemented by the family, but she didn’t use it and gave it to Chu Feng. It really moved Chu Feng, so he really couldn’t accept it.\n\n“When I say I give it to you, you should take it. You are my little brother after all.” Chu Yue was slightly irritated.\n\n“Oh? When were you so generous and even started to give Saint Spirit Grasses to people?”\n\n“Look, I am your little brother as well, and coincidentally, I will almost have a breakthrough into 4th level of the Spirit realm. How about you give the Saint Spirit Grass to me?”\n\nA young man around the age of Chu Feng walked over and he was also wearing clothes of the inner court disciples.\n\nHe was called Chu Zhen and he was also from the Chu family. Five years ago, he entered the Azure Dragon School at the same time as Chu Feng. However, he became an inner disciple 2 years ago.\n\n“Chu Zhen, you’ve already broke past the 3rd level of the Spirit realm and successfully condensed spiritual energy. Even if you don’t have this Saint Spirit Grass you can rank up quickly.”\n\n“But Chu Feng has not condensed spiritual energy yet, so this Saint Spirit Grass is more important to him.” Chu Yue forcibly put the Saint Spirit Grass into Chu Feng’s hands.\n\n“Yep, you are correct, but sadly he doesn’t want it.” Chu Zhen spread his hands open and sneered.\n\nWho said that I didn’t want it?” But then, Chu Feng lightly smiled and unrestrainedly put the Saint Spirit Grass in his pocket before saying, “Chu Yue, I will borrow this Saint Spirit Grass. On a later date I will return them back twofold.”\n\n“Mm, okay.” Seeing that Chu Feng accepted it, Chu Yue was already happy, so she just randomly responded and didn’t care whether Chu Feng would return it back or not.\n\n“If you’re taking it then why return it? Giving you this Saint Spirit Grass for you to use is such a waste.” Chu Zhen’s face had a really ugly look on it.\n\nChu Feng just smiled and ignored him. He then said to Chu Yue, “Chu Yue, I will participate in this year’s inner disciple exam.”\n\n“Hmph, you? If you can pa.s.s the inner disciple exam, I’ll give this year’s supplemented Saint Spirit Grass to you.” Chu Zhen looked at Chu Feng with contempt.\n\n“Is that true?” Chu Feng didn’t really believe it.\n“Chu Yue will be the witness. But what if you can’t pa.s.s it?”\n\n“Then the Saint Spirit Grass I get this year will belong to you.” Leaving that sentence behind, Chu Feng continued to throw himself into the work of outer court disciples.\n\n“Chu Zhen, we are family. Why do you always need to make things so hard for Chu Feng?” Chu Yue looked at Chu Zhen with annoyance.\n\n“Family? Chu Yue, you should know that that Chu Feng isn’t part of our Chu family.”\n“After entering the school for five years, he still hasn’t pa.s.sed the inner disciple exam. He is absolutely the disgrace of our Chu family.”\n\n“In the entire Chu family, which one likes him? Only you treat him nicely and you even give your own Saint Spirit Grass to him for use.” Chu Zhen really did not understand.\n\n“You are truly stupid.” Chu Yue was a bit angry and after glaring at him for a moment, she walked away.\n\nOn the other hand, Chu Zhen smiled. He really was happy. Although he didn’t get Chu Yue’s Saint Spirit Grass, he knew that this year, Chu Feng’s Saint Spirit Grass would certainly be his.\n\nA bit into the night, in the resting area for the outer court disciples. It was complete darkness.\n\nAfter being busy for the entire day, everyone was very tired and they slept very early. Only Chu Feng’s room was still lit up by light.\n\nHe sat on the front of the bed, took out the Saint Spirit Grass that Chu Yue gave him and muttered, “I hope this Saint Spirit Grass can make you full.”\n\nAfter saying that, Chu Feng closed both his eyes, clamped the Saint Spirit Grass between both his palms and did a strange hand seal.\n\nAt that instant, the spiritual energy inside the Saint Spirit Grass started to enter Chu Feng’s body through his palm and it converged into his dantian.\n\n\nAt the same time, chewing sounds came from Chu Feng’s dantian as if something was having a meal.\n\nIf you looked through his skin, you would discover in the deep part of Chu Feng’s dantian, a lump of lightning was occupying there.\n\nThat lump of lightning had nine colours and every colour was like a huge lightning beast. It emitted a terrifying aura that did not belong to this world.\n\nPrevious Chapter", "timestamp": 1636692976, "digest": "rMcKEVw_pbgQdWXxeL-Qb2k6l93YmBZ-rhkobaZ_AIw", "contributor": "0x56fb8c7B0B9a310c47b56b69537035133Cf01bb9"}

{"id": "NjJjV32FfPKasuU_1bHFbw7Gn5rlzRg8rFB9HcQceqs", "title": "MARTIAL GOD ASURA（Chapter 2 ：Beauty Elder）", "body": "Chu Feng wasn't really from the Chu family. He was an adopted son by “Chu Yuan”, the fifth oldest in the Chu family.\n\nThat caused Chu Feng to be pushed aside and to be humiliated at a small age. If it wasn’t for Chu Yuan’s protection, he would have already been kicked out of the Chu family. Because of that, Chu Feng was very thankful towards Chu Yuan, and swore to become the pride of Chu Yuan and to win back some honor.\n\nFive years ago, Chu Feng was exactly ten years old and it was the best age to train in the martial arts.\n\nThe him at that time had many expectations for training, because he felt that the time to prove himself had arrived.\n\nHowever, he never would have thought after entering the Azure Dragon School for one month, lightning would strike his body and enter his dantian.\n\nAt first, Chu Feng even thought it was good luck, because when he started training, his speed of improvement was astonishing. In two short months, he arrived at the 2nd level of the Spirit realm.\n\nThat speed was completely abnormal, and because of that, Chu Feng didn’t dare to tell it to anyone so he hid his strength and continued training.\n\nBut the good scene did not last long. Just as Chu Feng thought he became a genius, change happened within his body.\n\nBecause of that change, it made it so his cultivation stopped and did not move forward, and he was labeled to have the most horrible talent of a lifetime.\n\nAt that time, the Saint Spirit Grass in Chu Feng’s hands was being refined and absorbed by his dantain.\n\nHis refining speed was extremely fast and it exceeded common sense. Normally, with Chu Feng’s strength, it would take at least one month to refine the Saint Spirit Grass.\n\nHowever, looking at it now, it was already half-way refined just after a short while, and Chu Feng’s dantian that felt like a never-ending cave also had a feeling of being full.\n\nSuddenly, light floated over Chu Feng’s hand and the other half of the Saint Spirit Grass instantly disappeared.\n\nAlso, at the same time, everything changed in Chu Feng’s dantian.\n\nThe nine lightning beasts interwove with each other. It was hurriedly moving, and it was actually condensing. Finally, it turned into a pill-like object.\n\nAfter the pill formed itself, endless spiritual energy surged out from it like a tide washing Chu Feng’s body. Very soon, it permeated through his entire body.\n\nChu Feng suddenly opened his eyes, and there were traces of lightning in them! An indescribable expression hung on his face.\n\n“I succeeded. After five years, I finally succeeded.” Chu Feng was incomparably joyful. He jumped down from the bed, and as he walked around, he sized up his body.\n\nIn the journey of martial cultivation, the known realms were the following:\n\nSpirit, Origin, Profound, and Heaven. Those were the four big realms, and every realm was divided into nine levels.\n\nThe 1st level of the Spirit realm. The main point of it was to train the physical body with special methods, and to increase strength.\n\nBut after reaching the 2nd level of the Spirit realm, one must use ways to condense spiritual energy. Only people who successfully condensed their spiritual energy in their dantian could truly start their path in martial cultivation.\n\nChu Feng’s body changed and it made it unable to condense spiritual energy. The Divine Lightning in his dantian were like nine hungry wild beasts. The spiritual energy that Chu Feng condensed would always be engulfed by that Divine Lightning.\n\nBut he didn’t give up. It was because he found out that although the Divine Lightning did engulf his spiritual energy, there was a limit. As long as he kept on providing spiritual energy towards his dantian, he could fill it up one day.\n\nAnd today, he finally succeeded.\n\n“This is a really strong feeling. Endless amounts of spiritual energy is surging into my body, as though it was going to break through my body.”\n\nThis feeling was inconceivable to Chu Feng. He never would have thought that the Divine Lightning would directly condense into a pill and occupy a place in the dantian. The spiritual energy that the Divine Lightning was giving off was very dense and it was beyond imagination.\n\nHe knew that even with his five years of non-stop cultivation, he could not condense such strong spiritual energy. The reason why he could was because of that Divine Lightning.\n\nBut just at that time, Chu Feng’s body suddenly became stiff, and his expression also changed greatly.\n\nThe Divine Lightning was changing. His power instantly increased by several times, and he suddenly broke through again and stepped into the 4th level of the Spirit realm.\n\n“Have the hard times stopped and the good times come?”\n\nChu Feng tightly clenched his fist and he felt that the explosive power in his body was worth his five years of suffering.\n\nSuddenly continuously breaking through two levels, the unexplainable method of becoming strong finally returned.\n\nHe used a severe gaze to look towards the direction of the inner court and muttered, “Chu Zhen, I’ll be taking your Saint Spirit Grass.”\n\nThe Azure Dragon School’s disciple recruitment only happened once a year and every time, it lasted for ten days.\n\nAfter ten days, the annual inner disciple exam would start. This time, Chu Feng who had been silent for five years would also participate.\n\nThe exam location was a huge underground palace. Within the main hall of the underground palace, the number of people were like oceans and mountains and there were most likely over ten thousand people.\n\nMost of the people there were at the 3rd level of the Spirit realm because everyone knew that the inner disciple exam required one to be at least in the 3rd level to pa.s.s.\n\nHowever, there was also a small portion of disciples at the 2nd level and they wanted to try to pa.s.s it within the confusion. There were people like that every year, but most of them ended with failures.\n\nThe thing worth mentioning though, was that there were also a small portion of 4th levels there. They were not mediocre people who trained slow, and in fact, some of them were even geniuses.\n\nThey intentionally waited until they were at the 4th level of the Spirit realm before participating in the inner disciple exam. The reason? For the reward.\n\nWhen one reached the 3rd level, they could start training martial skills.\n\nMartial skills were very strong attacking methods. Not only could they thoroughly display strength, they could also make people gain power that exceeded the limits of their body.\n\nBecause of that, martial skills were very precious, and even the rich and powerful families that has been existing for generations didn’t have them. That was the reason why all sorts of families had to send their young generations into various schools for cultivation.\n\nIn every school, there were a large amount of martial skills, and within the Azure Dragon School, as long as you become an inner court disciple, you could start cultivating the martial skills.\n\nMartial skills were also divided into ranks, and from the weakest to the strongest, there were nine ranks.\n\nWithin the inner court, the best martial skill book was only a rank 3 one.\n\nBut, within the annual inner disciple exam, the first person to pa.s.s it would get a rank 4 martial skill book.\n\nThat was why those people would rather train in the outer court and not enter the inner court. It was for the rank 4 martial skill book.\n\n“Look, isn’t that Yang Tian Yu?”\n\n“Waa, it really is him. He’s already at the 4th level of the Spirit rank by the age of thirteen. It seems like first place in this exam will be him.”\n\nIn the ocean of people, one young man grabbed people’s’ attention. To be more precise it was a boy.\n\nThere were dozens of thousands of disciples in the outer court and most of them were unknown characters. However, the focal figures that people paid attention to were mostly geniuses, in which this Yang Tian Yu was one of them.\n\n“That may not be so. No matter how much aptitude Yang Tian Yu has, he is, at the end, a child. It would be very hard for him to get first.”\n\n“There are many unknown talents in Azure Dragon School, and sometimes geniuses may not be able to beat the mediocre. For example, that Duan Yuxuan.” Another outer court disciple pointed with his fingers at a cold young man.\n\nThat person was called Duan Yuxuan. He has been in the Azure Dragon School for 6 years and he was also originally an unknown character.\n\nBut a few months ago, he unexpectedly defeated an inner disciple who was in the 4th level of the Spirit realm. Because of that, his name was widespread and he became the focal character of the outer court.\n\n“Silence.” Suddenly, a loud and clear sound echoed.\n\nLooking at the source, everyone couldn’t help but stare blankly. They saw a dozen or so silhouettes appear on the high platform in the hall.\n\nMost of them were aged, old people, and they were the outer court elders. But not only was the leader young, she was even a beautiful female.\n\nThe female was wearing a red, skintight dress and it outlined her alluring curves. Especially under the dress, there were two straight, snow-white legs, and it could be said that they were perfect.\n\nNot only was her body attractive, her appearance was also extremely lovely. With round eyes, red lips, and an oval face, it was just like a fox face.\n\nShe was the famous beauty elder of Azure Dragon School, Su Rou.\n\nSu Rou was a topclass character. She entered the Azure Dragon School at the age of 10, entered the inner court at the age of 12, and became a core disciple at the age of 15.\n\nBut just as everyone were optimistic and thought that she would become Azure Dragon School’s #1 disciple, she suddenly became an elder.\n\nNo one had the inside information about this change, and up to today, it was still a mystery and it was discussed enthusiastically by people.\n\n“Waa, it’s Su Rou! Wasn’t she supposed to be an elder in the inner court? Why did she come to the outer court?” With the appearance of Su Rou, all of the male disciples opened their mouths and some even drooled.\n\nThe outer court disciples were very young. Most of them were teenagers and some were even children. To them at their age, a mature female like Su Rou had the most charm.\n\nSu Rou didn’t have the air of the elders as she charmingly smiled towards the crowd and said gently, “The exam rules are very simple. Enter the gate behind me and come out from the other gate. With that, you pa.s.s the exam.”\n\n“The only difference is that the first person to pa.s.s will get a rank 4 skill book. You can’t even get this in the inner courts.”\n\n“But something worth mentioning is that the person who is first this year will get another special reward.”\n\n“Depending on one's perspective, this reward could be even more precious than the previous one\\~” After saying that, Su Rou intentionally lengthened the intonation. The enchanting air filled the entire hall.", "timestamp": 1636692824, "digest": "aB3vCePSsfyxVmZjtILucA2BbolHDExBmzMZGYV8IDQ", "contributor": "0x56fb8c7B0B9a310c47b56b69537035133Cf01bb9"}

We are tremendously excited today to present a fully functional dApp with Solidity smart contracts and a Web3 frontend!\n\nTry out UniSync, our port of the Uniswap V2 smart contracts and frontend:\n\n[>>> Launch dApp <<<](https://uni.zksync.io/)\n\nWe have also prepared a comprehensive [zkEVM FAQ](https://zksync.io/zkevm).\n\n## A Solidity-first Approach\n\nIn the past, it was necessary to switch to ZK languages in order to take advantage of the unmatched scaling, security, and UX benefits of zero knowledge proofs. But this is no longer the case: after many [R\\&D breakthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wLSkpIHXM8%27), the innovations that make the zkEVM possible have elevated Solidity to a first class citizen in the ZK Rollup universe.\n\nDeveloping on zkSync will feel natural and familiar, with Solidity, Web3 API, Ethers SDK, and native Ethereum signatures. And audited codebases battle tested on Ethereum will be as secure on zkSync as they are on mainnet. **From code to developer tooling, from user to developer experience, everything will be compatible!**\n\nBy making Solidity native to ZK Rollups, we have preserved many important properties of Ethereum that extend far beyond that of just one programming language:\n\n## **1. Security**\n\nSolidity is currently securing over 100 billion dollars. But with over [1 billion in hacked funds](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/) so far, each lesson learned in security did not come for free. We climbed up the learning curve one fatal mistake at a time. It took over 5 years for a set of auditing firms and a broader security-focused community to form around Solidity, and preserving this expertise is paramount.\n\n## **2. Composability**\n\nMost dApps on Ethereum are tightly coupled: they build on other dApps and/or have dApps built on them. By keeping Solidity, we are leaving the composability stack intact.\n\nWhile it would be possible for dApps written in different languages to maintain composability, it’s not easy. Say Uniswap or Aave switch to a new language: this would require all protocols that use them to adjust, which can cause enormous wave effects! Yearn would have to adjust, potentially forcing Alchemix to adjust, and so on.\n\nWith Solidity all the way up and all the way down, it also keeps the barrier low for new composability patterns to emerge.\n\n## **3. Low Effort**\n\nGenerally, it will be possible to port all existing projects without major modifications, and you can re-use existing tooling. It saves you the work of maintaining many implementations of the same protocol, and it will be easier to find developers and auditors.\n\nSome may be concerned about the efficiency of Solidity as compared to native ZK languages, but **computational efficiency is no longer the bottleneck**. The scarcest resource was, is, and will continue to be programmers. Hiring developers and auditors for Solidity is hard, hiring for ZK languages that are less than one year old will be harder! If each ZK protocol were to have its own language, picking one would mean being confined to that one system, whose success is dependent on an *ecosystem-wide shift *from Solidity. Supporting Solidity through transpilers [may result in](https://twitter.com/transmissions11/status/1447302049847123971?s=21) more spots for vulnerabilities, odd behaviors in VM after transpilation that auditors need to account for, and inefficient code (while the zkEVM is designed to work as efficiently as possible with 256 bit integers).\n\nAs an ecosystem, it is too costly to transition to a new programming language right now. We are in a race against time: a race for freedom. In its early stages, the Internet was almost overtaken by private institutions, but it is a public good today because it outpaced privatization. **We are at a similar turning point for blockchains: if we are not fast, we risk losing the promises of Web3 to powerful actors that want to control and regulate it.**\n\nZero-knowledge proof technology relies on math to deliver true trustlessness, and the zkEVM harnesses its power inside Solidity, creating a more simple, secure, and scalable future. Because of the zkEVM, Solidity can be used to program smart contracts in zkSync 2.0, a Volition system where users can choose between a zkRollup with Ethereum degree of security and [zkPorter](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zkporter-a-breakthrough-in-l2-scaling-ed5e48842fbf) with sidechain-like ultra-low fees (yet more security than any other L1 or sidechain).\n\n*UniSync is a port of Uniswap V2’s code and frontend by Matter Labs and is not affiliated with Uniswap Labs.

{"id": "z-TfhhTFv9WSgOBvIem6TRHUAWHbjT0dD303bVQtUyk", "title": "Introducing SquiggleDAO", "body": "This is a re-post of our Genesis article from Medium.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*n_YlFqazAsDUSBhi)\n\n## The DAO Mission\n\nThe SquiggleDAO mission is to support the growth and cultural relevance of generative NFT art. We will achieve this by using one of the most important art series as membership, upon which we will create long-term value for generative art in a fun, inclusive manner.\n\nSquiggleDAO acts as a foundry for artists that want to create awesome art. We’ll source, support, fund, and launch anyone that the DAO selects as an amazing generative NFT artist. Together, we will etch NFT art into the history books.\n\nSquiggle DAO will act as a place for both Chromie Squiggles and on-chain generative art education, and drive awareness to both Chromie Squiggles and on-chain generative art through challenges, financing new works, and community.\n\n## Why?\n\nArt and culture are two sides of the same coin. History has shown that artists who capture mindshare during important culture epochs ultimately end up defining that time period. We believe we are in the early stages of a new cultural epoch, and that the art of this time period will be stored on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\\*“The paradox of the art market is that objects created for personal and contemplative aesthetic enjoyment are connected to the broader social fabric through an economic transaction.” — \\**<https://som.yale.edu/news/2016/06/history-of-the-art-market-in-35-record-breaking-sales>*\n\n## Who We Are\n\nWe are you. We are art collectors, artists, techo-centric dreamers from all walks of life that enjoy digital art and believe in decentralized decision-making. We believe that art is one of the most important aspects of human expression and that a world with more art in it is a better world.\n\nThe genesis team:\n\n@tripleg\n\n@thattallguy\n\n@jonas\n\n@quickrider\n\n@carlosgomes\n\n## How does this work? How do I participate?\n\n## Community Membership\n\nIt’s easy! If you own a Squiggle of any type, you’re already a member! Come and join the Discord [here](https://discord.gg/NjBWGKVkEr) (and find your way into Squiggle Square):\n\nNote: You can buy Squiggles on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/assets/art-blocks?search%5BsortAscending%5D=true&search%5BsortBy%5D=PRICE&search%5BstringTraits%5D%5B0%5D%5Bname%5D=Chromie%20Squiggle&search%5BstringTraits%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalues%5D%5B0%5D=All%20Chromie%20Squiggles)\n\n## What are Chromie Squiggles?\n\nChromie Squiggles is the first generative art project launched on Art Blocks, the first blockchain-based generative art platform. Both Chromie Squiggles and Art Blocks were created by a zombie named Snowfro.\n\nThere are only 10,000 Chromie Squiggles that can ever be minted. Currently, around 9,100 Chromie Squiggles have been uniquely minted into existence.\n\nChromie Squiggles are no longer available to mint for purchase on Art Blocks. The last 900 Chromie Squiggles are reserved for individuals who help further the goals of the Art Blocks community.\n\nHowever, Chromie Squiggles can be purchased in secondary markets, like OpenSea.\n\n## What is on-chain generative art?\n\nTo create an on-chain generative art project like Chromie Squiggles, a generative artist will create a script with variables, upload that script to the blockchain, and set a maximum mint number. When collectors mint a token, that token will contain a random hash that populates variable values, and creates unique generative artwork.\n\nFor example — today each Chromie Squiggle represents a unique generative art piece. No two Chromie Squiggles are the same, although some share certain characteristics with one another.\n\nIn this way, all 10,000 Chromie Squiggles are the same. And all 10,000 Chromie Squiggles are different.\n\n## What is Art Blocks?\n\nArt Blocks is a first of its kind platform focused on genuinely programmable on demand generative content that is stored immutably on the Ethereum Blockchain. You pick a style that you like, pay for the work, and a randomly generated version of the content is created by an algorithm and sent to your Ethereum account. The resulting piece might be a static image, 3D model, or an interactive experience. Each output is different and there are endless possibilities for the types of content that can be created on the platform.\n\nChromie Squiggles was the first generative art project launched on Art Blocks in 2020.", "timestamp": 1636693592, "digest": "Lm3LRM79z0R9wVcB2yY8S61O0jyuEznIzpxhhewk-DY", "contributor": "0x627841b158a982660C0557e671946E795Ccb5533"}

{"id": "jr_QmgJ1NsP2hMxnKMcCGpouf3l4whZYS2v5UzqMQUQ", "title": "アルコールに関する相談が増加", "body": "コロナ禍が長引き、アルコール依存症の治療を行う医療機関には数多くの相談が寄せられてきました。私が勤める久里浜医療センターでも、アルコールに関する電話相談はコロナ前に比べ1.5倍に増加しました。たとえば次のような相談です。\n\n仕事がなくなってしまったので、その分お酒を飲むようになった。\n\nテレワークで家にいるため、昼間からお酒を飲んでしまう \n （「顔が赤い」と会社から注意されたという人もいます）。\n\n主婦の方で、ご主人と子どもさんが家にずっといて、それがストレスで飲むようになった。\n\n退職をした方で、コロナで外出や趣味の活動がしにくくなり、飲酒量が増えた。\n\n特に女性の相談が目立ちます。本人だけでなく家族からの相談もよくあります。\n\nこの先、仕事や暮らしはどうなってしまうのかという不安、自由に遊びに行けない状況などからストレスが大きくなり、それを解消させようとお酒の量が増えてしまうことが心配されます。 \n 環境の変化も影響しているようです。ステイホームで在宅時間が増えました。コロナで職を失って一日中家にいるようになった人もいます。アルコール依存症は失業率とともに上下すると言われています。\n\nアルコール消費量全体はコロナの流行以降減りました。飲食店が営業を自粛し外で飲む機会が減ったからだと思われます。 \n しかし心配なのは“家で飲み過ぎてしまうこと”です。外で飲んでいれば、周りの人が飲み過ぎを注意してくれる、終電だから帰らないといけないといったことがあります。しかし家ではそうしたブレーキが効きにくくなります。\n\nお酒は人間関係を円滑にしたり食事をより楽しめるようにしたりと、いい面もたくさんあります。しかし家で一人で飲んでいる場合、負の側面が強くなってしまう恐れがあるのです。\n\n## ストロング系に注意\n\n家でお酒を飲むときに注意してほしいことがあります。さまざまなお酒が販売されているなか、最近ストロング系と呼ばれる缶入りチューハイが人気です。これまでと違う「飲み過ぎのリスク」が指摘されています。\n\n「ストロング系」と呼ばれるのは、アルコール度数が9％など従来より高いからです。たとえばアルコール度数9％の場合、350mL1缶で純アルコール量はおよそ25g。これはビールなら大瓶1本のアルコール量に相当します。日本酒なら1合を超える量です。\n\n厚生労働省「健康日本21」は「節度ある適度な飲酒量」を1日当たり20gとしています。ストロング系（9%以上）だと1缶でそれを上回ってしまいます。さらに、40g以上だと「生活習慣病のリスクが高まる」とされています。 \n しかもこれは男性の場合です。女性はさらにアルコールの影響を受けやすいため、男性の半分程度の量を目安にしたほうがいいでしょう。\n\nしかもストロング系は、度数が高いわりに「飲みやすい」「安い」という特徴もあります。 \n 甘く口当たりをよくしているため飲みやすいようです。そのため思いがけず飲み過ぎてしまう心配があります。安いことが手伝って飲む量が増える可能性もあります。\n\n大切なのは、度数（％）だけでなく1缶に含まれるアルコールの量を知ることです。ビールや日本酒と比較しながら、しっかりチェックしてください。\n\n## アルコール依存を防ぐコツ\n\n家で飲む量が増えてきたという人に、飲み過ぎないコツをまとめました。\n\n* ノンアルコール飲料を先に飲む。水でもかまいません。\n* 食事のときに飲む。\n* ゆっくり時間をかけて飲む。一口飲んだあと、容器をいったん下に置くだけでも効果があります。\n* なるべく薄いお酒を飲む。\n* 飲まない時間帯を決めておく。\n\n飲酒以外でリラックスできる方法を1つでも2つでも見つけて実践することもおすすめします。たとえば料理や読書など。バルコニーや庭に出て運動するのもいいでしょう。", "timestamp": 1636694281, "digest": "ZyF9o7_v9jDJvk21BABE4WhekSteuL7DNqt6MgiFXyE", "contributor": "0xA4d23993A653716d91BA0F47521Ab2484171E406"}

How will web3, crypto, and blockchain affect edtech & learning? In this post I outline what I'm seeing so far.\n\nToday I'm seeing early efforts in a couple of areas:\n\n1. Future of Learning: Learn to earn\n2. Future of Learning: DAOs as universities or Learning DAOs\n3. Future of Learning: Credentials, transcripts\n4. Future of Earning: Career funding: creator coins, securitized music\n5. Future of Earning: Freelancer networks\n\nIn this collectible post, I’ll dive into each of these and where there's additional opportunity in web3 x learning.\n\n## Learn to Earn (L2E)\n\nTaking a note from play to earn (P2E) successes like Axie Infinity, companies like Rabbithole are pioneering a L2E model that rewards people for performing tasks & learning skills. There's L2E for language learning, reading newsletters, branding and social design, and new protocols, all rewarded with tokens.\n\nPeople have paid students to study or given prizes for top results for years. But the benefits of L2E include on-chain ledger of skills, and potentially stronger motivation for learners. An early blockchain approach to L2E dates back to 2015 when Professor Gunnar Stefansson [received](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/news/cryptocurrency-finds-place-education-smileycoin-162032190.html) funding from the University of Iceland. His site Tutorweb, has enabled students in Iceland & Kenya to earn the $SMLY coin he developed for learning. He says he has had over 1,000 students earn $SMLY tokens.\n\nAs someone with a Masters in Education, I am obliged to point out the research by [Roland Fryer](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/merit-pay-for-students-fails-to-raise-scores-study-finds/2010/04) and others has shown paying people for behaviors associated with learning can improve achievement, but paying people solely for attaining higher scores doesn’t seem to work. Some critics worry about intrinsic motivation and this is a real concern. There is a lot to learn about the long-term effects of paying learners, especially children, for years on end, to pursue learning. But if designed correctly, L2E models could have a real basis in encouraging students to take the actions that lead toward better learning. \n\nElements of top designed L2E models will include:\n\n1. payment for online and offline behaviors that support learning\n2. ability to integrate with other services that track supporting behaviors (e.g. contributing to a community, habit formation)\n3. ability to assess depth of learning and weight credential appropriately - teaching someone else is a far stronger retention method than reading about something\n\n## Learning DAOs\n\nAnother innovation area is universities as DAOs or Learning DAOs. DAOs are decentralized autonomous organizations or decentralized communities where any token holder has voting rights & a shared \"bank account.\" These are a [few](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw) [great](https://underscore.vc/blog/the-future-is-dao-a-primer-on-daos-and-their-explosive-growth/) [primers](https://every.to/divinations/will-daos-replace-corporations) on DAOs for those new to the concept. DAOs can manage and deploy L2E courses, credentials & learning environments for their community. Colleges can be slower moving given the amount of time it takes to accredit a new degree or field of study, so  DAOs could have an advantage in fast  moving fields.\n\nThis [piece](https://kassen.substack.com/p/daos-as-university-replacements-a) by Kassen is an excellent breakdown of the value & function that today's higher education institutions serve and how DAOs could serve many of these purposes. She highlights potential issues and opportunities like admissions & life-long learning.  \n\nQuite a few DAOs as learning communities already exist. One such is [Crypto, Culture & Society](https://g.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x819b12E7b398021fbD9D2acdC8B7349E3D732B51) - a course built on Mirror that used crowdfunded crypto to come to existence. Their backers received an NFT for membership & tokens for voting on syllabus, scholarships, guests, and more. In some ways this decentralized, crowd-funded form of education reminds me of [Kritik](https://www.kritik.io/), an innovative web2 peer assessment platform that allows peers to contribute to the syllabus, rubric, and evaluation of other students.\n\nThere is also the [Ethernaut DAO](https://ethernautdao.medium.com/introducing-the-ethernautdao-21bfca20ee80), a learning organization geared at helping train the next generation of ETH developers. This could be the General Assembly or Lambda of the future. Soon traditional learning orgs for adult learners may need to learn to setup DAOs to be competitive long term\n\nHere’s a few things the best learning DAOs will need to get right:\n\n1. scholarships & admissions - many DAOs today are pay-your-way-in and clearly that’s not equitable. many DAOs are also first-come-first-serve which means great potential members who arrive later may never get the chance to buy the initial set of limited tokens\n2. trusty & safety - so many things can go awry while running a social, living, breathing community. a robust set of standards with community escalation policies is crucial to ensure a thriving social community\n3. choose signal v. skill priority - the problem with many higher education institutions is that they have chosen to prioritize the signal of their credential versus specific skills as what brands them in the market. It is easy to fall into this trap if assessment, admissions, and brand aren’t thought through.\n4. proof-of-skill creep - many universities experience grade inflation, which makes differentiation difficult. For a learning DAO to maintain the value of it’s credentials, it will need to ensure decentralized management holds the same bar\n\n## Credentials \n\nCredentials are one of the most cited uses of web3 in edtech. Verified credentials about one’s education history could be shared in a blockchains immutable ledger. MIT has been using blockchains to release transcripts since 2015. Originally called [Blockcerts Wallet](https://www.blockcerts.org/about.html), it's an open standard for blockchain credentials created by the MIT Media Lab.\n\nMIT isn't the only one. Maryville also allows students to access blockchain-based transcripts. They use pistis.io. Traditional higher education news outlets such as [Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/blogs/online-trending-now/fresh-look-blockchain-higher-ed) have been writing about this space for years. Despite being one of the longest discussed use cases, a singular platform for blockchain transcripts hasn't broken through.\n\nProfessor Beau Brannan at Pepperdine [experimented](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/education-nfts-replace-diplomas-resumes-beau-brannan/?trackingId=0x6MEMP9RWu5Xb022BP2Yg%3D%3D) with minting NFTs for his college finance class on the OpenSea platform.\n\nNFTs are likely not the right platform for credentials however given they can be freely transferred. This isn't core (in fact really antithetical) to the use case of transcripts. A blockchain entry should be sufficient to demonstrate provenance, so we’ll have to wait and see if another platform reaches mass consumer scale for this use case in the future. \n\nAnother exciting potential in credentials is real-time skill acquisition and display. Given crypto credentials can be earned for individual tasks, a student wouldn't need to wait 4 years to get credit for their knowledge. Real-time progress of their degree could be visible for all anytime. If an employer decides xyz skills or 75% is enough, the learner may not need to go further.\n\nPeople are calling this [\"proof of skill\"](https://twitter.com/grant_nissly/status/1377229994850717698) and it overlaps with the world of \"competency based education\" = a movement in education that has tried to give learners credit for what they know, not just butt-in-seat or [Carnegie hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Unit_and_Student_Hour) which are based off of hours spent in class.\n\nHere’s a few things crypto credentialing platforms will need to get right:\n\n1. partnerships with employers - new forms of credentials have long been hard to establish because adoption by employers is slow. it’s easy for them to rely on top college rankings\n2. review sites for DAOs and crypto credential issuer - as any new industry emerges, consumers and employers need to sift through the noise. There are already nearly [1M DAO members](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/daos-where-are-you-going-where-have-you-been/) today\n3. public education and category creation - the hardest part of any new credential is acceptance by the public. new credentials will need to collaborate and share where they are finding pockets of acceptance so the whole industry can succeed.\n\n## Career Funding\n\nFormal education and credentialing is an important avenue for many forms of work. But there are some categories of work, especially those in the creative fields, where education takes the form of experimentation and exploration. Music, Art, and indeed any form of content creation, whether it be on Tiktok or movie screens can all fall into this category. But this experimentation needs resources. That’s what makes creator coins and securitized music such an interesting area of web3. These new categories allow supporters to invest in their favorite creators and receive a stake of their future income as a result, an area that turns patronage into investment, and is directly adjacent to education. I especially like creator coins and securitized music because college isn’t always a great fit for creatives. Creator coins can be a better fit for high risk, high reward professions that help artists avoid the starving artist fate.\n\nIf you’ve been in the education world for some time, this might sound a bit like ISAs or income share agreements. With student debt in the USA at $1.57 trillion or $36k on average, we do need more options. But, although a few schools still have them, ISAs never took off.\n\nSecuritized music is a specific subset of creator coins that focus on sharing a % of royalties. Companies like [Royal](https://royal.io/), [Vezt](https://www.vezt.co/) & others are defining the category.\n\nHere’s a few things creator coins and securitized music builders will need to get right:\n\n1. Clear design choice on fungible v NFT - tokens are fungible, NFTs are not. I’m seeing players build both right now. The NFTs definitely have supporter fan value, but may have different implications for liquidity and how creator coins are valued.\n2. Consumption v. hold focus? Platforms naturally want to provide an outlet for liquidity. Does this mean spending the currency on their platform for special 1v1 interactions with the artists? Does it mean creating a secondary exchange? What behavior do you want to drive with fans, speculation or real interest?\n3. First-come v gated access? Similar to learning DAOs, creator coin builders need to figure out if they want to reward loyal fans and give them access, thus seeding their initial users with more of a fan club audience, or open it up to the public, increasing the likelihood that prices rise quickly as crypto whales come in.\n\n## Freelancing on Blockchain\n\nFreelancer networks are being built on the blockchain like [Braintrust](https://www.usebraintrust.com/). In Freelancer-owned orgs, members earn a share of all the projects completed by other members and give input on governance. For example, when a client issue persists over time, disputes could go to a jury to determine new policies. These networks can also use tokens to reward new customers who refer business rather than a referral fee, potentially increasing the attractiveness of such an offer. The freelancing network could theoretically charge lower prices since platform take rates on places like Upwork or Fiverr are replaced with shared earnings. \n\nHere’s a few things freelancing platforms will need to get right:\n\n1. ejection of members - if someone is no longer pulling weight or begins performing poor quality tasks, how do you address or remove them while keeping in mind decentralized governance and their ownership stake\n2. handling losses - members share in gains, but what about projects where clients ask for refunds or aren’t satisfied with the work done?\n3. management of DAO tools - this type of group, perhaps more than most, may resemble a more traditional company that needs lots of shared resourcing and tools. there are now so many [tools supporting DAOs](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/daos-where-are-you-going-where-have-you-been/) that they’ll need to get a handle on everything available in addition to traditional corporate saas tools\n\n## What’s Next\n\nThese are just 5 areas where Web3 x Edtech are intersecting. There is truly so much more to build and I can’t wait for the future.\n\nWhen I think about where there are gaps in the market today between existing and future Web3 and Learning tools, I refer to a few market maps and frameworks I’ve used to think holistically about this sector in the past.\n\nWhen I look at HolonIQs education blockchain market map from 2018, before this current wave of crypto, there were already tons of examples of learning DAOs, learn to earn models, and credential solutions.\n\n![HolonIQ's market map from 2018 of Blockchain & Learning](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Pcn_bZ9ogD3snCtiNRw9C.png?height=831&width=1200)\n\nI also think about the five areas I’m seeing gain steam today in relation to two of my learning sector frameworks (see below and [here](https://medium.com/lightspeed-venture-partners/the-future-of-work-ers-fd22509128e), [here](https://mercebent.medium.com/lightspeeds-edtech-portfolio-f4a324b44dd6)).\n\n![From my Lightspeed Edtech Portfolio post](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4k4Yeo0TpF6MdCt4BGGIW.png?height=787&width=1400)\n\n![From my 2019 Future of Workers post](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SVE_RnyuwNO3KjzSn2qvE.png?height=787&width=1400)\n\n So given these frameworks, where am I hoping to see solutions for Web3 x Learning? Here’s just a few:\n\n* hiring platforms tied to DAOs\n* job-integrated proof of skill (like degreed)\n* assessment: proof of task does not equal mastery of concept\n* early childhood and k12: most of innovation today is for adults\n* corporate learning & internal mobility\n* career discovery\n* job search & hiring tools\n* on-the-job performance enablement tools\n\nThanks so much for reading this post and perhaps the tweet that inspired it. If you are forming a learning DAO, want to crowdfund a course, or are building startups solving any of the solutions areas, hit me up! I would love to continue the conversation.

{"id": "CWT_OSmD2i7RFE9u4pfk9UWQwwI1heCkCuQ97UVdu7Q", "title": "DAOs and Australia", "body": "![In this article, Mycelium explains DAOs and observes recent developments relating to the recognition of DAOs in Australia.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J4fe7fw95uEvxHbJurxxf.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n# What are DAOs?\n\nA decentralised autonomous organisation (***DAO***) is a new form of business structure whose governance is decentralised and encoded in one or more smart contracts. DAOs exist on blockchains and allow an infinite number of participants (including individuals, companies or other DAOs) to coordinate their decision-making and resources transparently.\n\nTo date, DAOs have been extremely effective in housing truly global organisations, particularly in the blockchain industry. DAOs are necessarily internet-based entities, and have been described as \"subreddits with bank accounts\". More often than not, performant blockchain projects successfully leverage effective DAO operations alongside an effective product offering. This has led to a critical mass of teams around the world thinking long and hard about how to best build a DAO.\n\nThe opportunity for DAO-friendly jurisdictions is enormous. We have observed communities form DAOs who now control billions of dollars in a variety of industries, including: software development, venture capital, online gaming, art galleries, charities, research institutions, content creation and more.\n\nThe staggering time and resource requirements faced by companies seeking to operate globally over the last 10-20 years have made it somewhat impossible for most business to serve a global audience. DAOs significantly reduce the barrier for businesses to start \"day 1 global\" and, as a result, will allow other industries to join the wave of growth and innovation that has been observed in the blockchain industry in recent years.\n\nMycelium predicts that, given the success and rise of the DAO business structure in recent years, the use of DAOs as business structures will continue to accelerate for projects both on and off chain.\n\n# How exactly are blockchains and smart contracts related to DAOs?\n\nA person describing the functionality of blockchains often references the Bitcoin blockchain. However, the Bitcoin blockchain is not the best example of a DAO-friendly blockchain.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is a fantastic \"one-account\" blockchain. That is, it's suited to numerous people around the world creating an account on the blockchain (each with a unique address), called an \"externally-owned account\" or \"EOA\". They can then send assets and messages to and from each others EOAs transparently.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain (and other blockchains launched since Bitcoin) operate effectively as \"two-account\" blockchains. In addition to EOAs, a second kind of account, known as a \"contract account\", can be used to write coded logic and \"deploy\" it to its own unique address. This form of account has become colloquially known as a \"smart contract\". A DAO is one form of smart contract, whose coded logic is designed represent governance rules, decided by the deployer.\n\n![A great example of a DAO being used to coordinate governance is Tracer DAO: https://tracer.finance/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tVY-kfhdvdk41HM2NAC-J.png?height=2480&width=3243)\n\n# Will DAOs be recognised in Australia?\n\nEarlier this year, in its submission to the Australian Senate's Select Committee on Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre (***Bragg Committee***), Mycelium recommended that a new kind of business structure be introduced in Australia which is suitable for DAOs. To achieve this, Mycelium recommended that the Australian Government should ratify the Coalition of Automated Legal Applications’ (***COALA’s***), Model Law for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (***DAO Model Law***). To learn more about the DAO Model Law, refer to [our previous article](https://medium.com/@mycelium/summary-the-dao-model-law-51fd4febbd4). Mycelium was not alone in this view: five other submissions to the Bragg Committee also cited the need to recognise DAOs in Australia (ANU, DLA, HSF, RMIT and Mills Oakley).\n\n![ANU, DLA, HSF, RMIT and Mills Oakley each recognise the need for a new kind of business structure in Australia for DAOs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/orvCHTgikN9Yze_F6pNiE.png?height=450&width=1410)\n\nYou can read the rest of Mycelium's recommendations in its [full submission to the Bragg Committee](https://www.aph.gov.au/sitecore/content/Home/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Financial_Technology_and_Regulatory_Technology/AusTechFinCentre/Submissions).\n\nLast month, the Committee released its final report. Recommendation four of that report was:\n\n> *\"The committee recommends that the Australian Government establish a new Decentralised Autonomous Organisation company structure.\"*\n\nRecommendation four is an groundbreaking confirmation from the Australian Senate about the future of DAOs in Australia.\n\n# What happens next?\n\nAt the most recent Senate Estimates, Committee Chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee Senator Paul Scarr raised the question of legislating and regulating DAOs to ASIC Chair Mr. Joe Longo, on the basis that, in his view:\n\n> *\"Australia has a real opportunity here to legislate with respect to decentralised autonomous organisations.\"*\n\nSenator Scarr asked ASIC whether it has done any relevant work on DAOs, and any observations it has in relation to the work done by the Bragg Committee. ASIC Chair Joe Longo replied:\n\n> *\"Decentralised autonomous organisations are a unique, curious entity... we have a lot to learn about how DAOs work... and we welcome the debate and the discussion.*\n>\n> *With corporations, there are people behind the entity, we call them boards. But boards don't exist with DAOs: they are a combination of smart contracts and artificial intelligence and how we think about regulating them is ahead of us. It's certainly an issue that ASIC is thinking about and we look forward to working with Treasury and other governments and other regulators to see how this new form, or grouping, can be part of the future.*\n>\n> *I think there is a lot of potential there, but also a lot of work ahead of us to engage with this idea which is clearly getting traction amongst the international academic community and clearly in Australia. We look forward to being part of that.\"*\n\nASIC Commissioner Cathie Armour added:\n\n> *\"I think it's an area we really need to think about in the future and it does pose some really interesting philosophical questions for the way, in Australia , we regulate organisations like companies... because it's a very different focus from an individual accountability.\"*\n\nWe look forward to working with the Australian Government and ASIC in recognising DAO entities in Australia.\n\n![Aaron worked closely with the Wyoming Government in preparing the DAO Bill, which now allows DAOs to register as LLCs in Wyoming.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5XE1sbMowvdLN4Ece45Dn.jpg?height=400&width=470)\n\nAaron Wright is a Professor at Cardozo Law and Co-founder at Tribute Labs, The LAO and Flamingo DAO. Aaron worked closely with the Wyoming Government in preparing the DAO Bill, which now enables DAOs to be recognised as Limited Liability Companies (***LLCs***) in Wyoming. To learn more about the Wyoming Bill, refer to our previous article. According to Aaron:\n\n> *\"My experience in Wyoming has been very promising in terms of how DAOs can be brought into traditional corporate structures.*\n>\n> *Australia has a real opportunity to follow Wyoming's lead in first understanding and second adopting an appropriate legislative regime for DAOs. I look forward to working with Mycelium and the Australian Government in finding an appropriate solution.\"*\n\nMycelium will continue advocating for the recognition of DAOs in Australia and abroad.

{"id": "MNZDolnXNsLRVqlV4NZgr52Dcy3zT3cCvHlgcYY7jXA", "title": "やせた私、 “個性を手に入れた”と思ってしまった", "body": "私には個性がない” \n  \n そう悩んでいた15歳の高校生が始めたのはダイエットでした。体重が落ち始めたころ、ほめことばに聞こえた「やせてかわいくなった」。 \n  \n やがてそれは「やせてなければいけない」という脅迫に聞こえるようになっていきました。 \n （ネットワーク報道部 吉永なつみ）\n\n## 夢だったアイドル　心に刺さったことば\n\n彼女の名前は尾形春水さん。人気アイドルグループ「モーニング娘。」のメンバーでした。 \n  \n 小さい頃から周囲の視線を集めることが好きで、その原点は5歳で始めたフィギュアスケートでした。スケートリンクに立った時に、自分だけに注がれる視線が今でも忘れられないといいます。\n\n尾形春水さん \n 「まったく緊張しないし、楽しくて、ステージに立ちたいと思う原点だったと思います」\n\n放課後も週末もスケート教室に通う練習漬けの生活を10年続け、中学3年生の時にずっと目指していた日本スケート連盟の技術試験６級に合格、スケートからいったん距離を置くことにしました。 \n  \n アイドル好きだった尾形さんが、次の挑戦の場に選んだのはモーニング娘。のオーディションでした。そして厳しい選抜をくぐり抜けて合格します。\n\n尾形さん \n 「スケートの時よりもっと大きなステージに立てると思うと、ただただ先が楽しみでした」\n\nところが歌もダンスも経験がなかった尾形さん、すぐに“ここでは戦えない”と思うようになります。 \n  \n デビューするシングル曲の振り付けが、なかなか覚えられません。 \n  \n 他のメンバーが次々と振り付けをこなす中、尾形さんはミスを指摘されても何ができていないのかが、分かりませんでした。 \n  \n 劣等感にさいなまされている時に、自分へのＳＮＳの投稿が目にとまりました。\n\n「新メンバーの子、ガタイが大きい」 \n 「かわいいけど太ってる」 \n  \n 投稿は心に刺さりました。\n\n尾形さん \n 「私は、歌もうまくない、ダンスもうまくない、トークもおもしろくない。秀でた個性がないとずっと悩んでいました」 \n 「投稿を見た時、“個性を手に入れなくちゃ、それはやせることなんだ、それしかないんだ”と思い込んだんです」\n\n## やせた時、個性を勘違いした\n\n動画投稿サイトで「やせる」と紹介されている方法を次々と試しました。 \n  \n 白米やパンは食べない。 \n  \n 朝ご飯はスムージーだけ。 \n  \n ロケで出るお弁当はおかずしか食べない。 \n  \n 一方で毎日のダンスのレッスンは激しく、体重はみるみる落ち始めました。真っ先に反応してくれたのはＳＮＳなどのファンの声でした。\n\n「はーちん、やせてかわいくなった」 \n 「ビジュアル担当！」 \n  \n “やっと個性を手に入れた”、そう思いました。\n\n極端な食生活はエスカレートしていきます。食べ物の量や種類に独自のルールを作って自分を管理しました。体はやせ細り、身長と体重から割り出す指標「ＢＭＩ」は一時期、14になりました。\n\n肥満や、やせすぎを判定する国際的な指標で、18.5未満がやせすぎです。14はやせの重症度が高い危険な状態とされています。生理も止まってしまい、体力も落ちていきます。 \n  \n “歩くだけで疲れる” \n “生きているだけでしんどい” \n  \n そんな状態では舞台袖で出番を待つ間も立っていられず、隅でしゃがみこんでいました。以前ほめことばに聞こえていた「やせてかわいくなった」が、やがて脅迫に聞こえるようになります。\n\n“中身じゃなくてこの形の私が好みなんでしょ” \n  \n “太ったらファンじゃなくなるんでしょ”\n\nそう、思うようになりました。\n\n## 仲間が信じられない “私を太らせようとしているんでしょ”\n\nやせ過ぎた尾形さんに何人ものメンバーが「ちゃんと食べなよ」と、声をかけてくれました。そのことばを自分をだまそうとしているのだと受け取りました。\n\n尾形さん \n 「“ライバルの私を太らせて、手に入れた人気を落とそうとしているんだ”、メンバーは本気で心配してくれていたのに、私はそう思ってしまいました」\n\n極端な食生活とすさんだ心持ちは1年ほど続きました。考えが変わるきっかけは中学高校時代から仲のよい地元の友人の連絡でした。\n\n「最近ご飯ちゃんと食べてる？見た目も全然違っちゃってるからもう知ってる \n 尾形春水じゃなくて、アイドルのはーちんって呼ばなきゃいけないな（笑）」 \n  \n 何気ない文面の中にあった「ご飯ちゃんと食べてる」という問いかけに気持ちが動かされたのです。\n\n尾形さん \n 「私をよく知っている人から見ても本当にやせすぎなんだ、私、危険なんだと目が覚めました。ゆっくりでいいから元に戻そうとやっと思えるようになりました」\n\nただ自分をゆっくりと元に戻すのは簡単ではありませんでした。我慢していたぶん、食べ物がおいしくてたまりません。 \n  \n “3日分くらいの食料を買いすぐ全部食べてしまう” \n “夜中で何か口に運んでいる” \n 　 \n そんな行動で体型はまた急激に変化していきました。\n\n尾形さん \n 「少し太ると“個性がなくなった”と思ってしまう、そうした思い込みからまだ離れられませんでした」\n\nそしてだんだんと、以前から抱いていた「大学で学びたい」という気持ちが強くなり、悩んだ末に学業に専念することを決意。グループには19歳まで在籍して卒業しました。\n\n## 投稿した、まねしてほしくない姿\n\n22歳になった尾形さんはいま、大学に通いながらユーチューバーとして活動しています。 \n  \n 時間はかかりましたが好きなものを食べ、好きなことをして生きてると思えるようにやっとなったといいます。 \n  \n 去年、アイドル時代の無理なダイエットで心と体がどうなったのか、「絶対にまねしてほしくない」という思いから当時の写真をつけて投稿しました。\n\n投稿には同じ苦しみを経験した人から、コメントが寄せられました。\n\n「ダイエットをしていて拒食症になり、かなり体重は落ちたけど、あるきっかけで過食症に変わった」「それから10年、過食症が治らず人生かなり苦労しています」 \n 「私も28キロまで痩せたことあるけど、なにもいいことなかった」 \n 「今もまだ体戻ってないし、極端なダイエットはほんとダメ」 \n 「私摂食障害で同じような恐怖と罪悪感に毎日襲われてた」\n\nコメントにあった「摂食障害」は拒食症や過食症といった名前でも知られています。（尾形さん自身は心療内科などを受診してなく、摂食障害と診断されたわけではありません） \n  \n 医療機関につながっていないケースを含めると、症状がある人は全国に数十万人いると推計する医師もいます。専門家は尾形さんのように“やせないといけない”という思いがきっかけになるケースが多いといいます。\n\n## 達成感からのめり込んでしまう、悪循環\n\n「ダイエットをしたすべての人が摂食障害になるわけではありませんが、ほとんどすべての摂食障害はダイエットがきっかけで発症しています」\n\nそう話すのは摂食障害に詳しい精神科医の永田利彦さんです。\n\n永田利彦医師\n\n永田利彦医師 \n 「自分に自信がなかったり、生きづらさを抱えていたりすると、目に見える“成果”がすぐにでるダイエットが生きる救いになってしまうこともあるんです」 \n  \n 「そして体重が減ると達成感がある。周りからも褒められると、ますますのめり込んでしまうという悪循環です」\n\n摂食障害に有効な治療薬はなく、根気強くカウンセリングを続ける必要があり、回復には長い年月がかかるといいます。 \n 　 \n 「どう治療するか」以上に「どう発症させないか」が大事で、無理にやせようとすることの危うさに気付いてほしいと永田さんは訴えています。\n\n## コロナ禍で、子どもに摂食障害のリスク\n\nこの摂食障害、コロナ禍で子どもたちが、症状を持つリスクが高まっていると考える専門家もいます。 \n  \n 獨協医科大学埼玉医療センター子どものこころ診療センターの作田亮一教授です。\n\n作田亮一教授\n\n摂食障害の疑いで初めてセンターを受診する小中学生を調べたところ、去年1年間で70人となり前の年より60％も増えていました。例年は30人前後なのに、ことしも9月までにすでに37人となっています。\n\nある中学生は新型コロナの影響で休校になった時、運動不足が気になりネットで調べた方法でダイエットを始めました。 \n  \n 食べる量を減らし筋トレをして体重が1年半で12キロ落ちました。センターに来たのは症状が出てから1年以上たってからでした。 \n  \n ダイエットのきっかけがコロナ禍の運動不足でネット情報を参考に始めたというケースは、ほかの子どもでも相次いでいます。 \n  \n そしてふだん接している家族でも、症状を見落とすことが多いと言います。\n\n作田亮一教授 \n 「親世代が“やせること＝頑張っている” “太る＝怠けている”といったイメージを持っていて多かれ少なかれダイエットの経験があります」。 \n  \n 「子どもが急にやせることを “注意すべきこと”と思わず、リスクを見落とすことがあるんです」 \n  \n 「子どもたちは繊細で素直で影響されやすいのです。大人たちはどんな状況でも、適切な食事と睡眠、適度な運動が大切だと伝え続ける必要があります」\n\n## “あなたのままでいい”\n\n“コロナ禍で症状に悩む子どもが増えているんです”と尾形春水さんに話した時でした。 \n  \n 尾形さんは \n 「私がそうだったように、自分に自信が持てないと誰にでも起こりうることだと思います。“あなたはあなたのままでいいんだよ”とそのままを認めてくれる、そんな社会になるといいなと思います」と言いました。\n\n“あなたのままでいいんだよ”ということばを聞いた時、これまで摂食障害の取材で、私に時間を割いてくれた人たちのことを思いました。 \n  \n 彼女たちの話しを聞いていると拒食や食べ吐きのきっかけになる「ありのままでいられない、自分らしくいられない生きづらさ」に、私自身、共感するところがたくさんありました。 \n  \n 生きづらさのひとつが「女性はこうあるべきだ」という世の中のあちこちにあふれるメッセージで、「やせているほうが美しい」というメッセージも、まるで手本とすべき“ふつう”であるかのように世の中に漂っています。　　　　　 \n  \n 食べることに問題を抱えるのは、自分らしくいられない生きづらさが背景にあって苦しんでいるのだということを多くの人に知ってほしいと思っています。 \n  \n また摂食障害は本人が自覚しにくく、家族や友人など周囲の人の気付きが治療につながります。 \n  \n ・自分の意思で食事をコントロールできていない。 \n ・食事や体重に生活が振り回されている。 \n  \n そんな行動に気付いた時は、心療内科や精神科に、子どもの場合は、かかりつけの小児科などに相談してください。 \n  \n 地域の精神保健福祉センターや保健所などで相談を受け付けている場合もあります。", "timestamp": 1636697326, "digest": "kBxPyzZuIbbsqr-7uaPshwEBXyf9HB_QjO2cYzLIjdY", "contributor":

{"id": "wmU-NtqA0JHiCOL71C0WKmc-2s21QbfYzNiVytbQqFo", "title": "Idle Finance: Bringing the next wave of users into DeFi", "body": "Let’s see. Unprecedented yields, constantly rising TVLs, and more mature, sophisticated products being constantly launched. If you’re plugged into the DeFi ecosystem, this could well be one of the most exciting times of your life.\n\nStill, if this feels huge now, the real wave is yet to come. Institutions are still waiting on the sidelines, (though we are seeing increasing efforts with CeDeFi) and mainstream users are yet to be onboard.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*MeigNzuXnkzMq5UcgumV2g.png)\n\nBased on that conviction, LongHash Ventures has chosen to invest into [Idle Finance](https://idle.finance/), a yield aggregation protocol that we believe will be well-positioned to capture a significant slice of the pie and bring the next wave of mainstream users into DeFi.\n\n## So you say: Yield aggregators?\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*bHkQ1HNiXVKd5iN_Jx1DCw.png)\n\nA core tenet of DeFi is its permissionless access. The easiest way to understand this in the traditional sense: Imagine if you had access to every savings account available in the world, and could move your funds in and out frictionlessly.\n\nTo truly capitalize on this in DeFi, you would need to ensure that your funds are constantly earning you the best possible interest rate, which is exactly what Idle Finance does — pooling together user liquidity and moving them between the different lending protocols depending on their current rates.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BYAMgwJX0oLGl9AUhkttig.png)\n\nOne distinguishing feature of Idle Finance as a rebalancing protocol is that funds are also being rebalanced or allocated in the most efficient way to provide the best yield.\n\nThis avoids a “ping-pong” effect where for instance, the current yield on USDC offered at Aave drops below that of Compound as a result of Idle Finance’s significant volume being deployed into Aave. Funds would then have to be shifted again, possibly leading to the same outcome.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*cFaJaVGRuLVPskpX1I3aNg.png)\n\nWith Idle Finance, the utilization rates of the various lending protocols are taken into account as each pool of funds is allocated between them such that as a user, you can rest assured that you’re getting the best yield possible.\n\nYield optimization will continue to be a much-needed primitive in DeFi, and no matter how many new DeFi protocols arise, the best aggregators like Idle Finance will be here to stay.\n\n## The user experience: Keeping it simple\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*9uQgmRUQfHK4_kyaV-9KsA.png)\n\nWe expect that the next wave of mainstream users dipping their toes into DeFi won’t be the ones who are diving deep into every new yield farming opportunity available but will be those who are simply looking for a way to beat inflation, especially as interest rates are at historic lows. And yet, an often overlooked aspect of DeFi is the challenging user experience and steep learning curve for beginners.\n\nIdle Finance is well-positioned to take advantage of that and be *the* entry point for DeFi for such users. Just as how robo-advisors have gained popularity in recent years due to their low barriers into investment, DeFi protocols should also be simpler, without requiring users to personally choose and jump between protocols.\n\nOn Idle Finance, with just a couple of clicks in a simple interface, a DeFi beginner can easily deploy their available funds into a pool and watch as their interest grows over time.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*oT-j48xo2Y2tIWos4KnXzQ.png)\n\n## Come for the yield, stay for the security\n\nIn the unrelenting chase for yield, projects and users sometimes compromise on the key element of security. What we particularly like about Idle Finance is their focus on reliability and security.\n\nWhen liquidity mining exploded in the summer of 2020 and many projects fast-tracked the launch of their liquidity mining mechanisms, Idle Finance chose to double down on their security efforts instead. This meant going through multiple extensive audits (Quantstamp themselves are also an investor) and rolling out their platform in stages, as opposed to launching a token first and putting their users at risk.\n\nThis security-first approach is also reflected in its products, with alternative risk-adjusted strategies offered, providing risk-averse users with the option to deploy their funds into less risky protocols.\n\nWhen B2B integrators are looking for a DeFi protocol to deploy their users’ funds into, their top priority wouldn’t be chasing the highest yield, but integrating the protocol with the best security and practices.\n\n## Life in the Idle (Finance) lane\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*iR72cxM3dy7nge9JOfO6ug.png)\n\nIf you’re reading this and need a sign to jump on the DeFi bandwagon, let this be it. In a short period of time, Idle Finance has already:\n\n* Achieved a peak of >$200M total value locked (TVL)\n* Implemented a Smart Treasury and other cool features like batch deposits\n* Integrated with other leading DeFi protocols such as Harvest and Yearn\n\nAs a protocol that optimizes for the best yield, simplifies the user experience, and takes on a security-first approach, Idle Finance can be your entry into DeFi, helping you ensure that your valuable funds are never kept idle.

Analysts continue to expect further upside for cryptocurrencies despite short-term price swings.\n\n“Volatile price moves are always around the corner,” Nicholas Cawley, an analyst at [DailyFX](https://www.dailyfx.com/), wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “Longer-term traders in BTC and \\[ether\\] ETH may use this recent sell-off to build their positions as sentiment going forward remains positive,” Cawley wrote.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 20 secondsVolume 90%\n\n \n\nOther analysts pointed to the upcoming Bitcoin blockchain [Taproot](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/26/taproot-bitcoins-next-big-upgrade-might-already-be-priced-in/) upgrade as a bullish event for BTC’s price.\n\n“The Taproot upgrade will likely be activated by the end of this week or early next week,” crypto trading firm [QCP Capital](https://qcp.capital/) wrote in a Telegram announcement. “This is the largest upgrade since SegWit in 2017 and will improve a whole string of key functions,” QCP wrote. The firm is holding onto long BTC positions into the network upgrade event.\n\n## Latest prices\n\n* Bitcoin (BTC): $65,845, -1.66%\n* Ether (ETH): $4,737, +2.07%\n* S&P 500: $4,649, +0.05%\n* Gold: $1,863, +0.77%\n* 10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.57%\n\nMeanwhile, at [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/prime), the exchange’s trading desk continues to have higher volumes. “Although this behavior is quite common each time we approach \\[cryptocurrency\\] record highs, the current rally feels less mania driven and more supported by fundamentals, such as the Taproot upgrade, and genuine demand from investors,” the exchange wrote in a newsletter to institutional clients this week.\n\nSHIB continues to dominate Coinbase exchange volume market share at 18.16%, while ETH and BTC are at 12.7% and 10.85%, respectively.\n\n## Bitcoin long liquidations\n\nApproximately $64 million of long BTC positions were liquidated within two hours of bitcoin’s all-time price high near $69,000 on Wednesday, according to data compiled by [Glassnode](https://forum.glassnode.com/t/situation-room-bitcoin-69k-flush-out/1906).\n\nAs traders began to take some profits, BTC’s price dropped toward the $63,000 price level. The sell-off appeared to be fueled by a reduction in leveraged positions.\n\n## Ether bullish option activity\n\nOptions traders are overwhelmingly bullish on ether after the cryptocurrency reached an all-time price high around $4,800 on Wednesday. The chart below shows the largest amount of open interest at the $5,000 ETH strike price, followed by $10,000 and $15,000.\n\nSome analysts maintain high price targets for ether this year. “We continue to expect ETH to outperform and to reach our price target of $10,500,” FundStrat, a global advisory firm, wrote in a newsletter this week.\n\nOpen interest is the total amount of outstanding contracts that have not been settled. [Call options](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/040915/guide-option-trading-strategies-beginners.asp) provide the holder with the right to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price until a defined expiration date.

Or maybe even tweets?**\n\nWell, remember the side-eyeing Chloe meme? Or nyan cat? These were bought for a whopping $76,377.50 and $590,000, respectively.\n\nWhat about this [tweet](https://twitter.com/jack/status/20?lang=en) that sold for $2.9 million? Or maybe the digital artwork by Beeple for $69 million?\n\nAnd lastly, that short clip of Lebron James dunking for $200,000. Might as well buy several cars, right?\n\n**NFTs, collectively, have gone up to around $2.5B in sales, and that’s just for the first half of 2021.** \n\nNow, what are these NFTs that have been selling for such an amount? These stand for Non-Fungible Tokens, which are digital assets that are unique and cannot be duplicated. These come in many forms – digital collectibles, music, art, in-game tokens/characters/skins. Some popular examples are Axies, which are tiny little monsters from the famous game Axie Inifinity. But we’ll get to that later.\n\nNFTs are one of the many new notable assets in the cryptocurrency space. These can be sold in (NFT) marketplaces such as Rarible, Opensea, Enjin, and many more including cryptocurrency exchanges/platforms such as Binance, crypto.com, and etc. Unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs have different values that vary. Similarly, both have values that fluctuate and differ.\n\nNow, there are a lot of factors that contribute to its value, such as ownership history, reputation, rarity, utility, and etc. For example, that artwork that was sold for $69 million is by Beeple, a well known digital artist. Another example is when Dolce & Gabbana sold their first NFT collection that sold for around $5.7 million.\n\n**So, going back to NFT basics**.\n\nOne might argue that you can just right click and save the picture, and in that way, you can get the picture for free. Well, technically, anyone can do this. But the difference is, one has value, and the other does not. Just like when you print a picture of the famous Mona Lisa from the internet. It isn’t the same as owning the original. What makes buying different is that you get a digital certificate, which serves as a proof of ownership. You, and everyone else can access and see who previously owned the NFT. This is made possible by the blockchain. But take note that only one person can own an NFT at a time, except for fractional (ownership) NFTs. And yes, you can buy and sell NFTs - and also make one! Some have had major life changes selling their work. And even flipping NFTs (both positive and negative changes though). The process is a bit comparable to flipping houses *IRL.* Making your own NFT brand is also somewhat similar to opening a business - wherein the success of it depends on several factors such as marketing, quality, and so much more.\n\n**Spending massive amounts for jpegs, videos, or whatnot might seem absurd for some**. \n\nBut when you think about it, it’s not too far from collecting paintings, bags, Funko Pops, shoes, and etc. Some people also buy it for bragging rights. Going back, these can be an investment and/or collection for some. A lot of celebrities and artists like Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ellen DeGeneres, Steve Aoki, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, Reese Witherspoon, and many more have gotten into buying NFTs.\n\n**For artists and creators**, NFTs are a *huge* advantage as it enables them to have control over their work and their ownership - especially for those that greatly value intellectual property rights, software licensing, and the like. Artists also get a royalty fee whenever their work is resold; unlike for physical paintings that will only allow the artist to earn after it being sold for the first time. Talk about giving credit where it’s due, right?\n\nOverall, NFTs look like they’re *probably* here to stay, as it offers a huge improvement in the digital world - both for the creators and users. The concept of collecting is no different than the concept of collecting designer shoes. This one only comes with extra steps though, but the concept of it is somewhat the same. As for those that flip NFTs, it comes with risk too, just as with any other investments - even outside the cryptocurrency space.", "timestamp": 1636701677, "digest": "ISc79ey8_8pjoRnlxNw2jATjottouURvswRJUqRCftA", "contributor": "0x4ee97cd6c432dBDb0059Da2010e5D8d0566D390d"}

My version of the story is no more important than any other, but we’ve got to start somewhere. So, here it goes.\n\nI’ve watched DAOs from the sidelines for years.\n\nHappily, I missed the boat on “[The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization))” - one of the first large-scale attempts to democratize governance over publicly invested funds. In 2016, this project failed spectacularly after a hacker drained the smart contract to the tune of $55 million. Long story short, this event spurred the heated debate that lead to the community splitting into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

Probably through no fault of the SquiggleDAO, I just didn’t see any opportunities to get involved that captured my interest, so I continue to root for them from the sidelines.\n\nMeanwhile, DAO tooling continued to mature. Established Web3 companies, like Gitcoin, distributed their governance to a DAO. Friends With Benefits, a social club DAO, raised venture capital funding. Twitter never missed an opportunity to remind that DAOs would eat the world.\n\nCall me dense, but I still couldn’t read the signs. It was clear that DAOs could generate value, but I still didn’t grok where I could play a role. And then, two months ago, that changed.\n\n### The “What”\n\nNader Dabit, best to known to me for JavaScript and AWS conference talks and blog content, live streamed his way through an Ethereum NFT deployment. There was a rough sketch of a game plan: the smart contract to be deployed was a derivative (read: clone) of dhof’s Loot project that had the NFT world abuzz.\n\nWhereas each Loot NFT contained a list of gaming-inspired items (e.g., Leather Boots of Protection), Nader’s NFT contained a list of traits that a developer might have: a programming language, a text editor, an industry, and so on. While this is mildly interesting on its own, the important bit is that each of these NFTs was to signify membership in a community.\n\n[https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1433880659773333511?s=20](https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1433880659773333511?s=20)\n\nThe pitch: anyone who mints one of these free (+ transaction fee) tokens would be a member of the Developer DAO. Anything created by the DAO would be collectively governed. Anything monetized by the DAO would end up in a treasury to be managed by members. All skill levels were welcome - we’d learn together along the way.\n\nFinally, DAOs clicked for me in a very real way. There was beauty in the simplicity. I understood that I could put my experience in open source software and content creation to work, helping to level up developers, while building value in something I help govern.\n\nThings moved quickly right out of the gate. Perfect strangers went about setting up a Discord server, creating a GitHub org and a Discourse forum, buying web and ENS domains, and spinning up websites for viewing developer traits, finding available tokens, and minting new ones. A dozen or so members volunteered to moderate the chat server and went about creating requested channels and helping onboard the first members. One team got right to work on a pixel avatar derivative NFT.\n\n![Derivative pixel avatars, a community project](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qHtTHZ2Y6f1sT_wKdwc9_.png?height=377&width=367)\n\n### The “Why”\n\nIt quickly became clear that, as a community, we needed a common lens to evaluate how to focus our energy. Members were given a place to answer the question, “what brings you here?” Following a wide range of answers and discussions around them, we narrowed in on a set of repeating themes. The DAO had its [first snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/QmdZQD8h28PiWwwsdJo5mD2DBdC7BvYzrktmbsMoP4AcP6) to ratify the founding mission, values, and goals of the organization.\n\n**The mission:**\n\n> *Developer DAO exists to accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of Web3 builders.*\n\n**The values:**\n\n> * *Transparency (open source everything, conversations in public, document and share the journey)*\n> * *Diversity and Inclusion (seek to foster as diverse a membership as possible and support everyone to contribute)*\n> * *Responsibility (as a self-governed community we rely on members to be personally responsible for their actions and commitments to the community)*\n> * *Kindness and empathy (we know that we are living in a complex, stressful, and diverse world and go out of our way to make people’s lives and days better through our interactions)*\n\n**The goals:**\n\n> * *Onboard, educate, and support Web3 developers*\n> * *Foster and build Web3 tools and public goods*\n\nImportantly, these aspirations revolve around building, learning, and sharing those lessons learned along the way. This is distinctly different from organizations that exist to maximize assets.\n\nOne thing that members of this DAO have been especially good at is learning in public. Technical channels in the chat server have a steady stream of questions and humble  attempts to answer. “Aha” moments are celebrated and egos are surprisingly quiet.\n\nI believe the tone was aptly set by Nader’s deployment of the NFT on day one: a live stream event, later described as “a bit of a YOLO launch,” where all were invited and it wrapped up just in time to get to another meeting.\n\nThere’s a couple of small blunders in the NFT metadata which feel charming now: an improperly escaped ampersand character, which causes OpenSea not to render the SVG, and the misspelling of São Paulo as one of the trait locations. While I grimaced when I first noticed these, I now appreciate them as reminders not to take ourselves too seriously and that a YOLO launch is sometimes way better than no launch.\n\n### The “How”\n\nHaving agreed on why we’ve gathered, the next step was to figure out how best to move forward. It turns out that a community with several thousand members needs a bit of organization if its going to achieve any goal.\n\nWhat followed was a chaotic and occasionally overwhelming process of sifting through a steady barrage of suggestions from members, ranging from simple and straightforward to wildly ambitious. I believe the messy process of figuring out where we’re headed helped inspire a vision of the future that could be shaped by any one of us. Those with more crisp and actionable ideas, and the time to develop them, began to emerge as natural leaders.\n\nIn the end, some short-term next steps were distilled and those are contained in the DAO’s [second governance vote](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x52fc76fe5865cf038b89b8c6ef78b6e691c0ab9c2b1228b84b0813b7832ce369) to define what we hope to achieve by the end of the year. Borrowing from DAOs that have come before us, we’re calling this period “Season 0” and the broad idea is to organize membership into *guilds*, e.g., the Community Guild, the Design Guild, and so on. I’ve volunteered to head up the Writers Guild to kick things off; hopefully by this point in the post I haven’t convinced you that this was a mistake. More of the logistics can be found within the linked proposal.\n\n### The Future\n\nAt this point, you’re all caught up! It’s only been two months after all.\n\nA wide and exciting range of events, open source tools, learning platforms, spinoffs, and acquisitions have been proposed by members. Ideally, the guild infrastructure will enable our great many creative and motivated members to get designing, hacking, and shipping many of these ideas into the world.\n\nIt’ll be an iterative process and there’s plenty left to figure out, but the future feels bright. And lucky us, you’re just in time! We’d love for you to jump in and help us figure this whole thing out.\n\nClosing with Nader’s unassuming opening to the live streamed launch:\n\n> *“Alright. So, we’re here for another unprompted stream, but I have something really cool that I want to do today that I think is going to be pretty interesting.”*\n\nSo far, so good.\n\n🤝 wagmi 🤝", "timestamp": 1636701702, "digest": "3xNVnnuys7o3GM-d3EdRI90AfsmlKeBDU4xzbvrbpi0", "contributor": "0x378ff65Cb9E9B83B86AA2534c9991e5B28F1Ec92"}

I understood that I could put my experience in open source software and content creation to work, helping to level up developers, while building value in something I help govern.\n\nThings moved quickly right out of the gate. Perfect strangers went about setting up a Discord server, creating a GitHub org and a Discourse forum, buying web and ENS domains, and spinning up websites for viewing developer traits, finding available tokens, and minting new ones. A dozen or so members volunteered to moderate the chat server and went about creating requested channels and helping onboard the first members. One team got right to work on a pixel avatar derivative NFT.\n\n![Derivative pixel avatars, a community project](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qHtTHZ2Y6f1sT_wKdwc9_.png?height=377&width=367)\n\n### The “Why”\n\nIt quickly became clear that, as a community, we needed a common lens to evaluate how to focus our energy. Members were given a place to answer the question, “what brings you here?” Following a wide range of answers and discussions around them, we narrowed in on a set of repeating themes. The DAO had its [first snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/QmdZQD8h28PiWwwsdJo5mD2DBdC7BvYzrktmbsMoP4AcP6) to ratify the founding mission, values, and goals of the organization.\n\n**The mission:**\n\n> *Developer DAO exists to accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of Web3 builders.*\n\n**The values:**\n\n> * *Transparency (open source everything, conversations in public, document and share the journey)*\n> * *Diversity and Inclusion (seek to foster as diverse a membership as possible and support everyone to contribute)*\n> * *Responsibility (as a self-governed community we rely on members to be personally responsible for their actions and commitments to the community)*\n> * *Kindness and empathy (we know that we are living in a complex, stressful, and diverse world and go out of our way to make people’s lives and days better through our interactions)*\n\n**The goals:**\n\n> * *Onboard, educate, and support Web3 developers*\n> * *Foster and build Web3 tools and public goods*\n\nImportantly, these aspirations revolve around building, learning, and sharing those lessons learned along the way. This is distinctly different from organizations that exist to maximize assets.\n\nOne thing that members of this DAO have been especially good at is learning in public. Technical channels in the chat server have a steady stream of questions and humble  attempts to answer. “Aha” moments are celebrated and egos are surprisingly quiet.\n\nI believe the tone was aptly set by Nader’s deployment of the NFT on day one: a live stream event, later described as “a bit of a YOLO launch,” where all were invited and it wrapped up just in time to get to another meeting.\n\nThere’s a couple of small blunders in the NFT metadata which feel charming now: an improperly escaped ampersand character, which causes OpenSea not to render the SVG, and the misspelling of São Paulo as one of the trait locations. While I grimaced when I first noticed these, I now appreciate them as reminders not to take ourselves too seriously and that a YOLO launch is sometimes way better than no launch.\n\n### The “How”\n\nHaving agreed on why we’ve gathered, the next step was to figure out how best to move forward. It turns out that a community with several thousand members needs a bit of organization if its going to achieve any goal.\n\nWhat followed was a chaotic and occasionally overwhelming process of sifting through a steady barrage of suggestions from members, ranging from simple and straightforward to wildly ambitious. I believe the messy process of figuring out where we’re headed helped inspire a vision of the future that could be shaped by any one of us. Those with more crisp and actionable ideas, and the time to develop them, began to emerge as natural leaders.\n\nIn the end, some short-term next steps were distilled and those are contained in the DAO’s [second governance vote](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x52fc76fe5865cf038b89b8c6ef78b6e691c0ab9c2b1228b84b0813b7832ce369) to define what we hope to achieve by the end of the year. Borrowing from DAOs that have come before us, we’re calling this period “Season 0” and the broad idea is to organize membership into *guilds*, e.g., the Community Guild, the Design Guild, and so on. I’ve volunteered to head up the Writers Guild to kick things off; hopefully by this point in the post I haven’t convinced you that this was a mistake. More of the logistics can be found within the linked proposal.\n\n### The Future\n\nAt this point, you’re all caught up! It’s only been two months after all.\n\nA wide and exciting range of events, open source tools, learning platforms, spinoffs, and acquisitions have been proposed by members. Ideally, the guild infrastructure will enable our great many creative and motivated members to get designing, hacking, and shipping many of these ideas into the world.\n\nIt’ll be an iterative process and there’s plenty left to figure out, but the future feels bright. And lucky us, you’re just in time! We’d love for you to jump in and help us figure this whole thing out.\n\nClosing with Nader’s unassuming opening to the live streamed launch:\n\n> *“Alright. So, we’re here for another unprompted stream, but I have something really cool that I want to do today that I think is going to be pretty interesting.”*\n\nSo far, so good.\n\n🤝 wagmi 🤝", "timestamp": 1636701702, "digest": "3xNVnnuys7o3GM-d3EdRI90AfsmlKeBDU4xzbvrbpi0", "contributor": "0x378ff65Cb9E9B83B86AA2534c9991e5B28F1Ec92"}

现在你已经通过运行独立进程确认了事情没有问题，重要的是我们以一种当Mina 进出死后会自动重启的方式启动它。\n\n首先用 `Ctrl-C` 杀死现有的 Mina 守护进程，然后继续阅读：\n\n### Ubuntu 18.04 / Debian 9\n\n为了产生区块或以其他方式定制 Mina 守护程序的配置，创建一个包含以下内容的文件`~/.mina-env`：\n\n```\nCODA_PRIVKEY_PASS=\"My_V3ry_S3cure_Password\"\nLOG_LEVEL=Info\nFILE_LOG_LEVEL=Debug\nEXTRA_FLAGS=\" --block-producer-key <BLOCK_PRODUCER_KEY_PATH>\"\n```\n\n确保将 `<BLOCK_PRODUCER_KEY_PATH>` 替换为您的区块链生产者私钥的完整路径，例如，`/home/ubuntu/keys/my-wallet`。\n\n如果你不打算生产区块，那么你可以暂时保持 `~/.mina-env` 为空。\n\n要改变 Mina 的配置方式，只需在 `EXTRA_FLAGS=\"\"` 的引号之间用空格分隔的参数向 Mina 守护进程指定标志。\n\n`mina systemd` 服务不再需要 `peers.txt` 文件，它只是使用 `PEERS_LIST_URL` 变量来决定从哪里获取初始对等体，mainnet 包的 `PEERS_LIST_URL` 默认为<https://storage.googleapis.com/mina-seed-lists/mainnet_seeds.txt>。\n\n一旦你的 `.mina-env` 准备好了，运行下面的命令来启动一个 Mina 节点实例并连接到实时网络:\n\n```\nsystemctl --user daemon-reload\nsystemctl --user start mina\nsystemctl --user enable mina\nsudo loginctl enable-linger\n```\n\n这些命令将允许节点在你注销后继续运行，并在机器重启时自动重新启动。\n\n默认情况下，节点使用默认的 `8302` 外部端口连接到网络。这可以用 `-external-port` 标志来改变，只要把它添加到 `EXTRA_FLAGS` 中即可。\n\n你也可以研究一下在后台运行并自动重启的 Mina 进程本身。\n\n这个命令会让你知道 Mina 在启动时是否有任何问题:\n\n```\nsystemctl --user status mina\n```\n\n你可以优雅地停止 Mina，并停止自动重新启动服务:\n\n```\nsystemctl --user stop mina\n```\n\n手动重启：\n\n```\nsystemctl --user restart mina\n```\n\n查看日志：\n\n```\njournalctl --user -u mina -n 1000 -f\n```\n\n在某些情况下，为了查看日志，你需要运行以下命令来代替：\n\n```\njournalctl --user-unit mina -n 1000 -f\n```\n\n该命令将向你显示最后 1000 行，并从那里开始追踪。\n\n### Docker\n\n当使用 Docker 运行你的守护程序时，首先确保你的私钥有正确的权限。\n\n```\ncd ~\nchmod 700 ~/keys\nchmod 600 ~/keys/my-wallet\nmkdir ~/.mina-config\n```\n\n现在，只需用你的密钥和 `~/.mina-config` 挂载运行该镜像。\n\n```\ndocker run --name mina -d \\\n-p 8302:8302 \\\n--restart=always \\\n--mount \"type=bind,source=`pwd`/keys,dst=/keys,readonly\" \\\n--mount \"type=bind,source=`pwd`/.mina-config,dst=/root/.mina-config\" \\\n-e CODA_PRIVKEY_PASS=\"My_V3ry_S3cure_Password\" \\\nminaprotocol/mina-daemon:1.2.0-fe51f1e-mainnet \\\ndaemon \\\n--block-producer-key /keys/my-wallet \\\n--peer-list-url https://storage.googleapis.com/mina-seed-lists/mainnet_seeds.txt\n```\n\n运行 `docker logs -f mina` 来跟踪日志，如果它崩溃了，就用 `docker logs mina > mina-log.txt` 将日志输出保存到文件中，并将输出发布到 `#mentor-nodes` 频道，或者将完整的 `~/.mina-config/mina.log` 附加到 github 问题中，并在 discord 中链接该问题。\n\n运行 `docker exec -it mina mina client status` 来监测与网络的连接，你应该很快找到至少 10 个节点，并观察块高度/最大观察块高度的攀升。\n\n> 注意：如果你在尝试运行 `Docker` 容器时遇到 `[Warn] Shutdown before Mina instance was created, not saving a visualization` ，请[增加Docker容器被允许使用的资源](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/)。\n\n## 检查连接\n\n现在我们已经启动了一个节点，并且正在运行 Mina 守护进程，打开另一个 shell 并运行以下命令：\n\n```\nmina client status\n```\n\n> 注意：在第一次启动时，Mina 客户端状态可能需要一分钟才能连接到守护进程。因此，如果你看到 `Error: daemon not running. see mina daemon`，只需等待一下，然后再试一下。\n\n最有可能的是，我们将看到一个包括以下字段的回应：\n\n```\n...\nPeers:                                         Total: 4 (...)\n...\nSync Status:                                   Bootstrap\n```\n\n如果你看到 `Sync Status:Bootstrap`，这意味着节点正在引导，需要与网络的其他部分同步。你可能需要在这里耐心等待，因为这一步可能需要一些时间让节点获得所有需要的数据。\n\n一段时间后，你的节点应该连接到更多的对等体，然后应该进入`Sync Status:Catchup`，这意味着我们正在收集最近的区块，并试图追赶最高的区块的状态。\n\n当同步状态达到 `Synced`，并且节点连接到 1 个或多个节点时，我们将成功连接到网络。我们在同步后也会看到相应的守护进程日志 `[Info] Mina daemon is now synced`。\n\n如果你的 `Bootstrap` 状态持续了一个多小时，你的端口配置可能有问题。\n\n## 更多\n\n现在我们有了一个完全同步的节点，我们可以学习守护程序的一些更高级的功能，如[发送付款](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en/using-mina/send-payment)和[抵押与委托](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en/using-mina/staking)。如果你想赚取更多的代币，请查看[基金会的委托计划](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en/advanced/foundation-delegation-program)。\n\n原文：\n\n[https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en/using-mina/connecting](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en/using-mina/connecting)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636702523, "digest": "_NuN6rDMuoVrGjhVgh5UNi5XA3sD_iGKvc8JGakV6Kw", "contributor": "0x3445a4f377Ff5Be3D22F990490236BA20fbFDF71"}

{"id": "Yfi73raZ0kXGqU7UiMWm0RJhVVmf_q0KoP2HDswfyEM", "title": "Hello Web3 World", "body": "My hope is to have the story of Developer DAO told through the voices of its many members from all over the globe. My version of the story is no more important than any other, but we’ve got to start somewhere. So, here it goes.\n\nI’ve watched DAOs from the sidelines for years.\n\nHappily, I missed the boat on “[The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization))” - one of the first large-scale attempts to democratize governance over publicly invested funds. In 2016, this project failed spectacularly after a hacker drained the smart contract to the tune of $55 million. Long story short, this event spurred the heated debate that led to the community splitting into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. For a time, DAO was a taboo acronym.\n\nAfter some hard lessons were learned in public and enough time had passed, interest resumed. Along the way, I had a hunch that MakerDAO and Aragon were building important tech, and that MolochDAO and MetaCartel were on to something interesting, but were just one-off experiments by friends that could afford to lose a few cryptobucks.\n\nI continued to watch with interest as art acquisition and curation DAOs sprouted up, and finally jumped in when SquiggleDAO came about. Art Blocks is a wonderful community and I believe Chromie Squiggles will hold a small, but important place in Internet history. However, my involvement started and ended there. Probably through no fault of the SquiggleDAO, I just didn’t see any opportunities to get involved that captured my interest, so I continue to root for them from the sidelines.\n\nMeanwhile, DAO tooling continued to mature. Established Web3 companies, like Gitcoin, distributed their governance to a DAO. Friends With Benefits, a social club DAO, raised venture capital funding. Twitter never missed an opportunity to remind that DAOs would eat the world.\n\nCall me dense, but I still couldn’t read the signs. It was clear that DAOs could generate value, but I still didn’t grok where I could play a role. And then, two months ago, that changed.\n\n### The “What”\n\nNader Dabit, best to known to me for JavaScript and AWS conference talks and blog content, live streamed his way through an Ethereum NFT deployment. There was a rough sketch of a game plan: the smart contract to be deployed was a derivative (read: clone) of dhof’s Loot project that had the NFT world abuzz.\n\nWhereas each Loot NFT contained a list of gaming-inspired items (e.g., Leather Boots of Protection), Nader’s NFT contained a list of traits that a developer might have: a programming language, a text editor, an industry, and so on. While this is mildly interesting on its own, the important bit is that each of these NFTs was to signify membership in a community.\n\n[https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1433880659773333511?s=20](https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1433880659773333511?s=20)\n\nThe pitch: anyone who mints one of these free (+ transaction fee) tokens would be a member of the Developer DAO. Anything created by the DAO would be collectively governed. Anything monetized by the DAO would end up in a treasury to be managed by members. All skill levels were welcome - we’d learn together along the way.\n\nFinally, DAOs clicked for me in a very real way. There was beauty in the simplicity. I understood that I could put my experience in open source software and content creation to work, helping to level up developers, while building value in something I help govern.\n\nThings moved quickly right out of the gate. Perfect strangers went about setting up a Discord server, creating a GitHub org and a Discourse forum, buying web and ENS domains, and spinning up websites for viewing developer traits, finding available tokens, and minting new ones. A dozen or so members volunteered to moderate the chat server and went about creating requested channels and helping onboard the first members. One team got right to work on a pixel avatar derivative NFT.\n\n![Derivative pixel avatars, a community project](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qHtTHZ2Y6f1sT_wKdwc9_.png?height=377&width=367)\n\n### The “Why”\n\nIt quickly became clear that, as a community, we needed a common lens to evaluate how to focus our energy. Members were given a place to answer the question, “what brings you here?” Following a wide range of answers and discussions around them, we narrowed in on a set of repeating themes. The DAO had its [first snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/QmdZQD8h28PiWwwsdJo5mD2DBdC7BvYzrktmbsMoP4AcP6) to ratify the founding mission, values, and goals of the organization.\n\n**The mission:**\n\n> *Developer DAO exists to accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of Web3 builders.*\n\n**The values:**\n\n> * *Transparency (open source everything, conversations in public, document and share the journey)*\n> * *Diversity and Inclusion (seek to foster as diverse a membership as possible and support everyone to contribute)*\n> * *Responsibility (as a self-governed community we rely on members to be personally responsible for their actions and commitments to the community)*\n> * *Kindness and empathy (we know that we are living in a complex, stressful, and diverse world and go out of our way to make people’s lives and days better through our interactions)*\n\n**The goals:**\n\n> * *Onboard, educate, and support Web3 developers*\n> * *Foster and build Web3 tools and public goods*\n\nImportantly, these aspirations revolve around building, learning, and sharing those lessons learned along the way. This is distinctly different from organizations that exist to maximize assets.\n\nOne thing that members of this DAO have been especially good at is learning in public. Technical channels in the chat server have a steady stream of questions and humble  attempts to answer. “Aha” moments are celebrated and egos are surprisingly quiet.\n\nI believe the tone was aptly set by Nader’s deployment of the NFT on day one: a live stream event, later described as “a bit of a YOLO launch,” where all were invited and it wrapped up just in time to get to another meeting.\n\nThere’s a couple of small blunders in the NFT metadata which feel charming now: an improperly escaped ampersand character, which causes OpenSea not to render the SVG, and the misspelling of São Paulo as one of the trait locations. While I grimaced when I first noticed these, I now appreciate them as reminders not to take ourselves too seriously and that a YOLO launch is sometimes way better than no launch.\n\n### The “How”\n\nHaving agreed on why we’ve gathered, the next step was to figure out how best to move forward. It turns out that a community with several thousand members needs a bit of organization if its going to achieve any goal.\n\nWhat followed was a chaotic and occasionally overwhelming process of sifting through a steady barrage of suggestions from members, ranging from simple and straightforward to wildly ambitious. I believe the messy process of figuring out where we’re headed helped inspire a vision of the future that could be shaped by any one of us. Those with more crisp and actionable ideas, and the time to develop them, began to emerge as natural leaders.\n\nIn the end, some short-term next steps were distilled and those are contained in the DAO’s [second governance vote](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x52fc76fe5865cf038b89b8c6ef78b6e691c0ab9c2b1228b84b0813b7832ce369) to define what we hope to achieve by the end of the year. Borrowing from DAOs that have come before us, we’re calling this period “Season 0” and the broad idea is to organize membership into *guilds*, e.g., the Community Guild, the Design Guild, and so on. I’ve volunteered to head up the Writers Guild to kick things off; hopefully by this point in the post I haven’t convinced you that this was a mistake. More of the logistics can be found within the linked proposal.\n\n### The Future\n\nAt this point, you’re all caught up! It’s only been two months after all.\n\nA wide and exciting range of events, open source tools, learning platforms, spinoffs, and acquisitions have been proposed by members. Ideally, the guild infrastructure will enable our great many creative and motivated members to get designing, hacking, and shipping many of these ideas into the world.\n\nIt’ll be an iterative process and there’s plenty left to figure out, but the future feels bright.

In this article, we will share with you what is grid trading and how to get started as well as some trading tips.\n\nYou can also watch our YouTube video below or download the [PPT file](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSswywSE2qNbMkitEwehGHxupmQlk1FwwKkjikqVtkoqFRo1fuRMTW6rVMt2P9uGWx-YUQwhou7EC5F/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).\n\n[https://youtu.be/b_E5qTO_TQE](https://youtu.be/b_E5qTO_TQE)\n\n> **What is grid trading?**\n\nTo put it simply, grid trading can help you take advantage of the market volatility and earn profits for you.\n\nAll markets involve volatility — even when there is a clear uptrend or downtrend, volatility still exists. Let’s have a look at this chart.\n\n![BTC/USDT Price](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5hUoobafvyMvuXNVmT1W_.png?height=612&width=1121)\n\nWhat if we can take advantage of this volatility and make profits? Let’s say if we can constantly buy low and sell high, that would be ideal, right? That’s exactly what grid trading does for you. It is not feasible for us human beings to watch the trading all the time as we need to sleep, we need to go out for date, we need to have fun, right? So why not have someone else do the job for you?\n\nThat’s exactly what grid trading does. It is a systematic approach that can automate the buying and selling process. All you need to do is to set up a price range and interval and then the trading bot will do its job.\n\n> **What is price range and interval?**\n\nA ***price range*** means you need to decide a range for the bot to trade. And an ***interval*** means you need to let the bot know how often a buy or sell instruction is implemented. For example, if we set up the interval at $1,000, we are basically telling the bot to place buy orders at every $1,000 below the current market price of Bitcoin, while also placing sell orders at every $1,000 above the Bitcoin’s market price.\n\n![Price Range & Interval](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K0NzkhYpfkne_LK7rq0He.png?height=589&width=1225)\n\n> **How price ranges and interval affect your P&L?**\n\nAs you can guess, grid trading performs the best when the market is trading sideways and when prices fluctuate in a given range. The more grids you set up, the narrower the interval will be, and thus the more frequently the trades will be executed. However, it also means the profit you make from each trade is lower.\n\nThus, it is a tradeoff between making small profits from many trades, versus a strategy with lower frequency but generates a bigger profit per order.\n\nLet’s see some examples. Here are two screenshots we get from KuCoin grid trading bot. Both bots have the same price range. On the LHS chart, you can see if we set the number of placed orders at 100, then profits per grid are between 0.30–0.69%, while if we set the number of placed orders at 50, profits per grid will be between 0.77–1.55%. So how to set up these parameters is quite important if you want to maximize your return.\n\n![No. of placed orders is larger but the interval is smaller as well as the profit per grid](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JIJo9sjOTtEpmgLV8hcS8.png?height=698&width=527)\n\n![No. of placed orders is smaller but the interval is larger as well as the profit per grid](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/efI2DvnGXxFIVS_Kg4__F.png?height=698&width=528)\n\n> **How to do grid trading?**\n\nPlease check out our step-by-step YouTube video below on how to start grid trading.\n\n[https://youtu.be/TitBIAFM820](https://youtu.be/TitBIAFM820)\n\nHow to do grid trading\n\n> **Trading tips**\n\n1. *Use the assets you already own when starting the grid trading*: if this button is turned off, that means the bot needs to buy some BTC when the trading starts, which could slightly increase your cost. If you turn on this button and have enough both BTC and USDT, you don’t need to place any orders at the beginning which effectively increases your money usage efficiency and lowers your cost. Therefore, the KuCoin official suggested we turn that function on if we do the grid trading.\n\n![Use the assets you already own](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rlnUsZuBYpl6igzXpXjgX.png?height=534&width=567)\n\n2\\. *Use Token/BTC rather than Token/USDT pair*: So that you can not only enjoy the increase in BTC amount but also the BTC price increase. But how to choose which pair we want to trade? If you go to the dropdown button, you can see all the token/BTC pairs and you can rank them by volatility. We want to use those with higher volatility.\n\nBut at the same time, we also need to pay attention to the price change. We don’t want to use those coins that have already seen a big price increase.\n\n![Find Token/BTC trading pairs that have high volatility](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2QWmlLNqzE1WS9o719oOT.png?height=537&width=668)\n\n3\\. *Profits from grid trading include two parts: grid profits and floating P&L*.\n\n* A reasonable entry price: Floating P&L can affect your overall return so if you believe a token price is already at a high level, don’t rush into the grid trading. Instead, you can wait for a reasonable price to get in.\n* A reasonable price range: Try to make sure the token price will not leave your price range in the next few days. If the price range is too narrow, even small price fluctuations will result in your bot stopping working.\n* A reasonable number of grid: More grids means profits in each grid is low, barely covering the trading fee in the worst case. But when the grid is too wide, orders may not trigger very often.\n\n![Grid profits/Floating PNL](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v9kC-SWE9TomWP5e20VCE.png?height=383&width=756)\n\n\n---\n\n**About Us**\n\n3Comma Research focuses on cryptocurrency investment and research and shares with you what we have learned during our investment.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe information provided here does not constitute investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or any other sort of advice.

According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, these negative divergences indicate scope for a price pullback.\n\nEther’s daily (24-hour) active addresses, a proxy for user participation, peaked above 670,000 at the end of October and has been declining ever since, diverging from the cryptocurrency’s rising price.\n\nNetwork usage affects the demand for cryptocurrency and can influence its price. An uptick in the number of active addresses along with a price increase is said to confirm an upward trend. So, analysts often question the sustainability of price gains whenever the price rally is accompanied by a drop in active user participation on the network.\n\nAnother reason to be cautious is the strong divergence between prices and trading volumes seen in the chart below.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n2S7zeUk4jlWkQkrm6Yh5.png?height=1080&width=1400)\n\nWhile ether continues to chart higher lows and higher highs, a sustained pick-up in daily trading volumes remains elusive. According to technical analysis theory, a low-volume rally is often short-lived.\n\nA similar bearish divergence is seen in ether’s social volume, a metric representing the degree of crowd chatter about ether on various social media channels, including Telegram groups and crypto subreddits.\n\n“A bunch of long-lasting divergences is pointing us to the idea that we need to go down,” Santiment noted in a market insights post published early on Friday. “These are really worrying.”\n\n“There is 50/50 chance market quite often moves up one more time after divergence... just to confuse traders,” Santiment said, adding that there could be one more push higher before a crash.\n\nEther’s technical studies also indicate uptrend fatigue.\n\nThe daily MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, is predicting lower highs, contradicting the higher price trend. The divergence indicates a weakening of bullish momentum and often precedes price drops.\n\nThat said, a pullback, if any, could be shallow and short-lived, as ether may be facing a supply squeeze, as noted in Tuesday’s First Mover newsletter.\n\nEther was trading near $4,745 at press time, representing a 10% gain for the month.

DAS can be used as a digital assets collection account, as an account for accessing general Internet services.\nPersonalized & Unique\nAll DAS accounts end in .bit and you can register them in many different languages from around the world, even Emojis! Each DAS is unique, ensuring and cannot be replicated.\nDecentralized.\nYou can register a DAS account without permission and once registered, you (and only you) will have full control of the DAS account.\nCompatible with all Public Chains\nYou can register and manage DAS using any public chain's private key, or even email; DAS accounts can be transferred between any public chain's addresses.\nFlexible Parsing Records\nYou can set up any blockchain address, email address, web address, social account and any other data as a parsed record for DAS.\n[bit.cc](http://bit.cc)\nWhen you own alice.bit, you will automatically have a browser-accessible [alice.bit.cc](http://alice.bit.cc) site. By default the content of the site is your DAS account information, which you can change to a static page pointing to IPFS by parsing the record.\nOpen Source\nDAS is a future-proof infrastructure, therefore, all modules of DAS are open source and maintained by developers worldwide.\nDAS as a unified digital assets receiving account\nYou can add multiple addresses from different chains to your DAS resolution record, so that when someone transfers money to you, you can simply enter your DAS account to complete the transfer. You can even add labels to the addresses to easily distinguish between different receiving accounts.\nSupported wallets\nHuobi Wallet\nTokenPocket\nimToken\nAlphaWallet\nHyperPay\nDAS as a personal information page\nYou can add your social accounts, email, profile, preferences, and any other data you want to make public to your DAS account. This way, you will have a thoroughly censorship-resistant personal information page.\nDAS as a portal for Dapp or decentralized website \\*\nThe portal of a contract on the blockchain is its Hash, and the portal of a web page hosted on a decentralized store is also a Hash. By associating these hashes as a resolution record to a DAS account, users can access these services directly using their DAS account.\nDAS as an end-to-end encrypted communication account \\*\nEnd-to-end encrypted communication software such as WhatsApp and Signal still use real-name account systems such as cell phone numbers as their accounts. DAS is anonymous and censorship-resistant, so we can build a more extreme end-to-end encrypted communication system based on DAS accounts.\nDAS as passwordless login credentials \\*\nEach DAS account can be associated with a public-private key, and each DAS account is highly identifiable. Based on W3C's WebAuthn, DAS accounts can naturally be used as login credentials to third-party systems. The login method is changed from entering the account password to using the private key associated with the DAS account to sign the login operation, which can greatly improve the security and user experience.\nAs a token of honor \\*\nIf Alice is a top VIP customer of Coinbase, then Coinbase, as the holder of coinbase.bit, can create a secondary account -- alice.coinbase.bit and use all of alice's deposit addresses on Coinbase as the resolution record for that secondary account.

Heads you change your life, tails you keep things the same. Participants could get advice on everything from whether to have a child or start a business to whether to get a tattoo or go on a diet. Some 20,000 people took Levitt up on his offer.\n\nIt’s a somewhat kooky premise for research [published in a peer-reviewed journal](https://academic.oup.com/restud/advance-article/doi/10.1093/restud/rdaa016/5834495), but the results indicate something profound about human nature: We’re really biased toward the status quo, and we’d be happier if we shook up our lives more.\n\nChecking in with participants after two and six months, Levitt found that those who had made big changes in their lives because of the random coin toss (or even just because they decided it was the right thing to do) were markedly happier than those who had soldiered on in their previous course. (Subjects who were deciding between trivial alternatives — whether to grow a beard, say — were equally happy.)\n\n“I believe that people are too cautious when it comes to making a change,” [Levitt says](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/quitting-your-job-and-other-life-choices/495122/).\n\nThat doesn’t mean you should dump your adored life partner or throw your life savings into an ill-thought-out investment, of course. But it does suggest we’d all end up happier if we dared to change things up more often.\n\nAnd Levitt’s study isn’t the only one suggesting people are generally too conservative about change. Another study out of the Kellogg School found that, over the long-term, [we are much more likely to regret things we haven’t done](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/regret-and-the-aspiring-entrepreneur-a-warning-from-researchers.html) rather than things we tried and failed at. Other research shows people are more likely to regret doing what they feel they “should” do rather than [chasing their own crazy dreams](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/a-new-study-confirms-that-youre-really-going-to-regret-not-chasing-your-crazy-dreams.html).\n\nAll of which paints a clear but dreary picture of our natural inclinations, On average, it seems we humans are likely to stick things out too long, [ignoring our nagging dreams and restless instincts ](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/do-what-you-must-not-what-you-should.html)in favor of inertia and other people’s expectations.\n\n# The bottom-line advice\n\nAnd that, [Levitt feels](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-05/oupu-sfp051520.php), suggests some very simple advice we should all take to heart from his study: “A good rule of thumb in decision making is, whenever you cannot decide what you should do, choose the action that represents a change, rather than continuing the status quo.”\n\nSo go ahead and take the plunge. I can’t guarantee things will go according to plan, but I can point you to a pile of research that says you’ll regret not taking your shot far more.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1636704656, "digest": "nQPeXnMD0gpy1Yus7L3XYmatbIVBoLp53Q7tIvdJgFI", "contributor": "0xDd8b658273EfC164Bc93A2D18B91BBAe7A21322B"}

{"id": "OPRdb116iBbSZHg8eLfUUp2-oYdtzTxbwwiilhlSKdE", "title": "链上数据 - LTHS（Long Term Holder Supply）长期持有者供给数量指标", "body": "作为 [Glassnode](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//glassnode.com/) 上最高等级 T3 等级的数据指标，LTHS（Long Term Holder Supply）长期持有者供给数量指标可能是与BTC波动最显著相关的指标了，作为《链上数据》系列的第一篇，我们来解读一下这个指标。\n\n## 什么是 LTHS\n\nLTHS（Long-Term Holder Supply） 具体是怎么定义的呢？在 Glassnode 上是这么写的：The total amount of circulating supply held by long term holders.（全部可被计算的供给数量中，被长期持有者拥有的数量）。\n\n这里对 Long-Term Holder （长期持有者）的定义是持有时间从现在开始数，持有BTC时间大于 155 天的持有者，因为是区块链上的数据，因此这里的持有时间即区块链地址里未被挪动的BTC呆在那里的时间。\n\n与之对应的还有 Short-Term Holder（短期持有者），这里的短期持有者即持有时间小于155天的持有者，不过这里有个细节，为了统计的精确性，统计 STHS（Short-Term Holder Supply）的时候会把进 24 小时的去掉，以保证数据比较稳定。\n\n## 如何解读 LTHs 的变化\n\n我们看下 2021年11月 这个指标的表现，从这里我们可以看出一个与BTC波动正好反向的走势。\n\n![LTHs 与 STHs 供应量对比](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/viGMlf_VQcpwDnjY0khkf.jpg?height=1013&width=1800)\n\n我们大概可以将这个指标作为长线操作的一个根据，当 LTHs 的指标在持续向上的时候，我们应该保持耐心等待价格上涨，这个时候往往市场很冷清，甚至有一些短期持有者在离开市场。\n\n指标开始掉头向下（同时 STHs 向上）的时候，代表市场发生了一些变化，开始有新人进入这个市场，交易所大量新人涌入，于是长期持有者开始卖出自己的数字货币。\n\n## 如何根据 LTHS 操作\n\n从图形可以很容易看到，长期持有者和短期持有者的行为正好是相反的，再参考价格变化，短期持有者对价格相当敏感，短期持有者曲线变化，几乎就是市场情绪的扩大版，价格下跌时急速卖出，上涨时疯狂买入。\n\n这个指标并不适合短线操作，如果你的操作频率是在月级别以上，可以根据 LTHs 与 STHs 的变化进行操作，这里提供一个简单操作的思路：\n\n**买入**：LTH 从底部向上积累，并达到了与上一次积累“高点”相似的高度，同时 STHs 从顶部向下滑落，减少到与上次“低点”相似的位置。\n\n**卖出**：STHs向上积累，完成翻倍，并开始接近上一次高点；LTHs向下滑落，减少量在10%以上。\n\n根据这个图形操作，不止是月级别，甚至有的时候是年级别。这里的买入信号主要看 LTHs 是否积累足够，而卖出正好相反，要看 STHs 是否完成积累。\n\n换句话说，底部支撑住靠的是长期持有者的不断买入，将短期持有者逃离市场砸盘的抛压给接住；而冲到顶部靠的是短期持有者快速进入，FOMO情绪扩散，短时间将价格买到一个高位，然后发生崩塌的连锁反应，导致币价冲高回落。\n\n## 总结\n\n其实长期持有者也并不如神人一般都能买在最高点，卖在最低点，而是懂得在价格过高时逐渐减仓，价格过低时逐渐加仓，很简单的反向操作，经过时间的积累就能获得巨额回报。\n\n不知道大家是否玩过冰球，一个冰球老手会懂得预判球走向的未知提前等待，而新手只会一味的跟随球，却总也追不上。\n\n回到指标本身，这个指标是一个相对滞后的指标，但是能帮助我们抓住大的周期脉络，其实能确定大周期的变化，已经超过了绝大多数市场的玩家，长期看迟早会完成一个小目标的。", "timestamp": 1636705137, "digest": "8A-BiVfIYavTzqO64XvBlIVTeXCDfuu_nB0HK3opG6o", "contributor": "0xeB9c44AdB75C9CB54921C3E9Aa765b55f47dFE07"}

The game is playable on both mobile and PC, currently available on Android with IOS coming in the future.\n\nRecently Axie Infinity has come under attack by both new players and old members of the community. In this article, we hope to explore factors that affect the yield generating potential of Axie Infinity, its risks, and opportunities to outline why we are still optimistic. We hope to provide a brief overview of the game, scholarships, and current yields, then move on to discussions on our view of the future.\n\nSome resources we found extremely helpful in familiarizing ourselves with NFT gaming and Axie in particular are: The Axie Infinity [Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/), [“Infinity Revenue Infinity Possibility”](https://notboring.mirror.xyz/rPk2Ozej8JHZZ_qayaekCfc1OUUHkmzLtZF3axlfmok) by Not.Boring, and [“Into the Void: Where Crypto Meets the Metaverse”](https://metaversed.net/Into-The-Void-Where-Crypto-Meets-The-Metaverse-263f1ff8c13c455ea472f5689e01acaa), an in-depth overview of crypto’s role in the development of an open Metaverse.\n\n**If you are already familiar with the game please skip to Part 2!**\n\nIf you enjoy this essay, please follow us on Twitter @terry15chung and @StingRayL0!\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n**Part 1**\n\n* What is Axie Infinity\n  * The Crucial Tokens\n    * SLP\n    * AXS\n  * Scholarships\n  * The Future of the Game\n\n**Part 2**\n\n* Yields\n  * Perception as a Game\n* Risks\n  * Issues with Long-Term Economics\n* Conclusions\n\n## What is Axie Infinity\n\n![This is an Axie.  ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MbQwn_M4JZAtWJq1K4m3f.png?height=516&width=743)\n\nYou will need 3 of these adorable cuties to start playing the game. They are NFTs that live on the [Ronin sidechain](https://axie.substack.com/p/migration). Axies come in all shapes and sizes, with different *classes*, *traits*, and *genetics*.\n\n* The different *classes* determine the[ strength/weakness properties](https://imgur.com/a/ZerC1VA) against other classes (think ice>water>fire etc…)\n* The *traits* determine the [attacks/moves](https://www.axieworld.com/en/tools/cards-explorer) an Axie has (each Axie has 4 moves) and its physical appearance\n* The *genetics* determine the traits of a newborn Axie between two-parent Axies when mated🍆\n\nAxies that have a higher number of traits that match their class (ex. Beast class with a Beast trait) are considered more genetically pure. Players can also intentionally breed different classes of Axies together to create an Axie with a variety of traits, as higher genetic purity does not always translate to better combat performance (genetic mutation can also randomly occur - resulting in a random trait not possessed by either  parents). Axies can be bred 7 times but each successive breeding costs more. This is a brief overview, as the game is very complex, with lots of base stats, hidden boosts, combos, debuffs, and more to understand and learn. Here are some comprehensive guides to learn about [combat](https://lynnyl.io/axie-infinity-combat-guide/) or [breeding](https://lynnyl.io/axie-infinity-breeding-guide/).\n\nThe price of Axies are dependent on the current meta (the most effective tactic available based on current knowledge), their class, traits, genetic purity, the number of times they have been bred, and market conditions. Prices can range from as low as 0.005 ETH (aka floor Axies, with mismatched attacks and poor stats) to several ETH for highly competitive Axies with a unique set of traits. The average cost of a meta Axie at the time of this article, is around $300 (0.088 ETH), though depending on the type of team being built and the abilities desired, it is more likely that one will spend closer to $1200 (0.35 ETH) for a starting team. There are also rare Axies distributed early on in the game’s development called Mystic Axies that have unique appearances and traits. They are treated more like collectibles and are worth hundreds of ETH.\n\n![A mid-level Axie Team](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/31WrUT_3Jp2cogLeybpCt.jpg?height=225&width=569)\n\n### The Crucial Tokens\n\nThe game ecosystem is comprised of 2 important tokens: SLP and AXS. AXS is a multi-purpose governance token while SLP is currently a token required for breeding. SLP is also the main source of “income” when discussing the earning potential of Axie Infinity. It is also important to note that AXS has a limited supply while SLP does not.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JxFXVehGK2D3Xl-2SsEK8.jpg?height=614&width=1200)\n\n**SLP**\n\nDepending on the number of Axies you own on a single account, you get 20, 40, or 60 “*energy*”. Energy is spent every game you play (Arena = PVP or Adventure = PVE modes) regardless of victory/defeat and fully recharges every 24 hours at 12 AM UTC.\n\n![The Axie Homescreen (Some values are outdated)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wUOAL2xJvTcAkkGLuqhYX.png?height=401&width=800)\n\nIn **Adventure** mode, players battle successively harder levels which proportionally yield more SLP. By playing Adventure, you can level up your Axies to boost their stats which makes clearing higher levels - by extension gaining larger amounts of SLP in shorter periods of time - faster and easier.\n\nIn **Arena**, you battle other players. Levels do not matter here, as only the base stats of your Axie team are used. Generally, Adventure yields less SLP than Arena, as there is a cap of 50 SLP earnable per day playing Adventure mode. Meanwhile, SLP earnings in Arena are only capped by the amount of energy you have, the number of games you win, and the elo bracket you’re playing in. The higher elo bracket you are in, the more SLP earned per win.\n\nThere is also a daily quest that grants 25 SLP upon completion (as of season 18), which requires the player to win 10 Adventure games and 5 Arena games. You can keep playing after your energy runs out, but you won’t be earning any SLP in Arena or exp in Adventure (and SLP if you already hit the 50 SLP cap for adventure). SLP withdrawal is also only available every 2 weeks. The *energy system* and *Adventure SLP cap* are the main methods to limit SLP generation.\n\n![Arena Gameplay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wV-j2c0VxhS2VXL3fLAFC.png?height=563&width=1013)\n\nOn the demand side, the *SLP breeding requirement* is currently the only utility of SLP. Breeders must burn SLP in the process of minting new Axies (creating new Axies by mating two existing ones). This counterbalanced with the two aforementioned supply-side dynamics are the main determinants of the price of SLP. As for the scaling of breeding prices an example may be that a virgin Axie breeding with another virgin Axie costs 600 SLP (300+300), while a virgin breeding with one that has been bred twice already will cost 1050 SLP (300+750). These breeding costs are (at the moment) arbitrarily determined by Sky Mavis.\n\nCombining all that, the average player with a decently competitive Axie team can earn around 140 SLP a day with quite a significant variance between the best and worst players. The 140 SLP translates to $12.47, using the last-30-day average price of SLP of $0.08913.\n\n**AXS**\n\nAs of right now, AXS functions as a token on top of SLP as a *breeding limiter*, but Sky Mavis plans to introduce *staking rewards* and *voting governance*.\n\nOnce *staking* launches, AXS holders can stake the token for 3, 6, or 12 months to earn more AXS at variable yields. Rewards will be claimable weekly but will be escrowed for 1 year before they vest. If the stakers provide value to Axie Infinity before claiming the staked yield (by playing the game or participating in governance), the staking yield on AXS could be higher or the wallet may win a special NFT drop. The number of votes cast or time spent playing that constitutes the minimum qualification for the extra payout has yet to be decided and will likely evolve over time.\n\nThere will be a total maximum supply of 270,000,000 tokens distributed in the following manner.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4tPJ3lJliFwfQWtlHBss1.png?height=407&width=791)\n\nTo support the future development of Axie Infinity, Sky Mavis has created a Community Treasury. This treasury will receive all revenues generated by Axie Infinity and a portion of staking rewards and will be *governed* by AXS holders eventually once the team determines that a “sufficiently” diversified set of wallets/holders have AXS.\n\n> Currently, the treasury receives **4.25%** of all Axie *marketplace* transactions, and the AXS portion of the breeding fee.\n>\n> In the future, other streams such as licensing fees, proceeds from cosmetic sales, tournament entry fees, and more will contribute to the Treasury. AXS holders in the future can decide how the funds from the treasury should be allocated and invested.\n\nAXS has two main long-term goals:\n\n* It rewards players for interacting with Axie Infinity incentivizing long-term holds\n* Decentralizes the ownership and governance of Axie Infinity\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LFa-ftay3uDaOzGGqg6Kk.png?height=918&width=945)\n\nAXS holders will have voting rights on increasingly important matters as the token becomes more decentralized - by October 2023, Sky Mavis will lose the majority position in AXS. Members will be able to vote on matters ranging from dates to host online tournaments to whether Sky Mavis should be replaced as the leading development team for Axie Infinity.\n\n**Note**: This article was written prior to the launch of AXS staking on 9/30/2021. For more updated information please read their updated whitepaper, the [staking guide](https://axie.substack.com/p/stake), and the [AXS staking dashboard](https://stake.axieinfinity.com/).\n\n**Scholarships**\n\n[https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1435771774482878466](https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1435771774482878466)\n\nNot everyone can afford the steep price tag that is required to start playing Axie while the earning aspect has attracted many aspiring players. Over 50% of the player base and people who express a desire to play the game come from the Philippines alone, with players also coming from countries like Brazil, Venezuela, and Indonesia.\n\nTo spend $1200 to purchase a team is [1/10 ](https://biz30.timedoctor.com/average-salary-in-philippines/)of the median annual salary in the Philippines, which is unfeasible for many people. What has emerged as an alternative is a partnership system called a **‘Scholarship’** where people who have Axie teams will lend them to others to play in exchange for a cut of the SLP earned. The renter is the ‘*Manager*’ while the rentee is the ‘*Scholar*’. The current standard is usually a 50/50 split, but with current SLP prices, people are still flocking to forums and Discord servers asking for a scholarship. Our scholars have told us that at times it is more profitable to be a scholar than work a minimum to even an average wage job in their countries, and many have also become jobless during the pandemic.\n\n[https://twitter.com/vesakaxie/status/1435848815450501122](https://twitter.com/vesakaxie/status/1435848815450501122)\n\nThere are organizations like Yield Guild Games (YGG) that have invested millions into purchasing Axies (and other yield-bearing gaming NFTs) and are turning scholarships into businesses at scale. They manage thousands of scholars across NFT games and are building a community that will grow across the metaverse.\n\n### The Future of the Game\n\n**Lunacia**\n\nAxies aren’t the only NFTs in the game; Sky Mavis has built its own virtual world, Lunacia, and has sold tokenized land ownership. Moving forward, there will be game mechanics and rewards built around owning and playing on lands. Though the specifics have not yet been revealed, Sky Mavis has hinted that land gameplay will include PVE (player versus computer), a wider variety of monsters, material harvesting, and trading of said materials.\n\nLunacia land may also contain some pre-generated infrastructure like roads or bridges which can increase a land's value. Land value is also affected by its type and proximity to the center of Lunacia (the center is currently owned by Sky Mavis, and events are more likely to happen there). Landowners will have the first right to anything that spawns in their lands, but non-landowners will be able to participate in land-based gameplay as well (though in what capacity we do not know).\n\nLandowners will be able to build different structures using the materials harvested on their lands to boost Axie performance or upgrade land functionality. Depending on the event, unique nodes will spawn randomly on the map. Players will then need to teleport their Axies to the nodes in order to participate in the events. After the event is over, Axies will need to travel across the land (which could take several days going from one end of the world to the other) to return home. This is how landowners can also generate revenue, as Axies traveling home on the aforementioned infrastructure could potentially drop AXS or NFT collectibles that landowners can redeem.\n\n![An example of land gameplay (not actual footage)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jqUTOuIeSetRyH2Dy0HBL.png?height=542&width=1300)\n\n**Items**\n\nThere will also be NFT items to enhance Axie performance. Items will likely need to be crafted from Axie burning, monster drops, and material harvested from the land, or can already be bought on the marketplace. Both of these major game systems are estimated to be implemented earliest by Q4 2021 or Q1 2022, though delays will not be unexpected. Lunacia is part of Sky Mavis’ grander vision in building a strong community that will seamlessly integrate into the wider gaming Metaverse.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tpsr5d4frUfPuTQPYPAVe.png?height=456&width=804)\n\n**DEX**\n\nSky Mavis also intends to launch a DEX for Ronin to become the #1 exchange for everything Axie related. The objective is to ease the barrier of exchanging AXS/SLP/WETH and lower transaction fees. On a similar note, Sky Mavis plans to create a Ronin to Ethereum Bridge for Axies so people will be able to send their Axies back to Ethereum if they so desire.\n\n**Opensource SDK**\n\nThe aspiration to create an integrated ecosystem is reflected in Sky Mavis’ decision to create an open-source SDK for Axie Infinity. Other game developers will be able to create standalone games of entirely different genres (an open-world MMO where you play as an Axie or a tower defense where Axies are actually the towers?) while using Axie NFTs, the Axie marketplace, Ronin DEX, and AXS governance. This also allows Axie to live on for as long as the community, other studios, and individuals develop new content and use cases for Axies.\n\n![Inherited Will](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iMjZdhEgaoihXZ84QLL0P.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nSky Mavis’ ultimate goal for this game, is the creation of a household brand that can be leveraged into a stardom franchise with movies, books, theme parks, merchandise, and heaps more, just like its forefather and inspiration, [Pokemon](https://www.titlemax.com/discovery-center/money-finance/the-25-highest-grossing-media-franchises-of-all-time/), did and is still doing today, but now owned by its community. It's a grandiose dream, but Axie Infinity has proven itself so far.\n\n## Part 2: Yield\n\nIn Q1 and Q2 of 2021, Axie Infinity underwent unprecedented exponential growth in DAU. Increasingly more people wanted to play and were met with a dearth of Axies. AXS rose **13,500%** from 12/31/2020 to Q2 of 2021. Axie prices, which traced the single digits for most of 2020, rose to $600 for a meta Axie in July of 2021.\n\nSince then as the acceleration of growth has slowed and an existing player base produces increasingly large amounts of SLP, the price of SLP has come down 80%+ from its all-time highs of 0.34 to 0.06 as of 9/26/2021. This has sparked discomfort from many scholarship managers and players, uncertain about the future of their yields and the viability of current income levels playing or lending out Axies.\n\nAnd to a certain extent, the discomfort is warranted. At the moment, the only utility of SLP is in minting new Axies, making SLP only valuable insofar as new people want to play the game. In essence Axie Infinity at the moment is a yield farm whose token only has value because it can be reinvested for yield, denominated in itself. Yet, there is so much more to the ecosystem, different moving parts that affect the prices of SLP, AXS, and Axies. We hope to present a somewhat comprehensive discussion in the following section.\n\nFor those curious about manager APYs on Axie scholarships, please check out **[this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1oGnLLZ4yy99WogiUplmwcq-GinKLriRHEdggIdwTH5A/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=114135602492556547907)**[ ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1oGnLLZ4yy99WogiUplmwcq-GinKLriRHEdggIdwTH5A/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=114135602492556547907)that we created. Feel free to copy it and play around with different inputs.\n\n**Scholarship Yields**\n\n![Manager yields on scholarships at 200SLP/Day, 50/50 Split, 350USD/Axie, per scholar](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9ejSgwW4GntQ1mR-oJmFi.png?height=446&width=819)\n\nAt the current average Axie price for an Arena competitive team (300USD/Axie), even if prices of SLP were to decrease 90% the yields on an Axie team will still be significantly higher than yields in traditional instruments and blue-chip defi. ETH deposit rates on AAVE and Compound are 0.02% and 0.14% respectively. On cefi, stable coin rates on USDC/USDT are in the 5-10% range.\n\nThen why is it that either Axie or SLP prices are not correcting to stable and lower yields? It’s easy to relegate the disparity to an exponential growth of the player base resulting in substantially larger demand for Axies (and consequently SLP) than at equilibrium, yet, as we’ll briefly mention, there are reasons why this strikes us as only one of some primary reasons for the price mismatch.\n\nWe see three key barriers in price to yield convergence. First, the mental barrier of it being a game, second, opacity of yield stemming from opportunity cost, and finally some legitimate but mitigable concerns about long-term economics. Yet despite these concerns, of which the first and second we believe are insubstantial and the third mitigable, we are excited about what Axies will achieve in the long run.\n\n### It's just a game dude…\n\nWhen first hearing about Axie Infinity, we couldn’t comprehend the thought of earning a wage from gaming. We first wrote it off as a scam, then debated whether it was pay to win, then branded it as a third-rate card game - mental gymnastics to help solve the cognitive dissonance we were experiencing regarding its earning potential. We vividly remember thinking - ‘This is the market top.’ - the first time we saw Axie prices.\n\n![Credits to r/AxieSpike on Reddit](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RDIUvwzmHxHEZUl0iG3bX.png?height=445&width=460)\n\nAs a veteran gamer myself who has played nearly every imaginable genre at all price levels, none made me doubt myself more than looking at a triple-digit price tag for a single Axie. While it's not unprecedented for people to spend thousands of dollars on games (look no further than the game that inspired Axie Infinity, Pokemon), what is unheard of is the insane barrier to entry of $1000+ to even start playing the game at all.\n\n**Let it work for you, not the other way around**\n\n> “Games aren’t meant to make money! They waste both time and money!”  - Dad\n\nLook no further than the [177 billion dollars sunk](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-to-generate-175-8-billion-in-2021-despite-a-slight-decline-the-market-is-on-track-to-surpass-200-billion-in-2023/#:\\~:text=We%20now%20estimate%20that%20the,began%20tracking%20revenues%20in%202012.) into the gaming industry in 2020, the average [Fornite player’s spend of $85](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/06/26/study-says-69-of-fortnite-players-spend-money-on-the-game-85-spent-on-average/?sh=4aa0d92e2060) in 2018, or a [League of Legends player who spent $119 in 2019](https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/19/arm-treasure-data-the-most-popular-games-arent-necessarily-using-lots-of-microtransactions/). Even crazier, [85% of Fornite players ](https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/19/arm-treasure-data-the-most-popular-games-arent-necessarily-using-lots-of-microtransactions/)spent money on the game in 2019.\n\n![Day in the life](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1UwcbjG2swA7nUqz511QL.png?height=484&width=660)\n\nFor just a little historical insight, spending money on cosmetics and non-game-altering perks has not always been the norm. [Back in 2006, when Bethesda released the 2.5 dollar horse armor in “The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion”](https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/todd-howard-on-the-infamous-horse-armor-people-will-buy-anything/zdc37), people lost their minds. People could not fathom putting more money into a game they already purchased, especially for a purely cosmetic purpose and certainly not for a single-player game.\n\nFast forward to today, $15+ battle passes and skins are the norm. The release of [Seraphine’s ultimate skin ](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/k-da-all-out-seraphine-ultimate-skin-explainer/)garnered a lot of flak as people felt that Riot Games made the champion purely to sell skins, rather than actually add content and gameplay diversity. But I bet my Axies that the ultimate skin sold like hotcakes.\n\n![Is this worth 2.5USD?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xz5X55ypXeyK4cjMBfViX.png?height=367&width=649)\n\nPeople are not used to games generating any material benefit. But like it or not, people do spend money on games. That it is a game should not hinder our perception of it as a project. And on the plus side, at least now my dad can’t say that I’m not earning money anymore.\n\n**Are there exceptions?**\n\nAs of right now, there are only two mainstream ways to earn money by being an average gamer (no YouTube, account-selling, Esports, streaming, etc) discounting the Play To Earn model. One is gambling games, and the other is to participate in the grey-market economy of an MMO with a complex economy. Neither of which helps solidify gaming as a way to make money.\n\nExpansive MMORPGs develop complex economies due to their sheer scale and the desire of its player base to create an online identity. Eve Online comes to mind when talking about an expansive and ultra-complex player-driven economy.\n\nEve Online is famous in the gaming community for being a ‘free for all social experiment’ type of game. The devs since the very beginning have reinforced the fact that short of causing legal issues and or completely breaking the game, they will allow anything to happen with minimal intervention. And that's how you get to creating a[ cyber-space tyrant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2B6A3bzwJwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2B6A3bzwJw) manipulating thousands of players to do his bidding or a year-long galactic battle between multiple factions costing upwards of the equivalent of [$380,000 in in-game currency.](https://www.ccpgames.com/news/2021/the-most-expensive-video-game-battle-ever-earns-two-guinness-world-records)\n\n![https://www.pcgamer.com/a-single-mistake-started-the-largest-space-battle-eve-online-has-ever-seen/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5KlCGYrsvHL7EVH2-fmS_.png?height=347&width=610)\n\nBut what this freedom also enables is a breathtakingly comprehensive economy that even[ real economists study](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-REB-10618). When this much time and effort is poured into a game, combined with a complex economy, people will naturally find ways to make money. Unfortunately, because trading in-game currency (known as [Real Money Trading in the industry, or RMT](https://proprivacy.com/gamergirl/rmt-mmo)) for fiat currency, or vice versa, is against Eve’s TOS and EULA laws, [sketchy black markets](https://iskmarket.com/) have emerged offline to address players’ desires to be rewarded for their effort spent in the game and for people to take shortcuts with their credit cards. [RMT players](https://odealo.com/articles/how-to-trade-in-eve-online-rmt-done-right-odealo) use bots or stolen accounts to farm in-game currency, which often is a lose-lose for all parties, as RMTers rarely get punished, law-abiding players end up having their account banned, the game economy balance suffers, and the dev team could still be liable for the transactions.\n\n[https://twitter.com/amytongwu/status/1429325724016541702](https://twitter.com/amytongwu/status/1429325724016541702)\n\n> What we’re trying to say is this - if your first response to Axie Infinity’s yield generating capacity is to doubt its legitimacy simply by the fact that it is a game, know that it unleashes a two-decade-old pent up demand in a world where spending money on games is normalized.\n\n**Oh The Irony**\n\nIronically, Axie Infinity being a good game may be hindering its perception as a yield-generating asset. Behind the innovative player economy, and hype, Axie Infinity is surprisingly and genuinely a fun game to play. We still sometimes reach for our phones and play several rounds of Arena knowing that we are not earning SLP as our scholars already consumed all the energy earlier in the day.\n\nTake one look at a defi LP pool, and the first thing you see is the % APY. On the other hand, take a look at an Axie and that's usually not the first thought that comes into someone’s mind, especially if they haven’t been exposed to the game before and understand the numbers behind it.  Even for someone who has interest in the crypto and gaming spaces it would be easy for them to be turned off by its high entry price as they are used to the free-to-play gaming environment we currently reside in.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ih0dWSuUizvKtQtnfkGsR.jpg?height=487&width=675)\n\nThis is why the argument that “it's a game, that's so sketchy” makes no sense to us. People already pour money into games, there exists a demand for real-world trading (it happens in opaque markets) and people want to own their in-game assets.\n\n### The Time Value of Money\n\nAnother issue with the direct visibility of the yield generating capacity of Axies is that for a first-time player, the yield produced is largely proportional to the amount of time spent playing and studying the game.\n\nIn Arena, each game takes approximately 5-8 minutes to complete, and at 0.08 SLP/USD, this equates to 2.7USD/hour to 4.3USD/hour.\n\n![https://leveldash.com/how-to-earn-slp-axie-infinity/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T6jmwTcX0Oh9Bvlx673i-.png?height=287&width=744)\n\nAt advanced levels of Adventure-mode, each game takes approximately 5-8 minutes to complete, rewarding 4-10 SLP per round. This puts your USD hourly earnings from Adventure mode at 2.4USD/hour to 6USD/hour.\n\nHowever, to get to this point takes a significant time investment re-doing the same Adventure-mode levels to level up your Axies - levels that have low SLP yields. On average it took our scholars 10 days to get to adequate Adventure levels where achieving the 50 SLP cap was plausible within a decent time frame. But this was only possible after tens of hours of laborious, somewhat repetitive gameplay and even more research into the game mechanics.\n\nFor many around the world, the idea of a 10 day-long training session to earn 6USD/hour for an hour a day is incredible. More than 2.2B people around the world live under 10 USD a day and have mobile or internet access.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sNIBd2sCUsvpAEcuZdYP0.png?height=1446&width=2048)\n\nBut for others, this is not a tradeoff they are willing to make and thus yields may remain opaque for longer than usual.\n\n## Other Risks\n\nBesides the aforementioned reasons, why are yields on Axies so high? We believe there are legitimate issues in the Axie economy, and though they are regularly addressed and discussed in interviews and AMAs (we believe Sky Mavis is well aware and equipped for these problems) we wanted to aggregate them to provide a more holistic perspective of the long-term risks involved and the potential outcome of these scenarios.\n\n**Scholarship Risk**\n\nWe believe yields on scholarships (200-300%) are high for a reason, though unwarranted for the particular risk profile.\n\nFirst, renting is a manual process. Whoever owns an Axie team must create a new Sky Mavis account with a separate Ronin wallet and an attached email, and either give the scholar the login details to the account or send them a login QR code associated with the account every 14 days. This means that the scholar never has access to the Ronin wallet itself, and therefore cannot purchase, claim, breed, and sell Axies, SLP, or AXS. However, if the scholars are caught botting, playing multiple accounts, artificially changing the time on their devices to reset their daily energy, or engaged in other TOS violations, the Axies associated with the account will be banned and inaccessible for a period of 120 to 999 days ([and it seems like they are getting pretty good at catching bad actors](https://clutchpoints.com/axie-infinity-ban-wave-30000/)).\n\n![The Axie ban appeal form is a very new addition - in the past users could not appeal their ban](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4GbNnuDiofpaTnJ535laX.png?height=887&width=663)\n\nThis makes it imperative that you pick the right scholar, though in our opinion at the moment this is not a large concern. The number of people who own Axies is significantly smaller than the size and growth of the group that wants to be scholars. Besides capital scarcity among those who most value Axie as an income source, this is largely because scholarships have incredible viral coefficients.\n\nAs managers, we constantly get requests from our scholars who have family members, friends, and coworkers who’d love to onboard. Anecdotally, our scholars have told us that they searched for 1-3 months before landing a scholarship. This means that for as long as playing Axie Infinity remains a viable source of income and global play-to-earn penetration is low, scholarships will remain very competitive, making the likelihood that someone is on multi-scholarships extremely low (though not zero). This issue will be more relevant as SLP prices, and the ratio of Axie owners to Axie scholars change with time.\n\n**Centralization Risk**\n\n![Season 18 Update](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cQLu-nXokSYawREywkQq_.png?height=378&width=758)\n\nAnother key risk to scholarship yields is that currently, Sky Mavis controls the Axie economy. In the Season 18 update, having seen that the production rate of SLP far exceeded the SLP burn from breeding, Sky Mavis unilaterally decreased the SLP rewards gained from Adventure from 100 to 50 and the Daily quest reward from 50 to 25 SLP, effectively reducing novice players’ guaranteed SLP gains from 150 to 75 SLP a day. This however had no positive effect on the price of SLP.\n\nIt seems at the moment that because the AXS portion of the breeding requirement has been adjusted three times, doubled -> halved -> halved again (2→4→2→1), and because the SLP portion has been raised twice, that Sky Mavis has some sort of metric with which they target certain prices, growth rates or burn rates of these tokens. We believe that they are focused on maintaining attractive yields for managers and players by buoying up the price of SLP while ensuring marginal profitability of breeding to maximize the number of players who own Axies (and therefore are in the ecosystem), all the while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the economy.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8c0svsUv1S6-0POkWVr8-.png?height=269&width=1175)\n\n**How?**\n\nBut what exact quantifiable measures Sky Mavis is targeting is not clear. In an economy with as many moving parts as Axie Infinity, any change to the existing ecosystem affects, either favorably or disfavorably, all stakeholders and prices of tokens.\n\nThe Sky Mavis team holds 21% of the outstanding token supply of AXS. Given this knowledge, we begin with an assumption that the team’s objective is to maximize the long-term price of AXS considering lockups (we acknowledge that this may not be true but we start with this assumption). Then, in the long run, DAU and transaction volume must increase at a rate faster than the declining price of Axies. Increased transaction volume will bring more revenue into the Axie Treasury thereby increasing the value of the team’s AXS holdings. In the short run, the team must maintain marginal profitability of breeding, and “reasonable” yields to achieve their long-term goals. Here we make two key assumptions. First, that the team’s express purpose is to maximize long-term AXS value, and second, that at substantially lower yields, players will leave and not return. This is the framework with which we will examine the team’s actions to show that yield farmers and the team have aligned incentives.\n\nIn order to grow DAU and transaction volume in the Axie marketplace and not allow Axie prices to trend to 0, Sky Mavis’ needs to do juggle two main forces:\n\n1. Maintaining the marginal profitability of breeding\n2. Ensuring adequate yield\n\n### Maintaining the marginal profitability of breeding\n\nWe assert that until Axie has a self-sustaining economy with Axie/SLP sinks, the team must maintain marginal profitability of breeding to ensure DAU growth and adequate yields.\n\nIf breeding becomes unprofitable, no more Axies will be bred or supplied to new players who want to acquire Axies. No new Axies will be sold on the marketplace, at which point the Treasury is no longer earning transaction fees, *or* the AXS portion of the breeding fee. AXS would decrease in value as transaction volumes and breeding fees dry up. Existing Axies will continue to mint SLP which will place massive downward pressures on its price (because in this scenario breeding is the only SLP burning mechanism.) If the SLP prices fall faster than AXS prices, this could result in a mass exodus of players who may never come back to the game.\n\nHowever, in the presence of an Axie/SLP sink (items, Axie burn) assuming that existing Axies continue to be burnt during the time breeding is unprofitable, constant demand with limited supply would quickly raise the value of Axies restoring equilibrium to the breeding equation. On the other hand, even without a sink, if AXS declines faster than SLP then breeding profitability is restored, along with DAU growth (though probably not before losing a non-negligible portion of the player base).\n\nOn the other hand, if breeding becomes too profitable (AXS prices drop suddenly, breeding fees are adjusted to be very cheap) then in the short term SLP prices will rise as breeders scramble to meet existing demand. This would allow Axie Infinity to reach its local maxima DAU in the shortest period of time. However, given a couple of weeks, these newly created Axies will generate massive amounts of SLP, especially without an Axie/SLP sink, and once new player growth hits a natural stall, SLP will trend to 0. Once the price of SLP drops beneath the point where it is no longer profitable (opportunity cost of time, capital) to play, it will potentially trigger a similar mass exodus of players. Introducing Axie/SLP sinks after the fact becomes a matter of incredible precision with minimal room for error.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1437105498411520006](https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1437105498411520006)\n\nIn either scenario, marginal profitability of breeding (dictated by fluctuating costs of SLP and AXS) must be upheld, otherwise, yields will trend to 0. This phrased another way would be that the team must always hold the\n\n> **PV of SLP produced for an Axie > breeding costs of an Axie**\n\nthus ensuring yields will always be positive, “enough” to encourage breeding and compensate for an opportunity cost of capital.\n\nHowever, this rule won’t be necessarily true once a working Axie/SLP sink is established, as people might be willing to take a loss in breeding profitability to create new Axies to burn. On the other hand, the incremental SLP earnable from an improved Axie through burning (assuming that burning one Axie can improve another Axie’s abilities and thus its win-rate/stats)  must be less than the amount of SLP earnable if that Axie was not burned and used to earn SLP instead.\n\n**Why execute the above by decreasing the AXS portion of the breeding fee while increasing the SLP portion?**\n\nBy increasing SLP cost, they increase the amount of the SLP burned and decrease the rate at which Axies are created (as it pushes some breeders to choose to earn SLP instead of buying it off the market which, because of the 2 week unlock schedule of SLP, delays Axie creation). This supply-side restriction is however counterbalanced (in the short-term) by sustainment of yield, increasing/maintaining new player Axie demand. Thus DAU growth continues.\n\n### Insuring “Reasonable” Yields\n\nOn the demand side of the equation, the team must also ensure adequate yields to retain its existing player base. We define “reasonable” as the level of yield that will retain players. At current rates of \\~300-500% we have seen that 30 and 90 day retention rates are basically the same. At “unreasonable” yields, retention would significantly drop. We have personal conjectures as to this level, however,  the official figures remain to be seen.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1440790217204457474](https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1440790217204457474)\n\nBecause Sky Mavis wants to maintain its existing player base and conjecturing that the vast majority of its players play because of its earning aspect, the team has an express interest in maintaining attractive yields. The team also understands that people’s livelihoods depend on the price of SLP.\n\n**When SLP Sink? (Beyond Technical Reasons)**\n\nIdeally, the team wants to get Axies into the hands of as many people as possible. This maximizes DAU and likely transaction volume. However, if an Axie sink was introduced today, the price of Axies and SLP would rise quickly. A portion of Axies bred would also go to people who aren’t new players, rather to existing players who will be burning Axies before DAU can further expand, and many new users will now be priced out of the game.\n\nIt will also seek to enrich existing Axie holders at the expense of later entrants (assuming the majority of Axie DAU is yet to come) which increases the Gini coefficient of Axie. This is also somewhat against the ethos of NFT gaming, especially considering the core constituency of current Axie players.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Psycheout86/status/1437052404432781313](https://twitter.com/Psycheout86/status/1437052404432781313)\n\n[https://twitter.com/Psycheout86/status/1437052409126207490](https://twitter.com/Psycheout86/status/1437052409126207490)\n\nFor as long as growth remains the primary concern (until market saturation is reached), we strongly believe that the team’s incentives will ensure both the marginal profitability of breeding and adequate “snap-shot” yield (yield on Axies bought today).\n\nGiven these facts, in the short run, the Sky Mavis specific risk is a net positive for holders of Axies, scholarship managers, and holders of AXS.  Sky Mavis is acutely aware that many in the Philippines, Venezuela, and other countries rely on SLP production as their livelihood. We hope that at the very least this provides incentives to carefully manage the economy of the game.\n\n[https://twitter.com/AxiePerson/status/1437536258801143810](https://twitter.com/AxiePerson/status/1437536258801143810)\n\n### Finally some legitimate (issues?) with long term economics\n\nIncreasingly more people want to play Axie having seen their friends and family afford washing machines and earn a living off playing a game. This means that the demand for Axies far exceeds the supply, driving up its price. This in turn raises the price of SLP, a core variable cost in the production of new Axies. But at long-term equilibrium where everyone who wants to be in the game is already in the game, what is the price of SLP?\n\n[https://twitter.com/127wallace/status/1425808034459127808?lang=en](https://twitter.com/127wallace/status/1425808034459127808?lang=en)\n\nUltimately the demand for SLP arises from the demand for new Axies which roughly equals the entry of new players into the ecosystem and the desire for existing players to purchase more teams.\n\nThis means that the demand for SLP is driven by the desire to breed new Axies while demand for Axies is driven by the desire to earn more SLP. At the fundamental level, one Axie should only be priced at the desire for people to play the game and the dollar value of that desire. It is only because the production of new Axies cannot match the demand for new players that the price of Axies and the price of SLP is inflated at the moment. The supply is constrained by the desire to breed, a function of AXS prices and SLP prices, and the existing supply of Axies from which breeders can breed, while the demand for players increases exponentially via word of mouth. But at equilibrium, the value of the game accrues to the ability of the game to entertain.\n\nThis is not to say the current price is outrageous. If Axie as a game has the potential to captivate users regardless of the yield then the price of SLP and the price of one Axie may even appreciate. The issue is that at the moment, a large portion of the desire to play is fueled by a desire to earn, and it is hard to parse out exactly how many players are in the ecosystem because they genuinely enjoy the game mechanics or purely to earn (acknowledging that there are massive overlaps between the two groups).\n\nAs more people play for yield and automatically cash out their SLP at regular intervals, the amount of SLP sold on the market exponentially increases with DAU, and the number of Axies in the marketplace consequently increases as well. If no new player is there to buy up the Axies, if there aren’t any new utilities for existing Axies, then prices of SLP and Axies will correct.  At the moment Axies and SLP is an investment that requires the market to continue to grow at an expanding pace.\n\n![SLP burn/mint dynamics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QimrkfxVZ0bacR0Z4IhrV.png?height=398&width=727)\n\n### The Long Run is Not Today\n\nThe long run is paradoxically both closer and further away than people realize. It took Axie 3 years to get to where they are today.\n\nOn the other hand, there are 2.2B people who live on less than 10 USD a day who have a smartphone and only 1.5M DAU. At 15 USD a day there are more than 3B, half the world’s population, who have internet access. For as long as yields are low and people are out of jobs because of the pandemic, for as long as more people can play Axie as a source of income, we believe that Axie DAU growth, AXS price appreciation, and high yields on Axies will continue. It’s impossible to exactly time when the market will turn, and given that crypto and especially crypto-games are risk-on investments, it’s tough to forecast how changes in traditional yields and a global recession might affect the Axie ecosystem.\n\nToday APY on defi bluechip protocols is less than 1%, only slightly higher than traditional yields. At the end of the day, no yield can be sustained and we will either see a correction in the price of SLP or a move up in the price of Axies to account for the mismatch of yield in P2E games and the real world.\n\nWhat we have to also remember is that the game is still currently in alpha. In its current iteration, it is already an enjoyable game with lots of future developments to come. Once land-based gameplay is launched, the Ronin Dex shipped, the SDK made available, and merchandise sold, we'll get more information on how the game and the ecosystem will develop in the future.\n\nOnce those developments have launched, a bet against Axie will be a bet against the ingenuity of the ecosystem and the community. If any individual member, gaming studio, or collective that participates in the ecosystem can create any utility (a game, a protocol, art) that is interesting and fun that uses Axies, then the demand for Axies will naturally rise. At the very least, we do not want to bet against the creativity of the Axie community.\n\n### The Future of Lending NFTs\n\nThe manager-scholar market is an opaque market where capital providers and sellers, or employees and employers are connected on an ad-hoc basis without any systematization. Contract terms are purely arbitrary as employees have no power within the ecosystem, while as a manager, it’s impossible to ensure that the scholars abide by the TOS, exposing your capital to bans. If anything, Axie scholarships have shown that besides spot buying and selling, borrowing and lending of capital generating assets or NFTs for their utility, is the next natural step in NFT development - much like how after spot purchases we had de-fi and derivative markets in tokens. NFTs, in general, can be very expensive and people who can’t pay principal but want to harvest the utility of an NFT or take part in the social and financial perks of holding NFTs, or those who hold NFTs but want to derive financial utility from their possession before exit, all need an automatic market to connect.\n\nWe’re already seeing P2P marketplaces like the official Axie discord and YGG where trade and barter of scholarship-manager agreements happen on an ad-hoc basis, where take-rates are not transparent. This is the nebulous start of the future of NFTs as part of a larger financial system. On the other hand, it's exciting to think about what other protocols will develop that demystifies the opaque process of renting and borrowing NFTs in the future that moves it away from a dark P2P market to one with transparency about contract details, yields, and revenue splits. We have a couple of projects we are very excited about, but we’ll be back in another article.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, Axie Infinity has established itself as a pioneer in the NFT gaming space. But it must not rest on its laurels and keep pushing the boundaries if it wants to achieve global mainstream status and longevity. There are many challenges ahead for Axie Infinity and the space of NFT gaming as a whole to navigate, but we are optimistic and excited about the future.\n\nOn one hand, maybe in a couple of years, we’ll have empty Ronin blocks and our past transaction histories to remember the game that once was. Or maybe in 20 years you and your family will be heading to Axie Park in Ho Chi Minh City/Orlando (in your Lambo of course), Axie plush toy and keychain in hand (on your metaverse avatar) while your eldest works part-time grinding an Axie MMO to save up for college tuition, converting his SLP earnings to ETH. Wherever we are in 20 years, in the words of Not.Boring:\n\n“My bet is that this period in Axie’s life is just the start of something huge, a small blip on a much bigger graph, both in terms of revenue and impact.”\n\nThank you for reading and let us know if there is anything we can improve on!\n\n*Disclosure: We own small amounts of AXS and SLP, plus a couple of Axies.

À quoi servent-ils, quelles sont leurs différences, et comment en tirer profit ?\n\nLe stablecoin est une crypto monnaie à part entière qui se veut **stable**, qui est pour la plupart du temps **adossée** à une monnaie fiat ($, €, etc.) et qui se doit de coller à sa valeur via des mécanismes de collatéralisations ou algorithmiques.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*j_7kn5_vRumw4470)\n\n**Ses utilités sont multiples :**\n\n* Se protéger de la volatilité des crypto\n* Les utilisations cross-chain\n* Les utilisations dans la DeFi / CeFi / CeDeFi pour générer des rendements\n* Le crypto to stablecoin n’est pas générateur d’imposition\n\n![Stablecoin Supply](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*BDJKEKmyCM3vdt5h)\n\n**Globalement, pour qu’un stablecoin persiste dans le temps, il y a plusieurs points majeurs à prendre en compte :**\n\n* Sa conception et ses mécanismes\n* L’émetteur\n* La confiance que les gens lui accordent\n* Son utilisation\n\n**Il en existe des dizaines, mais on peut globalement les regrouper en 4 catégories :**\n\n* Les stablecoins 100% collatéralisé par du fiat\n* Les stablecoins 100% ou over-collatéralisés par des cryptos\n* Les stablecoins 100% algorithmique\n* Les stablecoins semi-algorithmique\n\nL’USDC, l’USDT et le BUSD sont des stablecoins 100% collatéralisés avec de l’argent réel, c’est-à-dire qu’à chaque fois qu’un USDC est émis, 1$ Américain est mis sous séquestre dans un compte bancaire affilié à Circle pour l’USDC par exemple.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Mp1UVD-8krcIGK8a)\n\nÀ l’inverse, quand l’offre en circulation ne correspond plus à la demande, les USDC sont brûlés et les $ sous séquestres sont libérés.\n\nLeur valeur est donc assurée intégralement tant que la balance entre les USDC émis et les $ mis sous séquestre est juste. Certains pourront y voir un problème, ces assets sont centralisés, et c’est à ce problème qu’essaie de pallier le DAI ou l’UST, mais avant d’en parler …\n\nCertains se souviennent probablement de l’affaire USDT, malgré tous les scandales autour, il n’a jamais perdu son peg, et c’est encore aujourd’hui le stable coin le plus utilisé. Pourquoi ? Sa popularité et son utilisation massive.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*upnboC16h-vlj-x2)\n\nComme évoqué précédemment, **le manque de décentralisation** présente un risque réel bien que peu probable, l’émetteur décide de l’avenir de son asset. Il peut donc le modifier, le supprimer, en interdire l’échange, le bloquer à sa guise, d’où la recherche de décentralisation.\n\nLes stablecoins collatéralisés ou over-collatéralisés par des cryptos : Le sUSD (par Synthetix) ou encore le DAI (par MakerDao). Ces assets offrent une décentralisation, et sont supposés maintenir leur peg aussi bien que les stablecoins collatéralisés en fiat, leur seul souci ?\n\nIls sont encore loin d’être capital efficient, c’est-à-dire qu’on obtient moins d’argent en sortie que ce qu’on a déposé en entrée pour les créer, ce qui assure une certaine sécurité pour le protocole comme on va le voir. On parle ici de “over-collatéralisation”.\n\nLe DAI, stablecoin décentralisé de MakerDao fonctionne sur le même principe, mais à la place de mettre des $ dans une banque, ce sont des Ethers ou tout autre asset ERC-20 voté par les posesseurs de [$MKR](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MKR&src=cashtag_click) qui sont mis sous séquestres via des smart contracts.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*2XHxThCJNmW8rcbt)\n\nIl faut déposer entre 101% et 175% de collatéral pour obtenir du DAI, les cryptos étant plus volatiles, le protocole s’assure une marge en cas de forts mouvements, il gère également les liquidations pour ne pas avoir de dette.\n\nQuelques exemples de collatéral mini à déposer et la liste d’assets ERC-20 qu’accepte le protocole en collatéral (à noter qu’il est également possible de déposer des LP en collatéral, plus d’infos ici : [https://oasis.app](https://t.co/vFiMhnhdZM?amp=1))\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*d7bNL8Ci0OgPbpto)\n\nÉvoquons maintenant le cas des stablecoins algorithmiques. Stabiliser un asset, uniquement grâce à des mécanismes ingénieux et sans aucun collatéral. C’est un véritable défi auquel de nombreux acteurs de la crypto s’essayent ou se sont essayés, parfois en se brûlant les ailes.\n\nL’UST, probablement le plus connu, le stablecoin décentralisé de l’écosystème Terra ($LUNA) est probablement celui qui a le mieux réussi l’exercice avec quand même une grosse frayeur en janvier 2021. Mais comment expliquer cette réussite ?\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*vP_IZPV0QnY1BkCr)\n\nCours de l’UST\n\n1\\. Un mécanisme très ingénieux, pour chaque UST crée, l’équivalent en [$LUNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNA&src=cashtag_click) est burn, et inversement. Ce processus permet de faire converger la volatilité sur le token LUNA et non sur l’UST.\n\n2\\. Un écosystème qui se développe complètement autour de l’UST, Anchor, Mirror, Pylon et les prochains projets de l’écosystème gravitent autour du stablecoin, ce qui contribue à sa stabilité.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Hp6x39t6Eh-cab4j)\n\nÉcosystème Terra\n\n3\\. Une volonté d’interopérabilité avant tout.\n\n4\\. Une démocratisation dans le monde réel, avec des solutions de paiement viables et utilisées notamment en Corée.\n\nLes stablecoins semi-algorithmiques : Ils combinent les deux aspects précédents, la collatéralisation et des mécanismes algo. Ils offrent en général la possibilité d’être sous-collatéralisé contrairement au DAI, pour plus de fenêtres d’arbitrage et de meilleurs rendements DeFi.\n\nCependant, ils restent vulnérables, au même titre que les stablecoins 100% algo, aux phénomènes de bank-run et leur viabilité sur le long terme ne pourra s’observer qu’après être éprouvée par le marché.\n\nDeux bons exemples de stable semi-algo, le [$FRAX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FRAX&src=cashtag_click) qui rempli bien son rôle pour l’instant ([https://frax.finance](https://t.co/rItqj9oiw7?amp=1)) Et l’ [$IRON](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IRON&src=cashtag_click) victime de son succès ou mécanisme non viable sur le long terme ?\n\n> <https://rekt.news/iron-finance-rekt/>\n\n![Cours FRAX](https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/0\\*BGbmPCPvaTsfWEZv)\n\n![Cours IRON](https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/0\\*WSTYGdiVUhiXPuII)\n\nUne chose est sûre pour ces projets prometteurs, leur survie ne dépendra pas uniquement des mécanismes de maintiens de peg, l’éducation des utilisateurs, la confiance, l’aspect communautaire seront également des aspects primordiaux.\n\nSi l’on devait récapituler les différences entre les types de stablecoins on pourrait le faire avec ce tableau :\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*suv8X08gvOW_4jWC)\n\nIl est également important de rappeler que pour bon nombre de protocoles DeFi comme Aave, Compound, OlympusDAO… Une perte de peg du DAI par exemple entraînerait des liquidations massives et des pertes considérables. La stabilité est un enjeu majeur.\n\n**Il est toutefois bon d’espérer pour la DeFi qu’elle trouve un jour le stable coin alliant décentralisation, cost efficiency et stabilité.**\n\nMerci d’avoir pris le temps de lire cet article !", "timestamp": 1636705802, "digest": "gQc1Vf4xwTGCPth3K0hwXB3z_j3naUPzijoqTDNBiKs", "contributor": "0x4e486E7eee27500b8851d63d003119c4DA4825f6"}

Il est possible que lors d’un déploiement sur une autre blockchain, les rewards & les taux changent en fonction de ladite blockchain.\n\nQuand on voit Aave d’un œil de farmer, on se dit que 4% 5% d’intérêt comparé à ce qu’il se fait sur le marché c’est ridicule, et hors conditions spécifiques avec un liquidity mining très élevé et du leverage farming, le protocole n’est absolument pas fait pour ça.\n\nLa réel valeur ajoutée n’est pas la, si Aave est autant utilisé c’est pour une raison bien spécifique, cela permet de garder de la liquidité en stable coin tout en conservant ses assets spéculatifs (eth,btc…)\n\nMais comment faire ?\n\nJe précise que pour mettre en place l’exemple qui va suivre, il y a une réel évaluation du risque à faire, ne vous lancez pas n’importe comment en suivant mes chiffres, faites vos propres recherches & analyses.\n\nUn bon conseil également, gardez de la liquidité hors du protocole. Prenez en compte que les taux peuvent varier. Cette stratégie est particulièrement efficace dans un marché haussier et lorsque vous êtes très bull sur l’asset que vous déposez en collatéral.\n\nPour se faire, je vais prendre un exemple concret d’utilisation pour accumuler de l’eth.\n\n`Wallet de base : 30 eth Cours de l’eth : 3600 $ Votre sentiment sur l’eth : bullish`\n\n1/ Dépôt des 30 eth sur Aave, valeur du dépôt (108k $)\n\n2/ Emprunt d’usdc à hauteur de votre risque management établi en amont Max empruntable 80% (86k $) On va prendre 30% comme emprunt(32k4 $)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*OYWT68FPjNAJALsk)\n\nCe qui signifie que pour être liquidé, il faudrait que notre collatéral soit égal à 37k2, ce qui représente un eth à 1242$, ce qui est quelque chose de très peu probable vous en conviendrez, mais on ne sait jamais\n\nD’où l’importance de garder sous la main des stables pour réagir en cas de crash ou autre. On se retrouve avec nos 108k d’eth qui sont lock sur aave jusqu’à remboursement, et nos 32k4 de liquidité pour nos investissements/farming…\n\nEn ce qui concerne nos intérêts et notre du : Notre dépôt nous rapporte ≈ 400$/ans(0.37%) Notre emprunt nous coute ≈ 1250$/ans(3.86%) Ce qui fait que sur un an, en plus de notre emprunt de 32k4$ à rembourser, nous avons une dette de 850$/ans\n\nA partir d’ici il existe plusieurs chemins, suivez celui qui vous convient le mieux. Mettez vos stable au travail, générez des $$ et commencez à rembourser assez rapidement votre emprunt (recommandé), ce qui vous permettra de relancer la boucle et d’augmenter votre collatéral.\n\nSi vous avez vraiment foi en votre token déposé en collatéral, vous pouvez mixer les deux, en racheter et le déposer en + pour augmenter votre collatéral donc par conséquent votre max empruntable et baisser votre seuil de liquidation tout en remboursant à moindre rythme.\n\nL’avantage de cette stratégie réside dans le fait que si vous vous positionnez au bon moment votre collatéral va naturellement augmenter, ce qui vous permettra d’emprunter plus tout en gardant une gestion de risque très correct.\n\nMais c’est aussi le soucis, si vous vous positionnez au moment d’un top, votre collatéral va diminuer il faudra surveiller votre seuil de liquidation et venir le soutenir si nécessaire en déposant de la liquidité.\n\nD’où l’intérêt de mettre en place ce schéma assez tôt en bullrun, afin de profiter non seulement de liquidité pour vos investissements, mais également conserver vos précieux eth pour l’avenir.\n\nIl y a bien entendu moyen d’augmenter votre emprunts, et de réaliser un modèle plus optimisé que mon exemple très simple, mais encore une fois c’est vous et votre risque management.\n\n**Pour ceux qui veulent des devoirs supplémentaires** 📚 :\n\n[https://docs.aave.com/faq/](https://docs.aave.com/faq/)\n\n[https://app.defisaver.com/](https://app.defisaver.com/)\n\n[https://defi.instadapp.io/](https://defi.instadapp.io/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636706125, "digest": "bGflsjciED8pMkp3ML42l72VgAjOqX0HsbtmauuuMzI", "contributor": "0x4e486E7eee27500b8851d63d003119c4DA4825f6"}
{"id": "_FnbTJV1f9AVyRkzqitPRW588yZu7G5b4BgJHwfRmAA", "title": "📌 Intro al Web3: Inizia qui a scoprire la blockchain", "body": "Dopo aver pubblicato il mio primo articolo \"[Musica e Blockchain](https://mirror.xyz/0xc0d31C0d6074E090D6a9A833004F157C4F9f2A32/kb32F7UuQT0AtUMTiu6QfLIz2-AGMALy8aHwn5fImqM)\", ho ricevuto diversi feedback su quanto che ho scritto. In particolare molte persone mi hanno fatto notare che gli argomenti da me trattati sono di difficile comprensione per chi è alle prime armi con ciò che concerne il web3.\n\nCosì ho deciso di scrivere questo **“compendio” per aiutare chiunque ad avere una introduzione al mondo blockchain**, fornendo conoscenze di base attraverso un glossario, fonti terze e consigli utili che ho ottenute dalla mia esperienza e da quanto ho studiato finora.\n\nInoltre vorrei che questo **articolo** fosse **dinamico**, riservandomi di aggiornarlo anche a distanza di mesi nel caso in cui qualcosa possa esser spiegato meglio o ci fossero novità importanti; così facendo il link resterà sempre lo stesso e potrete inviarlo ai vostri amici che iniziano ad avvicinarsi all'argomento 😇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vui7ogQlLAFk2jdCGKmBS.png?height=250&width=3000)\n\n## Glossario\n\nCome quando si impara una nuova lingua, credo che l'**acquisizione di nuovi vocaboli** aiuti ad avere una **migliore comprensione di un determinato argomento**, a elaborare frasi migliori e avere pensieri più strutturati. Per questo credo che il miglior modo per iniziare questo percorso, ed avere una comprensione generale della tecnologia blockchain, sia attraverso un glossario.\n\n*I termini finanziari sono quasi del tutto assenti perché vorrei che vi focalizzaste prima di tutto sulla tecnologia, sulle possibilità che essa offre e i problemi che può risolvere; credo che le implementazioni finanziare possono essere una conseguenza di una buona comprensione della materia.*\n\nNon assicuro che il glossario sia completo e impeccabile, ma comprende tutti termini più usati in ordine alfabetico, vi consiglio di leggerlo una volta per un'infarinatura generale e poi utilizzarlo quando vi imbattete in un termine di cui non ricordate il significato. Inoltre i termini in *corsivo* all'interno delle definizioni sono anch'essi presenti.\n\n* **airdrop:** distribuzione gratuita di *token* da parte dei fondatori di un progetto, normalmente avviene nelle fasi iniziali di quest'ultimo in modo da cedere il possesso di un *protocollo* e la creazione di una *DAO.* I calcoli della distribuzione sono variabili e determinati dalle attività fatte sulla piattaforma (es. semplice utilizzo, acquisti, codici referral ecc.), normalmente non vengono citati fino al momento dell'annuncio.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1458091239501348869?s=20](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1458091239501348869?s=20)\n\n* **altcoin:** qualsiasi cryptovaluta diversa da Bitcoin viene definita altcoin (che sta per “alternative coin”).\n* **blocco:** è un insieme di transazioni che vengono raggruppate secondo una grandezza massima (la block size) predeterminata per poi essere verificate da un nodo della *blockchain*.\n* **blockchain:** è la tecnologia che sta alla base del *web3*. Consiste in una rete decentralizzata, costruita da una catena continua e lineare di blocchi, una volta creato un *blocco* non si può più modificare. Tutte le transazioni sulla rete vengono memorizzate in un registro condiviso, a cui chiunque può avere accesso, il che significa che non è necessario un server centrale per autorizzare le transazioni e gli *smart contract* sulla rete, ma anche che le transazioni sono pubbliche e accessibili a chiunque.\n* **chiave privata**: è una serie alfanumerica usata nei sistemi di crittografia (asimmetrica) per decifrare un messaggio o per apporre la firma digitale. La chiave privata genera a sua volta la numerose *chiavi pubbliche*, ed è per questo che deve rimanere segreta.\n* **chiave pubblica**: è una serie alfanumerica usata nei sistemi di crittografia (asimmetrica) per cifrare un messaggio o per verificare l’autenticità di una firma digitale. Ogni indirizzo di una rete *blockchain* è associato ad una chiave pubblica, che è una specie di nome utente disponibile per tutti sul registro condiviso. Per esempio la chiave pubblica che sto utilizzando in questo momento è 0xc0d31C0d6074E090D6a9A833004F157C4F9f2A32.\n* **cryptovaluta**: valuta digitale, crittografata e basata sulla tecnologia *blockchain*. È una valuta progettata per essere decentralizzata (senza una banca centrale), con ogni *token* e transazione criptati in modo univoco. La tecnologia *blockchain* è l’infrastruttura che consente di archiviare le criptovalute sulla rete.\n* **DAO**: sigla di Decentralized Autonomous Organization, ovvero una organizzazione decentralizzata che opera seguendo delle regole di uno *smart contract*. Al suo interno il diritto di voto è rappresentato dal *token* e grazie a questo la community può decidere lo sviluppo del *protocollo*.\n* **exchange**: è una piattaforma/mercato digitale per la compravendita di *criptovalute*. Ne esistono di 2 tipi, gli exchange decentralizzati (*protocolli* presenti sulla *blockchain* che permettono lo scambio senza un ente centrale) e gli exchange centralizzati (più tradizionali che hanno un'azienda che detiene il capitale).\n* **fee**: conosciuta anche come gas fee, è la commissione sulle operazioni fatte sulla *blockchain*, sono il premio dato ai *miner* per il lavoro fatto, variano in base a quanto la rete è congestionata e quanto l'operazione richiede lavoro (per esempio il trasferimento di una crypto richiede meno lavoro rispetto all'utilizzo di uno *smart contract* per il *minting* di un *NFT*).\n* **FIAT**: è una valuta emessa e supportata da un ente governativo e che ha corso legale. Euro e Dollari sono esempi di valute FIAT, non è considerabile un elemento delle *blockchain* ma è un termine ricorrente.\n* **fork**: è un aggiornamento/modifica del *protocollo* concordato collettivamente dalla community parte di esso. Esistono due tipi di fork, il soft fork (considerabile come un semplice upgrade che supporta le versioni precedenti della rete) e l'hard fork (non supporta le versioni precedenti della rete).\n* **halving**: dimezzamento del premio dato ai *miner*. Il *protocollo* informatico di Bitcoin prevede un halving ogni 4 anni.\n* **hash**: è il risultato di una funzione hash, ovvero un'operazione crittografata che genera una serie alfanumerica irripetibile che identifica una transazione sulla *blockchain*. Per aiutare la comprensione di questo concetto utilizzo un esempio pratico, la transaction hash [0xbed1123aa714d41b4583f129220e6d3929ca12d9d647f2922bf889625c5853e0](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbed1123aa714d41b4583f129220e6d3929ca12d9d647f2922bf889625c5853e0) fa riferimento ad una transazione su *blockchain* Ethereum che ho fatto dal mio indirizzo all'indirizzo della mia etichetta discografica.\n* **ledger**: letteralmente “libro mastro”, è un registro digitale di tutte le transazioni\n  avvenute su una determinata rete *blockchain*. Le copie del ledger vengono memorizzate nella rete e sono costantemente aggiornate per corrispondere l’una con l’altra, in modo che le transazioni possano essere verificate da chiunque sulla rete (da non confondere con il nome proprio Ledger degli hardware wallet).\n* **market cap**: è la capitalizzazione di mercato di una *cryptovaluta* ottenuta moltiplicando la moneta circolante per il suo valore di mercato.\n* **miner**: persona che pratica il mining, ovvero utilizzare la potenza di calcolo di un computer per confermare le transazioni sulla *blockchain* risolvendo un'equazione. Questo lavoro viene ricompensato dalla rete stessa con delle *fee* pagate da chi vuole fare la transazione nella *cryptovaluta* della blockchain utilizzata.\n* **minting**: l'atto di \"coniare\" un *token* o un *NFT* utilizzando uno *smart contract.*\n* **NFT**: sigla di Non-Fungible Token, è un tipo speciale di *token* che rappresenta qualcosa di unico, vengono utilizzati per creare scarsità digitale verificabile e comunemente fungono da strumento per dimostrare il possesso di oggetti digitali unici come la crypto arte, collezionabili digitali o nei giochi online.\n* **nodo**: un computer collegato alla rete che conserva e distribuisce una copia del *ledger* (registro) di una determinata *blockchain*.\n* **proof-of-stake**: tipo di *protocollo* per la messa in sicurezza di una rete *blockchain*, e per il conseguimento di un consenso distribuito, tutte le blockchain più moderne lo utilizzano, con questo protocollo un *miner* deve essere in possesso di un certo ammontare di *cryptovalute* per poter avviare un *nodo*. Essendo necessaria una grossa quantità di cryptovalute per avviare un nodo, queste possono essere ricevute in delega da chi le possiede in cambio di una percentuale delle *fee*, più ne vengono delegate/possedute più alto sarà il ricavo (Cardano, Elrond e in futuro Ethereum con l'hard *fork* Ethereum 2.0 sono blockchain che usano questo protocollo).\n* **proof-of-work**: tipo di *protocollo* per la messa in sicurezza di una rete *blockchain*, per diventare *miner* è necessaria solo la potenza di calcolo per eseguire le operazioni, maggiore è la potenza di calcolo maggiore è il premio ottenuto, è il primo tipo di protocollo utilizzato dalle blockchain e quello tecnologicamente più arretrato e che consuma più energia (Bitcoin e Ethereum sono blockchain che usano questo protocollo).\n* **protocollo**: è un modello di interazioni basate sulla tecnologia del database condiviso (i dati non sono conservati in un server centrale ma sono distribuiti sulla rete e conservati dai *nodi*), spiegato semplice è l'insieme di elementi che permettono di comunicare con la *blockchain*, inviando e ricevendo i dati.\n* **smart contract**: protocolli informatici che facilitano, verificano, o fanno rispettare, la negoziazione o l'esecuzione di un contratto. Quando vengono soddisfatti i termini di uno smart contract, questo viene eseguito automaticamente dal *miner* ricompensato con delle *fee*, maggiore è la potenza necessaria per l'operazione maggiore è la fee. Per esempio le fee di uno scambio di *cryptovalute* su un *exchange* decentralizzato sono inferiori rispetto al *minting* di un *NFT.*\n* **token**: è un titolo che rappresenta un diritto, di norma, delle royalties; utilizzato dai *protocolli* sulle *blockchain* per distribuirne il possesso. Va fatta una distinzione, i token fanno riferimento ai protocolli sviluppati su una blockchain, quindi è scorretto chiamarli cryptovalute. Per esempio $AUDIO è il token del protocollo Audius che sfrutta la blockchain Ethereum per distribuirne il possesso, $ETH quindi è una cryptovaluta.\n* **wallet**: strumento per memorizzare le *chiavi private*, tenerle al sicuro e interagire con la blockchain. Ne esistono diversi tipi, i più diffusi sono gli hardware wallet (i più sicuri) e i software wallet (Coinbase Wallet, Metamask ecc.).\n* **web3**: è il nome che rappresenta tutto l’ecosistema della *blockchain* assieme al movimento culturale della decentralizzazione dell’internet e del suo possesso distribuito.\n\n[https://twitter.com/TheCryptoCPA/status/1457014965940916234?s=20](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoCPA/status/1457014965940916234?s=20)\n\n* **whitepaper**: è un documento informativo relativo ad un progetto sviluppato su *blockchain*. È il manifesto che indica gli obiettivi, la tecnologia ed i problemi che intende risolvere il progetto legato al *protocollo* che verrà creato.\n\n## Consigli\n\n**Armatevi di curiosità e voglia di imparare.** Questo è in assoluto il primo consiglio che posso darvi per comprendere il web3. Siamo ancora agli inizi di una rivoluzione tecnologica e di conseguenza nulla è certo o ben definito, potrebbe essere che qualcosa che oggi ha valore o rilevanza domani sarà già obsoleto. Però attorno a questa tecnologia si stanno creando community e nuove culture, non fermatevi solamente al lato economico, quella è solo la punta dell’iceberg.\n\nPrima di iniziare però a utilizzare il vostro primo wallet **vi consiglio vivamente di informarvi sulle questioni di sicurezza**. Non essendoci un ente centrale che regola la blockchain detenete tutte le responsabilità nelle vostre mani, \"*da grandi poteri derivano grandi responsabilità\"*, ciò significa che se dovessero rubarvi le chiavi private perdereste tutto quello che avete nel portafoglio, in particolare utilizzate un pezzo di carta per scrivere il seed per generare la chiave privata e nascondetelo in un luogo sicuro di casa.\n\nIl **miglior strumento per mantenere le proprie chiavi private al sicuro sono gli hardware wallet** (io consiglio il Ledger) ma costando circa 60 euro per qualcuno potrebbe non essere il wallet migliore per iniziare. Quindi quello che consiglio è **scaricare l'estensione metamask sul vostro browser** (Chrome o Firefox, non è presente per Safari) e utilizzarla per interfacciarvi per la prima volta con i protocolli della blockchain Ethereum, in modo da capire il loro meccanismo. Attenzione però, la chiave privata (con tutte quelle pubbliche generate da essa) che utilizzerete non sarà trasferibile a wallet differenti da metamask, quindi consideratela come una prova.\n\nIniziate da questi siti e poi esplorate liberamente:\n\n[mirror.xyz](http://mirror.xyz): fate l'accesso e scrivete qualche riga sul vostro blog per festeggiare i vostri primi passi sul web3, è gratis e potrebbe essere divertente tornare a leggere le vostre sensazioni a distanza di tempo. Pubblicatelo senza far capire chi siete (se volete), quel testo rimarrà per sempre all'interno della blockchain associato ad un indirizzo pubblico.\n\n[opensea.io](http://opensea.io): è il marketplace per la compravendita di NFT più grande al momento, curiosate e cercate di capire come funziona l'acquisto di beni digitali. Ovviamente sconsiglio di acquistare perché i costi attualmente sono fuori portata per una persona alle prime armi.\n\n[tryshowtime.com](http://tryshowtime.com): questo protocollo vi farà capire meglio il funzionamento del web condiviso, è sempre incentrato sugli NFT ma serve a scoprirne di nuovi ogni volta che qualcuno ne minta uno e permette di interagirci mettendo like e commentando. La cosa importante da comprendere è che tutto quello che vedete non è stato caricato direttamente sul sito ma sul database condiviso della blockchain e in automatico associato all'indirizzo pubblico dell'artista.\n\nQuesto 3 protocolli sono abbastanza per iniziare, ma vi serviranno come svezzamento senza la necessità di comprare ETH per l'utilizzo della blockchain. Però ricordatevi di salvare il seed delle le chiavi private anche se prenderete un hardware wallet, potrebbe essere che in futuro siate eleggibili per un airdrop di token per averci interagito.\n\n## Risorse\n\nNell'ultima parte di questo articolo vi voglio consigliare delle risorse che, secondo me, **saranno utili a comprendere il web3 e darvi vari punti di vista sulla materia**, compresi di note e motivazioni se necessario.

À quoi servent-ils, quelles sont leurs différences, et comment en tirer profit ?\n\nLe stablecoin est une crypto monnaie à part entière qui se veut **stable**, qui est pour la plupart du temps **adossée** à une monnaie fiat ($, €, etc.) et qui se doit de coller à sa valeur via des mécanismes de collatéralisations ou algorithmiques.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*j_7kn5_vRumw4470)\n\n**Ses utilités sont multiples :**\n\n* Se protéger de la volatilité des crypto\n* Les utilisations cross-chain\n* Les utilisations dans la DeFi / CeFi / CeDeFi pour générer des rendements\n* Le crypto to stablecoin n’est pas générateur d’imposition\n\n![Stablecoin Supply](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*BDJKEKmyCM3vdt5h)\n\n**Globalement, pour qu’un stablecoin persiste dans le temps, il y a plusieurs points majeurs à prendre en compte :**\n\n* Sa conception et ses mécanismes\n* L’émetteur\n* La confiance que les gens lui accordent\n* Son utilisation\n\n**Il en existe des dizaines, mais on peut globalement les regrouper en 4 catégories :**\n\n* Les stablecoins 100% collatéralisé par du fiat\n* Les stablecoins 100% ou over-collatéralisés par des cryptos\n* Les stablecoins 100% algorithmique\n* Les stablecoins semi-algorithmique\n\nL’USDC, l’USDT et le BUSD sont des stablecoins 100% collatéralisés avec de l’argent réel, c’est-à-dire qu’à chaque fois qu’un USDC est émis, 1$ Américain est mis sous séquestre dans un compte bancaire affilié à Circle pour l’USDC par exemple.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Mp1UVD-8krcIGK8a)\n\nÀ l’inverse, quand l’offre en circulation ne correspond plus à la demande, les USDC sont brûlés et les $ sous séquestres sont libérés.\n\nLeur valeur est donc assurée intégralement tant que la balance entre les USDC émis et les $ mis sous séquestre est juste. Certains pourront y voir un problème, ces assets sont centralisés, et c’est à ce problème qu’essaie de pallier le DAI ou l’UST, mais avant d’en parler …\n\nCertains se souviennent probablement de l’affaire USDT, malgré tous les scandales autour, il n’a jamais perdu son peg, et c’est encore aujourd’hui le stable coin le plus utilisé. Pourquoi ? Sa popularité et son utilisation massive.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*upnboC16h-vlj-x2)\n\nComme évoqué précédemment, **le manque de décentralisation** présente un risque réel bien que peu probable, l’émetteur décide de l’avenir de son asset. Il peut donc le modifier, le supprimer, en interdire l’échange, le bloquer à sa guise, d’où la recherche de décentralisation.\n\nLes stablecoins collatéralisés ou over-collatéralisés par des cryptos : Le sUSD (par Synthetix) ou encore le DAI (par MakerDao). Ces assets offrent une décentralisation, et sont supposés maintenir leur peg aussi bien que les stablecoins collatéralisés en fiat, leur seul souci ?\n\nIls sont encore loin d’être capital efficient, c’est-à-dire qu’on obtient moins d’argent en sortie que ce qu’on a déposé en entrée pour les créer, ce qui assure une certaine sécurité pour le protocole comme on va le voir. On parle ici de “over-collatéralisation”.\n\nLe DAI, stablecoin décentralisé de MakerDao fonctionne sur le même principe, mais à la place de mettre des $ dans une banque, ce sont des Ethers ou tout autre asset ERC-20 voté par les posesseurs de [$MKR](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MKR&src=cashtag_click) qui sont mis sous séquestres via des smart contracts.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*2XHxThCJNmW8rcbt)\n\nIl faut déposer entre 101% et 175% de collatéral pour obtenir du DAI, les cryptos étant plus volatiles, le protocole s’assure une marge en cas de forts mouvements, il gère également les liquidations pour ne pas avoir de dette.\n\nQuelques exemples de collatéral mini à déposer et la liste d’assets ERC-20 qu’accepte le protocole en collatéral (à noter qu’il est également possible de déposer des LP en collatéral, plus d’infos ici : [https://oasis.app](https://t.co/vFiMhnhdZM?amp=1))\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*d7bNL8Ci0OgPbpto)\n\nÉvoquons maintenant le cas des stablecoins algorithmiques. Stabiliser un asset, uniquement grâce à des mécanismes ingénieux et sans aucun collatéral. C’est un véritable défi auquel de nombreux acteurs de la crypto s’essayent ou se sont essayés, parfois en se brûlant les ailes.\n\nL’UST, probablement le plus connu, le stablecoin décentralisé de l’écosystème Terra ($LUNA) est probablement celui qui a le mieux réussi l’exercice avec quand même une grosse frayeur en janvier 2021. Mais comment expliquer cette réussite ?\n\n![Cours de l'UST](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*vP_IZPV0QnY1BkCr)\n\n1\\. Un mécanisme très ingénieux, pour chaque UST crée, l’équivalent en [$LUNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNA&src=cashtag_click) est burn, et inversement. Ce processus permet de faire converger la volatilité sur le token LUNA et non sur l’UST.\n\n2\\. Un écosystème qui se développe complètement autour de l’UST, Anchor, Mirror, Pylon et les prochains projets de l’écosystème gravitent autour du stablecoin, ce qui contribue à sa stabilité.\n\n![Écosystème Terra ](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Hp6x39t6Eh-cab4j)\n\n3\\. Une volonté d’interopérabilité avant tout.\n\n4\\. Une démocratisation dans le monde réel, avec des solutions de paiement viables et utilisées notamment en Corée.\n\nLes stablecoins semi-algorithmiques : Ils combinent les deux aspects précédents, la collatéralisation et des mécanismes algo. Ils offrent en général la possibilité d’être sous-collatéralisé contrairement au DAI, pour plus de fenêtres d’arbitrage et de meilleurs rendements DeFi.\n\nCependant, ils restent vulnérables, au même titre que les stablecoins 100% algo, aux phénomènes de bank-run et leur viabilité sur le long terme ne pourra s’observer qu’après être éprouvée par le marché.\n\nDeux bons exemples de stable semi-algo, le [$FRAX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FRAX&src=cashtag_click) qui rempli bien son rôle pour l’instant ([https://frax.finance](https://t.co/rItqj9oiw7?amp=1)) Et l’ [$IRON](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IRON&src=cashtag_click) victime de son succès ou mécanisme non viable sur le long terme ?\n\n> <https://rekt.news/iron-finance-rekt/>\n\n![Cours FRAX](https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/0\\*BGbmPCPvaTsfWEZv)\n\n![Cours IRON](https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/0\\*WSTYGdiVUhiXPuII)\n\nUne chose est sûre pour ces projets prometteurs, leur survie ne dépendra pas uniquement des mécanismes de maintiens de peg, l’éducation des utilisateurs, la confiance, l’aspect communautaire seront également des aspects primordiaux.\n\nSi l’on devait récapituler les différences entre les types de stablecoins on pourrait le faire avec ce tableau :\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*suv8X08gvOW_4jWC)\n\nIl est également important de rappeler que pour bon nombre de protocoles DeFi comme Aave, Compound, OlympusDAO… Une perte de peg du DAI par exemple entraînerait des liquidations massives et des pertes considérables.

{"id": "m6S8sOW6PP7tGozrxEbDWsZi9b60Hc1Z1JdmdbqQi-E", "title": "📌 Intro al Web3: Inizia qui a scoprire la blockchain", "body": "Dopo aver pubblicato il mio primo articolo \"[Musica e Blockchain](https://mirror.xyz/0xc0d31C0d6074E090D6a9A833004F157C4F9f2A32/kb32F7UuQT0AtUMTiu6QfLIz2-AGMALy8aHwn5fImqM)\", ho ricevuto diversi feedback su quanto che ho scritto. In particolare molte persone mi hanno fatto notare che gli argomenti da me trattati sono di difficile comprensione per chi è alle prime armi con ciò che concerne il web3.\n\nCosì ho deciso di scrivere questo **“compendio” per aiutare chiunque ad avere una introduzione al mondo blockchain**, fornendo conoscenze di base attraverso un glossario, fonti terze e consigli utili che ho ottenute dalla mia esperienza e da quanto ho studiato finora.\n\nInoltre vorrei che questo **articolo** fosse **dinamico**, riservandomi di aggiornarlo anche a distanza di mesi nel caso in cui qualcosa possa esser spiegato meglio o ci fossero novità importanti; così facendo il link resterà sempre lo stesso e potrete inviarlo ai vostri amici che iniziano ad avvicinarsi all'argomento 😇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vui7ogQlLAFk2jdCGKmBS.png?height=250&width=3000)\n\n## Glossario\n\nCome quando si impara una nuova lingua, credo che l'**acquisizione di nuovi vocaboli** aiuti ad avere una **migliore comprensione di un determinato argomento**, a elaborare frasi migliori e avere pensieri più strutturati. Per questo credo che il miglior modo per iniziare questo percorso, ed avere una comprensione generale della tecnologia blockchain, sia attraverso un glossario.\n\n*I termini finanziari sono quasi del tutto assenti perché vorrei che vi focalizzaste prima di tutto sulla tecnologia, sulle possibilità che essa offre e i problemi che può risolvere; credo che le implementazioni finanziare possono essere una conseguenza di una buona comprensione della materia.*\n\nNon assicuro che il glossario sia completo e impeccabile, ma comprende tutti termini più usati in ordine alfabetico, vi consiglio di leggerlo una volta per un'infarinatura generale e poi utilizzarlo quando vi imbattete in un termine di cui non ricordate il significato. Inoltre i termini in *corsivo* all'interno delle definizioni sono anch'essi presenti.\n\n* **airdrop:** distribuzione gratuita di *token* da parte dei fondatori di un progetto, normalmente avviene nelle fasi iniziali di quest'ultimo in modo da cedere il possesso di un *protocollo* e la creazione di una *DAO.* I calcoli della distribuzione sono variabili e determinati dalle attività fatte sulla piattaforma (es. semplice utilizzo, acquisti, codici referral ecc.), normalmente non vengono citati fino al momento dell'annuncio.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1458091239501348869?s=20](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1458091239501348869?s=20)\n\n* **altcoin:** qualsiasi cryptovaluta diversa da Bitcoin viene definita altcoin (che sta per “alternative coin”).\n* **blocco:** è un insieme di transazioni che vengono raggruppate secondo una grandezza massima (la block size) predeterminata per poi essere verificate da un nodo della *blockchain*.\n* **blockchain:** è la tecnologia che sta alla base del *web3*. Consiste in una rete decentralizzata, costruita da una catena continua e lineare di blocchi, una volta creato un *blocco* non si può più modificare. Tutte le transazioni sulla rete vengono memorizzate in un registro condiviso, a cui chiunque può avere accesso, il che significa che non è necessario un server centrale per autorizzare le transazioni e gli *smart contract* sulla rete, ma anche che le transazioni sono pubbliche e accessibili a chiunque.\n* **chiave privata**: è una serie alfanumerica usata nei sistemi di crittografia (asimmetrica) per decifrare un messaggio o per apporre la firma digitale. La chiave privata genera a sua volta la numerose *chiavi pubbliche*, ed è per questo che deve rimanere segreta.\n* **chiave pubblica**: è una serie alfanumerica usata nei sistemi di crittografia (asimmetrica) per cifrare un messaggio o per verificare l’autenticità di una firma digitale. Ogni indirizzo di una rete *blockchain* è associato ad una chiave pubblica, che è una specie di nome utente disponibile per tutti sul registro condiviso. Per esempio la chiave pubblica che sto utilizzando in questo momento è 0xc0d31C0d6074E090D6a9A833004F157C4F9f2A32.\n* **cryptovaluta**: valuta digitale, crittografata e basata sulla tecnologia *blockchain*. È una valuta progettata per essere decentralizzata (senza una banca centrale), con ogni *token* e transazione criptati in modo univoco. La tecnologia *blockchain* è l’infrastruttura che consente di archiviare le criptovalute sulla rete.\n* **DAO**: sigla di Decentralized Autonomous Organization, ovvero una organizzazione decentralizzata che opera seguendo delle regole di uno *smart contract*. Al suo interno il diritto di voto è rappresentato dal *token* e grazie a questo la community può decidere lo sviluppo del *protocollo*.\n* **exchange**: è una piattaforma/mercato digitale per la compravendita di *criptovalute*. Ne esistono di 2 tipi, gli exchange decentralizzati (*protocolli* presenti sulla *blockchain* che permettono lo scambio senza un ente centrale) e gli exchange centralizzati (più tradizionali che hanno un'azienda che detiene il capitale).\n* **fee**: conosciuta anche come gas fee, è la commissione sulle operazioni fatte sulla *blockchain*, sono il premio dato ai *miner* per il lavoro fatto, variano in base a quanto la rete è congestionata e quanto l'operazione richiede lavoro (per esempio il trasferimento di una crypto richiede meno lavoro rispetto all'utilizzo di uno *smart contract* per il *minting* di un *NFT*).\n* **FIAT**: è una valuta emessa e supportata da un ente governativo e che ha corso legale. Euro e Dollari sono esempi di valute FIAT, non è considerabile un elemento delle *blockchain* ma è un termine ricorrente.\n* **fork**: è un aggiornamento/modifica del *protocollo* concordato collettivamente dalla community parte di esso. Esistono due tipi di fork, il soft fork (considerabile come un semplice upgrade che supporta le versioni precedenti della rete) e l'hard fork (non supporta le versioni precedenti della rete).\n* **halving**: dimezzamento del premio dato ai *miner*. Il *protocollo* informatico di Bitcoin prevede un halving ogni 4 anni.\n* **hash**: è il risultato di una funzione hash, ovvero un'operazione crittografata che genera una serie alfanumerica irripetibile che identifica una transazione sulla *blockchain*. Per aiutare la comprensione di questo concetto utilizzo un esempio pratico, la transaction hash [0xbed1123aa714d41b4583f129220e6d3929ca12d9d647f2922bf889625c5853e0](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbed1123aa714d41b4583f129220e6d3929ca12d9d647f2922bf889625c5853e0) fa riferimento ad una transazione su *blockchain* Ethereum che ho fatto dal mio indirizzo all'indirizzo della mia etichetta discografica.\n* **ledger**: letteralmente “libro mastro”, è un registro digitale di tutte le transazioni\n  avvenute su una determinata rete *blockchain*. Le copie del ledger vengono memorizzate nella rete e sono costantemente aggiornate per corrispondere l’una con l’altra, in modo che le transazioni possano essere verificate da chiunque sulla rete (da non confondere con il nome proprio Ledger degli hardware wallet).\n* **market cap**: è la capitalizzazione di mercato di una *cryptovaluta* ottenuta moltiplicando la moneta circolante per il suo valore di mercato.\n* **miner**: persona che pratica il mining, ovvero utilizzare la potenza di calcolo di un computer per confermare le transazioni sulla *blockchain* risolvendo un'equazione. Questo lavoro viene ricompensato dalla rete stessa con delle *fee* pagate da chi vuole fare la transazione nella *cryptovaluta* della blockchain utilizzata.\n* **minting**: l'atto di \"coniare\" un *token* o un *NFT* utilizzando uno *smart contract.*\n* **NFT**: sigla di Non-Fungible Token, è un tipo speciale di *token* che rappresenta qualcosa di unico, vengono utilizzati per creare scarsità digitale verificabile e comunemente fungono da strumento per dimostrare il possesso di oggetti digitali unici come la crypto arte, collezionabili digitali o nei giochi online.\n* **nodo**: un computer collegato alla rete che conserva e distribuisce una copia del *ledger* (registro) di una determinata *blockchain*.\n* **proof-of-stake**: tipo di *protocollo* per la messa in sicurezza di una rete *blockchain*, e per il conseguimento di un consenso distribuito, tutte le blockchain più moderne lo utilizzano, con questo protocollo un *miner* deve essere in possesso di un certo ammontare di *cryptovalute* per poter avviare un *nodo*. Essendo necessaria una grossa quantità di cryptovalute per avviare un nodo, queste possono essere ricevute in delega da chi le possiede in cambio di una percentuale delle *fee*, più ne vengono delegate/possedute più alto sarà il ricavo (Cardano, Elrond e in futuro Ethereum con l'hard *fork* Ethereum 2.0 sono blockchain che usano questo protocollo).\n* **proof-of-work**: tipo di *protocollo* per la messa in sicurezza di una rete *blockchain*, per diventare *miner* è necessaria solo la potenza di calcolo per eseguire le operazioni, maggiore è la potenza di calcolo maggiore è il premio ottenuto, è il primo tipo di protocollo utilizzato dalle blockchain e quello tecnologicamente più arretrato e che consuma più energia (Bitcoin e Ethereum sono blockchain che usano questo protocollo).\n* **protocollo**: è un modello di interazioni basate sulla tecnologia del database condiviso (i dati non sono conservati in un server centrale ma sono distribuiti sulla rete e conservati dai *nodi*), spiegato semplice è l'insieme di elementi che permettono di comunicare con la *blockchain*, inviando e ricevendo i dati.\n* **smart contract**: protocolli informatici che facilitano, verificano, o fanno rispettare, la negoziazione o l'esecuzione di un contratto. Quando vengono soddisfatti i termini di uno smart contract, questo viene eseguito automaticamente dal *miner* ricompensato con delle *fee*, maggiore è la potenza necessaria per l'operazione maggiore è la fee. Per esempio le fee di uno scambio di *cryptovalute* su un *exchange* decentralizzato sono inferiori rispetto al *minting* di un *NFT.*\n* **token**: è un titolo che rappresenta un diritto, di norma, delle royalties; utilizzato dai *protocolli* sulle *blockchain* per distribuirne il possesso. Va fatta una distinzione, i token fanno riferimento ai protocolli sviluppati su una blockchain, quindi è scorretto chiamarli cryptovalute. Per esempio $AUDIO è il token del protocollo Audius che sfrutta la blockchain Ethereum per distribuirne il possesso, $ETH quindi è una cryptovaluta.\n* **wallet**: strumento per memorizzare le *chiavi private*, tenerle al sicuro e interagire con la blockchain. Ne esistono diversi tipi, i più diffusi sono gli hardware wallet (i più sicuri) e i software wallet (Coinbase Wallet, Metamask ecc.).\n* **web3**: è il nome che rappresenta tutto l’ecosistema della *blockchain* assieme al movimento culturale della decentralizzazione dell’internet e del suo possesso distribuito.\n\n[https://twitter.com/TheCryptoCPA/status/1457014965940916234?s=20](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoCPA/status/1457014965940916234?s=20)\n\n* **whitepaper**: è un documento informativo relativo ad un progetto sviluppato su *blockchain*. È il manifesto che indica gli obiettivi, la tecnologia ed i problemi che intende risolvere il progetto legato al *protocollo* che verrà creato.\n\n## Consigli\n\n**Armatevi di curiosità e voglia di imparare.** Questo è in assoluto il primo consiglio che posso darvi per comprendere il web3. Siamo ancora agli inizi di una rivoluzione tecnologica e di conseguenza nulla è certo o ben definito, potrebbe essere che qualcosa che oggi ha valore o rilevanza domani sarà già obsoleto. Però attorno a questa tecnologia si stanno creando community e nuove culture, non fermatevi solamente al lato economico, quella è solo la punta dell’iceberg.\n\nPrima di iniziare però a utilizzare il vostro primo wallet **vi consiglio vivamente di informarvi sulle questioni di sicurezza**. Non essendoci un ente centrale che regola la blockchain detenete tutte le responsabilità nelle vostre mani, \"*da grandi poteri derivano grandi responsabilità\"*, ciò significa che se dovessero rubarvi le chiavi private perdereste tutto quello che avete nel portafoglio, in particolare utilizzate un pezzo di carta per scrivere il seed per generare la chiave privata e nascondetelo in un luogo sicuro di casa.\n\nIl **miglior strumento per mantenere le proprie chiavi private al sicuro sono gli hardware wallet** (io consiglio il Ledger) ma costando circa 60 euro per qualcuno potrebbe non essere il wallet migliore per iniziare. Quindi quello che consiglio è **scaricare l'estensione metamask sul vostro browser** (Chrome o Firefox, non è presente per Safari) e utilizzarla per interfacciarvi per la prima volta con i protocolli della blockchain Ethereum, in modo da capire il loro meccanismo. Attenzione però, la chiave privata (con tutte quelle pubbliche generate da essa) che utilizzerete non sarà trasferibile a wallet differenti da metamask, quindi consideratela come una prova.\n\nIniziate da questi siti e poi esplorate liberamente:\n\n[mirror.xyz](http://mirror.xyz): fate l'accesso e scrivete qualche riga sul vostro blog per festeggiare i vostri primi passi sul web3, è gratis e potrebbe essere divertente tornare a leggere le vostre sensazioni a distanza di tempo. Pubblicatelo senza far capire chi siete (se volete), quel testo rimarrà per sempre all'interno della blockchain associato ad un indirizzo pubblico.\n\n[opensea.io](http://opensea.io): è il marketplace per la compravendita di NFT più grande al momento, curiosate e cercate di capire come funziona l'acquisto di beni digitali. Ovviamente sconsiglio di acquistare perché i costi attualmente sono fuori portata per una persona alle prime armi.\n\n[tryshowtime.com](http://tryshowtime.com): questo protocollo vi farà capire meglio il funzionamento del web condiviso, è sempre incentrato sugli NFT ma serve a scoprirne di nuovi ogni volta che qualcuno ne minta uno e permette di interagirci mettendo like e commentando. La cosa importante da comprendere è che tutto quello che vedete non è stato caricato direttamente sul sito ma sul database condiviso della blockchain e in automatico associato all'indirizzo pubblico dell'artista.\n\nQuesto 3 protocolli sono abbastanza per iniziare, ma vi serviranno come svezzamento senza la necessità di comprare ETH per l'utilizzo della blockchain. Però ricordatevi di salvare il seed delle le chiavi private anche se prenderete un hardware wallet, potrebbe essere che in futuro siate eleggibili per un airdrop di token per averci interagito.\n\n## Risorse\n\nNell'ultima parte di questo articolo vi voglio consigliare delle risorse che, secondo me, **saranno utili a comprendere il web3 e darvi vari punti di vista sulla materia**, compresi di note e motivazioni se necessario. Avendo difficoltà a trovare materiale in italiano in linea con la mia visione ci saranno anche risorse in inglese.\n\n*Questa è la sezione che molto probabilmente subirà maggiori aggiornamenti e aggiunte nel caso trovassi qualcosa che credo possa tornarvi utile.

Apprezzo il suo modo di divulgare l'argomento perché non crea mai hype e cerca di essere il più analitico possibile, con un occhio importante al lato tecnologico. Per la mia visione del web3 è troppo Bitcoin-centrico, ma i suoi contenuti sono sempre al top.\n\n### Inglese\n\n* [askmirror.xyz](https://askmirror.xyz/) è il sito per ricercare articoli su Mirror, il protocollo che sto utilizzando attualmente per scrivere questo blog, ogni giorno potete trovare nuovi contenuti o progetti che raccontano i loro processi di sviluppo, qui potete trovare un sacco di materiale utile se conoscete l'inglese.\n* [Coopahtroopa](https://alias.co/coopahtroopa/essays) (Cooper Turley) è un ragazzo a capo di innumerevoli progetti del web3, ha un esperienza di 5 anni nel settore e scrive articoli che possono ispirarvi positivamente.\n* [Bankless](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com) è una newsletter sulle ultime notizie del mondo crypto, ottima per arrivare prima di altri su molti trend.\n\n## Conclusioni\n\nSe siete arrivati fino a questo punto vuol dire che siete tra le primissime persone che si stanno approcciando a questo ambito in Italia e dovreste essere fieri di voi stessi.

Pour devenir LP, il suffit d’ allouer 50% d’un token A (ETH) et 50% d’un token B(USDC) dans une pool de liquidité, ou d’en créer une.\n\nUne fois ceci effectué, le DEX va manager votre position de manière à permettre les échanges pour les gens qui veulent exécuter un swap et en même temps veiller à l’équité stricte de votre position, le ratio 50/50 doit toujours être maintenu, peut importe les variations de prix.\n\nVous touchez ensuite une commission sur les swaps effectuer sur votre paire, qui peut être fixe ou variable en fonction du protocole et vous pouvez être en + récompenser par le protocole pour avoir apporté de la liquidité, ce qui constitue votre revenu passif et votre % d’APR.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*3bATB26z3GEaxGRJjln-2Q.png)\n\nUne question vous vient peut être, comment un protocole décentralisé peut il être aussi proche du cours réel, et des prix qu’affichent un CEX comme Ftx, Binance…\n\nLa justification est simple, l’arbitrage, quand un gap se creuse entre le prix d’un Dex et le prix d’un Cex, des personnes viennent naturellement le combler en effectuant un swap et viennent chercher un premium, qui correspond à la différence de prix entre le DEX et le CEX.\n\nCet apport de liquidité générant de l’income n’est pas sans risque et il est extrêmement important de savoir dans quoi on met les pieds, on va y revenir un peu plus tard dans ce thread.\n\n## Histoire\n\nIl y a bientôt 3 ans, des protocoles ont vu le jour en se basant la dessus et en ayant une idée simple, permettre à tout le monde d’échanger n’importe quel token sans passer par un CEX, très simplement et de manière totalement décentralisé.\n\nUn des premiers à sortir de terre fut [@Uniswap](http://twitter.com/Uniswap) , qui est encore aujourd’hui le protocole DeFi qui a le plus gros marketcap, et qui a su innover, inspirer (en bien ou en mal par ailleurs) et ouvert la voix vers l’échange décentralisé ce qu’on appel très concrètement des swaps.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1\\*opOPS4ylG8xkUVAj8BS9pg.png)\n\nDepuis sa création, Uniswap c’est :\n\n* + de 450 Md de volume\n* + de 1 Md de fees générés pour les liquidity providers\n* + 55k paires crées\n\nCe qui fait de lui un véritable mastodonte du liquidity providing.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*j1xpxn6UIO_pG6oqPZfqPw.png)\n\nAprès uniswap, d’autres protocoles apportant quelque chose de différent sont nés\n\nLe meilleur exemple est probablement sushiswap, qui est encore aujourd’hui le plus gros concurrent à uniswap et qui a su se démarquer par de nombreuses innovations, que ça soit en terme d’expérience utilisateur, d’incentives au liquidity providing, de déploiement croisschain…\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*p_4h-wS-19aeznUVlssd4A.jpeg)\n\nD’autres, en partant d’un fork d’uniswap, ont su se développer et apporter leur propre innovations au fil du temps, c’est le cas notamment de PancakeSwap, qui a connu ses heures de gloire et est encore la référence sur la bsc.\n\n## Limites des LP\n\nLe soucis essentiel de ces protocoles est que devenir LP est souvent un jeu dangereux pour le provider, que cela demande une très bonne connaissance et que si il y a des APR/Y a 2 chiffres voir 3 il y a également un risque associé.\n\nDevenir LP, c’est effectivement quelque chose qui peut être très bénéfique pour un protocole, mais qui peut être extrêmement risqué pour votre capital.\n\nPourquoi ? Comme tous protocoles DeFi il y a des risques inhérents: hack, smart contract exploit, blackswan event, bug d’oracle… c’est pourquoi je vous conseil d’allouer vos fonds sur des plateformes qui ont fait leurs preuves.\n\nLe plus gros risque qui, peut être négligeable sur une stratégie bien maitrisé mais qui peut également surprendre pour un Liquidity Provider débutant c’est bien entendu l’impermanent loss.\n\nNotez également que devenir LP ne vous fait pas devenir invulnérable aux variations du marché, si les assets contenu dans votre pair de liquidité montent, alors la valeur de votre position augmente, et a contrario si le marché baisse, votre position baisse également.\n\nBeaucoup en entendent parler, c’est un terme très barbare, qui peut couter extrêmement cher si on ne connait pas en quoi ça consiste.\n\n## Focus sur l’Impermanent Loss\n\nIl faudrait réaliser un thread entier sur ce concept pour l’explorer complètement, c’est pourquoi je me contenterai de vous l’expliquer très vulgairement et de vous donner un exemple très concret\n\n> Si vous voulez aller plus loin : <https://medium.com/auditless/how-to-calculate-impermanent-loss-full-derivation-803e8b2497b7>\n\nL’impermant loss (IL) c’est tout simplement la différence entre la valeur de votre LP quand vous en sortez et la valeur que vous auriez eu en holdant si vous n’aviez pas déposer dans cette pool de liquidité.\n\nCette différence constitue une perte nette au moment ou vous sortez de votre pool de liquidité.\n\n> Vous pouvez la calculer très simplement ici.\n>\n> <https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/>\n\nPlus concrètement, si on reprend notre exemple avec l’ETH(3k $) et l’USDC(1$), on dépose 1 eth et 3k en usdc dans une pool de liquidité, si demain l’eth est a 5k et qu’on retire notre LP, alors on aura perdu 3.18% de notre position à cause de l’IL.\n\nLa particularité de cette IL, c’est que comme son nom l’indique c’est impermanent, si demain l’eth revient à 3k, et que vous sortez de votre position, alors il n’y aura aucune IL.\n\nNoté également que cela s’applique uniquement quand vous sortez de position, tant que vous êtes dans la pool, la moins value lié à l’IL reste “ latente “.\n\nLe coté insidieux de ce mécanisme est qu’il s’applique à la hausse comme à la baisse, bien que ça soit en général négligeable sur une pool X token / stable.\n\nCela peu rapidement devenir problématique quand vous providez deux tokens volatiles, et plus particulièrement quand un de ces tokens inclue un shitcoin, qui peut très bien faire + 1000% à la hausse comme -99% à la baisse.\n\nPour le petit exemple, un x10 ou un /10 d’une paire shitcoin/stable représente 42,5% d’IL.\n\nPresque la moitié de votre position de perte uniquement à cause de cette IL.\n\nQuelque chose qui est toute fois très intéressant, en minimisant ce risque d’IL reste les pool de stable, comme sur [@CurveFinance](http://twitter.com/CurveFinance) par exemple qui proposent en général un rendement correct pour du stable tout en assurant une IL nulle.\n\nAttention toute fois a bien vous renseigner sur les stable coins que vous providez, car au même titre qu’un asset volatile, si un stable vient à perdre son peg pour x ou y raisons, il y’aura de l’IL à la sortie.\n\nC’est pourquoi je vous conseil de bien vous renseigner, d’établir un plan concret et de vous projeter sur votre perte potentielle avant de prendre part à une pool de liquidité.\n\n## Innovations du secteur\n\nPour pallier à ce phénomène, des protocoles ont essayés d’innover dans le liquidity providing, afin de rendre au maximum bénéfique pour l’utilisateur.\n\nPour se faire, des projets ont commencés par étendre les pools, pour permettre le dépot de 2, 3 ,4 tokens voir plus, pourvoir moduler le ratio initial 50/50, pouvoir faire par exemple un 20 / 80.C’est ce qu’on retrouve sur des protocoles comme [@BalancerLabs](http://twitter.com/BalancerLabs) ou [Rari Capital](https://medium.com/u/be5c2f03de20?source=post_page-----f95b299dc31-----------------------------------)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BS0MOoYe5SDL5Hj7oEDsIw.png)\n\n## Focus sur Uni V3\n\nD’autres ont essayés de repenser le système, c’est le cas notamment de la V3 d’uniswap qui permet de cibler la liquidité que l’on fourni en définissant une borne — et une borne + sur notre position, ainsi on maximise les fees récoltés, et on a une idée claire de l’IL potentielle.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*AVnFZKf3WqXzljlfONB_AA.jpeg)\n\nReprenons notre exemple de pool ETH/USDC, vous décidez d’apporter de la liquidité sur uni V3, vous définissez votre borne — a 2600$ et votre borne + à 3500$, vous diluez donc votre liquidité dans ce range et non dans un range de 0 à + ∞ comme c’est le cas pour les LP classiques.\n\nSi l’eth sort de ce range, alors votre position n’est plus active, et vous ne récoltez plus de fees.\n\nVotre position est également intégralement converti en eth si le prix descend en dessous de 2k6$, et en usdc si le prix monte au dessus de 3k5$, si par la suite le prix revient dans votre range, votre position et de nouveau active.\n\nUni V3 peut être extrêmement bénéfique pour les personnes ayant une expériences en AT, qui sont capables de bien anticiper des mouvements de marché, et surtout de situer les phases de range.\n\nMais cela demande de l’expérience, des essais, à noter également que si vous voulez changez votre range, il faut annuler la première et en faire une nouvelle, ce qui signifie du gaz en plus, et l’IL de la sortie de position.\n\nLa V3 d’uniswap a également ouvert la voie pour des protocoles spécialisés dans la gestion de liquidité, qui manage et optimise votre position, des solutions extrêmement intéressantes pour des protocoles qui voudraient optimiser leur liquidité.\n\n[@VisorFinance](http://twitter.com/VisorFinance)\n\n[@lixirfinance](http://twitter.com/lixirfinance)\n\n## Liquidity as a service\n\nLa dernière innovation que j’aimerai aborder ici c’est le “liquidity as a service”.\n\n42% des personnes qui entrent sur une pool de farming y restent moins de 24h, au bout de 3 jours, environ 70% des personnes sont out de leur pool.\n\n> [Source : https://www.nansen.ai/research/all-hail-masterchef-analysing-yield-farming-activity](https://www.nansen.ai/research/all-hail-masterchef-analysing-yield-farming-activity)\n\nC’est donc un très gros problème, le capital est très loin d’être géré de manière efficiente.\n\nPour un protocole qui est en recherche de croissance, d’autres des soucis se posent.\n\nEn règle général, pour attirer du capital, les protocoles proposent en plus des fees tirés des différentes pools, de récompenser les fournisseurs de liquidités avec des tokens natifs du protocole.\n\nC’est ce qu’on appelle le liquidity mining, ce qui constitue une sell pressure supplémentaire pour les gens qui profitent des rewards boostés et ce n’est pas durable, ce qui signifie que lorsque les rewards vont baissés, les LP vont juste partir à la recherche d’une nouvelle pool.\n\nProblème supplémentaire, quand le marché à tendance à corriger voir crash, les LP vont très probablement sortir le plus rapidement possible de leur pool, et paradoxalement c’est à ce moment la que le protocole a besoin le plus de liquidité pour garantir une stabilité des prix.\n\nC’est pour pallier à tous ces problèmes que des projets extrêmement novateurs ont cherchés d’autres solutions.\n\nC’est le cas notamment d’[@Olympus](http://twitter.com/Olympus), avec sa feature “pro” qui souhaite accompagner les protocoles dans l’acquisition de leur propre liquidité, stabiliser au mieux le prix de leur token natif, gagner en attractivité et en possibilité de génération de yield.\n\nComment ? Grace à un système de bonds très ingénieux, qui permet au protocole de capter de la liquidité tout en proposant un bénéfice pour les acheteurs de bonds.\n\n> Plus d’infos ici : <https://twitter.com/kaiznxyz/status/1405929382494064651>\n\nEncore un autre exemple avec un autre protocole très big brain, qui a mis en place de nombreux mécanismes pour optimiser au mieux la liquidité capté.\n\n[@TokenReactor](http://twitter.com/TokenReactor)\n\nLes devoirs 📚 :\n\n[https://medium.com/crypto-wisdom/dex-decentralized-exchange-simplified-61ff0fc640dd](https://medium.com/crypto-wisdom/dex-decentralized-exchange-simplified-61ff0fc640dd)\n\n[https://docs.uniswap.org/](https://docs.uniswap.org/)\n\n[https://kushgoyal.com/uniswap-v3-expalined-concentrated-liquidity/](https://kushgoyal.com/uniswap-v3-expalined-concentrated-liquidity/)\n\n[https://chainbulletin.com/impermanent-loss-explained-with-examples-math/](https://chainbulletin.com/impermanent-loss-explained-with-examples-math/)\n\n[https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro/](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro/)\n\nLes outils utiles 🛠️ :\n\n[https://defiyield.info/advanced-impermanent-loss-calculator](https://defiyield.info/advanced-impermanent-loss-calculator)\n\n[https://revert.finance/](https://revert.finance/)\n\n[https://zapper.fi/fr](https://zapper.fi/fr)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPour conclure, devenir liquidity provider peut être très bénéfique et peut permettre de générer un revenu passif conséquent, cependant attention à bien vous renseigner sur les plateformes que vous utilisez,les mécanismes de LP, les tokens et leurs volatilités.\n\nIl n’y a pas de recette magique, pour des LP “classiques” 3–4 chiffres d’apy s’explique par :\n\n* Il n’y a personne sur la pool.\n* C’est une pair de shitcoin.\n* Il y a un liquidity mining très agressif.\n* Le protocole empile des stratégies de farming\n\n**La solution miracle n’a pas encore était trouvé en matière de liquidity providing, mais l’innovation dans ce secteur au combien important pour la DeFi est omniprésente et nul doute qu’un jour provide de la liquidité sera quelque chose d’optimisé pour le protocole et le provider.**\n\n**Faites bien vos devoirs avant d’investir, surtout quand cet investissement représente la majeure partie de votre capitale que vous souhaitez faire travailler.**", "timestamp": 1636706466, "digest": "cGnw1qbtokx3oRORUM68MfwzY9ulh-pm4E-0F8jaEV8", "contributor": "0x4e486E7eee27500b8851d63d003119c4DA4825f6"}

{"id": "TzdeFbEbDZNyZzqFe76GEDBG77M_Ab30IpjD3QhFZwc", "title": "📌 Intro al Web3: Inizia qui a scoprire la blockchain", "body": "Dopo aver pubblicato il mio primo articolo \"[Musica e Blockchain](https://mirror.xyz/0xc0d31C0d6074E090D6a9A833004F157C4F9f2A32/kb32F7UuQT0AtUMTiu6QfLIz2-AGMALy8aHwn5fImqM)\", ho ricevuto diversi feedback su quanto ho scritto. In particolare molte persone mi hanno fatto notare che gli argomenti da me trattati sono di difficile comprensione per chi è alle prime armi con ciò che concerne il web3.\n\nCosì ho deciso di scrivere questo **“compendio” per aiutare chiunque ad avere una introduzione al mondo blockchain**, fornendo conoscenze di base attraverso un glossario, fonti terze e consigli utili che ho ottenute dalla mia esperienza e da quanto ho studiato finora.\n\nInoltre vorrei che questo **articolo** fosse **dinamico**, riservandomi di aggiornarlo anche a distanza di mesi nel caso in cui qualcosa possa esser spiegato meglio o ci fossero novità importanti; così facendo il link resterà sempre lo stesso e potrete inviarlo ai vostri amici che iniziano ad avvicinarsi all'argomento 😇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vui7ogQlLAFk2jdCGKmBS.png?height=250&width=3000)\n\n## Glossario\n\nCome quando si impara una nuova lingua, credo che l'**acquisizione di nuovi vocaboli** aiuti ad avere una **migliore comprensione di un determinato argomento**, a elaborare frasi migliori e avere pensieri più strutturati. Per questo credo che il miglior modo per iniziare questo percorso, ed avere una comprensione generale della tecnologia blockchain, sia attraverso un glossario.\n\n*I termini finanziari sono quasi del tutto assenti perché vorrei che vi focalizzaste prima di tutto sulla tecnologia, sulle possibilità che essa offre e i problemi che può risolvere; credo che le implementazioni finanziare possono essere una conseguenza di una buona comprensione della materia.*\n\nNon assicuro che il glossario sia completo e impeccabile, ma comprende tutti termini più usati in ordine alfabetico, vi consiglio di leggerlo una volta per un'infarinatura generale e poi utilizzarlo quando vi imbattete in un termine di cui non ricordate il significato. Inoltre i termini in *corsivo* all'interno delle definizioni sono anch'essi presenti.\n\n* **airdrop:** distribuzione gratuita di *token* da parte dei fondatori di un progetto, normalmente avviene nelle fasi iniziali di quest'ultimo in modo da cedere il possesso di un *protocollo* e la creazione di una *DAO.* I calcoli della distribuzione sono variabili e determinati dalle attività fatte sulla piattaforma (es. semplice utilizzo, acquisti, codici referral ecc.), normalmente non vengono citati fino al momento dell'annuncio.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1458091239501348869?s=20](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1458091239501348869?s=20)\n\n* **altcoin:** qualsiasi cryptovaluta diversa da Bitcoin viene definita altcoin (che sta per “alternative coin”).\n* **blocco:** è un insieme di transazioni che vengono raggruppate secondo una grandezza massima (la block size) predeterminata per poi essere verificate da un nodo della *blockchain*.\n* **blockchain:** è la tecnologia che sta alla base del *web3*. Consiste in una rete decentralizzata, costruita da una catena continua e lineare di blocchi, una volta creato un *blocco* non si può più modificare. Tutte le transazioni sulla rete vengono memorizzate in un registro condiviso, a cui chiunque può avere accesso, il che significa che non è necessario un server centrale per autorizzare le transazioni e gli *smart contract* sulla rete, ma anche che le transazioni sono pubbliche e accessibili a chiunque.\n* **chiave privata**: è una serie alfanumerica usata nei sistemi di crittografia (asimmetrica) per decifrare un messaggio o per apporre la firma digitale. La chiave privata genera a sua volta la numerose *chiavi pubbliche*, ed è per questo che deve rimanere segreta.\n* **chiave pubblica**: è una serie alfanumerica usata nei sistemi di crittografia (asimmetrica) per cifrare un messaggio o per verificare l’autenticità di una firma digitale. Ogni indirizzo di una rete *blockchain* è associato ad una chiave pubblica, che è una specie di nome utente disponibile per tutti sul registro condiviso. Per esempio la chiave pubblica che sto utilizzando in questo momento è 0xc0d31C0d6074E090D6a9A833004F157C4F9f2A32.\n* **cryptovaluta**: valuta digitale, crittografata e basata sulla tecnologia *blockchain*. È una valuta progettata per essere decentralizzata (senza una banca centrale), con ogni *token* e transazione criptati in modo univoco. La tecnologia *blockchain* è l’infrastruttura che consente di archiviare le criptovalute sulla rete.\n* **DAO**: sigla di Decentralized Autonomous Organization, ovvero una organizzazione decentralizzata che opera seguendo delle regole di uno *smart contract*. Al suo interno il diritto di voto è rappresentato dal *token* e grazie a questo la community può decidere lo sviluppo del *protocollo*.\n* **exchange**: è una piattaforma/mercato digitale per la compravendita di *criptovalute*. Ne esistono di 2 tipi, gli exchange decentralizzati (*protocolli* presenti sulla *blockchain* che permettono lo scambio senza un ente centrale) e gli exchange centralizzati (più tradizionali che hanno un'azienda che detiene il capitale).\n* **fee**: conosciuta anche come gas fee, è la commissione sulle operazioni fatte sulla *blockchain*, sono il premio dato ai *miner* per il lavoro fatto, variano in base a quanto la rete è congestionata e quanto l'operazione richiede lavoro (per esempio il trasferimento di una crypto richiede meno lavoro rispetto all'utilizzo di uno *smart contract* per il *minting* di un *NFT*).\n* **FIAT**: è una valuta emessa e supportata da un ente governativo e che ha corso legale. Euro e Dollari sono esempi di valute FIAT, non è considerabile un elemento delle *blockchain* ma è un termine ricorrente.\n* **fork**: è un aggiornamento/modifica del *protocollo* concordato collettivamente dalla community parte di esso. Esistono due tipi di fork, il soft fork (considerabile come un semplice upgrade che supporta le versioni precedenti della rete) e l'hard fork (non supporta le versioni precedenti della rete).\n* **halving**: dimezzamento del premio dato ai *miner*. Il *protocollo* informatico di Bitcoin prevede un halving ogni 4 anni.\n* **hash**: è il risultato di una funzione hash, ovvero un'operazione crittografata che genera una serie alfanumerica irripetibile che identifica una transazione sulla *blockchain*. Per aiutare la comprensione di questo concetto utilizzo un esempio pratico, la transaction hash [0xbed1123aa714d41b4583f129220e6d3929ca12d9d647f2922bf889625c5853e0](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbed1123aa714d41b4583f129220e6d3929ca12d9d647f2922bf889625c5853e0) fa riferimento ad una transazione su *blockchain* Ethereum che ho fatto dal mio indirizzo all'indirizzo della mia etichetta discografica.\n* **ledger**: letteralmente “libro mastro”, è un registro digitale di tutte le transazioni\n  avvenute su una determinata rete *blockchain*. Le copie del ledger vengono memorizzate nella rete e sono costantemente aggiornate per corrispondere l’una con l’altra, in modo che le transazioni possano essere verificate da chiunque sulla rete (da non confondere con il nome proprio Ledger degli hardware wallet).\n* **market cap**: è la capitalizzazione di mercato di una *cryptovaluta* ottenuta moltiplicando la moneta circolante per il suo valore di mercato.\n* **miner**: persona che pratica il mining, ovvero utilizzare la potenza di calcolo di un computer per confermare le transazioni sulla *blockchain* risolvendo un'equazione. Questo lavoro viene ricompensato dalla rete stessa con delle *fee* pagate da chi vuole fare la transazione nella *cryptovaluta* della blockchain utilizzata.\n* **minting**: l'atto di \"coniare\" un *token* o un *NFT* utilizzando uno *smart contract.*\n* **NFT**: sigla di Non-Fungible Token, è un tipo speciale di *token* che rappresenta qualcosa di unico, vengono utilizzati per creare scarsità digitale verificabile e comunemente fungono da strumento per dimostrare il possesso di oggetti digitali unici come la crypto arte, collezionabili digitali o nei giochi online.\n* **nodo**: un computer collegato alla rete che conserva e distribuisce una copia del *ledger* (registro) di una determinata *blockchain*.\n* **proof-of-stake**: tipo di *protocollo* per la messa in sicurezza di una rete *blockchain*, e per il conseguimento di un consenso distribuito, tutte le blockchain più moderne lo utilizzano, con questo protocollo un *miner* deve essere in possesso di un certo ammontare di *cryptovalute* per poter avviare un *nodo*. Essendo necessaria una grossa quantità di cryptovalute per avviare un nodo, queste possono essere ricevute in delega da chi le possiede in cambio di una percentuale delle *fee*, più ne vengono delegate/possedute più alto sarà il ricavo (Cardano, Elrond e in futuro Ethereum con l'hard *fork* Ethereum 2.0 sono blockchain che usano questo protocollo).\n* **proof-of-work**: tipo di *protocollo* per la messa in sicurezza di una rete *blockchain*, per diventare *miner* è necessaria solo la potenza di calcolo per eseguire le operazioni, maggiore è la potenza di calcolo maggiore è il premio ottenuto, è il primo tipo di protocollo utilizzato dalle blockchain e quello tecnologicamente più arretrato e che consuma più energia (Bitcoin e Ethereum sono blockchain che usano questo protocollo).\n* **protocollo**: è un modello di interazioni basate sulla tecnologia del database condiviso (i dati non sono conservati in un server centrale ma sono distribuiti sulla rete e conservati dai *nodi*), spiegato semplice è l'insieme di elementi che permettono di comunicare con la *blockchain*, inviando e ricevendo i dati.\n* **smart contract**: protocolli informatici che facilitano, verificano, o fanno rispettare, la negoziazione o l'esecuzione di un contratto. Quando vengono soddisfatti i termini di uno smart contract, questo viene eseguito automaticamente dal *miner* ricompensato con delle *fee*, maggiore è la potenza necessaria per l'operazione maggiore è la fee. Per esempio le fee di uno scambio di *cryptovalute* su un *exchange* decentralizzato sono inferiori rispetto al *minting* di un *NFT.*\n* **token**: è un titolo che rappresenta un diritto, di norma, delle royalties; utilizzato dai *protocolli* sulle *blockchain* per distribuirne il possesso. Va fatta una distinzione, i token fanno riferimento ai protocolli sviluppati su una blockchain, quindi è scorretto chiamarli cryptovalute. Per esempio $AUDIO è il token del protocollo Audius che sfrutta la blockchain Ethereum per distribuirne il possesso, $ETH quindi è una cryptovaluta.\n* **wallet**: strumento per memorizzare le *chiavi private*, tenerle al sicuro e interagire con la blockchain. Ne esistono diversi tipi, i più diffusi sono gli hardware wallet (i più sicuri) e i software wallet (Coinbase Wallet, Metamask ecc.).\n* **web3**: è il nome che rappresenta tutto l’ecosistema della *blockchain* assieme al movimento culturale della decentralizzazione dell’internet e del suo possesso distribuito.\n\n[https://twitter.com/TheCryptoCPA/status/1457014965940916234?s=20](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoCPA/status/1457014965940916234?s=20)\n\n* **whitepaper**: è un documento informativo relativo ad un progetto sviluppato su *blockchain*. È il manifesto che indica gli obiettivi, la tecnologia ed i problemi che intende risolvere il progetto legato al *protocollo* che verrà creato.\n\n## Consigli\n\n**Armatevi di curiosità e voglia di imparare.** Questo è in assoluto il primo consiglio che posso darvi per comprendere il web3. Siamo ancora agli inizi di una rivoluzione tecnologica e di conseguenza nulla è certo o ben definito, potrebbe essere che qualcosa che oggi ha valore o rilevanza domani sarà già obsoleto. Però attorno a questa tecnologia si stanno creando community e nuove culture, non fermatevi solamente al lato economico, quella è solo la punta dell’iceberg.\n\nPrima di iniziare però a utilizzare il vostro primo wallet **vi consiglio vivamente di informarvi sulle questioni di sicurezza**. Non essendoci un ente centrale che regola la blockchain detenete tutte le responsabilità nelle vostre mani, \"*da grandi poteri derivano grandi responsabilità\"*, ciò significa che se dovessero rubarvi le chiavi private perdereste tutto quello che avete nel portafoglio, in particolare utilizzate un pezzo di carta per scrivere il seed per generare la chiave privata e nascondetelo in un luogo sicuro di casa.\n\nIl **miglior strumento per mantenere le proprie chiavi private al sicuro sono gli hardware wallet** (io consiglio il Ledger) ma costando circa 60 euro per qualcuno potrebbe non essere il wallet migliore per iniziare. Quindi quello che consiglio è **scaricare l'estensione metamask sul vostro browser** (Chrome o Firefox, non è presente per Safari) e utilizzarla per interfacciarvi per la prima volta con i protocolli della blockchain Ethereum, in modo da capire il loro meccanismo. Attenzione però, la chiave privata (con tutte quelle pubbliche generate da essa) che utilizzerete non sarà trasferibile a wallet differenti da metamask, quindi consideratela come una prova.\n\nIniziate da questi siti e poi esplorate liberamente:\n\n[mirror.xyz](http://mirror.xyz): fate l'accesso e scrivete qualche riga sul vostro blog per festeggiare i vostri primi passi sul web3, è gratis e potrebbe essere divertente tornare a leggere le vostre sensazioni a distanza di tempo. Pubblicatelo senza far capire chi siete (se volete), quel testo rimarrà per sempre all'interno della blockchain associato ad un indirizzo pubblico.\n\n[opensea.io](http://opensea.io): è il marketplace per la compravendita di NFT più grande al momento, curiosate e cercate di capire come funziona l'acquisto di beni digitali. Ovviamente sconsiglio di acquistare perché i costi attualmente sono fuori portata per una persona alle prime armi.\n\n[tryshowtime.com](http://tryshowtime.com): questo protocollo vi farà capire meglio il funzionamento del web condiviso, è sempre incentrato sugli NFT ma serve a scoprirne di nuovi ogni volta che qualcuno ne minta uno e permette di interagirci mettendo like e commentando. La cosa importante da comprendere è che tutto quello che vedete non è stato caricato direttamente sul sito ma sul database condiviso della blockchain e in automatico associato all'indirizzo pubblico dell'artista.\n\nQuesto 3 protocolli sono abbastanza per iniziare, ma vi serviranno come svezzamento senza la necessità di comprare ETH per l'utilizzo della blockchain. Però ricordatevi di salvare il seed delle le chiavi private anche se prenderete un hardware wallet, potrebbe essere che in futuro siate eleggibili per un airdrop di token per averci interagito.\n\n## Risorse\n\nNell'ultima parte di questo articolo vi voglio consigliare delle risorse che, secondo me, **saranno utili a comprendere il web3 e darvi vari punti di vista sulla materia**, compresi di note e motivazioni se necessario. Avendo difficoltà a trovare materiale in italiano in linea con la mia visione ci saranno anche risorse in inglese.\n\n*Questa è la sezione che molto probabilmente subirà maggiori aggiornamenti e aggiunte nel caso trovassi qualcosa che credo possa tornarvi utile. Prendetevi anche qui il vostro tempo per assimilare i concetti e utilizzate il glossario per aiutarvi nella fruizione di queste risorse.*\n\n### Italiano\n\n* [La Blockchain funziona perché non funzionano gli esseri umani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S8k5cpFrCY) uno speech di Gian Luca Comandini al TEDxFrascati che attraverso un ottimo storytelling fa capire come mai la tecnologia blockchain è una tecnologia necessaria per il nostro futuro.\n* [HiFi & DeFi](https://hifiedefi.substack.com/) è una newsletter dedicata alla musica in ambito web3 che analizza le ultime notizie con cadenza settimanale.\n* [Tiziano Tridico](https://www.youtube.com/c/TizianoTridico) ha uno dei migliori canali YouTube su tutti gli ultimi aggiornamenti in materia cryptovalute, analizzando settimanalmente l'andamento del mercato con i suoi \"Crypto Monday\". Apprezzo il suo modo di divulgare l'argomento perché non crea mai hype e cerca di essere il più analitico possibile, con un occhio importante al lato tecnologico. Per la mia visione del web3 è troppo Bitcoin-centrico, ma i suoi contenuti sono sempre al top.\n\n### Inglese\n\n* [askmirror.xyz](https://askmirror.xyz/) è il sito per ricercare articoli su Mirror, il protocollo che sto utilizzando attualmente per scrivere questo blog, ogni giorno potete trovare nuovi contenuti o progetti che raccontano i loro processi di sviluppo, qui potete trovare un sacco di materiale utile se conoscete l'inglese.\n* [Coopahtroopa](https://alias.co/coopahtroopa/essays) (Cooper Turley) è un ragazzo a capo di innumerevoli progetti del web3, ha un esperienza di 5 anni nel settore e scrive articoli che possono ispirarvi positivamente.\n* [Bankless](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com) è una newsletter sulle ultime notizie del mondo crypto, ottima per arrivare prima di altri su molti trend.\n\n## Conclusioni\n\nSe siete arrivati fino a questo punto vuol dire che siete tra le primissime persone che si stanno approcciando a questo ambito in Italia e dovreste essere fieri di voi stessi. Il vostro percorso per comprendere a pieno il web3 è solo iniziato, ma le potenzialità che vi offrirà sono quasi illimitate.\n\n[https://twitter.com/crypto_fruit/status/1458354467452198916?s=20](https://twitter.com/crypto_fruit/status/1458354467452198916?s=20)\n\nSpero che l’articolo vi sia piaciuto, se per caso qualcuno di voi volesse mettersi in contatto con me può inviarmi un DM su Discord @Degra#9599 oppure seguirmi su Twitter @[itsdegra_](https://twitter.com/itsdegra_).\n\nInoltre se conoscete fonti migliori o non presenti tra quelle che ho fornito fatemelo sapere, le leggerò volentieri per poi aggiungerle alle risorse e rendere il compendio più completo.\n\nScritto con passione,\n\n* Degra ❤️‍🔥", "timestamp": 1636706590, "digest": "qfQB4ofqjxpevJrweHBVV9xYH_0GbN9Uv6whbO1LHd8", "contributor": "0xc0d31C0d6074E090D6a9A833004F157C4F9f2A32"}
{"id": "xWF1m12zIOmRdC2t55UwruGIb023j9bdmzXoD-mJy8Q", "title": "遨游元宇宙的必备工具(1)", "body": "李老师前几天发文说了他对元宇宙的看法，简单说元宇宙就是网络平行空间，我们每个人都身在其中。\n\n楚门每天过着一样的生活，如果不是他死去的父亲重新出现，可能他也不会对周围的一切产生怀疑。\n\n黑客帝国中，matrix营造了一个非常真实的平行空间，每个人身在其中乐此不疲而不自知。\n\n多年前的某一天，我浑身一个激灵，发现自己也在这个空间里。\n\n**发现更大的世界，首先需要的是自我意识的苏醒，另外就是需要得心应手的工具和得当的方法。**\n\n前几天介绍过[igg的用法](https://mirror.xyz/0x6E18e69AD6a71Be81b3a00303b1021a7E0021a3A/FwIUd9f_xXBt_hoOqH7ZUqYaKCNYJEXda__Xy1R2St8)，梯子是精神逃离matrix的第一条通道。同时也介绍了[加密钱包metamask的用法](https://mirror.xyz/0x6E18e69AD6a71Be81b3a00303b1021a7E0021a3A/FiJxu2FOj70HUYgkgNf-hn8w_LVE7DE7RNJaQodSTQk)，加密钱包是生存在元宇宙的最基础工具，衣食住行全靠它。\n\n本文将对其他自认为重要的元宇宙生存必备工具进行介绍：\n\n## 1、chrome浏览器\n\nigg梯子和Metamask加密钱包两篇教程，都使用到了chrome作为基础平台。chrome是一个非常好用且必要的浏览器，拥有大量的好用插件，比如梯子、自动翻译、加密钱包、自动格式转换、安全工具等等。\n\nchrome安装资源：\n\n* windows系统建议直接使用360软件助手安装\n* mac intel安装包：<https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/DTLD2zYQruH_CRiyg5sE>\n* mac m1安装包：<https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/DUjO6kIQruH_CRi5g5sE>\n\n安装chrome后，首先可以安装[igg的梯子](https://mirror.xyz/0x6E18e69AD6a71Be81b3a00303b1021a7E0021a3A/FwIUd9f_xXBt_hoOqH7ZUqYaKCNYJEXda__Xy1R2St8)，这样方便安装其他必备扩展插件。同时建议打开自动更新，保持浏览器最新版本，及时修复一些安全漏洞。\n\n## 2、翻译工具\n\n[DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator)是一个非常专业且好用的翻译工具，机翻已经达到非常准确的程度，不足之处就是目前还无法做到页面的自动翻译，需要复制到deepl工具中翻译内容。\n\n[Google 翻译](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb?hl=zh-CN)，访问chrome应用商店，搜索谷歌翻译并安装插件。\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcd7j58klj30tg06qdga.jpg)\n\n安装好谷歌翻译后，访问英文页面，浏览器右上角会出现一个翻译图标，点击中文后，页面会自动翻译成中文，对于英文不好的小伙伴非常有帮助。\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcdavcfwej307o03rt8l.jpg)\n\n## 3、油猴自动化工具\n\nTampermonkey（油猴）是一个非常好用的自动化脚本插件，我个人最常用的是使用它进行页面的自动翻译，支持对twitter、telegram、discord等常用社交网站的对话自动翻译。\n\n访问谷歌应用商店，搜索[Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=zh-CN)并进行安装。\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcdemz0qxj30si06kq3d.jpg)\n\n[greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN)上有很多自动化脚本，可自行搜索需要的脚本安装。这里推荐1个常用的对社交网站进行自动翻译脚本，访问greasyfork，搜索“翻译机”：\n[https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/378277-翻译机](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/378277-%E7%BF%BB%E8%AF%91%E6%9C%BA)\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcdoq2rmij30ee08mq3o.jpg)\n\n点击安装此脚本，在出现的页面中，点击“安装”\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcdpyfigmj30fz07ljrl.jpg)\n\n安装完成后，点击浏览器右上角油猴图标，选择“添加新脚本”：\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcdr4uormj308r04c749.jpg)\n\n在出现页面中，右上角选择“已安装脚本”，即可看到安装成功的翻译机：\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcdsrgnwij319z054aai.jpg)\n\n之后访问twitter、discord等网站，系统会弹出如下图所示页面，选择**总是允许**即可，油猴就会自动翻译对应的英文内容：\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcf4p9jbhj30jy0dyq3y.jpg)\n\n翻译效果如下图：\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcf5hnl29j30ga04caa7.jpg)\n\n**可点击被翻译页面右上角的“译”字进行翻译设置，可将“不翻译中文”勾选上，这样脚本就不会把页面中的中文再翻译一遍，减少不必要信息。**\n\n## 4、Gmail邮箱\n\nGmail是很多网站的登录选项之一，很多内容国内邮箱会限制，所以注册一个gmail是非常有必要的，注册地址：<https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2>\n\n按要求填写注册信息后，第二步会要求验证手机，正常填写国内手机号即可：\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcehumflbj30b909b3yt.jpg)\n\n第三步填写辅助邮箱，主要用户密码丢失等紧急情况的找回，建议设置一个自己的常用邮箱地址：\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcej364jij30al0amaac.jpg)\n\n第四步充分利用电话可跳过，第五步同意即可。\n\n**Gmail有很多高级用法，比如1个邮箱顶100个用法，限于篇幅，这部分准备放在之后的高级进阶教程中再讲。**\n\n## 5、Twitter社交账号\n\n基本全世界最聪明的大脑都在这里发布内容，是优质信息获取源。访问https://twitter.com，选择使用google账号注册：\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcdzpx96nj30b608r74n.jpg)\n\n这里如果是国内手机号，一般情况下是收不到验证码的，可以多试几次。或者可以办理一个google voice用于注册国外网站。\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcesexbqdj30fk089aah.jpg)\n\n其实多试几次使用google账号登录，有时不需要验证手机号也会通过注册，个人可以多尝试。\n\n混进去的账号没有密码，可以在页面中选择 more -> settings and privace -> your account -> account information，进行密码的修改（通过给gmail发邮件），同时进行电话的绑定和7天后的身份认证，像下图这样：\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcfmhv2d5j30gc079q2z.jpg)\n\n**另外也有一些国外手机号的使用方法，会放在高级进阶教程中详细讲解。**\n\n注册了推特不知道关注谁，可以先关注我：<https://twitter.com/nigdaemon> ，点击我名字下方的“xx人正在关注”，可以查看我关注了哪些人，通过这个方式丰富自己的关注列表。\n\n## 6、Discord 加密社区账号\n\nDiscord流传着很多财富故事，这些可以个人多多探索。目前很多加密项目、社群、DAO都活跃在Discord，很多一手信息也源于此。比微信更开放，这里主要讲下基本用法。\n\n注册地址：<https://discord.com/register> ，填写邮箱、账号名、密码和生日后，即可成功注册。\n\n第一个页面询问是否加入hub，直接选择“不，谢谢”\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcfu86c5xj30jp0gmab7.jpg)\n\n之后会询问创建自己的Discord服务器，还是加入已有的，如下图：\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcfv57vuij30in0csq44.jpg)\n\n选择“已经有了邀请，加入服务器”，在新出现页面，粘贴如下邀请链接：<https://discord.gg/bUeyYrBT8c> ，选择加入\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcfxbmrnvj30ip0clt9q.jpg)\n\n进入服务器后，在左侧会看到一些频道，有的可以发言，有的不能发言。详细功能还要靠个人慢慢摸索，**部分频道是持有特定token才可访问，这也是Defi研习社后期计划推出的付费教程所使用的频道，目前未持有相关token或NFT无法查看到。**\n\n![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gwcg0ah1jej30hw08j3yw.jpg)\n\n如果之前安装了油猴翻译机，首次打开discord时，会弹出授权页面，选择**总是允许**即可，这样discord中的英文便会被自动翻译。\n\n# 写在最后\n\n以上介绍了chrome浏览器、翻译工具、油猴脚本工具、Gmail、Twitter、Discord的注册，个人认为这些都是遨游元宇宙世界的必备工具，新手用户可以安装注册后慢慢摸索，相信会有很多惊喜等待在前方。\n\n元宇宙就是一个个的虚拟泡泡，每个人都活在不同的泡泡里，如果哪天开窍了，主动把泡泡吹破，去到别的泡泡里畅游一番，是很有意思的事。\n\n希望每一个小伙伴，都能找到自己在元宇宙中的生存空间。**李老师说未来在元宇宙中最牛的是个人魅力，增加个人魅力的方法就是不断输出价值！**\n\n行动起来吧！\n\n\n---\n\n**元宇宙第三故乡落脚点**：<https://discord.gg/bUeyYrBT8c>",

{"id": "lILCLZu9WCIMppXw453jA05SM1pQS_M1KLq5vxGDH7o", "title": "Mina--发送交易", "body": "# 通过 Mina 发送交易\n\n在本节中，我们将简要介绍如何用 Mina 客户端发送交易，以及如何开始与区块链进行互动。\n\n# 使用离线签名交易\n\n如果你想在不自己运行节点的情况下发送交易，而是委托别人运行节点，请继续关注这里。如果你想直接用运行中的节点发送事务，请跳到[使用连接的节点](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en/using-mina/send-payment#using-a-connected-node)。\n\n### 使用 Ledger\n\n如果你的私钥在 Ledger 设备上，要想在离线状态下生成签名交易，请看 Ledger 离线模式。\n\n### 使用用生成密钥对工具生成的密钥对\n\n一个更好的工具即将到来：<https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/issues/8928>。现在，请使用在该问题的评论中提供的[解决方法](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/issues/8928#issuecomment-857095846)。\n\n### 使用用离线客户端 SDK 生成的密钥对\n\n要使用客户端 SDK 生成一个签名的交易，按照[客户端 SDK README](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/tree/develop/frontend/client_sdk)页面上的显示，记录创建的签名付款。\n\n### 发送交易\n\n你可以使用一个托管服务来广播你的签名交易。发送你的签名交易并不会泄露你的私钥。\n\n用客户端 SDK 签名的交易： <https://minaexplorer.com/broadcast-tx>\n\n使用 Ledger 签署的交易： <https://minaexplorer.com/broadcast-ledger>\n\n### 使用一个连接的节点\n\n在剩下的部分，我们假设你的系统已经安装了 Mina 客户端，如果你没有安装 Mina，请看[入门指南](https://mirror.xyz/0x3445a4f377Ff5Be3D22F990490236BA20fbFDF71/mPD_a03YQpl6LbpNYTolvkvTdfgjHSrW-I0bwU7Gyqs)。\n\n### 导入账户\n\n一旦我们的节点同步，我们将需要导入我们的公钥/私钥对，以便我们可以签署交易并生成一个地址来接收付款。为了安全起见，我们要把钥匙放在一个攻击者更难访问的目录下。\n\n运行下面的命令来导入你以前生成的密钥对文件：\n\n```\nmina accounts import --privkey-path ~/keys/my-wallet\n```\n\n你会被提示输入创建账户时的密码。\n\n> 警告：公钥可以与任何人自由分享，但对你的私钥文件要非常小心。千万不要与任何人分享这个私钥，因为它相当于你资金的密码。\n\n这个命令的响应将看起来像这样：\n\n```\n😄 Imported account!\nPublic key: B62qjaA4N9843FKM5FZk1HmeuDiojG42cbCDyZeUDQVjycULte9PFkC\n```\n\n此外，你可以使用 `mina accounts create` 命令来生成新的账户来发送和接收交易。\n\n由于公钥相当长，难以记忆，让我们把它保存为环境变量。使用下面的命令，但将 `<YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY>` 替换为前面命令输出的公钥。\n\n```\nexport MINA_PUBLIC_KEY=<YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY>\n```\n\n现在我们可以以 `$MINA_PUBLIC_KEY` 的身份到处访问它 -- 通过尝试 `echo $MINA_PUBLIC_KEY` 来检查它是否正确保存。\n\n注意，这些环境变量只为当前的shell会话保存，所以如果你想保存它们以便将来使用，你可以把它们添加到 `~/.profile` 或 `~/.bash_profile`。\n\n> 注意： 如果你在云虚拟机上运行节点，确保导出并保存密钥文件。你可以用以下方法导出密钥：\n>\n> ```\n> mina accounts export --public-key <PUBLIC-KEY> --privkey-path <EXPORT-PATH>\n> ```\n>\n> 然后保存在本地，可以使用 [scp](https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp):\n>\n> ```\n> scp <EXPORT-PATH> <LOCAL-DESTINATION>\n> ```\n>\n> 之后，当启动一个新的虚拟机时，你可以上船私钥和引用：\n>\n> ```\n> mina accounts import --privkey-path <PRIVATE-KEY-FILE>\n> ```\n\n如果你忘记了你已经创建了哪些密钥对，你可以通过以下方式看到它们：\n\n```\nmina accounts list\n```\n\n### Check account balance\n\n我们可以用这个命令检查我们所有账户的余额：\n\n```\nmina accounts list\n```\n\n你可能会看到余额`Balance: 0 mina` ，根据网络中的流量，可能需要几个区块才能通过你的交易。\n\n### 支付\n\n最后，我们进入正题--发送我们的第一笔交易! 在你发送付款之前，你需要解锁你的账户：\n\n```\nmina accounts unlock --public-key $MINA_PUBLIC_KEY\n```\n\n为了测试的目的，我们将指定你的公钥作为接收方和发送方。这只是意味着我们在向自己发送一个交易，你可以通过发出以下命令看到你的公钥。\n\n```\necho $MINA_PUBLIC_KEY\n```\n\n> 警告：如果接收账户没有收到任何交易，将有一个额外的账户创建费 1 MINA，将从交易金额中扣除。\n\n让我们把一些 MINA 寄给自己，看看付款是什么样子。\n\n```\nmina client send-payment \\\n  --amount 1.5 \\\n  --receiver $MINA_PUBLIC_KEY \\\n  --fee 0.1 \\\n  --sender $MINA_PUBLIC_KEY\n```\n\n如果你想知道我们在上面的命令中传递了什么。\n\n*  `amount`是将发送一个1.5米纳的测试值，这足以支付账户创建费。\n*  `receiver` 是接收交易的账户的公钥，如 `B62qjaA4N9843FKM5FZk...`\n*  `fee`，用 0.1 MINA 吧\n* `sender` 是发送交易的地址，如 `B62qjaA4N9843FKM5FZk...`\n\n如果这个命令的格式正确，我们应该得到一个看起来像下面的响应。\n\n```\nDispatched payment with ID 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\nReceipt chain hash is now A3gpLyBJGvcpMXny2DsHjvE5GaNFn2bbpLLQqTCHuY3Nd7sqy8vDbM6qHTwHt8tcfqqBkd36LuV4CC6hVH6YsmRqRp4Lzx77WnN9gnRX7ceeXdCQUVB7B2uMo3oCYxfdpU5Q2f2KzJQ46\n```\n\n在账户的第一笔交易中，你可能看不到 `Receipt chain hash`，但在随后的交易中，这将向你显示收据链哈希值列表的头部。\n\n### 质押和 Snarking\n\n一旦你对创建地址、发送和接收米娜的基础知识感到满意，我们就可以进入 Mina 网络真正独特的部分，如[参与共识和帮助压缩区块链](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en/using-mina/staking)。\n\n## 高级\n\n### 批量发送交易\n\n有时你可能希望发送许多交易：例如，如果你正在运行一个赌注池，则向委托你的人支付奖励。\n\n这里的所有信息都与1.2.0版本有关（目前处于测试阶段）：\n\n### 速率限制\n\n目前，网络上的节点会限制从一个给定的节点接收信息的速率。从1.2.0版本开始，你的节点在发送交易时也将遵循这一速率限制。具体来说，目前的限制是每15秒10个交易，在5分钟的窗口内计算。如果你试图以超过这个速度发送交易，你的节点将排队，并在计算速率限制的窗口中的旧交易过期时刷新它们。你不需要自己控制这些交易的发送。\n\n注意，旧版本的mina守护进程不执行这种速率限制；如果你运行的是旧版本，你应该手动限制交易的数量。由于重新广播交易的开销，如果你需要手动限制速率，我们不建议每5分钟发送超过50个交易。\n\n### 我的节点在我完成发送交易之前就崩溃了或断开了连接\n\nMina守护进程目前没有持久化交易池。这意味着，如果你的节点在这个过程中崩溃了，你的节点将不知道你迄今为止发送的任何交易。从1.2.0版本开始，你可以重新发送所有的交易（和以前的方式完全一样），它们将在网络上被重新广播。\n\n如果你认为你暂时与网络断开了连接，但你的节点仍然在线（即八卦网络可能错过了你的一个或多个交易），从1.2.0版本开始，你可以在本地重新发送任何交易，即使你的节点认为它们已经被共享，它们也会被重新广播到网络上。\n\n### 取消一项交易并设置新的费用\n\n要取消一个交易，你需要在你的本地交易 mempool 中拥有所有之前还没有提交到链上的交易。这意味着如果你的节点崩溃了（见上文），你将需要重新发送那些早期的交易。最后，要取消一个交易，你所需要做的就是发送一个与你想取消的交易相同的 nonce，并收取更大的费用。没有最小增量，只是需要稍微大一点（并且大到足以让区块生产者选择你的交易）。\n\n原文：\n\n[https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en/using-mina/send-payment](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en/using-mina/send-payment)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636706998, "digest": "dLzULKwddRZxDdb_GaDfmCsxefPsh0s-XyD0sgaXcS4", "contributor": "0x3445a4f377Ff5Be3D22F990490236BA20fbFDF71"}

{"id": "_RyHVlRRPEs5RzIRk7MqmaMV-rKxF3lEv0lbt4bFHtg", "title": "Top 3 Mistakes I Learned From That I Hope May Benefit You Too ", "body": "Let's cut to the chase. Crypto in essence is the wild wild west of investing. Whether it's the rug pulls, scams, or volatility, we all have to be cautious before what gives us gains also makes us humble. Let's get to it then:\n\n(1) STORING SAFELY: Early on, I setup a mining rig, which was working on BTC and Eth. I sold most to pay bills but held some for the long term. I thought I was super secure given I had done research and stored most of my holdings on an offline wallet which was partitioned from the internet to avoid any cyberattacks. Long story short, I came back from work one day to find my entire apartment flooded 2 inches deep due to a building leak. That shit fried my PC and any attempt I made to recover the assets failed miserably. (I still have the waterlogged hard drive in hopes I'll plug it in one day and taadaa.) - What I learned : buy hardware wallet, don't always keep it attached to your PC, put it in a fireproof safe when out of use, and lock that shit up 3 feet off the ground (in a closet or elsewhere.)\n\n(2) PRIORITIES: Like most, when I first began investing I was frothing at the mouth at potential shortterm upsides of 10x, 50x, or 100x. We've heard those stories. However, with such upside there is always a catch. Perhaps the catch is volatility, it's criminal intent, etc. I've felt and I've seen new folk walk in here with the number 1 priority of, \"Make money and make it quick.\" Not to say that financial growth isn't highly valued but it IS only 2nd in importance in my humble opinion. - \"My number one priority of investing is to preserve weath.\" After that priority is fulfilled, grow that shit. Therefore, don't make risky assets 80% of your portfolio, don't jump on every rocket to the moon thinking you're not going to crash, and don't follow hype, precede it. Do your research, invest in good projects, think long, stake, and then, go ahead, play with 5-10% of your portfolio in memeworld.\n\n(3) THE BIG \"WHAT IF\": 2 years back, I had 60% of my family's investments in crypto. I played it conservative and sat back and watched it grow. Biking, on the way to work one day, I was cut off by a car turning across the bike lane while I was speeding down a hill. My brakes did SweetFA and I smashed into the car going \\~35mph. I apparently headbutt the rear passenger window because I was told I had to be pulled out of the car. I woke up in the hospital about an hour later. I thought of my wife and kids and the \"what if it was worse\" laid there in the front of my mind. Aside from insurance, a majority of my family's investments would rot in my hardware wallet without any chance of my family getting to it. - That's why I thought about how I could set up my non-techsavy wife to access my crypto should the issue ever arise. I built a detailed video, password protected by something only she would know, detailing how to retrieve, monitor, and withdraw the assets if needed. I put it in a safety deposit box under her name. Make sure you do this if you hold a large value and you have someone close you can really trust. No need to let them know the value of the holdings, just that it's important they work on opening it if you are not there to do so. As for the video, make it lighthearted, is my recommendation. After losing you, watching a video of you won't be too easy.\n\nAnyways, these are three big things I've learned, on top of many more.

整个出圈的事情。\n\n在开始之前，我想先请知县聊聊自己作为连续创业者的背景经历。你们的团队都做过哪些事情？你是怎么进入到区块链创业圈的？\n\n**知县：** 大家好，我是知县，非常感谢 Mable Jiang 的邀请，很高兴跟大家聊聊我的经历。我跟我的 CTO 是差不多快 10 年的合伙人关系，我还没毕业的时候就跑出来创业，开始做游戏的聚合支付，不知道有没有同行。\n\n当年你们可能听说过「聚合渠道」，我们是做支付跟联运，甚至后面做到了发行游戏的事情，所以算是半个游戏圈的人。后面，我们又把另外一只脚踏进了移动流量行业，做一些流量采买，比如说做海外流量投放，然后在国内也会去挖掘一些社交流量。\n\n当年微信管得没有那么严的时候，我们一个单页可以做到 1000 万的 PV，我们以前还推过一些比较著名的 App，能够做到他们全国推广前三的这么一个水平，这是我们 2017 年之前做的事情。\n\n在 2017 年之后，这个行业在某种程度上可以说是没了，不管是政策原因，还是从行业的局势，更趋向于「玩赢家通吃」，游戏的开发商越来越集中，然后游戏的渠道也越来越少，连「豌豆荚」这样的大渠道最后也草草收场，所以我们这种团队也就基本上算是被行业挤出去了。\n\n再然后，我们就来找下一个我们认为能够做出一些事情的赛道。这么多年的创业经历，我们总结了一个教训：**一定要能够拿到自己的用户。** 之前我们就是因为没有自己的用户，都是别人的用户，只是中间过一道手，所以才会有被行业挤出的这种惨痛经历。\n\n这次，我们要选一个一定能够站得住脚的赛道，能拿到自己的用户，所以我们就进了这个圈子，因为**这个圈子一是相对早期，另外就是有门槛，有一定的技术深度。** 区块链这个行业美好的愿景是新一代的 Web，那么对于我们这样的小团队来说，能够抓住一个赛道刚开始起飞的机会是非常不容易的，于是我们就决定沉下心来，在行业里进行扎根，争取能够在风来之前，先占住地方，先蹲好了，然后能够获取很多的用户红利，这是大概我们的经历。\n\n**主持人：** 您是哪一年进来的？\n\n**知县：** 2017 年底，我们也是被热潮给吸引过来的。\n\n**主持人：** 其实那也挺好的，因为至少经历过一轮完整的熊市了。\n\n**知县：** 对，你描述得非常准确，一进来就被「教育」了。\n\n**主持人：** 确实是这样的，你看现在很活跃的这批人，我指的不一定是创业者，也有投资人，其实有不少都是 2017 年那会儿进来的，有些在 2017 年「94」之前，有些是在「加密猫」之后，差不多都是那个时候。完整的熊市经历能够让你对整个区块链的产品形态会有更深的思考，还有你怎么样去 bridge 这个 crypto 产品和传统用户的经历。\n\n# **2、「雷兔」的由来**\n\n**主持人：** 首先，我想问的第一个问题是为什么叫「雷兔」？「雷兔」听起来像二层 Layer 2。\n\n**知县：** 这其实很有意思，2018 年我们就在做以太坊 Layer 2，算是比较早吃螃蟹的人，当然我们没有撑住。\n\n我个人其实特别喜欢 Layer 2 的概念，因为最早我们做「闪电网络」，那算是 BTC 的 Layer 2，因为我觉得\\*\\*只有做 Layer 2 才能够真正走向大规模的用户。\\*\\*Layer 1 是一个「信任机器」，它在长远看来不太可能会特别高效，Layer 2 肯定是一个更好的解决方法，所以即便之前的尝试因为各种各样的原因失败了，但是我觉得依然要往这个方向去做新的尝试。\n\n所以，Layer 2 在我看来就等同于出圈，但我们又不想叫 Layer 2，就像你不能管一个搜索引擎叫搜索引擎，你要叫百度或者叫 Google，所以我们就改了一下，用了个谐音梗—— Lay2 雷兔。\n\n# **3、从 Portal Wallet 到 UniPass**\n\n**主持人：** 你说的做二层之后的产品是 Portal Wallet 吗？\n\n**知县：** 应该是 UniPass，一会儿我可以再讲讲为什么做 Portal Wallet。\n\n**主持人：** 要不你分享一下创业的时间线，然后你每一个产品都是受什么启发就开始做的？\n\n**知县：** 了解我们的朋友会知道，我们做了两个主要产品，一个叫 Portal Wallet，一个叫 UniPass。\n\nPortal Wallet 的诞生其实比较早期，当时只有我一个人，我觉得**在以太坊的底层做 Layer 2 做得有点心累，觉得以太坊的底层怎么限制那么多。** 后来在 2019 年，我发现了新兴的公链 Nervos，我在这条公链上发现了很多其他公链没有的特性，这个时候我就开始摩拳擦掌跃跃欲试，想在这上面做点事。\n\n到了 2020 年 1 月左右，我做了个简单的类似于 ENS 的产品出来，然后我还注册了个 Nervos.domains，是模仿 ens.domains 的。但很明显，这里有个问题，就是我做出来了也没法用，因为那个时候的 Nervos 还处于早期，没有任何钱包可以用，我不可能为了做个 dApp 而去做一条新链，我也没办法让 MetaMask 去支持它。然后，我就在想：**能不能不让它支持我，而是我反过来去支持它？**\n\n当时的想法有点「反向思维」，然后我就想结合链的特点，把密码学的这些东西全都给它怼上，我是不是就能模仿一套以太坊的签名算法，然后让它被动支持，我就可以把它「白嫖」了。\n\n这就是 Portal Wallet 诞生的背景，所以你会看到这个产品其实并没有太大的战略布局，只是我当时在研究怎么做 Nervos 上的东西时，突然发现有这么一个产品可以做出来，而且效果好像非常好的一个产品。\n\n\\*\\*这是「Portal Wallet」 的定位，后面它的定位主要是为社区服务，\\*\\*帮助社区的小伙伴们转账、存币，以及出去布道的时候可以炫耀一下：你看，各个链的钱包都可以用。\n\n最后，我们还把它的能力封装成了一个「跨链」SDK，其他项目只要接上都可以用。最近也有很多项目，包括很多 Nervos 的生态项目，他们也都用上了这些功能，效果还比较好。\n\n所以，**Portal Wallet 更多的是站在 Nervos 社区做的事情，同时也是我们在探索怎么能够把这套范式应用到更广阔的地方去，** 因为 Nervos 本身是一个很小的圈子，尤其是相比以太坊生态来说，它非常小。我们成功地利用了一些技术上的突破，把以太坊的用户一下就可以囊括进来，我还能否更进一步，再通过现存的基础设施把更多的用户囊括进来？\n\n其实，这就是 UniPass 诞生的原因。\n\n**UniPass 才是我们想法的完整体，** Portal Wallet 主要是圈内的定位，但对于圈外的用户来说，使用 MetaMask、imToken 这些非托管钱包，对他们而言门槛非常高，这样的门槛下很难让大规模的用户进来，所以我们就要进一步往前走，希望能够找到这些已经在圈外有了的基础设施。于是，我们去研究比如浏览器、邮件等等，发现了很多已经可以在 Web 3.0 使用的基础设施，然后把这些东西的新功能拼起来，再加上一些架构的设计，就得到了最早的 Portal ID。这里其实可以看到 Portal Wallet 的影子，那个时候叫 Portal ID。\n\n从 ID 上大家可以感受到我们当时就在瞄准身份这个方向，后面不断地去打磨设计，因为「有想法」和「产品化」还是存在非常大的距离。后面，我们大概经过了半年的时间，到现在可以说是把 UniPass 产品做得比较完善了，也快正式发布了。\n\n# **4、为何选择 Nervos?**\n\n**主持人：** 你说你是因为对以太坊存在困惑，所以就想要找别的，但我感觉绝大多数的开发者还是会去找可能已经有的一些基础配套设施，或者是有一定生态规模的社区去做开发。当时你为什么会选择 Nervos？你刚刚也提到是说 Nervos 有一些特性是它独有的，所以我想请你聊聊你对 Nervos 的看法。\n\n**知县：** 我觉得选择更繁荣的生态肯定是最好的，但是这个「好」只是天平上的一点，比如说生态特别好，但它也有不好的地方，那就是门槛特别高。你如果选择了这个方向，那么你面对的用户量或者说用户群体就是比较固定的，你大概对自己做的东西就会产生一个选型的预期。当你的用户量不够多，新用户进来很难，现有用户的金融属性比较强的时候，你在设计产品时，你就会不自觉地往金融方向去走。\n\n站在我的角度，如果要讲 Web 3.0 这个故事，你不可能只做金融类或者投机类的产品，你要做更丰富、多元化的，能够让大家产生更强粘性和时间消耗的产品，你就得反过来进行考虑。\n\n首先，我觉得这些场景是必要的，我怎么把这些场景的用户吸引过来。这个时候，我就遇到了刚才说的门槛问题，一方面是操作门槛，一方面是认知门槛，这些对普通用户而言门槛比较高。\n\n在权衡的时候，我们选择希望 Web 3.0 有更多的场景，这样能够带来更多的用户，在这个前提下再往回推，我就会发现**目前能够支持我们降低门槛的基础设施，只有 Nervos 了。** 你可以理解为「我们要做直播，然后提供直播服务流的只有 Nervos 这么一家云服务商」，所以我们当时只有 Nervos 可以做，除非我们去做托管，那就是另一个故事了。\n\n所以，**以 Web 3.0 大发展为前提去考虑问题，我们就需要有一个去中心化的、足够安全、又能够兼容现有的基础设施，** 比如说直接使用 Web 浏览器而不需要安装插件，直接使用现成的密码学设施而不是去用小众一些的密码学设施，包括直接能够支持邮件这样更加广泛的基础设施。\n\n我们衡量了一下，如果我们使用 Nervos，在短期内很难有一个比较爆炸式的增长，因为它的社区可能要慢慢发展。但是长期来看，如果我们把互联网用户考虑进来的话，我能够直接触达的用户就是我的生态和我的社区。从这个角度来看，**我们面向的生态其实是互联网或者说是 Web 2.0 的用户。**\n\n接下来，我们就需要设计一些让他们能够进来的场景，而这个场景背后使用的是哪条公链，其实在这个层面上就没有显得那么重要了，这是我们最初的一些想法。\n\n# **5、Nervos 的灵活性**\n\n**主持人：** Nervos 跨链的这个概念，其实也是后面才提出来的。最开始 Nervos 出来的时候，它也没有说它能够做到这一点，你能否给听众简单地解释一下，究竟 Nervos 的哪一部分功能是其它公链做不到，只有 Nervos 可以做到的？\n\n**知县：** 简单来讲 ，**Nervos CKB 就是一条特别灵活的公链。** 拿安卓和 iOS 来做类比，iOS 的电话短信 App 都是系统写死的，即使你用得不习惯也不能改，但是安卓就可以用第三方的通话软件。所以，如果会玩 Nervos 的话，可以玩出很多花样来，但如果你不太愿意去了解或者不太会玩的话，可能就觉得啥也干不了，就没条件。你提到一开始他们不这么宣传，可能是在我们做这件事情之前，他们也没有意识到还能这么做。\n\n我记得 2020 年 1 月份，我给他们团队展示 Portal Wallet 的时候， Terry 当时的感受是：这就像是一名游戏设计者设计了一款游戏。他发现玩家竟然还可以这么玩，这么通关。这是我们的另一个故事。\n\n**另外，Nervos 的特点就是「密码学灵活」，我用什么密码学可以放什么。** 另外一个特点就是「账户抽象」，\\*\\*有一些听众可能对这个词比较熟悉，账户抽象就是说我可以用我任何自定义的逻辑来管理一种资产，而不是直接使用密码学公钥对应资产这种比较简单粗暴的方式。\n\n这两个特点一结合，你会发现我们可以把邮件结合进来，我们可以把指纹、人脸识别这些统统都结合起来，我觉得这对我们的产品很有吸引力。\n\n# **6、UniPass 如何降低 Web 3.0 的门槛？**\n\n**主持人：** 我们已经讲完了基础的部分，接下来想仔细地跟你讨论一下 UniPass。因为你也讲了 Portal Wallet 更像是一个工具包，它既服务了 UniPass，也服务了其他的一些应用，所以它其实更偏向一款开发者工具。\n\n从 Web 1.0 到 Web 2.0 的过程中，用户的增长速度其实是非常惊人的，因为这个过程把门槛降得很低了，但是 Web 3.0 是个全新的体系，或者说狭义一点的话，区块链不一定是 Web 3.0，因为「**数据主权自由** 」是一个更为广阔的概念，增长由于门槛的进一步提升，它又变成了一个问题。UniPass 作为一个解决方案，你是怎么去设计这个产品，如何在各个方面降低用户门槛，从而使得 Web 3.0 更加普及？\n\n**知县：** 你提的 Web 1.0、Web 2.0 这两阶段，都是人为划分的。当我们自己去看的时候，会发现互联网诞生挺长时间了，它一开始增长非常得慢，一直到大概 20 多年以后，到 1993 年左右，图形化的浏览器，包括后面的图形化操作系统出来之后，互联网用户才开始大规模地普及。\n\n比如说，1995 年大概有 1600 万的互联网用户，然后到 1998 年的时候差不多 1.47 亿，这个增量是非常快的，在 1995 年以及之前大概 26 年的时间里，其实一共也就增长了 1600 万。可以看到，Windows 95，包括 IE 浏览器、当年的网景等浏览器，对降低用户接入互联网的门槛有非常大的帮助，否则只能够在这个命令行界面去上网，这对于用户来讲门槛很高。\n\n第二个阶段，移动互联网阶段，包括智能手机这些工具的出现，让门槛进一步降低。\n\n在 2007 年 iPhone 的发布惊艳了全世界，之前并不是没有移动互联网，不是没有智能手机，但是他们的思路就把一个电脑微缩成一个手持的设备。\n\n因为 2007 年咱们知道 iPhone 的发布惊艳了全世界，之前并不是没有移动互联网，不是没有智能手机，但是他们的思路就把一个电脑微缩成一个手持的设备。\n\n不知道大家有没有用过那种全键盘的手机，让一个硕大的汉子都练就了用指甲盖去敲键盘的神技，很多使用功能都是直接照搬了 PC 体验，所以这个门槛一直没有降下来。直到 2007 年 iPhone 出现之后有了触屏，不管是老人还是甚至婴儿，都可以很方便地去操作，让不会打字、打拼音的人也可以上网，这是一次大规模地降低门槛。\n\n另一方面，可能大家不太常思考的，就是关于上网这一种「范式转移」的过程。原来我们上网都需要联网线，非常早的时候都是一台台式机插一段网线，再后面先进了一点就是一台笔记本电脑，需要有一个 WiFi 跟无线路由器，还有一些当年高富帅才用得上的 sim 卡，毕竟太高端，太贵了，普通人用不起。但是，自从智能手机普及之后，3G、4G 移动网络提速降费，让上网的环境、时间和空间都没有了限制。\n\n所以说，现在联网已经从「主动行为」变成了「被动性」，你不会主动去「联网」，你只会主动去「断网」，比如上飞机的时候主动去断网，平时肯定是默认联网的，这就是一个非常大的区别。移动互联网在这方面给全世界带来了非常快速的网络普及。\n\n到 2017 年，移动互联网的用户量、访问网站的流量，首次超过了桌面互联网。2007 年才真正意义上出现了移动互联网，但它只用了 10 年的时间，就打败了原来的桌面互联网，这个时候全球上网的用户也突破了 40 亿，我们可以看到它带来的这种效应是非常的迅速。所以，我们就觉得\\*\\*「降低门槛」是每一次用户爆发的一个必要条件。\\*\\*\n\n不管你上面的东西是什么样的，如果你的用户量不够大，你就没有办法找到真正的商业模式，你也很可能活不到那天就饿死了，这在咱们行业甚至都有不少先例。\n\n我认为现在的 Web 3.0，它跟我前面所讲的过程是相反的，因为现在的 **Web 3.0 门槛一直在上升，操作门槛到现在为止改观不大，上面的应用越来越难以理解，操作的成本越来越高。** 不管是 DeFi 这种金融类的应用，还是最近出圈的 NFT，它们的认知门槛已经比较低了，但操作门槛、资金门槛很高，甚至还有一些信息门槛。如果你的信息跟不上时代，你很可能进来玩一圈之后就被割了，然后就再也不来玩了。我觉得这肯定不是一个正常的 Web 3.0 的扩展路径，这样的话就没有办法复制之前互联网的成功经验，所以一定要把门槛降下来，至少要做到持平，不能比 Web 2.0 还要难用。\n\n如果不降的话，就类似一种「死亡螺旋」，因为你门槛高，所以你只能搞一些让用户非常有动力去克服门槛的项目出来。比如百倍币，比如说炒高价格，有非常高的收益，这样有足够动力让人跨过门槛。目前也只有认知能力比较高的一部分人能跨过来并且留下来，而这些又让场景更加内卷，没有别的选择，只能做这些东西，不断地去往这个方向上走，去挖掘更多的微创新，不断地去叠这个东西的复杂度，越来越专业，这样外面的人就越来越进不来了。这是我觉得现在出现的问题。\n\n**UniPass 想做的事，其实像之前互联网演进做的一样，把很多不应该暴露的底层细节给隐藏起来。**\n\n比如，我们在上网的时候，其实不会关心你交互的后端是阿里云还是腾讯云，你也不用理解什么 https，后面用的是什么密码学，即便事实上互联网早就用密码学了，可以说把自己武装到牙齿了。\n\n大家能够安全地使用互联网，其实后面有非常多的密码学，但是我们都不知道，因为它屏蔽得非常好，所以我们也希望 UniPass 能用路径把「公私钥」、「助记词」这些完全不应该让用户去费心的概念给隐藏掉，让他们用现在的习惯就直接进入 Web 3.0 的世界或者区块链的世界。只有这样，那些更多元化、没有那么高价值的场景才有可能出现，才有可能吸引到更多的用户。\n\n# **7、UniPass 的使用场景**\n\n**主持人：** 我觉得这两年产品使用体验还是有所提高的，门槛很高很大程度上来源于价格太贵了。这个门槛是属于基础设施本身的一些缺陷，或者说是因为太多人在用它来做一些可能本来不应该这么用的事情。你能否跟我们讲一下 UniPass 的一些使用场景？\n\n**知县：**\\*\\* 这两年用户体验提升，我觉得主要来源于做 dApp 团队更加完善了，\\*\\*他们可能有 UI，有 UE 了，之前只要有程序员就能直接上，所以会带来很多不一样的体验。\\*\\*但在密钥管理的体验上，我觉得进步确实不算很大，\\*\\*从 2017 年入行到现在为止，区别没有那么大，除了 Gas 涨得非常多。\n\n刚才我说我们为什么要做 UniPass，其实是为了更多的场景。对于场景，可以分为两部分，一部分现在已经有的场景，比如 UniPass 可以提供哪些更好的体验；一个是未来的一些场景，看看有没有一些新的场景可以探索。\n\n举个 DeFi 的场景，在 DeFi 的场景里面，大家有时候会有两难的选择，比如说你的资金量如果达到一定程度，你会需要用到硬件钱包，但是你用硬件钱包的时候，你有时候就觉得特别懒，因为你可能需要拿出来开机，然后按拼码，或者连电脑，操作要按好多键，这个时候一想就觉得好累，可能躺在床上觉得该操作了，但就是不想动，然后就不操作。也就是说，它逼着你在安全性和便利性上做一个「二选一」。\n\nUniPass 在这方面可以做到什么？\n\n在密钥架构上，UniPass 允许比如 Ledger 这样的管理器来管理密钥，还会允许在日常环境中使用的密钥，而这个密钥跟其他的解决方案不同的点在于，它可以用你的比如 iPhone 的扫脸或者指纹这种硬件级别的密码管理器来管理。iPhone 内置的这种支持密钥非常安全，安全到苹果自己都无法破解，它只能通过你的指纹、扫脸这样的生u物学的信息去做操作，而且它不会丢失，也不会泄露，这样就能够做到一个既安全又方便的体验。\n\n再来说说 NFT。NFT 其实更加社交化，带有出圈的性质。大家很希望把自己的 NFT 分享到朋友圈，一是让别人看到，另一个是我希望把一些东西送给别人或者卖给别人。但这时候，我都需要在一个 Web 3.0 环境下面操作，可能浏览器插件或者 imToken 这样的 App 钱包。\n\n那问题来了，如果对方是一名圈外的人，或者是粉丝，这都是圈外的人，我是一个 idol，是偶像，我要把 NFT 发给他们，怎么办？他们都不会操作，你难道要录一个视频教他们怎么一步一步地去创建钱包？即使粉丝把这个钱包创建出来了，他们也很难有这个能力去管理钱包，因为你不知道现在的环境有什么危险，尤其是对于普通用户，他可能随手一复制粘贴放到自己的云笔记里面，或者直接微信发给别人，然后就被盗了，这非常常见。因为他们并不知道这样是不安全的，他们已经习惯了这种操作，所以在这种情景下，对他们来说要求是过高的。\n\nUniPass 如何解决这个问题？**我们用的其实是现有的基础设施，UniPass 的密钥不可以导出，所以你的资产也不会丢失，用户也不需要保存「助记词」等流程，只需要有个邮箱就可以了。**\n\n而我们的 NFT 发送方案，对方不需要提前创建钱包，比如在微信里面，我们的 NFT 红包可以是二维码，也可以是个链接，大家扫码或者点链接进去，按照流程，有账户的话就直接登录，没有的话就创建一个新的 UniPass 账户，然后就可以 Claim NFT 了，也不需要考虑「Gas」。用过我们红包方案的人，体验都说好特别，我们现在大几千用户，很多都是通过做活动的时候注册的，他们从来也没有提出这个钱包应该怎么用，整个流程非常得顺，像是 Web 2.0 的体验，但背后整个 UniPass 架构又是 Web 3.0 的，这就是比较好的一种形态与实践。\n\n**主持人：** 我能否理解为 UniPass 是一个相对智能的钱包，但是又是一个身份管理的中间层？\n\n**知县：** 在某种程度上可以这么说，因为可以从不同角度来定义 UniPass 这个产品，现在大家对我们的认知可能最常见的就是说钱包，这其实是我们一直想摆脱的一种说法，因为钱包这个概念现在比较复杂，而钱包最基本的东西其实叫做「密钥管理器」，帮你去生成密钥，不管是备份或者说签名，帮用户保证安全地保存这么一套东西，其他的包括转账、转移数字资产等等。\n\n但你现在去 UniPass 里看，它没有转移资产的功能，**UniPass 最原始的功能就是「密钥管理器」，而在密钥管理器核心组件之上，UniPass 产品的定位其实就是刚才说的 DID 身份，或者说一种加密身份。** 这其实是 UniPass 的产品定位，而「钱包」或者「密钥管理」是它的其中一个功能定位，它可以用来帮其他人做签名，帮大家做管理。你为什么要去签名，要去管理？比如说，你去发行资产或者你去投票，这是你的身份，你有身份，所以你有权利在这个身份下面去获得沉淀资产和管理资产，你有权利以这个身份去做投票，你有权利用这个身份去 Claim 奖励和权益。所以，**身份才是 whole picture，UniPass 的密钥管理只是目前大家体验最多的一个功能。**\n\n**主持人：** 我觉得在 Web 3.0 的世界里面和 Web 2.0 不一样的地方在于，你的身份和你的资产其实是要强绑定的。在你的 Web 2.0 里面其实并没有表现出来，你在腾讯或者在豆瓣的数据，每个地方它都是一个数据孤岛，但在 Web 3.0 里面，它是账户体系，所以一个人所有的这些东西都是在同样一个账户。另一方面就是你链上的这种信誉，其实也可以被定价，比如说你用一条链，你从来没有被清算过，这个其实可以作为你的链上的信誉，可以把你能开的杠杆升高，这其实变相的就是有一个标价的。\n\n在你的 Web2.0 里面其实并没有表现出来，因为你在腾讯或者在豆瓣的数据，每个地方它都是一个数据孤岛，但是你首先在 Web3.0里面它是账户体系，所以一个人他所有的这些东西都是在同样一个账户，然后另一方面就是你链上的这种信誉，其实也可以被定价，因为他们其实是实际上比如说你用一个链上，你从来没有被清算过，这个其实是可以作为你的一个链上信誉，或者说可以把你的能开的杠杆升高，其实变相的它就是有一个标价的。\n\n在 Web 3.0 的世界里面，每一个人的身份会跟他各种各样的一些信息有一个强绑定，并且这个信息是可以用钱来量化的，所以从这样一点来讲，我觉得你刚刚说的不希望别人说 UniPass 是钱包，这个钱包的定义也是早期定义，实际上钱包不应该只是一个资产管理的工具。\n\n我最近在跟其他人讨论，钱包为什么不去做 social？像 MetaMask 这些，最适合做社交，它有没有这个能力是另外一个说法，但比如说在 OpenSea 上面，你跟别人买卖属于点对点交易，你天然就想跟对方以地址对地址的方式进行一些沟通。当然，这种 IM 的协议不太好做，而且蛮重的，但我觉得的确很需要。\n\n**知县：** 刚才聊到关于身份的定义问题。关于 Web 2.0，我其实有一个比喻，或者说 Metaverse 有区块链和没有区块链有什么区别。\\*\\*如果没有区块链，其实也就没有 Web 3.0，那 Metaverse 其实还是 Web 2.0 的一个大游戏公司运营的超大游戏。\\*\\*像头号玩家里的「绿洲」，在这个游戏里面或者在这个世界里面，是有神的，总是有一个全职全能、能够拥有一切权力，甚至把你整个人全抹杀掉的神。\n\n如果 Metaverse 想要跟真实世界做对标，你不能有神，因为任何人都不希望在一个有神但这个神还不是自己的世界，你进去的话你就属于一种被人宰割的状态。所以，我觉得\\*\\*区块链对于 Metaverse 来讲其实就是「去神化」\\*\\*的这么一个功能，我有了区块链，有了加密资产，有个加密身份，我才能够让 Metaverse 变得更真实，而不仅仅是一个 Web 2.0 的游戏。这是我对于加密身份的一个定位。\n\n第二，我觉得像 Galaxy 这样的声誉产品，非常好，而且是未来的方向。链上声誉非常像链下一个人的信用，或者说对这个人的定义，因为我们每个人都有一些档案，或者有一些各种各样的记录，当别人去分析你的时候，其实他就是要看你以往的一些行为来分析你，而不是根据你以往说过的话作为对你的一个评价依据。\n\n所以，区块链比较好的地方是它的行为是公开的，而且是你没有办法隐藏，它反映出来的身份就是非常难以伪造的，而且它的可用性也非常强。\n\n不管是 Galaxy 还是 UniPass，都是在往这个方向去探索，只不过大家的分工可能会不一样，我们主要是帮用户把他们自己的控制权掌握好，基于这个身份上面能够开发出什么样的应用，我非常期待。\n\n# **8、UniPass 的安全性**\n\n**主持人：** 在我的认知里面，使用体验和安全保证之间一定会存在一些妥协。所以，我想请你谈一谈 UniPass 的验证机制，从私钥的存储或者是 Cell 管理对比一下其他产品。\n\n**知县：** 这个问题我经常被问到，因为其他人在列竞争对手的时候，会把我们类比到其他，比如和 MetaMask 去比较。**其实最大的区别就在于，是不是一个低门槛的密钥管理方案，这点非常重要。**\n\nTorus 和 Magic 这些其实都属于我们的老前辈了，也是比较成功的一些产品，它们首先面向圈外用户降低门槛，其次才是怎么去管理「密钥」。\n\n**既然说到安全和体验的权衡，UniPass 的设计目标属于比较贪婪，就是我们安全、体验都想要，** 那妥协在哪儿？目前来说，我们在兼容性上做了妥协，这个兼容性主要是指对于现在的 Layer 1 的兼容。我们用到的密码学，比如 BTC 用的算法 SHA-256，这个算法不被互联网基础设施所支持，互联网支持的是它的同族，叫 PEA-256。所以，我们的妥协点是在短时间内，或者说目前状态下的一些兼容性。\n\n有了妥协之后，我们就可以做到前面我提的在网页里面可以通过扫脸来签名，这是一个既方便又安全的体验，这种安全是硬件级别的、底层上所支持的安全。从便利性角度来讲，因为是网页版，你都不用下任何 App 插件，你只要甚至在微信里面或者在 Discord 或者在推特上，有个链接点一下就进去了，然后扫一下脸就签名了。这就是我们追求的体验，目前暂时只能在 Nervos 上用。\n\n另外，与刚刚讲到的几个产品做对比，在低门槛这件事上，我觉得做得都比较好，可能需要找一些大家比较关注的点或者维度来做比较，这样有利于大家理解。\n\n**第一个是邮箱，邮箱对于这三个产品都非常重要。** 对 Torus 来说，它不是基于邮箱的，它是基于 OAuth，常见的社交平台包括 Discord 都提供 OAuth 服务，Torus 都可以直接调用，甚至微信都可以用。它用 OAuth 来做用户的鉴权，鉴权之后才进入区块链流程，这是一种「门前签名」的方式，它后面的流程其实跟邮箱的关系就不是很大了，尤其是它第一版产品。第二版 Torus 做了一个叫「Open Login」的功能，这个功能里面它有 security factor，有一个用邮件的功能，类似咱们常见的 2FA（Two-Factor Authentication）。\n\n第二个产品 Magic，其实是邮箱的重度用户。在 Magic，你的登录和注册是一样的，你把邮箱输进去，它给你发一封邮件，你点一下链接，包括你平时签名的时候，其实都是在邮箱里面收到一封邮件，你去点一下链接，然后转跳出来再去执行。所以，它其实把邮件作为我跟你之间的一种比较隐私的通信工具在用。在这个层面上，其实用微信也可以，你用微信服务号去推个消息是一样的，这是 Magic 的做法。\n\n然后，UniPass 做法跟它们两个都不太一样，因为我们用的是密码学，用的角度就不一样了。\n\n如果说刚才的两个产品用的是邮件 Web 2.0 的维度，那 UniPass 用的是邮件 Web 3.0 的维度。邮件虽然是个非常古老的协议，从 1971 年到今年正好 50 周年，虽然比较古老，但是它是横跨 Web 2.0 和 Web 3.0 两个维度的一个协议，这点可能大家了解的不多。\n\n最近，推特上发生了一件事，就是某个热门项目有一个「水军」邀约邮件，类似于「你帮我去转推特，我给你发钱」这种 5 毛邀请邮件，发到了 ENS 创始人 Nick Johnson 那边。Nick Johnson 非常愤怒，于是就把对方的信息挂在了推特上，之后被挂的那一方觉得这是垃圾邮件，跟他没关系，这是最简单的 Web 时代的钓鱼邮件，怎么能够被这么简单的骗局给骗到？还把我们牵连进来了。\n\nNick Johnson 更怒了，直接把 DKIM 签名贴出来了。DKIM 能够用密码学来证明这个邮件就是来自于某个域名的签名，也就是说，如果真的是钓鱼邮件，那也是你们官方的人控制的、拥有邮件私钥的人才有权限把这个邮件发出来，所以还是你们官方的，被打脸了。当然，可能对方是市场部的人员，他没有办法在这个维度上继续去聊，你也可以看到后面的后续。\n\n这件事特别巧，他把 DKIM 这个非常冷门的技术给搬出来了。我们其实很早以前就听说过 DKIM，全称 DomainKeys Identified Mail，就是用域名来验证的邮件，在零几年的时候就开始在全世界广泛支持了，是一个反 Spam 的协议。\n\n用 Gmail 举例，我给你发了一封邮件，你的收件箱怎么确定这封邮件是 Gmail 发的？邮件是个协议，任何人都可以搭一个邮件服务器，然后声称我是 Gmail。谷歌的做法类似于欧洲中世纪大家在信封上倒上红色蜡油并盖上自己的章，Gmail 发出去的每一封邮件都会盖上一个「封印」，即 DKIM Signature。每一份邮件都用公钥对应的私钥签过名，公钥在它的 DNS 记录里的一个 TXT 记录中公布，所以全世界的人都可以查询，收到邮件的时候你验证一下签名即可。只要签名是对的，那一定是 Gmail 发出来的；如果不对，那就是钓鱼邮件，直接从收件箱中删除，都不需要展示给用户看。\n\n这就是 DKIM 的基本原理。**我们就用这个协议里的密码学，直接在链上做 social recovery，直接在链上验证邮件。** 这是我们比较自豪的一个创新，因为它用上了互联网 Web 1 时代很古老的一个协议，通过 Killer App 直接把它带到了 Web 3 的新世界里。\n\n**第二个是托管程度，** 大家的方向都不太一样。Torus 用的门限签名，9 个节点，每次选其中的 5 个获取分配信息，在本地重组之后解锁一个密钥，这个密钥就是你的资产对应的那个地址。\n\nMagic 则用亚马逊的服务，AWS Key Management Service（KMS）。Magic 把跟亚马逊之间的 access 服务关掉了，就是说我没有权限 access 我买的服务。当然，如果 Magic 不续费，这个肯定就没了；如果他继续续费，KMS 继续运行，亚马逊也没问题，它就可以用，每次登录都通过 KMS 去解锁你的密钥。\n\nTorus 和 Magic 现在的盈利模式，是提供一个类似包月的、对活跃用户收费的功能。既然它们可以提供这个功能，说明大家依赖于它们的服务，没有它们的服务你定制不了。\n\n**UniPass 在这方面不太一样，因为我们没有后端的密钥存储，密钥都在本地。** 注意我讲的是 UniPass 正式版的方案，现在大家用的还不是。正式版 UniPass 本地密钥存储，不可导出。不可导出怎么灾备，是另一个问题。\n\n前面我们讲了怎么通过邮件做 social recovery，\\*\\*我们的前端是可以独立运行的，可以放在 IPFS 上，放在任何开源的地方，大家直接下载下来运行即可。\\*\\*我们现在用的 PWA 技术，可以在电脑或者手机的桌面上直接缓存一个类似 App 的东西，断网的时候也可以用，完全不依赖于 UniPass 的后端。这是在架构上的一个区分。\n\n**第三个是关于环境安全。** Torus 用的其实是 iPhone，它的 Key 每次解锁之后会存在 Session Storage 里，一次访问解锁一次 Key，关掉访问 Key 就直接释放，这是一种比较安全的手段，比起早期网页钱包直接把私钥存在 Local Storage 里要安全很多。\n\nMagic 除去亚马逊的风险不说，如果你作为一个用户，邮箱丢了，你的钱可能就没了。我们做过实验，一位小伙伴收到了 Magic 登录链接之后，从邮件中拷贝出来微信发给我，我复制到浏览器中去登录。Magic 会提示你的 IP 是新 IP，你确定登录吗？我点了确定，然后成功地登录了。\n\nUniPass 刚才其实也提到了，私钥在浏览器底层和硬件底层，就看你的当前浏览器对于 Web Authentication API 的支持程度了。如果支持得好，就直接是硬件级的；如果支持的兼容性不好，比如说微信浏览器，那就是微信级别的安全性。\n\n上面说的三个维度，大家或许能够感受到 UniPass 的一些区别。当然，还有一个是我们的问题，就是我们兼容的区块链现在还比较少，其他两个各个链都可以用。\n\n# **9、用户**\n\n**主持人：** 沟通下来，我感觉 Torus 比较喜欢把自己偏向 B 端，它并不去追求 own the customer。我前面提到钱包去做 social 这个事，需要钱包有能力去做，因为要自己去获取用户，要和用户有一个直接的交互才有可能。从这个角度看，你不会觉得难度更大吗？\n\n**知县：** 难度确实更大。我上次跟你聊的时候，思路跟现在不太一样，那时候想法还有些天真，不够周全。我之前的想法是，可能我靠一些手段就可以把用户玩起来，但我现在觉得就算玩起来了，用户可能也沉淀不下来，所以还是要有一个场景。**我们找到了这个场景，其实就是身份，然后基于这个身份再去拓展到社交，包括基于 token 的一些社交。**\n\n先说说方向上的事情。Torus 是典型的 to B 策略，因为它现在开始提供白标服务，而且在安全性上比 Magic 要好，同时比较好用，站在它的角度看，它要通过这套系统收整个行业的红利。月活用户越多，它收的钱越多，这是个非常简单也非常有效的商业模式，我觉得是没有问题的。\n\n那我为什么会选择一条更难、不确定性更强的路？还是跟我们的经历有关。我觉得**创业这件事情，尤其在一个新兴行业，要尽可能地去抓更大的红利，或者说红利到来的时候，能够找相对比较大的点去切入，这样你能够拿到更多的份额。**\n\n像 Web 1.0 时代，搜索引擎占据了非常大的份额，不管是百度还是 Google，基本上垄断了整个线上广告业务。Web 2.0 进入用户交互时代，咱们现在不太可能在搜索引擎中找信息，或者说找到的信息，你也明确地知道哪些是有用的，哪些是没有用的，广告其实越来越没有那么重要了，反而是你在 social media 上看到的信息你会更相信。这就是为什么现在大家甚至在抖音上买房子，在抖音上找吃的、穿的。\n\n你会发现，大家会被一个新的时代吸引到新的平台。如果站在 2000 年的时间点，你可能完全想象不到会是这个样子。所以，对于我们来讲，去收一个固定的收入，包括 ENS 也是这样，是一个非常好讲的故事，**但我想做的是怎么能够建立起更高的壁垒。这个壁垒就是你刚才说的我想 own 用户（拥有用户）。**\n\n我觉得 own 分好几个层级。在 Web 2.0，own 其实就是建立壁垒，你可以看到微信封杀淘宝链接，这是人为设置的，因为微信权限比较大，在它的体系里面它就是神，所以它可以这么干。但是在 Web 3 或者在区块链的世界里，open 可能是效率更高的一种方式，所以就提出了挑战：你怎么能够在 open 的前提下，咱不说 own，还能够让用户留下来，能够服务到更多的用户。\n\n**我的结论是，要避免被通道化。** 通道化，最好的例子就是移动运营商，按理说他们才是最基础的入口，没有他们你连网都上不去，但为什么到最后微信、抖音成为了入口，移动运营商只能收一个包月费用？这其实就是被通道化的典型。大家如果翻翻移动互联网的历史，你会发现最早占据 50% 以上流量的网站叫移动梦网，它拥有非常大的互联网先发优势，但是最后没有做成。这就是被通道化了。\n\n现在，你在加密世界做用户入口，怎样才能够避免被通道化？我们可以看到，即便是有一些被通道化的产品，它们现在日子也过得不错，比如 MetaMask，其实它的壁垒并没有那么强，但由于它的用户量足够大，它一年赚个一两千万美金应该是没有问题的。这就是用户入口的价值。\n\n**但另一方面，你怎么能够让价值可持续？我觉得是网络效应，要考虑软性的粘性。** 站在微信的角度考虑，用户对它来说可能都差不多，但是站在普通用户的角度考虑，微信代表的是什么？是你的整个社交关系网，所以任何一个人想离开这个网，他的阻力都是其他人，不管是主动的还是被动施加给他的。\n\n社交网络也是一样，你在用这个产品的时候，这产品代表的不仅仅是它对你提供的价值。比如，我用一个工具类的产品，比如说钱包，我用这个钱包管理我的密钥，和用另外一个钱包管理我的密钥，其实区别不大，而且我可以非常简单地通过注记词导过去的方式就转移了。但是对于微信来说，显然没有这么简单，这是个聊天工具。另一个比如 Telegram 也是个聊天工具，你过去了，你的朋友没过去，还是没有用，这就是网络效应产生的软性粘性。\n\n所以，我认为**在一个更加 open 的世界里面，软性的粘性远比硬性的，** 比如说我不开源，去跟别人打，去做流量的切割，可能要更符合这个行业的趋势，以及能够产生更强的壁垒。\n\n**如果你要做这种网络效应，其实就两个字——连接。** 张小龙对于微信的定位是什么？连接一切，connect everything。微信甚至还说过，我要把人从我这赶走，不要在这里头沉迷，因为微信有底气，它是连接器，你总会从微信过一道，既然过一道那微信就有权利挑选谁才能够让用户看到。这就是渠道的价值和它的盈利逻辑。\n\n**UniPass 的定位为什么要以身份来切入，就是因为要 connect everything。** 什么是 everything？要么是用户跟场景，或者说用户跟应用做连接，要么就是用户本身做连接。我觉得身份是连接中必不可少的点，没有这个点是没有办法做连接的，而你站住这个点的话，其实不管是对人还是对于场景，去做连接都是非常顺的。\n\n我举个小例子，我们对 NFT 的理解是什么？NFT 其实在链上你可以理解为一个连接，比如像 Galaxy 发给我的茅台币，这不就是代表着我跟当时出现在这个活动现场的大家的一个关系，跟 Multicoin 的关系吗？这种连接性，现在你只能在 token 的简介里看到，可能在 UniPass 后面的产品形态中，你会直接在产品级别看见，比如你点开一个 NFT，你就可以看到 connection，甚至你可以直接触达他们，你可以看到他们有官方的社群，有第三方的社群。\n\n**主持人：** 这就是我说的 IM 的那种。Web 3 最核心的点就是要「白嫖」，就是要互相借力。\n\n**知县：** 对，你不「白嫖」的话，你要说服用户从一个熟悉的平台进入一个新的平台，关键你还做不过人家，因为你带着 Web 3 的包袱，做的东西其实是更难的。\n\n**所以，我们的思路一直都是融入，然后只要再坚持，最后不管是身份还是资产，在去中心化、开放的前提下，尽一切可能利用现在的设施去触达所有人。** 比如，最简单的我可能做一个 discord bot，然后我的目标是被 10 万个 server 邀请进去。这个 bot 能干什么，能触达多少人，我能够对这些人的行为做出什么样的反馈，这几点其实我觉得可以跟 Galaxy 有很大的合作空间。\n\n**主持人：** 是的，从 Discord 的角度来讲，它也想要「白嫖」。大家都有在社群展示身份的需求，Reddit 不就是这样做的嘛。Discord 也在这么做了，就是去把你的身份和你链上的一些徽章关连在一起，这样你就可以更容易地找到你的社区和你的同类。\n\n**知县：** 是的，所以我觉得这个思路都是非常一致的。\n\n# **10、链上身份和信誉**\n\n**主持人：** 我其实想跟你多聊一点关于链上身份和信用这个事情。你应该知道有一个产品叫 Yat，你能不能跟我讲一下为什么大家会愿意付费，产生一个链上的虚拟身份？\n\n**知县：** 其实我觉得我不代表普通用户，我买的是对产品有用的。第二，我觉得它跟 Crypto Punk 这些有点像，你会觉得你拥有它，你就是这个群组的人，或者说我跟没有它的人不一样。这种身份认同也是跟身份有关。\n\n有时候说「我比你有身份」，什么叫「我比你有身份」，身份这个东西是有圈层的，倒不是说谁高谁低，而是说我跟你不一样。我觉得 Yat 的一个原因是这个。另外，Yat 本身是一个展示性特别强的东西，你在这里面又可以像 Linktree 一样去放各种各样的东西，有点像文艺复兴。Web 1.0 文艺复兴最早的做这种个人主页的事情，现在又在 Web 3 开始活跃起来了，我觉得挺有意思。\n\n**主持人：** 历史是螺旋上升的。刚刚有互联网的时候，还有很多个人站长，后面为了效率的提升，就会有平台出现。但后面比如说 Shopify，是非常个人化的，是对 Amazon 的抗争。在 Shopify，每个店铺都不一样，然后大家其实是希望去寻找更加符合自己风格的消费体验，而不是说按照 Amazon 这种走量的。所以，历史一直都是在螺旋上升前进，还蛮有意思的。\n\n接下去我特别想问你的一个事，是关于信誉体系。在传统 Web 2.0 里面，信誉体系，比如 credit score 信用积分，它都是基于中心化的模型，它会去算你的信用分。你觉得在 Web 3.0 世界里，身份绑定的行为，大家会更加愿意使用中心化的机构或者说中心化定义的模型来打标签，还是各个 DAO 这种项目会更愿意自定义标签、属性，去算用户的链上身份信誉？\n\n**知县：** 我觉得可能是后者。现在的标签体系里边，也不是完全由某个机构。比如说，你去阿里或者腾讯买这种数据服务，他们先给你一个数据的 sample，比如说 10 万条数据。然后，你去跑你自己的模型，你自己算分或者说打标签，完成后他们会把你编译好的程序拿去，完全离线的情况下给你跑一遍，最后给你跑出来的结果，原始数据你是拿不到的。\n\n如果我是一个小贷公司，你也是一个小贷公司，我们如果用同一套标准去评估借款人的信用，其实大家没有什么竞争上的优劣，对吧？因为他的信用分其实就代表你的放款成本，大家都是自己在算的。\n\n**到了 Web 3.0 也是一样，因为每个组织的关注点肯定是不一样的，而且维度更多，这个数据的权威性和以前也不一样了。** 以前，说实话，谁是数据源谁说了算，最后给你的结果你只能相信，是吧？这点上，我觉得可能是像 Galaxy 这样新兴的这种声誉系统，它能够带来的突破就是它的数据源至少有一部分是公开可查而且不可篡改的，这部分是这个身份的基础。另外，关于 Galaxy 我还稍微了解了一下，它还能够囊括进一些非标数据。这些数据的判断就没有那么冷冰冰，可能会有一些比较社区化的认同参数或者说评分标准，这些都是可以去探索的点。\n\n**链上数据在链上出结果，这个基础设施对于链上身份也非常重要。** 虽然现在还没有那么紧迫，但是未来当多链数据变得越来越多，人在链上的行为越来越多的时候，你有链上的数据能力其实是一个非常强的竞争力，因为线下做一个数据统计并没有那么高门槛，但是做链上的事情门槛就会非常高。这一点也是身份的一个比较重要的方向。\n\n**主持人：** 假设未来是个多链宇宙，你觉得不同链的身份之间，信息应该怎么统一、互相借鉴？\n\n**知县：** 就看多链是分工的还是竞争的。\n\n**主持人：** 我感觉还是有分工的。举个例子，Solana 不去做分片的核心的原因，是它需要即时的同步，它不希望有这种跨分片的通讯，因为跨分片通讯就意味着会有一些延迟。但是 Web 3.0 的一些 App 不需要这种即时的同步。我其实是想说，假设多链不是竞争的关系，你觉得不同链的身份之间怎么去统一？当然也有一种可能性，就是在未来的元宇宙里面，大家不希望有一个独立的身份，而是想要有多个身份。我很好奇你怎么看这件事？\n\n**知县：** 我的看法就是你说的后面这些。我们提到加密身份或者去中心化身份，为什么有时候我不想跟 DID 挂钩，就是因为 DID 还是想用去中心化的方式把你这个人固定下来。\n\nUniPass 提供的东西，绝对不是说把真实世界中的你跟虚拟世界绑定，而是说我给你一种方便在 Metaverse 或者 Web 3.0 这种未来的数字世界里面去沉淀资产，沉淀声誉，去执行一些操作的能力。不是说就只能有一个，你当然可以创建好多，反正只要你有邮箱，就可以创建多个 UniPass。\n\n接着说多链怎么同步。一方面，之前我们 Portal Wallet 的能力可以在这上面发挥作用，在 UniPass 的正式版里面你会发现这是可选项，你可以把你多链的地址密码学地绑到 UniPass 里面去，没有什么不能统一的。比如，知县的 UniPass，这个人的整个身份在多链上是什么样的，你就看他公开了哪几条链上的地址，这些地址可以被统合成同一个主体去考虑。\n\n比如说，我的多链身份绑定这一用户名之后，我就可以去某一条链上的 DeFi 赚钱，赚到钱后，我去了一条娱乐的公链上玩游戏，把钱花了，然后可能给我打出来的标u签就是：这个人是一个月光族。当然，前提是我愿意公开，如果我不愿意公开，我们还是要提供一种能力，让用户很好地保护自己的隐私。\n\n事实上，邮箱在整个 UniPass 方案里面是一个非常隐私的东西，你会发现我们的方案里用了很大的精力去做零知识证明，为的就是要把你邮件里面的邮箱信息给抹去，同时还要在链上保证这个邮件就是账户所有的。**我们其实在这些地方花了很大精力，就是为了让用户的隐私能够得到保护。**\n\n所以，未来我希望建一个小号的时候，可以建一个小号，这个小号我打算把它打造成玩游戏的大牛，我就可以给他绑上各种游戏链上的东西，让大家发现这个人综合评分好高。就像索尼的奖杯，虽然你玩的游戏不一样，你可以把每个游戏当做一个 Metaverse，但是你在 Metaverse 里面的成就、你的经验值最后都会反馈到你在这个游戏里面获得的奖杯数量和品种，最后再反馈到你的账户在索尼平台上的一个等级和经验值。我觉得这样的一个层级关系可能比较好。\n\n**主持人：** 还蛮有意思的。你说的既然能在未来的短时间内实现，我觉得也蛮牛逼的，因为我本来觉得这种事情应该不太会在短时间内发生。所以，你的意思是你觉得其实这个并不远吗？\n\n**知县：** 其实真的不远，因为基础设施在我看来都是完备的，主要就是：一个是场景没有到这一步，没有足够丰富的东西能够产生这样的数据，就是大数据你得先有数据。\n\n**主持人：** 一旦有一种模式跑出来，就会有很多新的玩法，所以我倒不担心说你说的场景没有到这一步。传统的机构、团队，只要能够赚到钱，他们都会来的，因为他们现在也有一个增长瓶颈，就是大的这些平台已经非常强大了，他们作为小兵很难去开疆拓土，所以转到有非常明显的红利，是大势所趋。我们看到许多传统 VC 也开始关注 Crypto 了，我觉得创业者也一样。\n\n# **11、分布式办公**\n\n**主持人：** 你们的团队现在是分布式办公，我也蛮好奇的，就是你们这种协作的体验、效率如何？你们每个季度去某个地方做封闭开发，你觉得这种运营模式能够可持续，一直分布式吗？\n\n**知县：** 我觉得没问题，但我们不是无脑地分布式，我们现在的状态是 60% 远程，40% Onsite。有一些岗位，哪怕暂时过不来，我可能也要求他过来，比如说运营。这其实是分岗位的，得看工作性质，比如说开发人员，其实他们做事情时更需要一些独立的空间和时间，所以**分布式办公的挑战，其实是挑战你的组织架构，或者说你这个团队协调大家一起做事的能力。**\n\n如果你是远程的技术小伙伴，我们会要求你先在办公室里待半个月到一个月，这样大家能够建立起一个深度的了解，增加默契。这个我觉得是必要的，过了这个时期，大家建立了一些信任和熟悉程度，包括工作节奏、包括一开始的技术培训。我觉得我们公司的技术培训氛围还挺好。之后，大家就能够比较迅速地切入，像我们现在招的技术小伙伴基本都没有区块链的开发经验，基本上半个月、三周之内都可以正常进入开发，而且我们出东西还是比较快的，效率比较高。\n\n当然了，团队的大小也有关系，我们现在大概是 10 个人，我觉得这个规模到 20 个人左右应该就差不多了，再大的话管理上会消耗更多的精力。\n\n**第二个是每个季度的封闭开发，我觉得也是非常必要的。** 人还是需要有面对面的这种关系的，长时间大家不见面的话就会生分，在沟通上缺乏默契。比如说，你说了一句不好听的话，我跟你很熟的话我肯定不当回事，我要跟你不熟我就会走人。如果大家天天不见面，不太好，这个人就相当于在你的生活中消失了，就只剩下网上的一些文字，还有视频会议里面的头像，这样不太好。\n\n所以，有条件的话是每个季度，没条件可能也就是两三次，大家找一个地方封闭开发，一般都是我们产品上线或者一些比较重要的 milestone 之前，找一个地方一块待上 10 天左右，长的话两周，短的话可能一周多。我们已经进行了 3 次，如果算上最早的 Portal Wallet，那就是 4 次。这个过程，一方面小伙伴们会把它当做一种福利，类似于带薪旅游，虽然去了之后也没有太多时间旅游，因为我们去的时候都是 1 天当作 1.5 天安排的。我们排任务的时候，平时每天是按 8 个小时排，然后封闭开发的时候一天 12 个小时。\n\n比如说上次去大理，有大概两天的时间是大家一起出去玩的，第一天去古镇玩了一天，最后一天大家自由活动，所有的人都非常高兴，那次的效率也非常高。我觉得这是一个值得探索的新的协作模式，尤其是在这种疫情之下，咱们这个行业其实更开放，大家配合的模式没有必要那么死板。\n\n再比如说比特币社区，它甚至连一个事实上的领导机构、发起机构都没有，这是非常去中心化的，大家就是按规则来。\n\n我们现在在做一个产品，做产品的时候需要的形态就是快速迭代、快速推进，所以它会需要一个更紧密的组织形态。武警、军队、特种部队，虽然他们都属于军事力量，但是他们的侧重点和组织形态就非常不一样。我觉得我们更像特种部队，大家快速突进，到一个共同的目标汇合，然后接着下一步。\n\n所以，雷兔这个名字，你会发现很「雷」，对吧？这种雷厉风行的感觉，又要像兔子一样非常灵活，大家不要死气沉沉的，要尽量地把大家的创造力释放出来，还是非常有效果的，这个状态非常",

We will be purchasing Genopets Habitats specially branded for YGG that will allow for the YGG community to play, move, and earn.”\n\n“The Genopets team has great experience in the crypto space and a deep understanding of the scholarship model, which can be seen from the design of the game and how Habitat delegation should allow for easy management of scholars,” he added.\n\nAs Albert Chen, co-founder, and CEO of Genopets, shared, “The idea for Genopets was born from our prior work in digital health exploring ways to provide passive income to individuals as an incentive to stay physically active.”.\n\n“Through the years, we remained steadfast in our vision for health-enabled passive income,” he added. “We have been very blessed by the play-to-earn narrative tailwind and are excited to have the support and experience of Yield Guild Games on our side as we revolutionize the intersection of gaming and NFTs.”\n\nGenopets is a play-to-earn NFT game on Solana that combines the nurturing of Tamagotchi with the training and battling of Pokémon through asynchronous puzzle mini-games all driven by your real-world activity.\n\nAt the heart of the game is your digital spirit animal, a Genopet. Genopets are generative NFTs that evolve and can be upgraded and customized with eight variable bionic features and extremities, falling under the category of one of five elemental types. Due to the cybernetic nature of Genopets, players can swap their body parts for a more pleasing appearance and better stats by completing PVE quests and unlocking special body modifications as they level up their Genopet and increase its rarity.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*YIGd22g69yPyx4JR)\n\nThese pets can be evolved to increase their value with every step taken in real life, then sold on NFT marketplaces. Genopet NFTs can be acquired for free and are minted as infants. Over time, they increase in value as more time and effort is invested to augment their type, battle performance, and aesthetics. Since your Genopet reflects your daily activity and personal preferences, it becomes a one of a kind and incredibly rare digital representation of yourself.\n\nThe game converts your real-life movement into XP (experience points) to progress in-game. It does this by accessing the step data from your smartphone or wearable fitness device to reward you for each step you take in the real world with in-game features and abilities such as story advancement, aesthetic enhancements, and performance upgrades.\n\nGene Crystals are non-fungible tokens that you craft using unrefined crystals, GENE and KI to direct the evolution of a Genopet. Gene Crystals come in many forms, and each plays a unique part in affecting your pet’s evolution. For instance, a Fire Crystal can change your Genopet to fire-type and grant it a fiery appearance and fire moves for a limited time.\n\nIn the Genoverse, there are three different roles:\n\n*   **Collector** — Collectors may play the game with the purpose of creating the coolest, never-before-seen Genopet while crafting and hunting for rare NFTs to hold and trade them in the open marketplace.\n*   **Merchant **— Merchants purchase, create, and terraform the most mystifying habitats to farm and refine rare and valuable crystals to trade on the marketplace.\n*   **Landlord** — Landlords acquire habitats for the purpose of leasing them to other players to get a steady flow of resources.\n\n**GENE** is a governance and staking token that represents ownership in the Genoverse. GENE token holders get to vote on the future of gameplay and stake GENE tokens to earn rewards.\n\n**KI** is a fungible in-game reward token that can be earned when purchasing a Habitat. KI can be used to evolve Genopets, alchemize crystals, generate new Habitats, and battle other players.\n\nGenopets live and evolve in procedurally generated non-fungible Habitats that can be purchased through the Genopets Marketplace or crafted using GENE, KI, and Gene Crystals. These Habitats influence Genopets’ skills and crafting costs for Gene Crystals. In addition to this, Habitats need to be maintained periodically to continue earning KI tokens.\n\nThe biggest difference between Habitats level 1–3 is the number of unrefined crystals each Habitat generates, Refined Crystal production, and the amount of KI a player can earn each day. This means that a higher-level habitat can generate more daily KI. Habitats boost XP, unlocking the ability to craft Gene Crystals directly and earn daily KI.\n\nThe game also has a competitive nature to it by letting players battle it out in a PVP environment to secure their rank on the leaderboard and earn more XP.\n\nGenopets also has plans to roll out team PVE quests and an NFT marketplace in addition to implementing a zero-knowledge protocol to upgrade Genopets by importing biometric data.\n\nFor more information on Genopets, check out their [website](https://www.genopets.me/), [documents](https://docsend.com/view/b9bqd2j78nekzdgr), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/U6fvpEj7yS), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/genopets).\n\nAlso check out YGG’s [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/AWSVhfkVXG) or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yieldguild) for future updates.\n", "timestamp": 1636712400, "digest": "AA3_DDOsPlOQp-7spw8TwcGknWq5cHoPs8fl7vqn3os", "contributor": "0x8f32844357f27d8C185255832B914dd7E3eCFB9a"}

While it may be necessary to for a nation to ensure that all of its students comprehend several basic and fundamental parts of human knowledge, this can be accomplished without requiring all of its students to follow the exact same curriculum. By requiring students to comprehend a certain amount of areas of knowledge but without drawing the exact pattern to circumscribe the way of teaching, students and teachers of the nation would be able to achieve a win-win: they could both find their best pattern of learning, and teaching.\n\nIt is important to ensure that students acquire knowledge in certain important fields. When a student graduates from high school, what’s the most important is that he/she grasp the most basic, fundamental part of human wisdom, the most crucial parts that the collective understanding of human consist. To be more specific, students should be already packed with the adequate amount of comprehension of mathematical and physics, from which they grasp the basis of how this word goes around; understanding human history and politics, so that can they be capable of important decisions of democracy that a citizen is being called upon to make. When a student enters college, it isn’t the specific knowledge that they’ve acquired before the most important for academic success and well-being in life. Rather, it is the ‘way to learn’, or simply, the ability of learning and comprehension of the objectives that matters the most, and thus we need subjects, subjects that comprised the most essentials of human wisdom to provide students with those. In math and physics, we develop analytical and quantitative skills; in English and history we absorb culture and humanities; in biology and geography we learn more about this magnificent planet we live and nurture. At this point, we do need some sort of mean to ensure that all students within the nation shares the equal opportunity to learn those essentials of human wisdom.\n\nHowever, when taken seriously, there isn’t clearly a necessity to carry out and implement a national curriculum to make this happen. Even, one may easy find that it is nearly impossible – with feasible empirical tractability, to implement such national curriculum. Imagine all of a NATION’s students board school at the same time, take the same class simultaneously. How could we possible have enough teacher to let this happen? What low an efficiency should we expect from such a strange organization of courses? Even if a nation could manage this above, requiring all of a nation’s student to have the same curriculum arises more drawback and limitations. For example, having the same curriculum forbids teachers to teach in their own way, which makes it almost impossible to design and give lectures aiming at cultivating student’s characteristic and personality, which however, is considered equal, or even more important than specific discipline knowledge. Schools, especially K-12 ones, never should let alone be the institution that only offer knowledge within a limited area. Instead, it should cultivate students with well-being and rich personalities thorough a personalized education. Such education requires, demands courses and curriculums designed according to the specific circumstances of teachers and students, and having a national curriculum at most means diminishes such requirement.\n\nAll in all, it is important to require students to learn knowledge of certain field before entering college, but it should not be implemented by cramming students with a national curriculum.", "timestamp": 1636713213, "digest": "_dMmfvic5LROF959LRxm8R42I3N1hAsfda4ZRtDA1TY", "contributor": "0xe5c64cdf0659Bea1338A3aB8645B9cA109bB602E"}

It can takes hours, days and weeks because; If you don’t choose your cities best venue, someone else will.\n\nHere’s how to do it right.\n\n## Venue Dating\n\n### Personality \n\nWe choose beautiful venues that are unique, alternative, creative, edgy, funky, arty, traveller friendly, off-beat, or just with a special character. We work with independent businesses who nurture their venue’s vibe. Forget chains!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IRxqMZ010wAcKzkYh8hiY.png?height=605&width=908)\n\n\nIt seems there are dozens of perfect venues in your city, but as you look closer, it becomes clear that finding that truly compatible match takes love and patience.\n\n### Ask the Public\n\nAs part of **[Decentralise Mundo Lingo](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/Bz8plTeNzVaYGOvJ7utPNUn41k6G4HSh3fnhOxzWjb8)** we highly recommend making this as much a public affair as possible.

However, our aim is open 3, 4 or more weekly events in your city. To open 1 event in the centre of a mega-city is incredibly short-sighted. **Ask yourself**; if you were to open 5 events in your city tomorrow, where would they be?\n\n\\*\\*Why the CBD / Centre, will only waste your time |\n\\*\\*• High prices\n• Bars are already busy. We’re not needed.\n• Full of office workers in suits. Suits kill vibe\n• People working or studying in the centre go home to change in the suburbs at 5pm, and are too tired to come back to the centre.\n• Bars with no character. Only generic penny-pinching chain bars survive.\n\n**The Fringe**\nWhere cool bars hang out.\nThey know they must nurture their community in order to succeed, just like us!\nIndependents are often run by open-minded owners open to trying new ideas, rather than corporate offices with inflexible policies. The fringe has trendier bars, sweeter vibes, lower prices, less suits and more authentic smiles.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DRRunSL2TrpnaVqsEAell.png?height=800&width=800)\n\n**Your City Map |**\nWe provide you with a City Map (please don’t create it yourself).\nUse the City Map to mark businesses (bars, hostels and language schools) and take notes on them.

Pour devenir LP, il suffit d’ allouer 50% d’un token A (ETH) et 50% d’un token B(USDC) dans une pool de liquidité, ou d’en créer une.\n\nUne fois ceci effectué, le DEX va manager votre position de manière à permettre les échanges pour les gens qui veulent exécuter un swap et en même temps veiller à l’équité stricte de votre position, le ratio 50/50 doit toujours être maintenu, peut importe les variations de prix.\n\nVous touchez ensuite une commission sur les swaps effectuer sur votre paire, qui peut être fixe ou variable en fonction du protocole et vous pouvez être en + récompenser par le protocole pour avoir apporté de la liquidité, ce qui constitue votre revenu passif et votre % d’APR.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*3bATB26z3GEaxGRJjln-2Q.png)\n\nUne question vous vient peut être, comment un protocole décentralisé peut il être aussi proche du cours réel, et des prix qu’affichent un CEX comme Ftx, Binance…\n\nLa justification est simple, l’arbitrage, quand un gap se creuse entre le prix d’un Dex et le prix d’un Cex, des personnes viennent naturellement le combler en effectuant un swap et viennent chercher un premium, qui correspond à la différence de prix entre le DEX et le CEX.\n\nCet apport de liquidité générant de l’income n’est pas sans risque et il est extrêmement important de savoir dans quoi on met les pieds, on va y revenir un peu plus tard dans ce thread.\n\n## Histoire\n\nIl y a bientôt 3 ans, des protocoles ont vu le jour en se basant la dessus et en ayant une idée simple, permettre à tout le monde d’échanger n’importe quel token sans passer par un CEX, très simplement et de manière totalement décentralisé.\n\nUn des premiers à sortir de terre fut [@Uniswap](http://twitter.com/Uniswap) , qui est encore aujourd’hui le protocole DeFi qui a le plus gros marketcap, et qui a su innover, inspirer (en bien ou en mal par ailleurs) et ouvert la voix vers l’échange décentralisé ce qu’on appel très concrètement des swaps.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1\\*opOPS4ylG8xkUVAj8BS9pg.png)\n\nDepuis sa création, Uniswap c’est :\n\n* plus de 450 Md de volume\n* plus de 1 Md de fees générés pour les liquidity providers\n* plus de 55k paires crées\n\nCe qui fait de lui un véritable mastodonte du liquidity providing.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*j1xpxn6UIO_pG6oqPZfqPw.png)\n\nAprès uniswap, d’autres protocoles apportant quelque chose de différent sont nés\n\nLe meilleur exemple est probablement sushiswap, qui est encore aujourd’hui le plus gros concurrent à uniswap et qui a su se démarquer par de nombreuses innovations, que ça soit en terme d’expérience utilisateur, d’incentives au liquidity providing, de déploiement croisschain…\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*p_4h-wS-19aeznUVlssd4A.jpeg)\n\nD’autres, en partant d’un fork d’uniswap, ont su se développer et apporter leur propre innovations au fil du temps, c’est le cas notamment de PancakeSwap, qui a connu ses heures de gloire et est encore la référence sur la bsc.\n\n## Limites des LP\n\nLe soucis essentiel de ces protocoles est que devenir LP est souvent un jeu dangereux pour le provider, que cela demande une très bonne connaissance et que si il y a des APR/Y a 2 chiffres voir 3 il y a également un risque associé.\n\nDevenir LP, c’est effectivement quelque chose qui peut être très bénéfique pour un protocole, mais qui peut être extrêmement risqué pour votre capital.\n\nPourquoi ? Comme tous protocoles DeFi il y a des risques inhérents: hack, smart contract exploit, blackswan event, bug d’oracle… c’est pourquoi je vous conseil d’allouer vos fonds sur des plateformes qui ont fait leurs preuves.\n\nLe plus gros risque qui, peut être négligeable sur une stratégie bien maitrisé mais qui peut également surprendre pour un Liquidity Provider débutant c’est bien entendu l’impermanent loss.\n\nNotez également que devenir LP ne vous fait pas devenir invulnérable aux variations du marché, si les assets contenu dans votre pair de liquidité montent, alors la valeur de votre position augmente, et a contrario si le marché baisse, votre position baisse également.\n\nBeaucoup en entendent parler, c’est un terme très barbare, qui peut couter extrêmement cher si on ne connait pas en quoi ça consiste.\n\n## Focus sur l’Impermanent Loss\n\nIl faudrait réaliser un thread entier sur ce concept pour l’explorer complètement, c’est pourquoi je me contenterai de vous l’expliquer très vulgairement et de vous donner un exemple très concret\n\n> Si vous voulez aller plus loin : <https://medium.com/auditless/how-to-calculate-impermanent-loss-full-derivation-803e8b2497b7>\n\nL’impermant loss (IL) c’est tout simplement la différence entre la valeur de votre LP quand vous en sortez et la valeur que vous auriez eu en holdant si vous n’aviez pas déposer dans cette pool de liquidité.\n\nCette différence constitue une perte nette au moment ou vous sortez de votre pool de liquidité.\n\n> Vous pouvez la calculer très simplement ici.\n>\n> <https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/>\n\nPlus concrètement, si on reprend notre exemple avec l’ETH(3k $) et l’USDC(1$), on dépose 1 eth et 3k en usdc dans une pool de liquidité, si demain l’eth est a 5k et qu’on retire notre LP, alors on aura perdu 3.18% de notre position à cause de l’IL.\n\nLa particularité de cette IL, c’est que comme son nom l’indique c’est impermanent, si demain l’eth revient à 3k, et que vous sortez de votre position, alors il n’y aura aucune IL.\n\nNoté également que cela s’applique uniquement quand vous sortez de position, tant que vous êtes dans la pool, la moins value lié à l’IL reste “ latente “.\n\nLe coté insidieux de ce mécanisme est qu’il s’applique à la hausse comme à la baisse, bien que ça soit en général négligeable sur une pool X token / stable.\n\nCela peu rapidement devenir problématique quand vous providez deux tokens volatiles, et plus particulièrement quand un de ces tokens inclue un shitcoin, qui peut très bien faire + 1000% à la hausse comme -99% à la baisse.\n\nPour le petit exemple, un x10 ou un /10 d’une paire shitcoin/stable représente 42,5% d’IL.\n\nPresque la moitié de votre position de perte uniquement à cause de cette IL.\n\nQuelque chose qui est toute fois très intéressant, en minimisant ce risque d’IL reste les pool de stable, comme sur [@CurveFinance](http://twitter.com/CurveFinance) par exemple qui proposent en général un rendement correct pour du stable tout en assurant une IL nulle.\n\nAttention toute fois a bien vous renseigner sur les stable coins que vous providez, car au même titre qu’un asset volatile, si un stable vient à perdre son peg pour x ou y raisons, il y’aura de l’IL à la sortie.\n\nC’est pourquoi je vous conseil de bien vous renseigner, d’établir un plan concret et de vous projeter sur votre perte potentielle avant de prendre part à une pool de liquidité.\n\n## Innovations du secteur\n\nPour pallier à ce phénomène, des protocoles ont essayés d’innover dans le liquidity providing, afin de rendre au maximum bénéfique pour l’utilisateur.\n\nPour se faire, des projets ont commencés par étendre les pools, pour permettre le dépot de 2, 3 ,4 tokens voir plus, pourvoir moduler le ratio initial 50/50, pouvoir faire par exemple un 20 / 80.C’est ce qu’on retrouve sur des protocoles comme [@BalancerLabs](http://twitter.com/BalancerLabs) ou [Rari Capital](https://medium.com/u/be5c2f03de20?source=post_page-----f95b299dc31-----------------------------------)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BS0MOoYe5SDL5Hj7oEDsIw.png)\n\n## Focus sur Uni V3\n\nD’autres ont essayés de repenser le système, c’est le cas notamment de la V3 d’uniswap qui permet de cibler la liquidité que l’on fourni en définissant une borne — et une borne + sur notre position, ainsi on maximise les fees récoltés, et on a une idée claire de l’IL potentielle.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*AVnFZKf3WqXzljlfONB_AA.jpeg)\n\nReprenons notre exemple de pool ETH/USDC, vous décidez d’apporter de la liquidité sur uni V3, vous définissez votre borne — a 2600$ et votre borne + à 3500$, vous diluez donc votre liquidité dans ce range et non dans un range de 0 à + ∞ comme c’est le cas pour les LP classiques.\n\nSi l’eth sort de ce range, alors votre position n’est plus active, et vous ne récoltez plus de fees.\n\nVotre position est également intégralement converti en eth si le prix descend en dessous de 2k6$, et en usdc si le prix monte au dessus de 3k5$, si par la suite le prix revient dans votre range, votre position et de nouveau active.\n\nUni V3 peut être extrêmement bénéfique pour les personnes ayant une expériences en AT, qui sont capables de bien anticiper des mouvements de marché, et surtout de situer les phases de range.\n\nMais cela demande de l’expérience, des essais, à noter également que si vous voulez changez votre range, il faut annuler la première et en faire une nouvelle, ce qui signifie du gaz en plus, et l’IL de la sortie de position.\n\nLa V3 d’uniswap a également ouvert la voie pour des protocoles spécialisés dans la gestion de liquidité, qui manage et optimise votre position, des solutions extrêmement intéressantes pour des protocoles qui voudraient optimiser leur liquidité.\n\n[@VisorFinance](http://twitter.com/VisorFinance)\n\n[@lixirfinance](http://twitter.com/lixirfinance)\n\n## Liquidity as a service\n\nLa dernière innovation que j’aimerai aborder ici c’est le “liquidity as a service”.\n\n42% des personnes qui entrent sur une pool de farming y restent moins de 24h, au bout de 3 jours, environ 70% des personnes sont out de leur pool.\n\n> [Source : https://www.nansen.ai/research/all-hail-masterchef-analysing-yield-farming-activity](https://www.nansen.ai/research/all-hail-masterchef-analysing-yield-farming-activity)\n\nC’est donc un très gros problème, le capital est très loin d’être géré de manière efficiente.\n\nPour un protocole qui est en recherche de croissance, d’autres des soucis se posent.\n\nEn règle général, pour attirer du capital, les protocoles proposent en plus des fees tirés des différentes pools, de récompenser les fournisseurs de liquidités avec des tokens natifs du protocole.\n\nC’est ce qu’on appelle le liquidity mining, ce qui constitue une sell pressure supplémentaire pour les gens qui profitent des rewards boostés et ce n’est pas durable, ce qui signifie que lorsque les rewards vont baissés, les LP vont juste partir à la recherche d’une nouvelle pool.\n\nProblème supplémentaire, quand le marché à tendance à corriger voir crash, les LP vont très probablement sortir le plus rapidement possible de leur pool, et paradoxalement c’est à ce moment la que le protocole a besoin le plus de liquidité pour garantir une stabilité des prix.\n\nC’est pour pallier à tous ces problèmes que des projets extrêmement novateurs ont cherchés d’autres solutions.\n\nC’est le cas notamment d’[@Olympus](http://twitter.com/Olympus), avec sa feature “pro” qui souhaite accompagner les protocoles dans l’acquisition de leur propre liquidité, stabiliser au mieux le prix de leur token natif, gagner en attractivité et en possibilité de génération de yield.\n\nComment ? Grace à un système de bonds très ingénieux, qui permet au protocole de capter de la liquidité tout en proposant un bénéfice pour les acheteurs de bonds.\n\n> Plus d’infos ici : <https://twitter.com/kaiznxyz/status/1405929382494064651>\n\nEncore un autre exemple avec un autre protocole très big brain, qui a mis en place de nombreux mécanismes pour optimiser au mieux la liquidité capté.\n\n[@TokenReactor](http://twitter.com/TokenReactor)\n\nLes devoirs 📚 :\n\n[https://medium.com/crypto-wisdom/dex-decentralized-exchange-simplified-61ff0fc640dd](https://medium.com/crypto-wisdom/dex-decentralized-exchange-simplified-61ff0fc640dd)\n\n[https://docs.uniswap.org/](https://docs.uniswap.org/)\n\n[https://kushgoyal.com/uniswap-v3-expalined-concentrated-liquidity/](https://kushgoyal.com/uniswap-v3-expalined-concentrated-liquidity/)\n\n[https://chainbulletin.com/impermanent-loss-explained-with-examples-math/](https://chainbulletin.com/impermanent-loss-explained-with-examples-math/)\n\n[https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro/](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro/)\n\nLes outils utiles 🛠️ :\n\n[https://defiyield.info/advanced-impermanent-loss-calculator](https://defiyield.info/advanced-impermanent-loss-calculator)\n\n[https://revert.finance/](https://revert.finance/)\n\n[https://zapper.fi/fr](https://zapper.fi/fr)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPour conclure, devenir liquidity provider peut être très bénéfique et peut permettre de générer un revenu passif conséquent, cependant attention à bien vous renseigner sur les plateformes que vous utilisez,les mécanismes de LP, les tokens et leurs volatilités.\n\nIl n’y a pas de recette magique, pour des LP “classiques” 3–4 chiffres d’apy s’explique par :\n\n* Il n’y a personne sur la pool.\n* C’est une pair de shitcoin.\n* Il y a un liquidity mining très agressif.\n* Le protocole empile des stratégies de farming\n\n**La solution miracle n’a pas encore était trouvé en matière de liquidity providing, mais l’innovation dans ce secteur au combien important pour la DeFi est omniprésente et nul doute qu’un jour provide de la liquidité sera quelque chose d’optimisé pour le protocole et le provider.**\n\n**Faites bien vos devoirs avant d’investir, surtout quand cet investissement représente la majeure partie de votre capitale que vous souhaitez faire travailler.**", "timestamp": 1636715949, "digest": "cGnw1qbtokx3oRORUM68MfwzY9ulh-pm4E-0F8jaEV8", "contributor": "0x4e486E7eee27500b8851d63d003119c4DA4825f6"}

Pour devenir LP, il suffit d’ allouer 50% d’un token A (ETH) et 50% d’un token B(USDC) dans une pool de liquidité, ou d’en créer une.\n\nUne fois ceci effectué, le DEX va manager votre position de manière à permettre les échanges pour les gens qui veulent exécuter un swap et en même temps veiller à l’équité stricte de votre position, le ratio 50/50 doit toujours être maintenu, peut importe les variations de prix.\n\nVous touchez ensuite une commission sur les swaps effectuer sur votre paire, qui peut être fixe ou variable en fonction du protocole et vous pouvez être en + récompenser par le protocole pour avoir apporté de la liquidité, ce qui constitue votre revenu passif et votre % d’APR.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*3bATB26z3GEaxGRJjln-2Q.png)\n\nUne question vous vient peut être, comment un protocole décentralisé peut il être aussi proche du cours réel, et des prix qu’affichent un CEX comme Ftx, Binance…\n\nLa justification est simple, l’arbitrage, quand un gap se creuse entre le prix d’un Dex et le prix d’un Cex, des personnes viennent naturellement le combler en effectuant un swap et viennent chercher un premium, qui correspond à la différence de prix entre le DEX et le CEX.\n\nCet apport de liquidité générant de l’income n’est pas sans risque et il est extrêmement important de savoir dans quoi on met les pieds, on va y revenir un peu plus tard dans ce thread.\n\n## Histoire\n\nIl y a bientôt 3 ans, des protocoles ont vu le jour en se basant la dessus et en ayant une idée simple, permettre à tout le monde d’échanger n’importe quel token sans passer par un CEX, très simplement et de manière totalement décentralisé.\n\nUn des premiers à sortir de terre fut [@Uniswap](http://twitter.com/Uniswap) , qui est encore aujourd’hui le protocole DeFi qui a le plus gros marketcap, et qui a su innover, inspirer (en bien ou en mal par ailleurs) et ouvert la voix vers l’échange décentralisé ce qu’on appel très concrètement des swaps.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1\\*opOPS4ylG8xkUVAj8BS9pg.png)\n\nDepuis sa création, Uniswap c’est :\n\n* + de 450 Md de volume\n* + de 1 Md de fees générés pour les liquidity providers\n* + de55k paires crées\n\nCe qui fait de lui un véritable mastodonte du liquidity providing.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*j1xpxn6UIO_pG6oqPZfqPw.png)\n\nAprès uniswap, d’autres protocoles apportant quelque chose de différent sont nés\n\nLe meilleur exemple est probablement sushiswap, qui est encore aujourd’hui le plus gros concurrent à uniswap et qui a su se démarquer par de nombreuses innovations, que ça soit en terme d’expérience utilisateur, d’incentives au liquidity providing, de déploiement croisschain…\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*p_4h-wS-19aeznUVlssd4A.jpeg)\n\nD’autres, en partant d’un fork d’uniswap, ont su se développer et apporter leur propre innovations au fil du temps, c’est le cas notamment de PancakeSwap, qui a connu ses heures de gloire et est encore la référence sur la bsc.\n\n## Limites des LP\n\nLe soucis essentiel de ces protocoles est que devenir LP est souvent un jeu dangereux pour le provider, que cela demande une très bonne connaissance et que si il y a des APR/Y a 2 chiffres voir 3 il y a également un risque associé.\n\nDevenir LP, c’est effectivement quelque chose qui peut être très bénéfique pour un protocole, mais qui peut être extrêmement risqué pour votre capital.\n\nPourquoi ? Comme tous protocoles DeFi il y a des risques inhérents: hack, smart contract exploit, blackswan event, bug d’oracle… c’est pourquoi je vous conseil d’allouer vos fonds sur des plateformes qui ont fait leurs preuves.\n\nLe plus gros risque qui, peut être négligeable sur une stratégie bien maitrisé mais qui peut également surprendre pour un Liquidity Provider débutant c’est bien entendu l’impermanent loss.\n\nNotez également que devenir LP ne vous fait pas devenir invulnérable aux variations du marché, si les assets contenu dans votre pair de liquidité montent, alors la valeur de votre position augmente, et a contrario si le marché baisse, votre position baisse également.\n\nBeaucoup en entendent parler, c’est un terme très barbare, qui peut couter extrêmement cher si on ne connait pas en quoi ça consiste.\n\n## Focus sur l’Impermanent Loss\n\nIl faudrait réaliser un thread entier sur ce concept pour l’explorer complètement, c’est pourquoi je me contenterai de vous l’expliquer très vulgairement et de vous donner un exemple très concret\n\n> Si vous voulez aller plus loin : <https://medium.com/auditless/how-to-calculate-impermanent-loss-full-derivation-803e8b2497b7>\n\nL’impermant loss (IL) c’est tout simplement la différence entre la valeur de votre LP quand vous en sortez et la valeur que vous auriez eu en holdant si vous n’aviez pas déposer dans cette pool de liquidité.\n\nCette différence constitue une perte nette au moment ou vous sortez de votre pool de liquidité.\n\n> Vous pouvez la calculer très simplement ici.\n>\n> <https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/>\n\nPlus concrètement, si on reprend notre exemple avec l’ETH(3k $) et l’USDC(1$), on dépose 1 eth et 3k en usdc dans une pool de liquidité, si demain l’eth est a 5k et qu’on retire notre LP, alors on aura perdu 3.18% de notre position à cause de l’IL.\n\nLa particularité de cette IL, c’est que comme son nom l’indique c’est impermanent, si demain l’eth revient à 3k, et que vous sortez de votre position, alors il n’y aura aucune IL.\n\nNoté également que cela s’applique uniquement quand vous sortez de position, tant que vous êtes dans la pool, la moins value lié à l’IL reste “ latente “.\n\nLe coté insidieux de ce mécanisme est qu’il s’applique à la hausse comme à la baisse, bien que ça soit en général négligeable sur une pool X token / stable.\n\nCela peu rapidement devenir problématique quand vous providez deux tokens volatiles, et plus particulièrement quand un de ces tokens inclue un shitcoin, qui peut très bien faire + 1000% à la hausse comme -99% à la baisse.\n\nPour le petit exemple, un x10 ou un /10 d’une paire shitcoin/stable représente 42,5% d’IL.\n\nPresque la moitié de votre position de perte uniquement à cause de cette IL.\n\nQuelque chose qui est toute fois très intéressant, en minimisant ce risque d’IL reste les pool de stable, comme sur [@CurveFinance](http://twitter.com/CurveFinance) par exemple qui proposent en général un rendement correct pour du stable tout en assurant une IL nulle.\n\nAttention toute fois a bien vous renseigner sur les stable coins que vous providez, car au même titre qu’un asset volatile, si un stable vient à perdre son peg pour x ou y raisons, il y’aura de l’IL à la sortie.\n\nC’est pourquoi je vous conseil de bien vous renseigner, d’établir un plan concret et de vous projeter sur votre perte potentielle avant de prendre part à une pool de liquidité.\n\n## Innovations du secteur\n\nPour pallier à ce phénomène, des protocoles ont essayés d’innover dans le liquidity providing, afin de rendre au maximum bénéfique pour l’utilisateur.\n\nPour se faire, des projets ont commencés par étendre les pools, pour permettre le dépot de 2, 3 ,4 tokens voir plus, pourvoir moduler le ratio initial 50/50, pouvoir faire par exemple un 20 / 80.C’est ce qu’on retrouve sur des protocoles comme [@BalancerLabs](http://twitter.com/BalancerLabs) ou [Rari Capital](https://medium.com/u/be5c2f03de20?source=post_page-----f95b299dc31-----------------------------------)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BS0MOoYe5SDL5Hj7oEDsIw.png)\n\n## Focus sur Uni V3\n\nD’autres ont essayés de repenser le système, c’est le cas notamment de la V3 d’uniswap qui permet de cibler la liquidité que l’on fourni en définissant une borne — et une borne + sur notre position, ainsi on maximise les fees récoltés, et on a une idée claire de l’IL potentielle.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*AVnFZKf3WqXzljlfONB_AA.jpeg)\n\nReprenons notre exemple de pool ETH/USDC, vous décidez d’apporter de la liquidité sur uni V3, vous définissez votre borne — a 2600$ et votre borne + à 3500$, vous diluez donc votre liquidité dans ce range et non dans un range de 0 à + ∞ comme c’est le cas pour les LP classiques.\n\nSi l’eth sort de ce range, alors votre position n’est plus active, et vous ne récoltez plus de fees.\n\nVotre position est également intégralement converti en eth si le prix descend en dessous de 2k6$, et en usdc si le prix monte au dessus de 3k5$, si par la suite le prix revient dans votre range, votre position et de nouveau active.\n\nUni V3 peut être extrêmement bénéfique pour les personnes ayant une expériences en AT, qui sont capables de bien anticiper des mouvements de marché, et surtout de situer les phases de range.\n\nMais cela demande de l’expérience, des essais, à noter également que si vous voulez changez votre range, il faut annuler la première et en faire une nouvelle, ce qui signifie du gaz en plus, et l’IL de la sortie de position.\n\nLa V3 d’uniswap a également ouvert la voie pour des protocoles spécialisés dans la gestion de liquidité, qui manage et optimise votre position, des solutions extrêmement intéressantes pour des protocoles qui voudraient optimiser leur liquidité.\n\n[@VisorFinance](http://twitter.com/VisorFinance)\n\n[@lixirfinance](http://twitter.com/lixirfinance)\n\n## Liquidity as a service\n\nLa dernière innovation que j’aimerai aborder ici c’est le “liquidity as a service”.\n\n42% des personnes qui entrent sur une pool de farming y restent moins de 24h, au bout de 3 jours, environ 70% des personnes sont out de leur pool.\n\n> [Source : https://www.nansen.ai/research/all-hail-masterchef-analysing-yield-farming-activity](https://www.nansen.ai/research/all-hail-masterchef-analysing-yield-farming-activity)\n\nC’est donc un très gros problème, le capital est très loin d’être géré de manière efficiente.\n\nPour un protocole qui est en recherche de croissance, d’autres des soucis se posent.\n\nEn règle général, pour attirer du capital, les protocoles proposent en plus des fees tirés des différentes pools, de récompenser les fournisseurs de liquidités avec des tokens natifs du protocole.\n\nC’est ce qu’on appelle le liquidity mining, ce qui constitue une sell pressure supplémentaire pour les gens qui profitent des rewards boostés et ce n’est pas durable, ce qui signifie que lorsque les rewards vont baissés, les LP vont juste partir à la recherche d’une nouvelle pool.\n\nProblème supplémentaire, quand le marché à tendance à corriger voir crash, les LP vont très probablement sortir le plus rapidement possible de leur pool, et paradoxalement c’est à ce moment la que le protocole a besoin le plus de liquidité pour garantir une stabilité des prix.\n\nC’est pour pallier à tous ces problèmes que des projets extrêmement novateurs ont cherchés d’autres solutions.\n\nC’est le cas notamment d’[@Olympus](http://twitter.com/Olympus), avec sa feature “pro” qui souhaite accompagner les protocoles dans l’acquisition de leur propre liquidité, stabiliser au mieux le prix de leur token natif, gagner en attractivité et en possibilité de génération de yield.\n\nComment ? Grace à un système de bonds très ingénieux, qui permet au protocole de capter de la liquidité tout en proposant un bénéfice pour les acheteurs de bonds.\n\n> Plus d’infos ici : <https://twitter.com/kaiznxyz/status/1405929382494064651>\n\nEncore un autre exemple avec un autre protocole très big brain, qui a mis en place de nombreux mécanismes pour optimiser au mieux la liquidité capté.\n\n[@TokenReactor](http://twitter.com/TokenReactor)\n\nLes devoirs 📚 :\n\n[https://medium.com/crypto-wisdom/dex-decentralized-exchange-simplified-61ff0fc640dd](https://medium.com/crypto-wisdom/dex-decentralized-exchange-simplified-61ff0fc640dd)\n\n[https://docs.uniswap.org/](https://docs.uniswap.org/)\n\n[https://kushgoyal.com/uniswap-v3-expalined-concentrated-liquidity/](https://kushgoyal.com/uniswap-v3-expalined-concentrated-liquidity/)\n\n[https://chainbulletin.com/impermanent-loss-explained-with-examples-math/](https://chainbulletin.com/impermanent-loss-explained-with-examples-math/)\n\n[https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro/](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro/)\n\nLes outils utiles 🛠️ :\n\n[https://defiyield.info/advanced-impermanent-loss-calculator](https://defiyield.info/advanced-impermanent-loss-calculator)\n\n[https://revert.finance/](https://revert.finance/)\n\n[https://zapper.fi/fr](https://zapper.fi/fr)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPour conclure, devenir liquidity provider peut être très bénéfique et peut permettre de générer un revenu passif conséquent, cependant attention à bien vous renseigner sur les plateformes que vous utilisez,les mécanismes de LP, les tokens et leurs volatilités.\n\nIl n’y a pas de recette magique, pour des LP “classiques” 3–4 chiffres d’apy s’explique par :\n\n* Il n’y a personne sur la pool.\n* C’est une pair de shitcoin.\n* Il y a un liquidity mining très agressif.\n* Le protocole empile des stratégies de farming\n\n**La solution miracle n’a pas encore était trouvé en matière de liquidity providing, mais l’innovation dans ce secteur au combien important pour la DeFi est omniprésente et nul doute qu’un jour provide de la liquidité sera quelque chose d’optimisé pour le protocole et le provider.**\n\n**Faites bien vos devoirs avant d’investir, surtout quand cet investissement représente la majeure partie de votre capitale que vous souhaitez faire travailler.**", "timestamp": 1636715914, "digest": "cGnw1qbtokx3oRORUM68MfwzY9ulh-pm4E-0F8jaEV8", "contributor": "0x4e486E7eee27500b8851d63d003119c4DA4825f6"}

After all, in our cognition, ability is a very important factor in work.\n\nIf you have this question, you might as well take a look at the following story with me.\nFrom a female cleaner.\n\nA girl from Northeast China moved to Japan with her family when she was 17 years old.\n\nBecause she had no education, she became a cleaner with a lower threshold.\n\nShe is a language barrier, so she is squeezed out at work.\n\nDirty and exhausting work that others don’t want to do, throw it to her;\n\nShe was always the first to be suspected of things lost in the office.\n\nIn such a situation, she did not give up on herself, but settled down and devoted all her energy to work.\n\nCleaning is a very meticulous task. In order to check whether she has been cleaned, she often lay on the ground in disregard of her image and observe whether there is dust on the floor with bright light.\n\nWhen cleaning the toilet, she used a small mirror to check for dirt on the inside.\nThis job is also very demanding on physical strength.\n\nIn order to exercise, she goes to climb he stairs every day.\n\nWhen she arrives at the office, she will take out a pair of 5 kg dumbbells to exercise her wrists and abdominal muscles, once in the morning and once in the evening.\n\nCleaning is boring, but she treats it as a subject.\n\nShe can quickly analyze the causes of stains on the use of more than 80 cleaners on the market, and know which cleaner to use by looking at the stains.\n\nWith the ultimate pursuit of work, she was named \"Japanese National Treasure Craftsman\" in 2016.\n\nHer name is Haruko Shintsu. She is engaged in cleaning work, but she has become a well-known star in Japan.\nLet's go back to the research results of Harvard University.\n\nThe elements of a person's success cannot be generalized, but the \"attitude\" is indispensable.\n\nPeople with a bad attitude will continue to internalize themselves;\n\nPeople with good attitude will keep improving themselves. \n\nOver time, the life gap between these two types of people will naturally gradually widen. \n\nWhen a person knows how to adjust himself in time, his work status will be better and better, and the road of life will be smoother and smoother.\n```", "timestamp": 1636718018, "digest": "uMOkLIGu0Qnulovm_K6ukcqjFeQ5A25plIM1HX_OdCE", "contributor": "0xCFDbCCA0febF0856216bB8feE56cfd17357176d1"}

Analyses & infographics unpack the capabilities of Ethereum-based DAOs as provided by DAO Launchers and Tools.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDAOs are maturing. From social movements to financial exchanges, from legal documents to applicative science – DAOs have been seriously engaged by all such endeavors, and many more, whilst still fastly developing and expanding. \n\nWithin this article, we offer an analysis of two important components of the DAO space: **DAO launchers** and **DAO tools. \n  \n DAO launchers** are platforms that allow easy deployment of blockchain-native organizations to govern over agreements, funds, ownership, and more. “Launchers” here may be siloed products (e.g., Aragon Govern) or compositions of tools that frequently serve to create DAOs. **DAO tools** may complement launcher-endowed capabilities with additional features such as accounting, analytics, identity, etc. \n  \n Such **DAOs Capabilities** are therefore our basic building block, the unit of analysis. The concept of ‘Building Block’ is a *prime* crypto primitive. It is inherent to blockchain technology and to programming in general. Some of its more popular implementations include ‘money legos’, ‘governance legos’, blockchain layers, shared coding, etc. And it is also common in the terminology of virtually all DAO launchers reviewed here. Thus, we stand on firm grounds when we aim to present DAOs’ capabilities as DAOspace building blocks while maintaining their launcher/tool original context.\n\n### What Might a DAO Do? \n\n**DAOs** can be modeled as the composition of typical building blocks, and specifically: (1) a means of sensing the collective will of a group of stakeholders & arriving at decisions (i.e. Governance); and (2) the ability to actuate its governance decisions - the most common way is through tokenizing decision-making over a Treasury, which enhances not just simple trade, but also incentivized trust-minimal cooperation towards collective DAO goals.\n\n**DAO Launchers** are functional frameworks that get DAOs up and running through a convenient and transparent platform. As detailed below, different DAO launchers endow DAOs with different sets of capabilities. Deploying a DAO without a launcher pack is possible, but it may demand specific skills that most communities (and even excellent programmers) do not effortlessly wield.\n\n**DAO Tools** are modules that may help a team to create bespoke, custom-made DAOs - or can be used to supplement or enhance DAOs created through other Launchers. For example, snapshot + gnosis safe + an oracle is effectively the same implementation as Gnosis SafeSnap (Reality) Launcher. By combining this setup with Kleros, a decentralized arbitration tool, the DAO can introduce a Ricardian Contract directing the behavior of arbitrators, which may add decentralized checks and balances to pure token voting. Such a Ricardian clause might be, for example, “for the period of one year, no governance proposal shall be passed that distributes the treasury to token holders”.\n\n## Potential Unpacked: DAO capabilities by launchers and tools\n\nThe infographics ahead stand to present DAO launchers and DAO tools by the capabilities they endow DAOs to run their day-to-day.\n\n### The Space\n\nThe first infographic, below, is a zoom-out display of reviewed launchers and tools. It is shaped similarly a doughnut to represent an Ethereum DAO universe. DAO launchers have emerged from the blockchain space as planet-DAO factories, followed suit by a belt of orbiting DAO tools, mostly bound by Ethereum gravity but sometimes also space-bridged to other NetVerses, or possibly serve from an inclusive meta-space.\n\nThis space survey is not “complete”: firstly, the scope left out main web2 tools that greatly facilitate DAO communication, content, and community-building, such as [Discord](https://discord.com/) and [Discourse](https://discourse.org) (also serve soft decision-making), [Telegram](https://www.telegram.org) and other forums, [exceptional](https://mirror.xyz/) [blogging](https://medium.com/), [media](https://banklesshq.com/nation/), [events](https://www.thedaoist.co/), and [social networks](https://twitter.com/ethdotorg). Secondly, the DAO space is evolving as we write, with many pre/alpha and otherwise projects that are not displayed. \n All those deserve dedicated complementary research.\n\n![A blockchain is almost always at the heart of a DAO. Ethereum is community-run technology powering thousands of decentralized applications implemented as so-called “Smart Contracts”. As the largest Smart Contract platform, our focus here is on Ethereum, however DAOs (tools and launchers) are increasingly being deployed to other blockchains that support the Ethereum Virtual Machine (primarily due to increasing fees on Ethereum).](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gNk2xLC9YEuGMmWj0tsZM.jpg?height=1207&width=1924)\n\n### The Launch Platforms\n\nThe second infographic unpacks the capabilities offered by DAO Launchers to their created DAOs: what does each launcher bring to the DAO table. Capabilities are color-coded as building blocks (e.g., Proposal system, decision-making modules, Accessibility, etc.), and their specifics are represented by symbols (e.g gas costs: 🙂= average, 😅= high, 😃= low) Followed by short descriptions of each launcher, this layout enhances a comparative Launchers view.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WvbI65euq-t9FWWGN6IrO.jpg?height=1207&width=1924)\n\n* **[Aragon (Client, Govern)](https://aragon.org/):** DAO builder governed by its built DAOs, featuring governance, agent and treasury plugins, scaled voting and cheap “optimistic” execution, dispute resolution network, and more.\n* **[Moloch (v2)](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch):** creates minimalistic viable DAOs that support a variety of profit-driven yet decentralized use cases, including grants, venture funds, and incubators.\n* **[Elastic DAO](https://elasticdao.org/#/):** Inspired by Aragon, Moloch, and others; this launcher creates DAOs that focus on fairness of governance and token distribution to members.\n* **[Colony (v1, v2)](https://colony.io/):** focused on organizational ownership, structure, authority, and financial management, in particular incentivizing active contribution, e.g. through reputation.\n* **[DAO Stack](https://alchemy.daostack.io/):** a modular stack that includes governance protocols and easy-to-use interfaces for creating and managing DAOs.\n* **[Tribute](https://tributedao.com/):** developed by OpenLaw on Moloch, this is a DAO factory with native Legal and  NFT capabilities, designed to freely add adaptors and extensions. \n* **Zodiac [Reality](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-reality/get-started/) Module (fka SafeSnap):** Popular Snapshot off-chain, token-based voting + popular Gnosis on-chain treasury safe = popular DAO launching pack, added modularity.\n* **[Compound (Finance) Governance](https://compound.finance/docs/governance):** (Governor Alpha / Bravo): a governance Token, token-weighted voting (by Governor), and Timelock execution delay, delegation, and emergency functions. Adopted by main(ly) DeFi DAOs.\n\n### The Tools\n\nThe third infographic is an outline of DAO tools. It presents the DAO sun at the center, and its tool-planets hovering around it.

Full listings of DAOs from all major DAO platforms for financial, social, and governance data visualization.\n\n### An Ever-Expanding Universe\n\nWithin a hyper-connected decentralized human network that stands for open-source code and ideas, innovation and iteration move at the speed of light. Thus, next to the platforms and tools already in use, many others are being developed as we write. Here are some of those up-and-coming tools:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1KVrMfJC_zWQ2jS2iAe4e.jpg?height=1207&width=1924)\n\n* **[Prime Deals](https://www.prime.xyz/deals) -** The Interface for DAO to DAO interactions, such as token swaps, co-liquidity provision, and joint venture formation. \n* **[Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/home) -** On-chain payment flows.

Moreover, serial open-stack DAO factories seem to be a growing trend (consider tokenized communities, legal smart contracts, DAOHaus, Colony, Tribute).  \n\nAs the infographics show, launchers already offer various DAO governance suites, module stacks, governance blockchains, sandboxes, and other infrastructure. DAO tools likewise evolve and diversify, covering more and more use cases for DAOs’ needs. \n\nMuch like mapping the DAOspace by DAO trades, goals, industries, or AUMs, the representation of the DAOspace as a lego of DAO capabilities offers a lens, a meaning-making layer of our common environment. \n  \n It is yet to be seen how further the DAOspace would explore open interoperable building-blocks, and what other paths for DAO tooling may look like. As the ecosystem and its tools continue to multiply and diversify, we believe that DAOs may benefit from building-blocks research such as nuanced investigations into typical capability modules, the applicability of DAO legos, analysis of governance trends, and beyond!\n\n*This is a work in progress: We are eager to continue exploring the DAO space and include more projects. Any contribution, comment, and insight are much appreciated. **On Discord: **[The DAOist](https://discord.gg/TRs96UjbAY), [DeepDAO](https://discord.gg/zrwtHyHa), and [PrimeDAO](https://discord.gg/jHucYpNa)*\n\nWe thank the good advice received from reviewers, and for the happy collaboration with The DAOist which brings this article up on Mirror!** \n **\n\n**Research & writing** \n\nNoam Hofstadter, analyst & researcher, [DeepDAO.io](http://deepdao.io)\n\nRuben Russel, web3 Researcher and UI/UX designer, [Kolektivo Labs](https://www.kolektivolabs.co/) / [PrimeDAO](https://prime.xyz/)\n\nNuma Oliveira, artist, researcher & comms [Kolektivo Labs](https://www.kolektivolabs.co/) / [PrimeDAO](https://prime.xyz/)\n\nMarek, blockchain researcher & advisor, [Open DeFi DAO](https://www.opendefi.network/)\n\n**Graphic Art** \n\nCatarina Horn, graphic designer & illustrator, [Kolektivo Labs](https://www.kolektivolabs.co/)\n\n[split://0x5e71678B1B2677ef120082A0FF66342c7dbbA6Bc](split://0x5e71678B1B2677ef120082A0FF66342c7dbbA6Bc)\n\n \n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1636720265, "digest": "FfzZ8NnWdb5ygJu13mLi9PdWoGqaoKSm8mJoRIi3GJI", "contributor": "0x11c8613b3Aa83269fcad7d2F34D2250b8380A285"}

{"id": "r9g9Or3voEfyDD79l5X_d5Jn_E_WdDGxpbBihwRRuJ8", "title": "信任的模式", "body": "对于许多区块链应用来说，免信任性都是最重要的特征之一。所谓的免信任性，就是应用的正常工作不以特定参与者按特定方式行事为前提，即使他们将来会在利益的驱使下做出意料之外的举动（也不能使应用的工作状况脱离预期）。区块链应用永远不可能实现完全免信任，但是有一些应用在免信任程度上远远高于另一些项目。如果我们想要朝着信任最小化迈出坚实的步伐，就得先辨别出信任程度的高低。\n\n首先，我个人对信任的定义很简单：信任就是对其他人行为的假设。在疫情爆发前，你不会因为害怕别人突然捅你一刀而与刻意跟他人保持两米的距离。这就是一种信任：一方面是信任他人不会暴走，另一方面是信任法律制度对违法犯罪行为的约束力。当你运行其他人写的一段代码时，你相信他们是诚实的（不管是从人品的角度，还是从经济利益的角度），至少有足够多的人对这段代码进行过审计，知道里面没有 bug 。不自己种菜也是一种信任：相信会有足够多的人为了赚钱而生产粮食。你可以信任不同群体，信任的类型也多种多样。\n\n为了分析区块链协议，我会将信任拆解成四个维度：\n\n你需要多少人如你预期的那样行事？总参与人数有多少？需要这些人出于什么动机如你预期的那样行事？需要他们是利他主义者，还是唯利是图者？是否需要避免他们之间产生协同？如果这些假设被打破了，对系统的破坏有多大？现在，先让我们聚焦于前两个问题。通过下图，我们可以更加直观地看出：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FrvFk1VI4BQOTmUlCilQv.png?height=567&width=640)\n\n绿色越深表示越健康。让我们详细分析以下几种情况：\n\n1 : 1：整个系统只有一个参与者。如果这名参与者确实如你预期的那样行事，系统就会正常运行。这就是传统的 “中心化” 模型，也是我们所要超越的模型。\nN : N：“反乌托邦” 世界。系统中的所有参与者都要如你预期的那样行事，系统才能正常运行，如果有任意参与者失败，那也没有备份方案。\nN/2 : N：这是区块链的运作方式 —— 如果大部分矿工（或 PoS 验证者）是诚实的，区块链就能正常运作。要注意的是，N 越大，N/2 就越有价值。相比只由少量矿工/验证者控制的区块链，矿工/验证者广泛分布的网络有趣得多。尽管如此，我们依然想要获得更高的安全性，因为还有 51% 攻击的问题存在。\n1 : N：在众多参与者中，只要有一名参与者如你预期的那样行事，整个系统就能正常运行。任何基于欺诈证明的系统都属于这一类。可信设置也是如此，不过在可信设置中，N 通常较小。要注意的是，N 越大越好！\n极少数 : N：在众多参与者中，只要有达到固定人数的小部分参与者如你预期的那样行事，整个系统就能正常运行。数据可用性检查（data availability check）就属于这一类。\n0 : N：系统无需依赖外部参与者即可正常运行。自我验证区块有效性就属于这一类。\n尽管除 “0 : N” 之外的模型都是建立在 “信任” 基础上的，但是这些模型之间存在巨大差异！相信某个特定的人（组织）会如你所预期的那样行事，和相信任何一个人都会如你所预期的那样行事，二者之间有着天壤之别。相比 “N/2 : N” 和 “1 : 1”，“1 : N” 与 “0 : N” 更为接近。或许有人会觉得 “1 : N” 模型与 “1 : 1” 模型很像，因为这两种系统都依赖一名参与者，但实际上它们之间迥然不同：在 “1 : N” 系统中，如果这名参与者消失或作恶，换一名参与者即可；如果是 “1 : 1” 系统，你就只能束手无策。\n\n尤其要注意的是，即使是你正在运行的软件，其正确性通常也取决于 “极少数 : N” 信任模型，以此确保软件代码出现 bug 时，会有人及时发现。在了解这一事实后，你就会发现，努力从 “1 : N” 模型转向 “0 : N” 模型如同为敞开窗户的房子安装防盗门。\n\n另一个重要的区别在于，如果你的信任假设被打破，对系统的破坏有多大？在区块链上，最常见的两种故障类型是活性故障（liveness failure）和安全性故障（safety failure）。活性故障就是你暂时无法进行操作（例如，提币、将交易打包进区块、读取链上数据）。安全性故障就是出现了系统想要预防的情况（例如，无效块被添加到区块链上）。\n\n以下列举了一些区块链 Layer 2 协议所采用的信任模型。我使用 “small N” 来指代 layer 2 系统本身的参与者集合，“big N” 来指代底层区块链的参与者。我的假设是 Layer 2 的社区总是小于其底层区块链的社区。另外，我所谓的 “活性故障” 特指代币长时间卡住的情况。无法使用系统但能即时提款的情况不算作活性故障。\n\nChannel 类（包括状态通道、闪电网络等）：使用 “1 : 1” 信任模型来确保活性（你的交易对手可以暂时冻结你的资金，不过你可以将资金分散到多个通道中，从而减轻负面影响），“N/2 : big N” 模型来确保安全性（攻击者可以通过 51% 攻击来偷走你的资金）。\nPlasma（采用中心化运营方）：使用 “1 : 1” 模型来确保活性（运营者可以临时冻结你的资金），“N/2 : big N” 模型来确保安全性（攻击者可以通过 51% 攻击来偷走你的资金）。\nPlasma（采用半中心化运营方，如 DPOS）：使用 “N/2 : small N” 模型来确保活性，“N/2 : big N” 模型来确保安全性。\nOptimistic rollup：使用 “1 : 1” 或 “N/2 : small N” 模型来确保活性（取决于运营者的类型），“N/2 : big N” 模型来确保安全性。\nZK rollup：使用 “1 ：small N” 模型来确保活性（如果运营者未能打包你的交易，你可以取回你的资金，如果运营者没有立即打包你的取款交易，就无法打包更多交易，你可以在 rollup 系统中任何一个全节点的帮助下自行提款。）；不存在安全性故障风险。\nZK rollup（轻取款增强型）：不存在活性故障风险和安全性故障风险。\n最后是关于激励的问题：为了达到预期的效果，你所信任的参与者需要非常利他主义，一般利他主义，还是理性主义？默认情况下，“欺诈证明” 需要参与者是利他主义的，但是程度如何取决于计算的复杂性（详见 “验证者困境” ），而且有很多方法可以修改规则，使之变得理性。\n\n如果我们增加一种方式来支付服务费，那么帮助他人从 ZK rollup 上取款的行为就是理性的，因此没必要担心无法退出 rollup 的问题。与此同时，如果整个社区都同意 不接受通过 51% 攻击创建的区块链（将交易历史回滚到很久之前，或审查很久之前的区块），就可以减轻其它系统的风险。\n\n结论：如果你听到有人说某个系统 “依赖于信任”，一定要问清楚！这个系统是 “1 : 1” 模型、“1 : N” 模型还是 “N/2 : N” 模型？这个系统需要参与者是利他主义还是理性主义？如果是利他主义，参与者需要付出多大代价？如果假设被打破，那么你需要等待多久才能取回自己的资金？几个小时？几天？还是永远无法取回？搞清楚了这些问题，你才能决定要不要使用这个系统。\n\n原文链接:\n\n<https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/08/20/trust.html>\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1636720227, "digest": "lFHiXn8BWV72L_iXTd7CqoK-LKCZbzL86jzmv9cCrbo", "contributor": "0x29ec474ECb12f9930033d40e23f0e3946257FA56"}

{"id": "AJeDAPPV3wn4tYFz_EHzXFIhr_GHWXxQ6m93sQG_1nA", "title": "Crypto-monetizing music on Discord with tone, WVRPS' generative audiovisual NFTs, geniuscorp & hic et nunc radio", "body": "In last week’s MUSIC x Web3 [roundup](https://musicx.mirror.xyz/HXmpxbz-pNZb_OGHcJOj0mOIhHZXTfCXhPNe_t8Bfdc), I quipped that I could write these on a weekly basis. The two main topics I’m currently most engaged with in music are community and web3, so LFG: another week, another roundup.\n\n## sone’s tone Discord music bot\n\n**tone** is a music bot for Discord that’s designed to pay artists. It’s being developed by the **[sone](http://sone.works/)**[ DAO](http://sone.works/), which was kicked off by members of the **[Topshelf Records](https://www.topshelfrecords.com/)** team and is exploring what a record label can be in the new web3 context.\n\n*Edit, Nov 12: at time of writing, tone is a work-in-progress. An MVP exists on the sone DAO Discord.*\n\nThe bot takes a metered approach to streaming and collects monthly fees based on usage. It plays music from **SoundCloud** and **Bandcamp** and creates a registry of all music that’s been played, so artists can sign in and claim their payments in [CELO](https://celo.org/) (a proof of stake blockchain & cryptocurrency).\n\nIt utilizes a so-called [‘user-centric’](https://jazzfuel.com/user-centric-streaming-for-jazz/) payment model, as opposed to the big pool model common with most major streaming services, where in this case the Discord server is the user.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B7RDqe5Gz0smtfruI4T49.png?height=330&width=1760)\n\nBesides payments, artists also get $SONE tokens, which gives them access to the sone DAO.\n\nAspects I like:\n\n* Being popular on the bot means you get to hold more tokens in the DAO that develops it. Imagine if artists that drive traffic to the platforms they use (Instagram, Bandcamp, Spotify, etc) automatically became shareholders in those platforms.\n* It solves the issue of Discord streams not being monetized. Communities can decide “we want artists to get paid”, then kick out the existing music bot and go for this bot instead. They could use it to play the music of artists they know and alert those artists so they can claim their CELO payments.\n\nOne thing I worry about:\n\n* Collecting money for artists without having licences in place will eventually invite the attention of lawyers. I trust the crew behind this. They work in music and have a track record of getting musicians paid. I think what they’re setting up solves a problem, gets artists paid in a place where no payments exist yet, and they do so in a transparent way, so that anyone can see exactly what’s happening with the money… But if a company feels that this money is not theirs to collect & distribute, I think this DAO might run into some friction with the legacy industry’s lawyers sooner or later.\n\nFor more info, check out the [tone website](https://topshelfrecords.co/sone/bot.html).\n\n## WarpSound’s WVRPS\n\n**[WarpSound](https://www.warpsound.ai/)** is a music collective created by **Nayomi**, **DJ Dragoon**, and **Gnar Heart** which appear to be avatars created by **[Authentic Artists](https://www.authentic-artists.ai/)**. Their upcoming project, called **WVRPS**, blends generative profile pictures (PFPs) with music by feeding a generative visual and metadata layer into a music AI, which generates an audio loop. This last music layer is then merged together with the other two layers to form a unique audiovisual NFT called a WVRP.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ny43AKKD56q3KcSdBp0TE.png?height=1034&width=2288)\n\nWhat I like about this project specifically is its world-building exercise through Twitch, [its Discord](https://discord.gg/5XnXuSZRcS) which has loads of activities including social games, and its characters. By launching a generative PFP series, it gets the community to invest and will bring more folks into the community that may currently be just on the periphery.\n\nLonger term, they want holders of the NFTs to be able to collaborate to do new things with the audio fingerprints, like create full songs or new compositions.\n\n## geniuscorp\n\nThe website is a little mysterious, but *I think* **[geniuscorp](https://geniuscorp.fr/)** is kind of like a record label by music web3 pioneer **[Mighty33](https://mobile.twitter.com/Mighty_33)**. You may know the latter from [this blockchain music map](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kqkQyeI=/) on Miro, if not from their music. geniuscorp lists its address as 104 Ceres Tower A, Ceres, **[Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/)**, which is a virtual world (or metaverse, if you will) built on top of the **Ethereum** blockchain.\n\nA lot of their music is also released on NFT platform **Rarible**, for relatively affordable sums like 0.05 ETH (\\~$250 at time of writing).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PvaQevF-c0CQ928LqAMhj.png?height=1278&width=2548)\n\n## hic et nunc radio\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LfygjXISa5tAE8CUwQTEb.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\n**[hic et nunc](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/)** has been the NFT platform of choice for some artists, due to the low transaction fees and energy cost of the **Tezos** blockchain that it’s built on.\n\nWhat I didn’t know, is that there’s a music ecosystem there, which has now been clearly exposed by a little tool called [hen radio](https://hen.radio/) which provides an easy way to explore the music on the platform.\n\nI’m highlighting this project, since it was built by the community during a hackathon. It’s a great example of how people in web3 ecosystems can come together to create value for each other and the wider space around themselves (similar to **[Club BPM](https://musicx.mirror.xyz/HXmpxbz-pNZb_OGHcJOj0mOIhHZXTfCXhPNe_t8Bfdc#club-bpms-bpm-bot)**[’s bot](https://musicx.mirror.xyz/HXmpxbz-pNZb_OGHcJOj0mOIhHZXTfCXhPNe_t8Bfdc#club-bpms-bpm-bot) which plays **Catalog** NFTs on Discord).\n\n\n---\n\n*If you’re new here and would like more MUSIC x web3 updates, consider subscribing to the biweekly [MUSIC x newsletter](http://musicx.email/), which has been covering innovation in the music space since 2016.

{"id": "xHPkopvu4y1tIpC7xhngbqiGq96lVSZQbFBLDyhIYsU", "title": "Mirror:让公众号，微博成为过去式", "body": "互联网的，改变了内容的传播方式，我们人可以拥有自己的日常创作和传播，如今，以媒体的传播方式中占有举足轻重的地位。在中国，你有哪些或经常的内容平台有哪些？、头条，还是？这些内容平台有一个共同点，他们都属于互联网公司，是有一个中心运营维护的。需要对其他地方吗？\n\n2021年1月06日，去化内容发布平台，开放日镜已向所有以太坊地址开放，任何人都在镜中连接自己的钱包并开始写作，下景可以内镜中心也将继续开放经济区（经济浏览），不定期发布更新体验，例如编辑器更新、支持ENS、功能、订阅信息流和发现、自定义日期等。\n\n镜子对自己的定位则更艺术、更哲学：什么是镜子=谁在镜子上（谁站在镜子前，镜子即是谁）。实际上，镜子是一个去中心化的内容创作平台，它更是一个平台剧情、具有超强瞬变与瞬间、具有极强社交属性的社区内容且，可以直接为创作者带来收益。\n\n现阶段，Mirror为创作者提供了6个基础功能，包括作品（Entries）、众筹（Crowdfunds）、藏品（Editions）、拍卖（Auctions）、合作共享（Splits）、投票（Token Race）。**作品（参赛作品）**\n\n镜子的作品功能已经全面开放，链接你的微信公众号进入使用。点击条目，分类开始在线发布作品。用过微信公众号的朋友一定知道在公众号而后台编辑文章更省心镜像发布作品逻辑非常简单，可在线实时插入图片、编辑格式、实时预览等。Mirror作品中最大的亮点，是Mirror上的所有条目都可以铸造为 NFT，只需要选中编辑器右上角的 NFT 复选框。然后你就可以为你的内容上传封面图片，以便它可以在不同的 NFT 平台上呈现。一旦你的 NFT 在链上铸造，你就可以在条目的署名行中看到。你还可以通过编辑、选中 NFT 复选框并保存文章来追溯创建以前的条目。在仪表板的“Entries”选项卡下查看您的哪些条目已被铸造为 NFT。而这所有的NFT均可销售，这一点也直接为内容创作者的收益问题带来了解决方案，你可以直接将你的内容出售、获得回报。其次，Mirror每一篇内容的发布，都可以保存在区块链中，点击右上角齿轮可以选择是否将文章发布到链上，public 即是将文章发布到 Arweave 分布式存储区块链上（需要缴纳gas）。这一点对于区块链爱好者来说，是不是感到仪式感满满，想象一下，你所有的内容均实实在在保存在链上，它就在那里，永远不会消失。对于真正的内容创作者来说，我想Mirror这样的去中心化内容创作平台，将是他们的福音，这里将不会有敏感词，这里更没有审查，you are totally free on it。**众筹（众筹）**\n\n在镜子上，任何人都可以使用众筹。众筹功能实际上是一个以太坊上的智能合约。支持者存入 ETH 来资助你的项目换样币。代币代表众筹可以嵌入到镜子上的任何条目中。Mirror上有这样一个例子，艾米丽是一个小说创作者，她有一本名为燃烧阿尔法的小说在Mirror上创作，艾米丽正是基于这部小说发起了众筹，最终结果是筹集到25个以太坊。参与众筹的人都将获得名为Novel的代币，此代币即为众筹者的股份。此外，艾米丽还将这本小说的完整手稿制作成为了NFT，通过NFT的发售，众筹者将会按照一定机制参与收益分成。看到了吗？so damn cool！！！这改变的不仅仅是内容创作者的收益方式，投资者的投资方式，它甚至改变了文学作品、艺术作品的发布方式。\n\n当然这只是一个例子，在众筹中你可以有多种项目发起，文学作品、绘画作品、NFT项目等等。**藏品（Editions）与拍卖（拍卖）**\n\n镜中的藏品与拍卖，逻辑比较简单，它在Opensea上的NFT创作与销售，你可以通过藏品功能创建自己的NFT，并在拍卖中发起销售。\n\n**合作共享（Splits）**\n\n拆分翻译为分裂，我理解了其功能后，功能翻译了合作共享，什么意思呢？几个人共同完成的，然后你需要自己与他人共享该作品带来的收益，镜子提供了这样一个智能的收益共享功能，它也是一个创建在以太坊上的智能合约，设置了多个收益地址后比如，合作的作品在拍卖中收获了 1 个以太坊，那么这 1 个以太坊模拟智能智能合约自动添加了之前设置好的规则转入地址，省去很多传统分配收益的繁冗步骤。在我看到这个功能后，第一印象是，这个功能似乎有点多余啊？但细想后发现，这个功能解决了合作者之间收益分配的问题。仔细想一想，现实生活中，你是否与人合伙做过生意？在合伙过程中有多少问题会产生?互相信任问题、收到利润后迟迟不分钱、分赃不均等等。而在Mirror这个设定中，只要事前制定好规则，事后获得收益后100%由智能合约来执行，多么的快捷高效啊！从此你不必再需考验人性。**投票（Token Race）**\n\n有了艾米丽众筹划的实例中，大家可以看到，参与众筹者具体组成了一个DAO（去中心化自主组织），而对于一个成熟的DAO来说，投票是非常重要的应用。代表了 DAO 倾向于对任何一方的集体倾向和决定。\n\n使用镜子投票的好处是它与镜子的其他构成部分可以继承。通过一篇文章，创作者解释了一个项目的创意，通过一个众筹，召集社区最终成员。最终通过投票，对社区我们看到的创作者社区的能力闭上了。以上，就将Mirror的现阶段功能做了简要的介绍，怎么样，是不是觉得为你打开了新世界的大门？你认为它对比传统的内容平台如何呢？\n\n**一点迷思**\n\n我们看到的，镜子的产品，将完整的链式拼装到了这样的造型，太会玩了，夸张的惊叹！化的特点，搭建了一个化的内容平台，去融合中心NFT与Dao。Mirror可以是一个简单的内容传播平台，创作者可以自由的抒发他们的才华、想法、观点。丰富一点，Mirror是一个创作者内容变现平台，你可以通过各种方式将你的才华价值变现。再丰富一点。Mirror是一个创新项目孵化器，可融合Dao等区块链应用与世界各地，欣赏你的人共同做一些你认为有意义的事情。Mirror不仅可以为分布式协作提供强大的创作工具和能力，同时也是面向加密世界的一个路演平台。我们再谈深一点，现在大家都在谈WEB3.0，可是到底什么是WEB3.0？可能我无法一时解释的非常全面，但是Web3.0有一个特质，借此机会分享给大家，首先看一个知乎上关于web3.0的回答：\n\n当你在园里看《长安十二时辰》的，隔老王家的某云矿机正在地为你传输下一集的视频文件；你是为了看电影向视频网站交了15块钱的会员费，老王的矿机靠着给附近的人传文件，一天赚了2毛钱。\n\n**你是普通的互联网用户，老王是 Web 3.0 很快。**\n\n没有，web3.0 有一个错误的特征，就是价值流与信息流的合并。通过付费，有的通过广告，有的通过社区等等，但基本都难以实现信息获取即价值回馈。但是，在 Web3.0 时代，就像镜子一样，你有各种各样的方式和手段，将你的内容产生了这讨论的价值。当然，只是web3.0其中一个，未来我们对它进行了更深的。", "timestamp": 1636721196, "digest": "GWwPL4MSBCn5f3XKoXuiZKKGtef14xty_4frRpx8MOA", "contributor": "0x8Ff1D4874aA3dd5704eD4ce442bf683728322bfA"}

There is no central authority to control everything\n\nAt present, the government and companies are responsible for handling all currency and information in circulation. Usually, the following situations will not happen, but there are also such examples. Perhaps these organizations will violate the trust of users and sell valuable data to advertisers. Moreover, data is sometimes arbitrarily discarded, which occurs when governments and companies do not need it.\n\n1. Reduce the risk of single point of failure\n\nA single point of failure occurs during downtime, which can significantly affect productivity. For example, when Google encounters technical difficulties, they must shut down the server, and you cannot access email or files on Google drives for that specific period of time.\n\nThis usually occurs in a centralized network. However, in the distributed platform, even if one node is shut down, other nodes will not be affected and continue to execute due programs. Therefore, it will not affect your work efficiency.\n\n1. Reduced review\n\nNo matter how closely we are connected to the Internet, the government still has the right to prevent citizens from accessing social media and control the use of other services. In distributed networks, there is less review because data or information is sent and received on peer-to-peer networks.\n\n1. Development is dynamic\n\nDistributed platforms are open source, and everyone can access the code they can develop to make it better and more dynamic. This important collaboration creates better tools and products, as well as excellent business opportunities.", "timestamp": 1636721542, "digest": "m25DplXIYmRRunfry_zP2_BGKIBfgWxgyrcaTV_3CtM", "contributor": "0x174459460A65Dac1242793534dAf9502B0168ab0"}

"[https://hackmd.io/@canti/rkUT0BD8K](https://hackmd.io/@canti/rkUT0BD8K)\n\n来源\n\n[https://hackmd.io/@canti/rkUT0BD8K](https://hackmd.io/@canti/rkUT0BD8K)\n\n作者：Canti\n\n[可扩展性三元悖论](https://miro.medium.com/max/2640/1\\*JxrKTU2QczIo_kr1FcKKCg.png)存在于所有区块链网络中。L1 网络的可扩展性越差，运行一个全节点的最低硬件要求就越高。如果用户无法轻易地访问全节点，网络就会变得越来越中心化。很明显，以太坊长期以来都优先考虑安全性和去中心化程度，而基础层的可扩展性成为不可能三角中较为忽视的一项。随着转向[以 rollup 为中心的路线图](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698)，以太坊正在利用其基础层 (特别是其[庞大的全节点](https://www.notion.so/e70677d5111140a89e19f27da227a55c)) 来提供[强大的数据可用性代替 L1 可扩展性，同时保证安全性和去中心化。](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html)\n\n![图示：可扩展性三元悖论。cr：Vitalik Buterin](https://i.imgur.com/TAjfVev.png)\n\n这个路线图的目的是，将发生在以太坊网络上的大部分执行 (DeFi、NFT 等) 将转移到 rollup 上，而不是在主网上进行。虽然 L1 专注于提高速度和安全性而不是去中心化程度有悖于这个行业的精神，但是同样的三元悖论并不适用于 rollup。Rollup 继承了以太坊主网的安全性。由于以太坊处理了三点中困难的部分，rollup 能够专注于成为最佳的执行层。\n\n到目前为止，大家可能已经听说过 [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) 和 [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/)，这两个都是 [optimistic rollups](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/optimistic_rollups/)。即将出现的是另一种 rollup — [ZK-rollup](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/)。有一些 ZK-rollup 实例已经存在，但它们都没有提供通用计算 [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) 兼容性，或 [zkEVM](https://zksync.io/zkevm/)。这种情况不会持续太久，因为 [zkSync 2.0](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zksync-2-0-hello-ethereum-ca48588de179)、[Scroll](https://hackmd.%20io/@yezhang/S1sJ2cEWY)、[StarkNet](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-alpha-2-4aa116f0ecfc) 等项目正研究这个问题，并发展迅速。\n\n那么，为什么这很重要呢？当以太坊从单一链转变为模块化系统之后，它改变了竞争的动态。正如 [polynya](https://twitter.com/epolynya) 之前所说，L1 智能合约区块链不再直接与以太坊竞争；他们还与 rollup 竞争。我相信与 EVM 兼容的通用 ZK-rollup 的出现不仅会导致 optimistic rollup 的淘汰，还会导致*所有其他 L1 智能合约区块链的淘汰。*\n\n现实情况是，rollup 的实现十分具有竞争力，并且它们拥有专注于提高执行效率的自由，因此 rollup 将以极快的速度迭代到自己的最佳版本。由于每个 rollup 项目都发展迅速，因此在本文中，我不会尝试选出最好的一个 ZK-rollup 项目。相反，我将强调合并后、分片上线后，ZK-rollup 的功能和可能性有哪些突破。\n\n# 安全性\n\nRollup 所提供的强大安全性保障能够实现一些有趣的动态。\n\n## **escapeHatch() 函数**\n\n如果你将资金放在 Polygon PoS 或 Solana 上，假设该网络离线了几个小时，那么在停机期间你将无法取回资金被困的资金。不同于使用”侧链“ (sidechain，如 Polygon PoS) 或者其他智能合约链 (如 Solana)，主网 rollup 合约包含”逃生舱口“ (escape hatches)。这是不可纂改函数，允许用户即便在 rollup 网络离线的情况下也能从 rollup 中退出到主网上。用户始终可以根据需要手动向主要以太坊 rollup 合约提交交易，包括将资金从 rollup 中提出。\n\n![理想情况下，从 rollup 中撤出不会让人感觉像在飞行中撤出飞机...这应该是一个相对舒适的过程。cr: Google](https://i.imgur.com/yu77tIp.jpg)\n\n## 中心化的定序者和证明者 (顺便解释了为什么它们并没有那么吓人)\n\n我知道在我的介绍中，我说过我将涵盖 rollup 必须提供的“最佳功能”...在有人吹嘘之前，我得先说明一点：理想情况下，定序者和证明者的设计应是完全去中心化的。\\*\\*然而，最初的情况并非如此。\\*\\*大多数 rollup 在刚启动时，具有不同程度的中心化设计，然后逐步实现去中心化。也就是说，rollup 中的中心化定序者比某条中心化 L1 链要安全得多，这一事实值得强调。\n\n当使用由中心化定序者或证明者运行的 rollup 时，用户不得不在信任和抗审查方面做出妥协，但不会影响安全性。定序者的运营者无法窃取用户的资金，并且用户可以随时将资金撤出到以太坊主网。实际上，用户主要依赖中心化定序者来保证活性。\n\n我们之前都听说过关于某某区块链是一条“数据中心链”的笑话。使用 ZK-rollup，实际上你可以拥有一个由超高规格机器组成的数据中心专门负责证明工作，并且这对网络来说不是一个存在的风险。\n\n## 去中心化的定序者和证明者\n\n幸好，由于 rollup 能够在需要时触发“逃生舱门”机制并保障用户的资产不被盗取，因此 rollup 的开发者能够尝试各种方案而不必担心灾难性后果。去中心化定序者和证明者的设计空间相当大。\\*\\*在其最终的形式中，我希望定序和证明工作会向公众普遍开放，并采取各种形式的经济激励措施 (代币、质押、惩罚等等) 来确保网络能正常运行。\\*\\*我们不再依靠单个定序者，而是支持多个！更重要的是，我们将拥有一个去中心化网络帮我们运行证明者，这个分布式网络由企业、rollup 开发者以及爱好者组成。\n\n# 数据可用性\n\n[数据可用性](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-data-availability)指的是每个以太坊节点需要维护的数据。当我们需要不可纂改这种属性时，链上数据存储很有价值。但是，以太坊上的数据容量是有限的且需要大量资源来维护；存储可不便宜！\n\n一旦以太坊转向具有数据分片的模块化系统，rollup 将享有大量的数据容量，并且只会随着时间的推移而增加。 大量全节点和验证者意味着以太坊将拥有高容量的数据可用性。\n\n## 以太坊数据分片\n\n以太坊将分阶段推出分片升级。分片将充当网络数据存储需求的负载平衡器，为 rollup 执行层释放出巨大的可扩展性。重要的是，这也避免了对全节点的高要求，从而使网络保持去中心化。\n\n最初，将有 64 个数据分片 (也成为分片链)，到最后将有 *1,024* 个数据分片。数据分片不处理交易或智能合约，它们仅为 rollup 提供额外的数据容量。\n\n![实现分片后的图示。cr: Hsiao-Wei Wang](https://i.imgur.com/xIuUDpM.png)\n\nRollup 作为交易压缩的一种形式，不定期向以太坊主网发布单个状态根更新，其中包含在 rollup 层发生的许多不同交易的结果。由于必须将这些状态根更新发布到主网上，所以 rollup 的 gas 费用会受到区块空间需求波动的影响，而这种费用通常由 rollup 的用户承担 (相关内容请看“摊销”部分)。一旦分片上线，容量将增加近 20 倍。这将使 rollup 的操作更便宜、更快。\n\n同样的，作为接受 rollup 发送的状态根更新最终链，以太坊上的用户同样可以受益于一些替代的数据可用性解决方案。\n\n## Volitions\n\n[Volition](https://medium.com/starkware/volition-and-the-emerging-data-availability-spectrum-87e8bfa09bb) 属于 ZK-rollup，包含一条 rollup 链和一个 [validium](https://ethereum%20.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/validium/) 实例。Volition 像 ZK-rollup 一样将状态根和证明提交给以太坊，不同的是，Volition 允许用户选择通过其 rollup 链使用链上数据可用性或者通过其 validium 实例使用链下数据可用性。这种权衡仅适用于 ZK-rollup，不适用于 optimistic rollup。\n\nVolition 的其中一个案例是 [zkSync 2.0](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zkporter-a-breakthrough-in-l2-scaling-ed5e48842fbf)：\n\n![zkSync volition 示意图，cr：Matter Labs](https://i.imgur.com/bCkFvba.png)\n\nzkSync 的 validium 实例称为 zkPorter。在该方案中，数据可用性由 zkPorter 的验证者提供安全保障。Matter Labs 团队声称这个方案能够实现超过 20,000 TPS (每秒交易笔数) 以及将 gas 成本降低 100 倍。需要注意的是，ZK-rollup 吞吐量的最终上限实际受到其证明者的计算和存储能力的限制。我认为长期来看，20,000 TPS 这一估计过高了。\n\n## Adamantium\n\n有像 [Adamantium](https://ethresear.ch/t/adamantium-power-users/9600) 这样的提案，一个去信任的链下数据可用性解决方案 ([TODA](https://medium.com/starkware/volition-and-the-emerging-data-availability-spectrum-87e8bfa09bb#:\\~:text=Trustless%E9%93%BE%E4%B8%8B%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%8F%AF%E7%94%A8%E6%80%A7(TODA)), Trustless Off-chain Data Availability)。这个提案进一步寻求数据可用性方面的创新。可以说，TODA 属于 volition 范畴。提案摘录如下：\n\n`\"...Adamantium，一种拥有自主数据可用性的协议 (Autonomous Data Availability)...它保留了链下数据可用性的扩容优势，同时移除了任何自愿用户的所有信任假设。这些用户自愿做什么？自愿上线；也就是说，即便他们离线了，其资产也不会被盗窃或冻结 —— 相反，这些资产能够从 L2 转移到用户的以太坊主网地址下。\"`\n\n跟 volition 一样，这个方案仅适用于 ZK-rollup。\n\n# 交易成本和吞吐量\n\nRollup 的交易成本已经相当低了，但还不够低。幸好，还有很多可以应用的优化，这将极大降低 gas 成本。此外，还将部署许多技术来提高交易吞吐量。\n\n## An Army of Rollups 一支 Rollup 大军\n\n鉴于主网上 rollup 的轻量级特性，可能会有数百个 rollup 并行运行，每个 rollup 都能承载数十万个用户并且都拥有巨大的吞吐量，所有这些都由以太坊提供支持和安全保障。如果某个 rollup 已饱和 (RPC 或定序者无法承载其流量)，那么用户能够轻易地跳到另一个 rollup 并开始交易。如果你需要的话，分叉一个 rollup 并自己部署一个副本也很简单。\n\n## 有效性证明摊销\n\n有效性证明摊销 (validity proof amortization) 指的是，ZK-rollup 上每一个批量交易的验证总成本由该 batch 内的所有交易分摊。\n\n我将提供一种快速理解摊销概念的方法。\\*\\*请记住，为简单起见，此示例在数学上并不准确。我提供公式只是为了说明；实际上，rollup 交易成本的分摊并不是那么简单。\\*\\*以下为我们的想象场景：\n\n* 更新状态根需要 5,000,000 gas\n* 就像主网一样，用户在 rollup 中进行交易时需要支付 gas 费\n* 每笔交易的价格遵循公式 `x = 5000000 / y`，其中 `x` 是每笔交易的价格，`y` 是任何给定 batch 中的交易数量\n\n你应该能够推断出：\n\n* 在包含 200 笔交易的 batch 中，单笔交易成本为 25,000 gas\n* 而在包含 100,000 笔交易的 batch 中，单笔交易成本为 50 gas，基本上可以忽略不计\n* \n\n如果向某一 batch 提交越多笔交易，交易的摊销成本就越低。这与单片区块链 (如当前的以太坊) 完全相反。以太坊随着活跃用户数量的增加，对区块空间的需求也会增加，从而导致 gas 价格飙升。\n\n摊销的一个例子：**StarkEx 提供了一种称为 SHARP (Shared Prover) 的机制**，也就是在所有 StarkEx 部署中摊销成本。\n\n## Volitions (再一次提到)\n\n大部分关于 volition 的相关信息都在前面讲到了。由于 volition 与 rollup 的吞吐量有关，因此在这里再提一遍。简要回顾：\n\n* Volition 让开发者和用户能够通过 validium 使用链下数据可用性\n* 这种链下数据可用性虽然不如链上数据可用性安全，但可以极大地降低交易成本\n* 除了降低成本外，链下数据可用性还额外释放了大量的交易吞吐量\n\n# 隐私\n\n我们都知道，隐私并非以太坊固有的属性。我们不能期望说，让普通用户和企业放弃自己的金融隐私。默认情况下，ZK-rollup 不具备隐私属性。“ZK-rollup” 中的“零知识”指的是在链下进行计算，然后借助零知识证明在主网上验证计算的有效性。这不意味着“用户的交易活动不被窥探”。当然，隐私问题还有改善的空间。目前，有许多围绕 实现 ZK-rollup 无需许可的隐私方面的工作正在进行。\n\n## 递归证明\n\n在文章[《Rollups 不完全指南》](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html#:\\~:text=One%20important%20compression,SNARKs%20are%20valid)中，Vitalik 列出了 optimistic rollup 和 ZK-rollup 之间的一些主要区别。其中一点就是，两种 rollup 分别如何处理隐私问题。他特别提到了递归证明。递归证明 (Recursive proof) 指在某个证明中验证另一个证明。比如，在某个 SNARK 中验证另一个 SNARK。这是一种便于使用的压缩技术，可以极大地提高效率并降低隐私维护成本。(中文版: <https://www.ethereum.cn/an-incomplete-guide-to-rollups>)\n\n[Aztec](https://aztec.network/) 正在[研究](https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/zk-zk-rollup-code-release-i-97216347b3bc)所谓的 *ZK-ZK-rollup* 或 *ZK²-rollup*，利用他们创新的 [PLONK](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/09/22/plonk.html) 证明和 [Turbo-PLONK](https://docs.zkproof.org/pages/standards/accepted-workshop3/proposal-turbo_plonk.pdf) 以提供隐私交易功能。简而言之：\n\n* [ZK-SNARK](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/05/zksnarks-in-a-nutshell/) 代表着 ZK²-rollup 上的每笔交易。这些是“内部” SNARK。\n* 另一个 ZK-SNARK，即 rollup SNARK，负责证明内部 SNARK 的有效性。\n\n需要注意的是，optimistic roolup 无法实现这一创新，因为它们无法让内部 SNARK 验证安全地在 rollup 外部进行；且数据必须发布在链上。这并不是说 optimistic rollup 不能从零知识证明中受益，但它们的效率和成本效益都会较低。\n\n当前，zkSync 和 Mina Protocol 已经采用了 PLONKs。随着时间的推移，我们期待看到递归证明的进一步创新 (包括[其他类型的 ZK-SNARK 证明](https://medium.com/coinmonks/comparing-general-purpose-zk-snarks-51ce124c60bd)，如 Groth16、Marlin、Fractal、Halo2 等) 为所有 ZK-rollup 带来更便宜、更强大的隐私方案。\n\n![图示：Turbo-PLONK 多项式逻辑单位。cr：零知识峰会 (演讲视频)](https://i.imgur.com/R7rp5DP.jpg)\n\n# 灵活性\n\nZK-rollup 能够随意地在各个方面进行创新，而无需面对 L1 链上可能带来的灾难性故障风险。以 rollup 为中心的以太坊路线图的一个关键原则是，自由市场正在寻找构建 rollup 的所有最佳方法，而不是依赖于一小群核心开发者去假设哪种方案最佳。\n\n由于开发和部署 rollup 是一项无需许可的工作，因此我们会看到不同的 rollup 推出各种各样的机制来吸引用户使用。这包括不同风格的治理、代币经济和流动性激励、去中心化范围内的不同权衡、意识形态的不同表述，甚至 [VM 环境的不同选择](https://github.com/protolambda/optimistic-brainfuck)(如 LLVM、自定义 VM 等等)。\n\n当然，本节所提到的所有内容并非仅 ZK-rollup 独有。尽管 optimistic rollup 不具备 ZK-rollup 所提供的某些功能，但 op 也有许多相同的灵活性。然而，其他 L1 智能合约区块链不能像 rollup 那样快速地迭代其中的功能。请记住，现在是 rollup 和其他 L1 智能合约在进行竞争。\n\n如果某条 L1 链试图迭代太快，而没有进行适当的测试和采取安全措施，那么它的用户就会面临很高的风险。这些网络上的所有资金随时都是黑客眼里的赏金。如果 L1 链出现了故障，那么损失可能是灾难性的。停机时间还会影响到 L1 可能拥有的任何扩容执行环境 (rollup、状态通道等)。因此，优先考虑安全性和去中心化是有好处的。\n\n最坏的情况是，当 rollup 宕机时，在系统修复之前都需要手动操作。可以想象，类似于在 Etherscan 上与合约进行交互，rollup 开发者与应用程序开发者可能会提供一个“应对紧急情况”的门户网站，允许用户在需要时快速简便地手动操作 rollup。幸好，这些快速迭代很可能会在早期得到解决，我猜相关开发工作将会得到高度重视。\n\n# 多种可能\n\n外包计算和数据可用性 (即在 L2 执行计算) 使许多当前无法在主网以太坊或其他智能合约平台上运行的链上应用成为可能。这种新范式还允许我们构建任何现有链上产品的高级版本。\n\n## 应用专用型 ZK-Rollup\n\n虽然本文主要讲述通用计算型 ZK-rollup 的好处，但对于应用专用型 ZK-rollup 的影响也有许多想要讨论的。\n\n### dYdX 交易所\n\n[dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/) 由 [StarkEx](https://starkware.co/product/starkex/) 提供支持，是一个去中心化交易所，支持永续交易、保证金交易、现货交易以及借贷交易。自从推出 L2 版本的交易所，dYdX 的 ETH/USD 代币对产生的流动性已经与 FTX 的相匹敌。虽然其中很大部分是由于其 [DYDX 代币](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dydx)奖励计划所产生的流动性，但我相信 dYdX 或其他一些 ZK-rollup 原生 DEX 总有一天会在交易量和流动性方面超越所有永续合约交易所。\n\n![dYdX 的 ETH 流动性与 FTX 相匹敌，数据截止 2021 年 9 月 26 日。cr: Hsaka](https://i.imgur.com/C5P0Ehe.png)\n\n在用户体验方面，只需一个以太坊钱包和一些 ETH 即可登录并开始在 dYdX 上进行交易。不同于一般的中心化交易所，由于去中心化交易所是非托管的，使用 DEX 不需要 KYC 以及不需要第三方存储用户的个人信息。用户确实需要将资金转到 rollup 中才能使用这个 DEX，但用户对其资金保有控制权，并可根据需要将资金提回主网。据 dYdX 用户所说，其使用体验与中心化交易所一样灵敏。\n\n这种链引起了一些 HFT (high-frequency trading, 高频交易) 群体的关注。假设 HFT 公司是理性且受利益驱动的实体，我猜随着时间的推移，这项活动将主要在 ZK-rollup 上进行。\n\n### Immutable X\n\n另一个迅速获得关注的应用是 [Immutable X](https://www.immutable.com/blog/design-architecture)，这是一种为 NFT 提供巨大可扩展性空间的 volition 用例 (也是由 StarkEx 提供支持)。最近，TikTok 选择 Immutable X 作为发布其 [TikTok Top Moments NFTs](https://tiktok.immutable.com/) 的平台。使用 Immutable X，用户无需支付 100 到 1000 美元的 gas 成本来铸造 NFT，而是以几分钱的价格甚至免费铸造 NFT。摘自 **Immutable X** 的 [alpha 交易公告](https://www.immutable.com/blog/immutable-x-alpha-trading-launch)：\n\n`Immutable X 提供免 gas 和即时交易：对于任何市场、游戏和去中心化应用程序，Immutable X 提供免 gas 的交易 (免 gas 铸造、交易、赚取、收集)、即时NFT 交易 (每秒最多处理 9,000 笔交易)，在保证非托管的前提下，极大地实现了扩容。`\n\n你注意到它们说的能够达到 9000+ TPS 了吗？\n\n## 物理和游戏引擎 (什么时候会在 ZK-Rollup 上爆发？)\n\n一位名叫 [guiltygyoza](https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza) 的推特用户展示了[相当](https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza/status/1452311405437366281)[多](https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza/status/1448709529387032582)其在 [StarkNet](https://starkware.co/product/starknet/) 上进行的物理现象相关[实验](https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza/status/1449637155001798657)。我预计，随着工具变得更加强大和实验继续发展，未来将有大量从前无法想象的新链上游戏。\n\n![简单点阵 & 重力场中的二体问题，在 StarkNet 上运行。cr: guiltygyoza](https://i.imgur.com/xbkIRxD.gif)\n\n## 其他概念\n\nVolition 将为实现 Web3 的愿景带来新方法。例如，区块链原生社交网络之类的东西应该能够极大地利用链下数据可用性。Jack Dorsey 已经[谈论过他的计划](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106?s=20)：将推特变成一个开源的分布式系统，其中推特只是“推特”协议上的一个客户端。Volition (更具体地说应为 validium) 可以在这个场景中发挥关键作用。\n\n同样，也可以想象一下 [Vine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_(service)) 的开源版本，其中用户提交的短视频 (6 秒或更短) 铸造为 NFT。TikTok 和其 ‘Top Moments’ 系列与这个想法相似，但 TikTok 始终是一个闭源实体，搞点其他花样并非坏事。\n\n# 这场竞争会如何发展？\n\nZK-rollup 带来了很多好处，以太坊很快就会让它们发挥自身最大的潜力。但是其他竞争链呢？它们在各种意义上都被超越了，其未来发展会怎样？这是一个很好的问题，不可避免地会有许多复杂的答案。对于它们的命运，我有一些想法。\n\n## 以太坊的实用主义黑洞\n\n在过去的一年里，我们看到了许多“又便宜又快”的兼容 EVM 的链涌现。还有一些声称要在基础层解决区块链三难困境的链上线了，这些链实际上牺牲了去中心化来保证速度和安全性。\n\n现在应该很清楚，通用计算型 ZK-rollup 将比任何 L1 智能合约链都更安全、更快、更去中心化、更具适应性和灵活性，并且更轻量级。这些事实很重要；每条独立的链都将承担不必要的安全开销和风险，同时是劣质产品。\n\n在我看来，未来务实的解决方案是让这些链放弃其冗余的共识机制和数据可用性，成为 ZK-rollup 或意志。 他们应该融入以太坊一流的安全性、数据可用性和结算保证。\n\n在我看来，对于这些区块链而言，未来的实用主义方案是放弃其冗余的共识机制和数据可用性，发展成为一个 ZK-Rollup 或者 Volition。它们应该借用以太坊的一流安全性、数据可用性及其结算保证。\n\n将共识和安全的工作外包给以太坊将使这些链能够专注于执行的工作。在分片上线后并且以 rollup 为中心的世界中，这是它们之间保持相关性的机会。否则，它们的安全维护成本将变得更高而难以维持。随着时间的推移，这将是一个变得更加明显的现实。\n\n![以太坊 (左) & 所有其他 L1 执行层 (右), 大约在 2023 年。cr: NASA/CXC/M.WEISS](https://i.imgur.com/D3PwYbt.jpg)\n\n可以说，像 Solana、Avalanche、Fantom 和 Binance Smart Chain 这样的网络在任何潜在的 rollup 治理代币中都有优势。 这些网络 (以及其他类似网络) 的原生代币：\n\n* 有时间达到某种程度的分布式\n* 是“已知实体”\n* 有交换支持\n* 具有深度的流动性\n\n也就是说，放弃他们冗余的共识机制和安全开销，然后变成以太坊 rollup 并不意味着他们的代币消失了。相反，他们可以重新利用代币来调整证明者和定序者的激励措施或提供链上流动性激励措施。这些链不需要牺牲它们的身份，只需去掉一些危险指数。这对所有人来说都是积极的调整。\n\n## 需要考虑现实情况\n\n当然，这些区块链链的设计者、风投和用户不可能那么快接受这一现实。Meme 很强大，圈内的人都不乏傲慢之心，很多风投都有向散户投资者兜售其产品的梦想。\n\n以前的经验告诉我们，区块链的消亡从来都不是一个快速的过程。[现在你可以在以太坊经典等类似平台上观察到数千个空块](https://blockscout.com/etc/mainnet)，这表明它们缺乏采用。当然，还有其他类似的链在运行着。\n\n## 需要一定的时间\n\n即便这些链愿意选择实用主义的方法，也需要投入大量的研究、准备和注意力来实现这种规模的变化。任何人都需要很长时间才能执行。我直觉 Solana 将会是最早采取这种方法的链之一，也许我的直觉是错的。\n\n# 免责声明\n\n一个以 ZK-rollup 为中心的未来似乎是世界上所有问题的神奇技术解决方案，但需要注意以下几点：\n\n## **General**\n\n一份不全面清单：\n\n* 根据不同 rollup 的设计，中心化定序者可能可以优先执行 [MEV](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/02/mev-and-me/)。\n* 根据 volition 中 validium 的数据可用性委员会的不同实现方式，数据委员会的验证者可能可以恶意冻结用户资金或拒绝更新 validium 的状态。但这种情况并不会影响 volition 的 ZK-rollup 状态。\n* 许多 rollup 出现意味着有更多的流动性场所，无论是代币交易还是 NFT 交易。虽然 ZK-rollup 能够实现在 rollup 和主网之间快速转移资金 (甚至在不同的 rollup 之间也可以)，但流动性碎片化还是可能会造成早期的波动。而 [dAMM](https://medium.com/starkware/damm-decentralized-amm-59b329fb4cc3) 主要就是为了解决这一问题。\n* 运行一个证明者需要消耗一定的算力，因此我们应该找到降低潜在 KW/h 消耗的方法，同时提供证明效率。\n\n  需要注意的是，这种证明工作并不像 PoW 挖矿那种消耗游戏；它不会随着时间的推移而变得更加困难。因此，运行证明者的能源消耗接近以太坊 PoW 的能源消耗是不大可能的。\n\n在我看来，除了 MEV (矿工可提取价值)，我预计市场将会快速地为大多数问题提供解决方案。就 MEV 而言，这是一个棘手的问题，并不是通过单个神奇的解决方案或协议就能解决的。但各种最小化 MEV 和使其民主化的方案将有助于减少其影响。\n\n## Optimistic Rollup\n\n虽然我对于 optimistic rollup 的长期可行性的态度不太乐观，但它仍是以太坊目前最佳的兼容 EVM 的扩容解决方案。通用计算型兼容 EVM 的 ZK-rollup 还没上线，也就是说我们还需要一段时间才能实现本文介绍的所有有点。\n\n[Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) 最近推出了一版升级，[其执行环境将发生巨大的变化](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306) [(中文版)](https://www.ethereum.cn/Layer2/introducing-evm-equivalence)，而这些变化对开发者和用户都非常使用友好。[Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) 将很快进行 [Nitro](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-nitro-sneak-preview-44550d9054f5) 升级，它支持 EVM 兼容性并为用户提供更快的速度。\n\n越来越多 DeFi app 在这两种 rollup 上部署，它们两个网络中都存在着数十亿美元的流动性，两者都非常值得尝试。桥接资产至 Optimism 和 Arbitrum 上只需几分钟！\n\nOptimism 桥接：\n`https://gateway.optimism.io/welcome`\n\nArbitrum 桥接：\n`https://bridge.arbitrum.io/`\n\n请注意在与任一网站交互之前验证每个 URL 的有效性。你可以在 [Optimism 的 Twitter](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC) 和 [Arbitrum 的 Twitter](https://t.co/HUmlnrMAbr?amp=1) 上仔细查看其链接的网站。\n\n在撰写本文时，Optimism 仅限用于通过白名单的智能合约，但用户可以随意使用任何列入白名单的智能合约。 我估计这个白名单机制很快就会取消啦。Arbitrum 没有白名单机制；用户和开发者可以自由地交易和部署他们的东西。\n\n需要注意的是，使用这两个 rollup 本身的桥梁将资产从二层提到主网需要 7 天 (这是 optimistic rollup 处理欺诈证明的方式)。当然，你也可以通过第三方桥来在 rollup 和主网之间转移资产，但需要支付手续费。在使用它们中的任何一个方案之前先自己调研一下，并在使用时仔细检查滑点和费率。\n\n# 总结\n\n我们正面临着一个巨大的范式转变，这将对加密生态系统带来永久的影响。ZK-rollup 将能为以太坊实现扩容，它们会在这方面做到最好。这种范式转变将十分强大，届时会开启所有 L1 智能合约区块链的终结 —— 即便是我们现在所知的以太坊。\n\n关于扩容，有许多不同的提案。为了发明出现在众所周知的灯泡，经历了数千小时的研究和失败，才有后来的成功和实现 —— 当然，这项工作还远未结束。前方的道路充满曲折，但我们的目标却从未如此清晰。\n\n我希望这篇文章能够帮你在思考行业未来时改变自己的思维方式。对于未来格局的猜想令我无比兴奋。\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/rDCKkMM.png](https://i.imgur.com/rDCKkMM.png)\n\nECN的翻译工作旨在为中国以太坊社区传递优质资讯和学习资源，文章版权归原作者所有，转载须注明原文出处以及ethereum.cn，若需长期转载，请联系[eth@ecn.co](http://mailto:eth@ecn.co/)进行授权。",

"来源\n\n[https://hackmd.io/@canti/rkUT0BD8K](https://hackmd.io/@canti/rkUT0BD8K)\n\n作者：Canti\n\n[可扩展性三元悖论](https://miro.medium.com/max/2640/1\\*JxrKTU2QczIo_kr1FcKKCg.png)存在于所有区块链网络中。L1 网络的可扩展性越差，运行一个全节点的最低硬件要求就越高。如果用户无法轻易地访问全节点，网络就会变得越来越中心化。很明显，以太坊长期以来都优先考虑安全性和去中心化程度，而基础层的可扩展性成为不可能三角中较为忽视的一项。随着转向[以 rollup 为中心的路线图](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698)，以太坊正在利用其基础层 (特别是其[庞大的全节点](https://www.notion.so/e70677d5111140a89e19f27da227a55c)) 来提供[强大的数据可用性代替 L1 可扩展性，同时保证安全性和去中心化。](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html)\n\n![图示：可扩展性三元悖论。cr：Vitalik Buterin](https://i.imgur.com/TAjfVev.png)\n\n这个路线图的目的是，将发生在以太坊网络上的大部分执行 (DeFi、NFT 等) 将转移到 rollup 上，而不是在主网上进行。虽然 L1 专注于提高速度和安全性而不是去中心化程度有悖于这个行业的精神，但是同样的三元悖论并不适用于 rollup。Rollup 继承了以太坊主网的安全性。由于以太坊处理了三点中困难的部分，rollup 能够专注于成为最佳的执行层。\n\n到目前为止，大家可能已经听说过 [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) 和 [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/)，这两个都是 [optimistic rollups](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/optimistic_rollups/)。即将出现的是另一种 rollup — [ZK-rollup](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/)。有一些 ZK-rollup 实例已经存在，但它们都没有提供通用计算 [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) 兼容性，或 [zkEVM](https://zksync.io/zkevm/)。这种情况不会持续太久，因为 [zkSync 2.0](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zksync-2-0-hello-ethereum-ca48588de179)、[Scroll](https://hackmd.%20io/@yezhang/S1sJ2cEWY)、[StarkNet](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-alpha-2-4aa116f0ecfc) 等项目正研究这个问题，并发展迅速。\n\n那么，为什么这很重要呢？当以太坊从单一链转变为模块化系统之后，它改变了竞争的动态。正如 [polynya](https://twitter.com/epolynya) 之前所说，L1 智能合约区块链不再直接与以太坊竞争；他们还与 rollup 竞争。我相信与 EVM 兼容的通用 ZK-rollup 的出现不仅会导致 optimistic rollup 的淘汰，还会导致*所有其他 L1 智能合约区块链的淘汰。*\n\n现实情况是，rollup 的实现十分具有竞争力，并且它们拥有专注于提高执行效率的自由，因此 rollup 将以极快的速度迭代到自己的最佳版本。由于每个 rollup 项目都发展迅速，因此在本文中，我不会尝试选出最好的一个 ZK-rollup 项目。相反，我将强调合并后、分片上线后，ZK-rollup 的功能和可能性有哪些突破。\n\n# 安全性\n\nRollup 所提供的强大安全性保障能够实现一些有趣的动态。\n\n## **escapeHatch() 函数**\n\n如果你将资金放在 Polygon PoS 或 Solana 上，假设该网络离线了几个小时，那么在停机期间你将无法取回资金被困的资金。不同于使用”侧链“ (sidechain，如 Polygon PoS) 或者其他智能合约链 (如 Solana)，主网 rollup 合约包含”逃生舱口“ (escape hatches)。这是不可纂改函数，允许用户即便在 rollup 网络离线的情况下也能从 rollup 中退出到主网上。用户始终可以根据需要手动向主要以太坊 rollup 合约提交交易，包括将资金从 rollup 中提出。\n\n![理想情况下，从 rollup 中撤出不会让人感觉像在飞行中撤出飞机...这应该是一个相对舒适的过程。cr: Google](https://i.imgur.com/yu77tIp.jpg)\n\n## 中心化的定序者和证明者 (顺便解释了为什么它们并没有那么吓人)\n\n我知道在我的介绍中，我说过我将涵盖 rollup 必须提供的“最佳功能”...在有人吹嘘之前，我得先说明一点：理想情况下，定序者和证明者的设计应是完全去中心化的。\\*\\*然而，最初的情况并非如此。\\*\\*大多数 rollup 在刚启动时，具有不同程度的中心化设计，然后逐步实现去中心化。也就是说，rollup 中的中心化定序者比某条中心化 L1 链要安全得多，这一事实值得强调。\n\n当使用由中心化定序者或证明者运行的 rollup 时，用户不得不在信任和抗审查方面做出妥协，但不会影响安全性。定序者的运营者无法窃取用户的资金，并且用户可以随时将资金撤出到以太坊主网。实际上，用户主要依赖中心化定序者来保证活性。\n\n我们之前都听说过关于某某区块链是一条“数据中心链”的笑话。使用 ZK-rollup，实际上你可以拥有一个由超高规格机器组成的数据中心专门负责证明工作，并且这对网络来说不是一个存在的风险。\n\n## 去中心化的定序者和证明者\n\n幸好，由于 rollup 能够在需要时触发“逃生舱门”机制并保障用户的资产不被盗取，因此 rollup 的开发者能够尝试各种方案而不必担心灾难性后果。去中心化定序者和证明者的设计空间相当大。\\*\\*在其最终的形式中，我希望定序和证明工作会向公众普遍开放，并采取各种形式的经济激励措施 (代币、质押、惩罚等等) 来确保网络能正常运行。\\*\\*我们不再依靠单个定序者，而是支持多个！更重要的是，我们将拥有一个去中心化网络帮我们运行证明者，这个分布式网络由企业、rollup 开发者以及爱好者组成。\n\n# 数据可用性\n\n[数据可用性](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-data-availability)指的是每个以太坊节点需要维护的数据。当我们需要不可纂改这种属性时，链上数据存储很有价值。但是，以太坊上的数据容量是有限的且需要大量资源来维护；存储可不便宜！\n\n一旦以太坊转向具有数据分片的模块化系统，rollup 将享有大量的数据容量，并且只会随着时间的推移而增加。 大量全节点和验证者意味着以太坊将拥有高容量的数据可用性。\n\n## 以太坊数据分片\n\n以太坊将分阶段推出分片升级。分片将充当网络数据存储需求的负载平衡器，为 rollup 执行层释放出巨大的可扩展性。重要的是，这也避免了对全节点的高要求，从而使网络保持去中心化。\n\n最初，将有 64 个数据分片 (也成为分片链)，到最后将有 *1,024* 个数据分片。数据分片不处理交易或智能合约，它们仅为 rollup 提供额外的数据容量。\n\n![实现分片后的图示。cr: Hsiao-Wei Wang](https://i.imgur.com/xIuUDpM.png)\n\nRollup 作为交易压缩的一种形式，不定期向以太坊主网发布单个状态根更新，其中包含在 rollup 层发生的许多不同交易的结果。由于必须将这些状态根更新发布到主网上，所以 rollup 的 gas 费用会受到区块空间需求波动的影响，而这种费用通常由 rollup 的用户承担 (相关内容请看“摊销”部分)。一旦分片上线，容量将增加近 20 倍。这将使 rollup 的操作更便宜、更快。\n\n同样的，作为接受 rollup 发送的状态根更新最终链，以太坊上的用户同样可以受益于一些替代的数据可用性解决方案。\n\n## Volitions\n\n[Volition](https://medium.com/starkware/volition-and-the-emerging-data-availability-spectrum-87e8bfa09bb) 属于 ZK-rollup，包含一条 rollup 链和一个 [validium](https://ethereum%20.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/validium/) 实例。Volition 像 ZK-rollup 一样将状态根和证明提交给以太坊，不同的是，Volition 允许用户选择通过其 rollup 链使用链上数据可用性或者通过其 validium 实例使用链下数据可用性。这种权衡仅适用于 ZK-rollup，不适用于 optimistic rollup。\n\nVolition 的其中一个案例是 [zkSync 2.0](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zkporter-a-breakthrough-in-l2-scaling-ed5e48842fbf)：\n\n![zkSync volition 示意图，cr：Matter Labs](https://i.imgur.com/bCkFvba.png)\n\nzkSync 的 validium 实例称为 zkPorter。在该方案中，数据可用性由 zkPorter 的验证者提供安全保障。Matter Labs 团队声称这个方案能够实现超过 20,000 TPS (每秒交易笔数) 以及将 gas 成本降低 100 倍。需要注意的是，ZK-rollup 吞吐量的最终上限实际受到其证明者的计算和存储能力的限制。我认为长期来看，20,000 TPS 这一估计过高了。\n\n## Adamantium\n\n有像 [Adamantium](https://ethresear.ch/t/adamantium-power-users/9600) 这样的提案，一个去信任的链下数据可用性解决方案 ([TODA](https://medium.com/starkware/volition-and-the-emerging-data-availability-spectrum-87e8bfa09bb#:\\~:text=Trustless%E9%93%BE%E4%B8%8B%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%8F%AF%E7%94%A8%E6%80%A7(TODA)), Trustless Off-chain Data Availability)。这个提案进一步寻求数据可用性方面的创新。可以说，TODA 属于 volition 范畴。提案摘录如下：\n\n`\"...Adamantium，一种拥有自主数据可用性的协议 (Autonomous Data Availability)...它保留了链下数据可用性的扩容优势，同时移除了任何自愿用户的所有信任假设。这些用户自愿做什么？自愿上线；也就是说，即便他们离线了，其资产也不会被盗窃或冻结 —— 相反，这些资产能够从 L2 转移到用户的以太坊主网地址下。\"`\n\n跟 volition 一样，这个方案仅适用于 ZK-rollup。\n\n# 交易成本和吞吐量\n\nRollup 的交易成本已经相当低了，但还不够低。幸好，还有很多可以应用的优化，这将极大降低 gas 成本。此外，还将部署许多技术来提高交易吞吐量。\n\n## An Army of Rollups 一支 Rollup 大军\n\n鉴于主网上 rollup 的轻量级特性，可能会有数百个 rollup 并行运行，每个 rollup 都能承载数十万个用户并且都拥有巨大的吞吐量，所有这些都由以太坊提供支持和安全保障。如果某个 rollup 已饱和 (RPC 或定序者无法承载其流量)，那么用户能够轻易地跳到另一个 rollup 并开始交易。如果你需要的话，分叉一个 rollup 并自己部署一个副本也很简单。\n\n## 有效性证明摊销\n\n有效性证明摊销 (validity proof amortization) 指的是，ZK-rollup 上每一个批量交易的验证总成本由该 batch 内的所有交易分摊。\n\n我将提供一种快速理解摊销概念的方法。\\*\\*请记住，为简单起见，此示例在数学上并不准确。我提供公式只是为了说明；实际上，rollup 交易成本的分摊并不是那么简单。\\*\\*以下为我们的想象场景：\n\n* 更新状态根需要 5,000,000 gas\n* 就像主网一样，用户在 rollup 中进行交易时需要支付 gas 费\n* 每笔交易的价格遵循公式 `x = 5000000 / y`，其中 `x` 是每笔交易的价格，`y` 是任何给定 batch 中的交易数量\n\n你应该能够推断出：\n\n* 在包含 200 笔交易的 batch 中，单笔交易成本为 25,000 gas\n* 而在包含 100,000 笔交易的 batch 中，单笔交易成本为 50 gas，基本上可以忽略不计\n* \n\n如果向某一 batch 提交越多笔交易，交易的摊销成本就越低。这与单片区块链 (如当前的以太坊) 完全相反。以太坊随着活跃用户数量的增加，对区块空间的需求也会增加，从而导致 gas 价格飙升。\n\n摊销的一个例子：**StarkEx 提供了一种称为 SHARP (Shared Prover) 的机制**，也就是在所有 StarkEx 部署中摊销成本。\n\n## Volitions (再一次提到)\n\n大部分关于 volition 的相关信息都在前面讲到了。由于 volition 与 rollup 的吞吐量有关，因此在这里再提一遍。简要回顾：\n\n* Volition 让开发者和用户能够通过 validium 使用链下数据可用性\n* 这种链下数据可用性虽然不如链上数据可用性安全，但可以极大地降低交易成本\n* 除了降低成本外，链下数据可用性还额外释放了大量的交易吞吐量\n\n# 隐私\n\n我们都知道，隐私并非以太坊固有的属性。我们不能期望说，让普通用户和企业放弃自己的金融隐私。默认情况下，ZK-rollup 不具备隐私属性。“ZK-rollup” 中的“零知识”指的是在链下进行计算，然后借助零知识证明在主网上验证计算的有效性。这不意味着“用户的交易活动不被窥探”。当然，隐私问题还有改善的空间。目前，有许多围绕 实现 ZK-rollup 无需许可的隐私方面的工作正在进行。\n\n## 递归证明\n\n在文章[《Rollups 不完全指南》](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html#:\\~:text=One%20important%20compression,SNARKs%20are%20valid)中，Vitalik 列出了 optimistic rollup 和 ZK-rollup 之间的一些主要区别。其中一点就是，两种 rollup 分别如何处理隐私问题。他特别提到了递归证明。递归证明 (Recursive proof) 指在某个证明中验证另一个证明。比如，在某个 SNARK 中验证另一个 SNARK。这是一种便于使用的压缩技术，可以极大地提高效率并降低隐私维护成本。(中文版: <https://www.ethereum.cn/an-incomplete-guide-to-rollups>)\n\n[Aztec](https://aztec.network/) 正在[研究](https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/zk-zk-rollup-code-release-i-97216347b3bc)所谓的 *ZK-ZK-rollup* 或 *ZK²-rollup*，利用他们创新的 [PLONK](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/09/22/plonk.html) 证明和 [Turbo-PLONK](https://docs.zkproof.org/pages/standards/accepted-workshop3/proposal-turbo_plonk.pdf) 以提供隐私交易功能。简而言之：\n\n* [ZK-SNARK](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/05/zksnarks-in-a-nutshell/) 代表着 ZK²-rollup 上的每笔交易。这些是“内部” SNARK。\n* 另一个 ZK-SNARK，即 rollup SNARK，负责证明内部 SNARK 的有效性。\n\n需要注意的是，optimistic roolup 无法实现这一创新，因为它们无法让内部 SNARK 验证安全地在 rollup 外部进行；且数据必须发布在链上。这并不是说 optimistic rollup 不能从零知识证明中受益，但它们的效率和成本效益都会较低。\n\n当前，zkSync 和 Mina Protocol 已经采用了 PLONKs。随着时间的推移，我们期待看到递归证明的进一步创新 (包括[其他类型的 ZK-SNARK 证明](https://medium.com/coinmonks/comparing-general-purpose-zk-snarks-51ce124c60bd)，如 Groth16、Marlin、Fractal、Halo2 等) 为所有 ZK-rollup 带来更便宜、更强大的隐私方案。\n\n![图示：Turbo-PLONK 多项式逻辑单位。cr：零知识峰会 (演讲视频)](https://i.imgur.com/R7rp5DP.jpg)\n\n# 灵活性\n\nZK-rollup 能够随意地在各个方面进行创新，而无需面对 L1 链上可能带来的灾难性故障风险。以 rollup 为中心的以太坊路线图的一个关键原则是，自由市场正在寻找构建 rollup 的所有最佳方法，而不是依赖于一小群核心开发者去假设哪种方案最佳。\n\n由于开发和部署 rollup 是一项无需许可的工作，因此我们会看到不同的 rollup 推出各种各样的机制来吸引用户使用。这包括不同风格的治理、代币经济和流动性激励、去中心化范围内的不同权衡、意识形态的不同表述，甚至 [VM 环境的不同选择](https://github.com/protolambda/optimistic-brainfuck)(如 LLVM、自定义 VM 等等)。\n\n当然，本节所提到的所有内容并非仅 ZK-rollup 独有。尽管 optimistic rollup 不具备 ZK-rollup 所提供的某些功能，但 op 也有许多相同的灵活性。然而，其他 L1 智能合约区块链不能像 rollup 那样快速地迭代其中的功能。请记住，现在是 rollup 和其他 L1 智能合约在进行竞争。\n\n如果某条 L1 链试图迭代太快，而没有进行适当的测试和采取安全措施，那么它的用户就会面临很高的风险。这些网络上的所有资金随时都是黑客眼里的赏金。如果 L1 链出现了故障，那么损失可能是灾难性的。停机时间还会影响到 L1 可能拥有的任何扩容执行环境 (rollup、状态通道等)。因此，优先考虑安全性和去中心化是有好处的。\n\n最坏的情况是，当 rollup 宕机时，在系统修复之前都需要手动操作。可以想象，类似于在 Etherscan 上与合约进行交互，rollup 开发者与应用程序开发者可能会提供一个“应对紧急情况”的门户网站，允许用户在需要时快速简便地手动操作 rollup。幸好，这些快速迭代很可能会在早期得到解决，我猜相关开发工作将会得到高度重视。\n\n# 多种可能\n\n外包计算和数据可用性 (即在 L2 执行计算) 使许多当前无法在主网以太坊或其他智能合约平台上运行的链上应用成为可能。这种新范式还允许我们构建任何现有链上产品的高级版本。\n\n## 应用专用型 ZK-Rollup\n\n虽然本文主要讲述通用计算型 ZK-rollup 的好处，但对于应用专用型 ZK-rollup 的影响也有许多想要讨论的。\n\n### dYdX 交易所\n\n[dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/) 由 [StarkEx](https://starkware.co/product/starkex/) 提供支持，是一个去中心化交易所，支持永续交易、保证金交易、现货交易以及借贷交易。自从推出 L2 版本的交易所，dYdX 的 ETH/USD 代币对产生的流动性已经与 FTX 的相匹敌。虽然其中很大部分是由于其 [DYDX 代币](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dydx)奖励计划所产生的流动性，但我相信 dYdX 或其他一些 ZK-rollup 原生 DEX 总有一天会在交易量和流动性方面超越所有永续合约交易所。\n\n![dYdX 的 ETH 流动性与 FTX 相匹敌，数据截止 2021 年 9 月 26 日。cr: Hsaka](https://i.imgur.com/C5P0Ehe.png)\n\n在用户体验方面，只需一个以太坊钱包和一些 ETH 即可登录并开始在 dYdX 上进行交易。不同于一般的中心化交易所，由于去中心化交易所是非托管的，使用 DEX 不需要 KYC 以及不需要第三方存储用户的个人信息。用户确实需要将资金转到 rollup 中才能使用这个 DEX，但用户对其资金保有控制权，并可根据需要将资金提回主网。据 dYdX 用户所说，其使用体验与中心化交易所一样灵敏。\n\n这种链引起了一些 HFT (high-frequency trading, 高频交易) 群体的关注。假设 HFT 公司是理性且受利益驱动的实体，我猜随着时间的推移，这项活动将主要在 ZK-rollup 上进行。\n\n### Immutable X\n\n另一个迅速获得关注的应用是 [Immutable X](https://www.immutable.com/blog/design-architecture)，这是一种为 NFT 提供巨大可扩展性空间的 volition 用例 (也是由 StarkEx 提供支持)。最近，TikTok 选择 Immutable X 作为发布其 [TikTok Top Moments NFTs](https://tiktok.immutable.com/) 的平台。使用 Immutable X，用户无需支付 100 到 1000 美元的 gas 成本来铸造 NFT，而是以几分钱的价格甚至免费铸造 NFT。摘自 **Immutable X** 的 [alpha 交易公告](https://www.immutable.com/blog/immutable-x-alpha-trading-launch)：\n\n`Immutable X 提供免 gas 和即时交易：对于任何市场、游戏和去中心化应用程序，Immutable X 提供免 gas 的交易 (免 gas 铸造、交易、赚取、收集)、即时NFT 交易 (每秒最多处理 9,000 笔交易)，在保证非托管的前提下，极大地实现了扩容。`\n\n你注意到它们说的能够达到 9000+ TPS 了吗？\n\n## 物理和游戏引擎 (什么时候会在 ZK-Rollup 上爆发？)\n\n一位名叫 [guiltygyoza](https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza) 的推特用户展示了[相当](https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza/status/1452311405437366281)[多](https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza/status/1448709529387032582)其在 [StarkNet](https://starkware.co/product/starknet/) 上进行的物理现象相关[实验](https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza/status/1449637155001798657)。我预计，随着工具变得更加强大和实验继续发展，未来将有大量从前无法想象的新链上游戏。\n\n![简单点阵 & 重力场中的二体问题，在 StarkNet 上运行。cr: guiltygyoza](https://i.imgur.com/xbkIRxD.gif)\n\n## 其他概念\n\nVolition 将为实现 Web3 的愿景带来新方法。例如，区块链原生社交网络之类的东西应该能够极大地利用链下数据可用性。Jack Dorsey 已经[谈论过他的计划](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106?s=20)：将推特变成一个开源的分布式系统，其中推特只是“推特”协议上的一个客户端。Volition (更具体地说应为 validium) 可以在这个场景中发挥关键作用。\n\n同样，也可以想象一下 [Vine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_(service)) 的开源版本，其中用户提交的短视频 (6 秒或更短) 铸造为 NFT。TikTok 和其 ‘Top Moments’ 系列与这个想法相似，但 TikTok 始终是一个闭源实体，搞点其他花样并非坏事。\n\n# 这场竞争会如何发展？\n\nZK-rollup 带来了很多好处，以太坊很快就会让它们发挥自身最大的潜力。但是其他竞争链呢？它们在各种意义上都被超越了，其未来发展会怎样？这是一个很好的问题，不可避免地会有许多复杂的答案。对于它们的命运，我有一些想法。\n\n## 以太坊的实用主义黑洞\n\n在过去的一年里，我们看到了许多“又便宜又快”的兼容 EVM 的链涌现。还有一些声称要在基础层解决区块链三难困境的链上线了，这些链实际上牺牲了去中心化来保证速度和安全性。\n\n现在应该很清楚，通用计算型 ZK-rollup 将比任何 L1 智能合约链都更安全、更快、更去中心化、更具适应性和灵活性，并且更轻量级。这些事实很重要；每条独立的链都将承担不必要的安全开销和风险，同时是劣质产品。\n\n在我看来，未来务实的解决方案是让这些链放弃其冗余的共识机制和数据可用性，成为 ZK-rollup 或意志。 他们应该融入以太坊一流的安全性、数据可用性和结算保证。\n\n在我看来，对于这些区块链而言，未来的实用主义方案是放弃其冗余的共识机制和数据可用性，发展成为一个 ZK-Rollup 或者 Volition。它们应该借用以太坊的一流安全性、数据可用性及其结算保证。\n\n将共识和安全的工作外包给以太坊将使这些链能够专注于执行的工作。在分片上线后并且以 rollup 为中心的世界中，这是它们之间保持相关性的机会。否则，它们的安全维护成本将变得更高而难以维持。随着时间的推移，这将是一个变得更加明显的现实。\n\n![以太坊 (左) & 所有其他 L1 执行层 (右), 大约在 2023 年。cr: NASA/CXC/M.WEISS](https://i.imgur.com/D3PwYbt.jpg)\n\n可以说，像 Solana、Avalanche、Fantom 和 Binance Smart Chain 这样的网络在任何潜在的 rollup 治理代币中都有优势。 这些网络 (以及其他类似网络) 的原生代币：\n\n* 有时间达到某种程度的分布式\n* 是“已知实体”\n* 有交换支持\n* 具有深度的流动性\n\n也就是说，放弃他们冗余的共识机制和安全开销，然后变成以太坊 rollup 并不意味着他们的代币消失了。相反，他们可以重新利用代币来调整证明者和定序者的激励措施或提供链上流动性激励措施。这些链不需要牺牲它们的身份，只需去掉一些危险指数。这对所有人来说都是积极的调整。\n\n## 需要考虑现实情况\n\n当然，这些区块链链的设计者、风投和用户不可能那么快接受这一现实。Meme 很强大，圈内的人都不乏傲慢之心，很多风投都有向散户投资者兜售其产品的梦想。\n\n以前的经验告诉我们，区块链的消亡从来都不是一个快速的过程。[现在你可以在以太坊经典等类似平台上观察到数千个空块](https://blockscout.com/etc/mainnet)，这表明它们缺乏采用。当然，还有其他类似的链在运行着。\n\n## 需要一定的时间\n\n即便这些链愿意选择实用主义的方法，也需要投入大量的研究、准备和注意力来实现这种规模的变化。任何人都需要很长时间才能执行。我直觉 Solana 将会是最早采取这种方法的链之一，也许我的直觉是错的。\n\n# 免责声明\n\n一个以 ZK-rollup 为中心的未来似乎是世界上所有问题的神奇技术解决方案，但需要注意以下几点：\n\n## **General**\n\n一份不全面清单：\n\n* 根据不同 rollup 的设计，中心化定序者可能可以优先执行 [MEV](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/02/mev-and-me/)。\n* 根据 volition 中 validium 的数据可用性委员会的不同实现方式，数据委员会的验证者可能可以恶意冻结用户资金或拒绝更新 validium 的状态。但这种情况并不会影响 volition 的 ZK-rollup 状态。\n* 许多 rollup 出现意味着有更多的流动性场所，无论是代币交易还是 NFT 交易。虽然 ZK-rollup 能够实现在 rollup 和主网之间快速转移资金 (甚至在不同的 rollup 之间也可以)，但流动性碎片化还是可能会造成早期的波动。而 [dAMM](https://medium.com/starkware/damm-decentralized-amm-59b329fb4cc3) 主要就是为了解决这一问题。\n* 运行一个证明者需要消耗一定的算力，因此我们应该找到降低潜在 KW/h 消耗的方法，同时提供证明效率。\n\n  需要注意的是，这种证明工作并不像 PoW 挖矿那种消耗游戏；它不会随着时间的推移而变得更加困难。因此，运行证明者的能源消耗接近以太坊 PoW 的能源消耗是不大可能的。\n\n在我看来，除了 MEV (矿工可提取价值)，我预计市场将会快速地为大多数问题提供解决方案。就 MEV 而言，这是一个棘手的问题，并不是通过单个神奇的解决方案或协议就能解决的。但各种最小化 MEV 和使其民主化的方案将有助于减少其影响。\n\n## Optimistic Rollup\n\n虽然我对于 optimistic rollup 的长期可行性的态度不太乐观，但它仍是以太坊目前最佳的兼容 EVM 的扩容解决方案。通用计算型兼容 EVM 的 ZK-rollup 还没上线，也就是说我们还需要一段时间才能实现本文介绍的所有有点。\n\n[Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) 最近推出了一版升级，[其执行环境将发生巨大的变化](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306) [(中文版)](https://www.ethereum.cn/Layer2/introducing-evm-equivalence)，而这些变化对开发者和用户都非常使用友好。[Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) 将很快进行 [Nitro](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-nitro-sneak-preview-44550d9054f5) 升级，它支持 EVM 兼容性并为用户提供更快的速度。\n\n越来越多 DeFi app 在这两种 rollup 上部署，它们两个网络中都存在着数十亿美元的流动性，两者都非常值得尝试。桥接资产至 Optimism 和 Arbitrum 上只需几分钟！\n\nOptimism 桥接：\n`https://gateway.optimism.io/welcome`\n\nArbitrum 桥接：\n`https://bridge.arbitrum.io/`\n\n请注意在与任一网站交互之前验证每个 URL 的有效性。你可以在 [Optimism 的 Twitter](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC) 和 [Arbitrum 的 Twitter](https://t.co/HUmlnrMAbr?amp=1) 上仔细查看其链接的网站。\n\n在撰写本文时，Optimism 仅限用于通过白名单的智能合约，但用户可以随意使用任何列入白名单的智能合约。 我估计这个白名单机制很快就会取消啦。Arbitrum 没有白名单机制；用户和开发者可以自由地交易和部署他们的东西。\n\n需要注意的是，使用这两个 rollup 本身的桥梁将资产从二层提到主网需要 7 天 (这是 optimistic rollup 处理欺诈证明的方式)。当然，你也可以通过第三方桥来在 rollup 和主网之间转移资产，但需要支付手续费。在使用它们中的任何一个方案之前先自己调研一下，并在使用时仔细检查滑点和费率。\n\n# 总结\n\n我们正面临着一个巨大的范式转变，这将对加密生态系统带来永久的影响。ZK-rollup 将能为以太坊实现扩容，它们会在这方面做到最好。这种范式转变将十分强大，届时会开启所有 L1 智能合约区块链的终结 —— 即便是我们现在所知的以太坊。\n\n关于扩容，有许多不同的提案。为了发明出现在众所周知的灯泡，经历了数千小时的研究和失败，才有后来的成功和实现 —— 当然，这项工作还远未结束。前方的道路充满曲折，但我们的目标却从未如此清晰。\n\n我希望这篇文章能够帮你在思考行业未来时改变自己的思维方式。对于未来格局的猜想令我无比兴奋。\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/rDCKkMM.png](https://i.imgur.com/rDCKkMM.png)\n\nECN的翻译工作旨在为中国以太坊社区传递优质资讯和学习资源，文章版权归原作者所有，转载须注明原文出处以及ethereum.cn，若需长期转载，请联系[eth@ecn.co](http://mailto:eth@ecn.co/)进行授权。",

Ce thread va traiter exclusivement d’analyse technique et de \"price action\".\n\nDans mon trading, je me fie presque exclusivement au mouvement du prix. Le chartisme, les bougies et les volumes sont mes meilleurs amis pour prendre une décision. Pas ou peu d’indicateurs dans mon analyse. Je rentre dans le vif du sujet.\n\nPremièrement je détermine la tendance. Comment ? Différentes techniques, les MM 100 ou 200, Ichimoku, des droites de tendances ou encore déterminer les creux et sommets sont vos amis pour déterminer la tendance.\n\nPerso je repère les creux et les sommets. Je note BOMS (Break Of Market Structure) l’endroit où, si on casse ce sommet ou ce creux, la tendance PEUT être remise en cause. J’insiste sur peut, car ce n’est pas toujours le cas, seulement un premier signe d’essoufflement.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YFjy2lnM_R6ReE6w1uXRQ.png?height=969&width=1518)\n\n[ \n ](https://twitter.com/0xAkina/status/1389238598239666182/photo/1)À partir de ça, je sais si je dois me positionner long ou short. Je me laisse porter par la tendance. Ensuite, je joue la prise de liquidité sous des points bas ou hauts, explication en image.\n\nIci on remarque une prise de liquidité sous la mèche basse de la bougie (également support). Ça peut s’expliquer par une petite manipulation de marché pour que les whales ou institutionnelles fassent péter les SL de petits porteurs pour repartir ensuite avec un meilleur prix.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MaSWQOcHAyFWktb4JAssq.png?height=385&width=605)\n\nBref, ce qu’on cherche, c’est donc une prise de liquidité. Pour accentuer les probabilités et trouver une bonne entrée, il faut des bougies qui montrent un changement de tendance.\n\nIci une pinbar candle qui montre que les acheteurs semblent reprendre de la force au détriment des vendeurs (cela peut être un avalement haussier). Ainsi on se retrouve avec un niveau plébiscité par les acheteurs et en plus la bougie laisse entendre une reprise acheteuse.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oHD7ZK9-Zb9Ey3-UjB_gq.png?height=354&width=605)\n\nAvalement haussier :\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sL01AQ9Lz1B3NGIep1xQN.png?height=316&width=255)\n\nPour clôturer ce set up il nous faut le plan du trade. \n\nPerso, mon SL est souvent sous la bougie sur laquelle on rentre et TP en 3 ou 4 fois sur différents levels qui me semblent important. Mon ratio gain / risque est souvent compris entre 3 et 6.\n\nPar la suite et pour améliorer mon trading, j'aimerais me former plus précisément sur le \"on-chain analysis\" qui peut accentuer mes probabilités.\n\nJe finis sur un petit tip. Il ne faut pas se presser pour trader. Ne pas trader, c'est trader ! Il y a des jours ou je vais me rendre compte que j’ai du mal à lire les graphiques.\n\nPour conclure : on détermine la tendance (grande UT) -on cherche des zones qui nous intéressent (grande UT) -on cherche une bougie de retournement dans cette zone (souvent en petite UT). Voilà une petite aide sur \"comment je trade\" et un set up que j'aime bien !", "timestamp": 1636726665, "digest": "DdKLorVMiPUBA_PZwe3QhOdA0FcIkhAPxY8HcCA4tgc", "contributor": "0xA6534C8bf255F859D309125202ab27e436384fE6"}

I thought I’m in for a deep discussion on just AGI, but the talk was nothing short of spiritual for me. There were a lot of amazing things that Joscha said on the podcast, and I’ll probably write a detailed post on that someday. For this post, one specific thing that he mentioned is relevant. This was in context of what is the ‘true’ nature of reality vs what we perceive it to be. Joscha in his trademark calm demeanor [quips](https://youtu.be/P-2P3MSZrBM?t=3270) that “there is no color or sound in the Real world”.\n\nWe of course know this, but it’s easily forgotten in our daily experience. Kant discussed this quite eloquently in his classic work, ‘Critique of pure reason’ where he differentiated between **Phenomenal** and **Noumenal** ‘things’. Color perceptions are entirely phenomenal. It’s a conscious experience that would not exist in itself if there were no conscious mind to have those experiences in the first place. In addition, the same ‘color’ (i.e., wavelength of light that is reflected vs absorbed) is perceived differently by different people, though they all might agree to call the different perceptions by the same name (for example, there is a lot of [strong evidence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0341-7) that color perception varies across gender).\n\nIn contrast, Kant defined Noumenal as something whose existence does not depend upon being perceived by some mind. These ‘things’ exist independently of us and our sensibilities. (Joscha calls this the ‘[quantum graph](https://youtu.be/P-2P3MSZrBM?t=1820)’ in the podcast)\n\nIn his notion of ‘transcendental idealism’, Kant went on to propose that:\n\n> it is possible to demonstrate the empirical reality of space and time, that is to say, the objective validity of all spatial and temporal properties in mathematics and physics, but this empirical reality involves transcendental ideality. Space and time are forms of human intuition, and **they can only be proved valid for things as they appear to us and not for things as they are in themselves.**\n\nIn general, Kant's investigations in the ‘Transcendental Logic’ lead him to conclude that:\n\n> understanding and reason can only legitimately be applied to things as they appear phenomenally to us in experience. What things are in themselves as being noumenal, independent of our cognition, remains limited by what is known through phenomenal experience.\n\nThis brings us to the title of this post. To begin to talk about ‘Being what is’, we need to first clearly define ‘Being’ and ‘What is’ to the best of our ability. I give the Kantian context above because I think that it’s a clear way of wrapping one’s mind around ‘what-is’:\n\n**‘What-is’ is Kant’s ultimate Noumena.**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n> “Whereever you look, you see what you are looking for.” - RamDass\n\nTrying to observe what-is is a key initial teaching for anyone exploring meditation. A lot of guided meditations start with the instruction of bringing awareness to the breath. Every thought and sensation is allowed to appear as it is. The only other instruction is to observe what is happening without trying to change or engage with it in any other way.\n\nThe challenge of course is that **the very act of observation (Phenomenal) changes what-is (Noumena) and mixes it up with our mind’s what-ought-to-be.** Our conditioning will always color the way we observe and interpret the information from our senses, and this sensory information is itself a model of the Noumenal Reality. The simple act of noticing the sensations arising in consciousness carries with it a ‘concept’ map of the body in which it is apparently located. The apparent act of observation also creates the observer (the ‘me’) who is seemingly acting on objects.\n\nSo how can one really *observe* what-is if the act of observation will change it? Well, you cannot. **The only possibility is *****being ***what is.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis subject-object perception is a by-product of our brain’s basic nature of information processing and discrimination (most of this happens in [the neocortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex)).\n\nThe emergent mind manufactures various preferences, likes, goals, desires, needs and wants that fracture what-is into multitude of opposites: Good-bad, right-wrong, pain-pleasure, happy-sad, true-false. Fear is a key underpinning knob of this system, and the dial is adjusted via an interplay of a variety of conditioned patterns. Some of these patterns go back thousands of years in our evolutionary history and they manifest as instinctive fight or flight responses.\n\nFor most of us now, our basic survival is not under threat on most occasions, and we don’t know what to ‘do’ with this default evolutionary survival toolkit that we ship with. Since it doesn’t really need to be used to ensure survival against a harsh environment, we use it in our everyday life. This large hammer of survival instincts creates an existential nail out of every life situation. A work situation makes our anxiety and stress go up to the same degree as if we are going to be attacked by a wild animal. A small financial setback floods our body with cortisol, as if our food security is under threat.\n\nInstead of letting this toolkit run our day to day life, we should try to transcend it. It is simply not required in most life situations. And in an unforeseen situation that poses an actual threat to your survival, trust that your default toolkit will come to your aid automatically.\n\nThis transcendence of the toolkit requires you to practice abandoning the use of your mind when it is not really needed. Just like your tongue is not actively trying to taste when there is nothing in your mouth, we should learn how to switch off our discriminating minds when there is no real problem to solve.\n\nMeditation is the practice of switching off your mind’s default activity - trying to solve so-called problems by discriminating what-is into what-ought-to-be. The resulting state of such a meditation is called ‘Being’ - a state of complete non-discrimination.\n\nBeing is a state of complete acceptance and surrender by your mind, where there is a momentary cessation of its entire activity. And in this state of complete non-discrimination, there is an opportunity to be what-is, not by observation, but by complete dissolution of any subject and object.\n\nIt’s impossible to describe this state in words. The various pointers that sages have left us over the years can cause this collapse of the mind to happen, but there are no rules to this. It’s a causeless happening. The beingness is not due to or dependent upon any sort of intellectual understanding. It is our essential nature that cannot ever be recognized by the mind ; the[ empty set](https://intuitiontree.substack.com/p/empty-set) that contains everything.\n\nAny attempt by the mind to cause this will necessarily lead to illusions that can get quite tricky to see through. An extremely common one is the fact that **once your mind understands the above intellectually, it tries to objectify its non-discriminating state itself.** [1](#footnote-1)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nOne practical ‘method’ that I’m trying out to get around this trickery is the ‘fractal object collapse’ meditation. In a nutshell, it’s a state of **recursive** observation that collapses the process of observation completely.\n\nStart by doing the only thing you can ‘do’ - observe your mind’s discrimination process by the automatic stream of thoughts that come up to the surface. When you initially begin, the act of such an observation will become an object in itself. Instead of resting your mind here, continue to follow the process of observing-objectification ad infinitum. As you continue to observe recursively, you will feel a sense of going deeper and deeper into a bottomless pool of pure awareness. The effort can feel excruciatingly frustrating since there will be a sense of the process always being one step ahead of your ability to catch it via observation. Observation -> Objectification -> Observation….\n\nEventually, there would be a complete cessation of this observation process and hence any objectification. No one can say how ‘long’ this will last, but you’ll notice a complete rest and relaxation of the observing-objectification loop. The energy being spent on this process will subside and along with it your mind will come to a sudden pause; a glimpse of the great silence and peace of the void that lies at the core of your being.\n\nAnd That is pure ‘being what is’.\n\n***Root:***\n\n*   [The Critique of Pure Reason, by Immanuel Kant](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4280/4280-h/4280-h.htm)\n*   [Joscha Bach: Artificial Consciousness and the Nature of Reality | Lex Fridman Podcast ](https://youtu.be/P-2P3MSZrBM)\n", "timestamp": 1636726782, "digest": "WbRZCc_q1rSAplzBHsDSnCnMQ58b4xUhjfjMFgUZhqc", "contributor": "0x24e3e7bFd8B9E9C3C92873690D9c3e2949E39568"}

This something has given rise to an intelligence in the universe that can pose such a question. Another way to put this is: we see this something and the so called ‘fine-tuning’ of the universe because life as we know it could not have evolved in any other set of circumstances.\n\nA lot of philosophers and physicists balk at this answer, since it eradicates any need for further inquiry into the question. Nonduality is also assumed to be, by the mind, a similar ‘cop out’ on trying to really answer the question. I have personally witnessed a lot of people frown when the conversation reaches a point where someone utters:\n\n‘Things just are.’\n\n'I am’.\n\n‘It all is just a happening.’\n\nIn this post, I’ll try and use a logical structure to basically say the same thing, but hopefully present a more ‘satisfying’ answer to the mind.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFirst up, let’s understand a term called ‘primitive notion’ that is key to the whole body of mathematics. Here is how Wikipedia [defines the term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion):\n\n> A **primitive notion** is a concept that is not defined in terms of previously-defined concepts. It is often motivated informally, usually by an appeal to intuition and everyday experience.\n>\n> For example, in contemporary geometry, *point*, *line*, and *contains* are some primitive notions. Instead of attempting to define them, their interplay is ruled (in [Hilbert's axiom system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axiom_system)) by axioms like \"For every two points there exists a line that contains them both.\n\nAnd here are two key examples of primitive notion that are relevant to the analogy that I’ll be building below:\n\n> [Set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory): The concept of the [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)) is an example of a primitive notion. As Mary Tiles writes: \\[The\\] 'definition' of 'set' is less a definition than an attempt at explication of something which is being given the status of a primitive, undefined, term. As evidence, she quotes Felix Hausdorff: \"A set is formed by the grouping together of single objects into a whole. A set is a plurality thought of as a unit.\"\n>\n> [Naive set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory): **The [empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set) is a primitive notion.** **To assert that it exists would be an implicit [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom).**\n\nNow let's consider a set **S** of all possible Objects, Processes and Concepts defined as follows:\n\n**S ε  {O, P, C}**\n\nwhere:\n\n**Objects:** Whatever your mind labels as it perceives via the sensory apparatus of the five senses and thought. O **ε** {sights, sounds, smells, touches, tastes, thoughts and the infinite combination of these internal and external perceptions}\n\n**Processes:** State changes that appear to be an event in time. P **ε**  {Bodily and mental functions, aging, sunrise, ...}\n\n**Concepts**: Laws, theories, explanations, definitions, language, logic. C **ε** {Laws of thermodynamics and energy conversation, general relativity, evolution, natural selection, Choice, Desire, set and number theory, axioms, primitive notions....}\n\nNote the inter-relatedness of these three elements of S. Some Concepts are set of Processes that talk about Objects. Some Processes are set of Objects that change and are explained via a Concept. And since both Concepts and Processes have names, and are perceived, labelled and categorised by your mind, they are all Objects as well.\n\nThis inter-relatedness makes the differentiation almost trivial , but the point of defining such a set is to point you to this subtle fact: **Your whole *experience* of consciousness is basically S ε {O,P,C}, whereas consciousness *itself*  is the raw awareness that contains these.** \n\nSymbolically, consciousness is the brackets { } that contain everything that can be talked or thought about. These curly brackets of Awareness contain and enable everything that we perceive.\n\n**This empty set of pure Awareness is a primitive notion of everything that is. To assert that it just is, is an implicit axiom of reality.**\n\nPrimitive notions are bedrock to all rational and scientific thought. If you believe in mathematics and if you have ‘faith’ in the truth of its primitive notions, how can the primitive notion of consciousness be treated differently?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen the bomb of nonduality was first detonated in my mind around a decade ago, the fallout was wide. It look a long time to pick up the pieces and try and see the whole. One of the natural questions that the mind throws up in this journey is:\n\n“So what should I ‘do’ with this deep realization?”\n\nImagine for a moment that 'you' have a choice between picking being identified with S **ε** {O,P, C} OR the the empty set {}. What would you choose?\n\nThe Concept of choice and an individual who is making the choice is of course contained in 'C' itself to begin with, so what we are really asking is : Can an element of set ever become aware of the set in which it is contained? To be even more precise - Can a part ever realise the whole that contains it?\n\nThis question is behind the entire enterprise of illusory spiritual seeking that has goals such as enlightenment. The thing that is doing the seeking (the person/mind) is *necessarily* going to be caught in this act forever.  To be what the seeking is trying to be, it needs to paradoxically stop seeking in the first place.\n\nOsho talks about the same things from the perspective of effort. He says that in the initial stages of spiritual seeking, a lot of effort will be put by an individual, and it is very much required. Think of it as laying the ground work and foundation for the eventual giving up of all effort. A point will come when no more effort will be required, because the empty set will make itself known when all effort drops away. (We all are this empty set every night during deep sleep, but there is no memory of it for our minds to refer to. Remember, memory is also something that is within the set 'P' of Processes).\n\nSo how can one 'choose' to be the empty set? By dropping all effort and seeking. Let the entire process of cosmic evolution that is burning like a fire within you reveal itself to your Awareness as an undeniable evidence of your true nature - a cosmic process that is happening on its own.\n\nOur minds have made us deeply believe that choosing {O,P,C} is the 'right' or natural way of being. Of course the mind will choose something that ensures its own survival. It is after all a product of arguably the most complex natural selection process know to itself.\n\nFalling back to the source, this Great nothingness, is our eventual destiny anyway. The second law of thermodynamics guarantees this state of high disorder and randomness where complex ordered life form will have to expend an energy that is greater than all the available energy to continue existing. That is when the process of evolution comes to a definite end. If you do not like this line of argument, just look at your own life. You will die one day and your body-mind implementation will come to an end. You return to the nothingness and become the empty set. So why not touch it time to time while you are within the set?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n***Root:***\n\n* [Meditation : The Art of Ecstasy by Osho](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13513058-meditation)\n* Godel’s incompleteness theorem. (Here’s a [great read on it](https://infinityplusonemath.wordpress.com/2017/08/04/godels-incompleteness-theorems/#fnref-4746-cardinality) that explains it quite well).\n  * Godel's first incompleteness theorem basically says that in any mathematical system, there are things you’ll want to prove, but can’t.\n  * The second incompleteness theorem says that within your mathematical system, you cannot prove that you can’t have contradictions.\n\n> As long as your mathematics is complicated enough to include the natural numbers (which, I think we can agree, is not a particularly high bar), then it must have statements which cannot be proven true *or* false. They are unprovable.\n\n* [Infinite regress - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_regress)\n* [Axiom - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom)", "timestamp": 1636726228, "digest": "505dnKhPeqocrFGS96VoNV8rhGVX0RsQ1OK5skoNYig", "contributor": "0x24e3e7bFd8B9E9C3C92873690D9c3e2949E39568"}

I re-read it recently and let my intuition lean over the edge once again.\n\nHere is how my mind deconstructed the poem initially:\n\n*   The mind perceives time due to the constantly changing contents of our consciousness. Everything is seemingly changing into something else as seen via this arrow of time, which only points in one direction. This is what Stickney calls the ‘segment of our station’.\n*   Based on our conditionings, we classify a certain category of change as ‘progress’. Progress can be only be defined on a finite time scale, as we traverse our segment of time. At an infinite time scale (or a time scale that is beyond our mind’s imagination), life starts from nothing and goes back to ‘naught’.\n*   The discrimination of our mind makes us look only at the bright stars of progress, against a sky of ever changing things. Our mind’s ‘aspirations’ make us forget the sky *in *which these stars shine forth and grab our attention.\n*   Certainties declared and promised by various belief systems (logic positivism, science, mathematics, religions, spiritual practices and methodologies) are what champions their faith. All believers are inherently seeking something true, and these belief systems help them march on this journey. All seekers are driven by this deep desire to ‘discover’ the eternal Truth. A Truth that nihilates all their seeking and desires. This final and ultimate desire is the desire to be desire-less.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis particular poem reads a lot like [an English translation of Upanishads](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B004DI7R4W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8\\&psc=1) that I’m currently reading. One of the passages that I particularly liked, which is relevant to this poem:\n\n> \"You are what your deep, driving desire is. As your desire is, so is your will. As your will is, so is your deed. As your deed is, so is your destiny.\"\n>\n> \\[Brinhdaranyaka Upanishad]\n\nStickney was a student of Hindu scriptures and studied Bhagavad-Gita and the Upanishads in details. From his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumbull_Stickney):\n\n> He wrote there two dissertations, a Latin one on the Venetian humanist [Ermolao Barbaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ermolao_Barbaro \"Ermolao Barbaro\"), and the other on *Les Sentences dans la Poésie Grecque d'Homère à Euripide*. The latter is openly indebted to *[The Birth of Tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_Tragedy \"The Birth of Tragedy\")* and to Stickney's study of the *[Bhagavad Gita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita \"Bhagavad Gita\")* under the tutelage of [Sylvain Lévi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvain_L%C3%A9vi \"Sylvain Lévi\").[\\[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumbull_Stickney#cite_note-2)\n\nThe core structure via which he reaches the final line of the first stanza is quite remarkable. Starting with the passage of time as the root illusion in which we seem to be trapped, he catches hold of other key illusions such as progress, aspirations, victories, certainties and ends by pointing out to the reader that the real ‘grip’ that we are under is our deep, driving desire to realize the ultimate Truth.\n\nThe line about ‘better distribution’ between dreaming mind and real truth is worth lingering on. The reign of mind that human civilization is currently under conjures up all the illusions mentioned above. Most of that reign is concerned with phantom goals and desires that will turn out to be nothing but distractions that mind threw up for you to keep you ignorant of the Truth. But a small set of those same goals will lead to paths such as ‘seeking enlightenment’, where the seeker rejects almost all the distractions, to surrender to this final distraction. This can be called a better distribution from a practical sense of how to lead one’s life, a sort of a [truce](https://intuitiontree.substack.com/p/truce) between your mind and your True nature.\n\nStickney knew that a lot of readers will utter in their minds - \"I can’t understand you”. In some sense the poem ends with the first stanza. But is it possible to take one last crack at trying to explain what can never be explained with words?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nPoetry is a great vehicle for spiritual musing, because it can create a negative space from the explicit meaning of the words as they flow together. The juxtaposition teases a range of interpretations and the reader’s creativity fills this negative space. The reader becomes entangled with the poem, and intertwined with the author’s creativity.\n\nStickney is trying to point out to the reader that the so called meaning of his words have a natural limit. The medium cannot truly describe the medium *in *which and o*ut of* which it emerges in the first place. A part cannot show you the whole that it is a part of (unless you see the part as a [fractal](http://www.fractal.org/Bewustzijns-Besturings-Model/Fractal-levels.pdf)). Language cannot ever describe the place it comes from. One has to go beyond this edge of meaning and feel the Truth experientially, rather than understanding intellectually.\n\nThe negative space of the ‘things I have not said’ is yet another pointer, just like language. It points to the Truth that is beyond words. Once you touch this Truth , albeit for a brief moment, it will leave you feeling dizzy.

Property means owning internet media like images (JPEGs!), audio, video, gifs, memes, episodes, web pages, blog posts, social posts, domains, and increasingly virtual land, items, characters, and skins in the Metaverse. Before crypto, all this property could be duplicated infinitely with “right click and save”. But crypto allows true digital property rights, backed up by math, not a government, and that will be the most powerful force on the Internet over the next 20 years. Yes, “right click and save” still exists, but with [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thesmarmybum/status/1443259893411049475?lang=en), Reddit, and other services enforcing these digital property rights, duplication/plagiarism will fade away with time.\n\nDomains (like mirror.xyz) we the original Internet property. They are a pointer to a particular computer connected to the internet, most likely serving up a web page you are reading. They can’t be “right click and save”-ed but have a w[hole host of other issues](https://recompilermag.com/issues/issue-1/the-web-is-broken-how-dns-breaks-almost-every-design-principle-of-the-internet/). Enter ENS, which bring cryptographically secure property ownership to domains and is one of the OG projects to come out of the Ethereum Foundation. They were doing NFTs waaayyy before they were cool. ENS has been around for a while and it’s most used as a more human-readable way to send tokens to a particular Ethereum address…although can be used for much more. It’s become a service for decentralized identity, NFT registration and trading, and a universal utility service for the crypto space. So I’m happy they’ve undergone progressive decentralization and will be governed by [a DAO of $ENS token holders](https://openorgs.info/) going forward. They’re a great example of a humble service with real utility transitioning to community ownership and governance. [Claim your airdrop and delegate](https://claim.ens.domains/) if you haven’t already and congrats to the team on a successful DAO launch! 🚀\n\n\n---\n\n[https://ribbonfinance.medium.com/ribbon-treasury-ee311f7ce7d8](https://ribbonfinance.medium.com/ribbon-treasury-ee311f7ce7d8)\n\nWhen people think of DeFi, they think of speculating on new tokens or yield farming APY on new, crazy food protocols. 🤑 But those were just the initial use cases; DeFi will be the financial system for the internet. DAOs will be the native organizations of the internet and can be described as any group of people online with a shared wallet and economy. Well DAO wallets need financial services, just like any other organization on the planet, and they get those services through DeFi.\n\nRibbon Finance is one of the most promising DeFi projects in the derivatives/structure product space. In the next few years, more of the TradFi structured product market will move to public, smart contract blockchains because settlement time (t+0) and “code as law” features make these markets 10x more efficient than the legacy marketplaces. Traditional hedge funds have massive back offices to deal with these inefficiencies of the legacy markets, and those will largely be replaced with DeFi infrastructure.\n\nRibbon’s new Treasury offering is a structured product for DAOs, so they can earn stablecoin income on the large protocol treasuries they’ve amassed. This allows the DAO to get some liquidity and paying for services without selling protocol tokens and impacting the market. The big trends here are 1) DAOs are becoming the “first best customer” for many DeFi projects and 2) structured products have massive growth potential on their impact. And Ribbon has been leading the way on both. 🎀", "timestamp": 1636727068, "digest": "Mh6XcrzWfqTJLS_QUBkATpmbZKGpOk_QEttdRHxXNoI", "contributor": "0x869eC00FA1DC112917c781942Cc01c68521c415e"}

Pour la première fois, les investisseurs du monde entier peuvent acheter sur le marché immobilier par le biais de la blockchain.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qJtlsm0uRzOJIp6jGepcy.png?height=500&width=500)\n\nJe cite la plateforme, « RealToken fournit aux investisseurs une méthode simple pour acheter des propriétés fractionnées et tokenisées, en tirant parti du système juridique américain et de l'émission de jetons sans autorisation et sans restriction grâce à Ethereum. »[ \n ](https://twitter.com/0xAkina/status/1405179956460756998/photo/1)Pour faire simple, la propriété est répartie sur un nombre fini de jetons représentatifs qui seront vendus à différents propriétaires et leur octroiera des loyers hebdo à vie.\n\nSelon moi, le marché est énorme et la demande va être croissante. Il n’y a qu’à regarder les biens qui sont sold out dès la sortie. Imaginez investir dans l’immo dès 50 $ et avoir des intérêts de plus de 10% par an (le banquier en sueur).\n\nComment l’entreprise procède ? Dans un premier temps, elle achète les biens, puis créer une société et tokenise le bien à travers sa plateforme. Beaucoup de documentation sur la plateforme, on parle quand même d’un bien immobilier donc lisez et DYOR !\n\nPour chaque propriété RealT a une société de gestion immobilière qui gère la propriété au nom des propriétaires de RealToken. La société de gestion immobilière recherche des locataires, perçoit les loyers et gère les réparations, de sorte que nous, acheteurs, n’ayons rien à faire. Après avoir rempli le KYC et signés les documents, l’onglet marketplace vous indiquera les potentiels tokens de maison à acheter. L’achat se fait en CB ou en crypto de manière très simple.\n\nPosséder une propriété avec RealT vous permet de percevoir un loyer chaque semaine. Le loyer est payé à l'aide d'un stablecoin en dollars américains, envoyé sur votre portefeuille xDai ou Ethereum.\n\nL'immobilier reste un investissement relativement safe et optimale pour diversifier son portefeuille. Cela m’a permis d’allouer un léger capital dessus, qui sera donc moins volatil, mais très performant malgré tout.\n\nPourquoi j’affectionne le projet ? Il utilise la blockchain pour donner l’opportunité, à chacun, de devenir propriétaire. Pour tout investisseur la diversification est importante, il est préférable de posséder des actifs risqués, moins risqués, avec beaucoup de rendement…\n\nIci, RealT nous permet d’acquérir de l’immobilier grâce à la blockchain. Les avantages sont multiples : -Investir dans l’immo avec une faible somme, pour diversifier son capital -Gagner des intérêts, entre 10 et 12% par an\n\n -Pas d’entretien et peu de paperasse pour le bien\n\nEn revanche, certains frais sont à prévoir comme ceux de l’entretien ou réparation du bien qui seront déduit du loyer, d’autres concernant la location comme les frais de gestion du bien, frais de RealT et assurance. Ces frais restent relativement faibles.\n\nSi vous avez des questions, ils répondent rapidement sur Twitter, par mail et ont une FAQ sur leur site.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qMQApHInSZtHUpFbTPUcF.png?height=897&width=1401)\n\n0xAkina", "timestamp": 1636727077, "digest": "QpmqVEQQvHaL_qEZ9HpEg7jDfh_vaor6czuY-r1oO68", "contributor": "0xA6534C8bf255F859D309125202ab27e436384fE6"}
{"id": "TeyOtDkFhb__kRgCOw63-mIyHOX8vmoIdogBAn7-kTg", "title": "Comment évaluer un projet crypto \n", "body": "Je vous donne des outils simples et des pistes de réflexions pour faire vos propres recherches !\n\nTout d'abord, un projet, c’est avant tout UNE VISION. Qu'est-ce que l'entreprise veut apporter à la société, quelle technologie ? Quel bien ou service ?\n\nIl est nécessaire lorsque l'on investit dans une crypto de connaitre le projet. Est-ce que cela répond à un vrai besoin, le marché est-il conséquent, saturé ? Est-ce un besoin temporaire ?\n\n\\- LA TEAM - En crypto, il y a de tout ! Du good, mais aussi des scams. Pour les éviter, il faut se renseigner au maximum sur la team ! Fouillez LinkedIn et autres applications, pour avoir des informations et faites vos recherches !\n\nExemple avec la team [@Polkadot](https://twitter.com/Polkadot)\n\nOn retrouve le co founder d'Ethereum, créateur de solidity, des ingénieurs diplômés d'Oxford. Tous avec de solides compétences en informatique. Le diplôme n'est pas le plus important, regardez plutôt les expériences de la personne !\n\nSi les fondateurs sont \"connus\" cela est un élément qui peut faire penser qu'ils n'ont pas d'intérêts à nuire à leur image (même si par expérience, cela s'est déjà produit maintes fois).\n\n\\- LE WHITEPAPER - Le Whitepaper résume l'idée du projet et les moyens mise en œuvre pour y parvenir. C'est l'élément à lire lorsque l'on veut investir dans un projet. La qualité rédactionnelle, la technicité des propos sont des éléments à identifier.\n\n\\- LA ROADMAP - La roadmap explique les échéances et grandes étapes du projet. Un projet qui respecte ses deadlines sans trop de retard souligne du sérieux et du travail de la part de la team. Exemple avec la roadmap de [@EthernityChain](https://twitter.com/EthernityChain) qui se veut précise et chargée !\n\n\\- LE MARCHE - Élément à prendre en compte même si, selon moi, ce n'est pas le plus important. Nous sommes dans un marché early, et il ne faut pas forcément être le premier pour être le leader. Il faut privilégier la qualité et l'innovation, si l'on veut dominer un secteur.\n\nNéanmoins, des secteurs comme les jeux vidéos ou de nombreux projets se placent comme Decentraland, Thesandbox ... peuvent être mis en concurrencent et devront 'potentiellement' se partager les parts de marché. Même si, comme je l'ai expliqué précédemment, le marché est early !\n\n\\- LE CONCRET - On aime voir le projet évoluer, communiquer sur les réseaux, c'est humain ! Quels sont les choses de faites par la team, qu'apporte le projet concrètement. Souvent le projet plaît, mais quand on regarde concrètement, peu de choses sont mises en place.\n\nPour exemple, je peux prendre Cardano, où c'est smart contacts ne sont pas encore utilisé, un projet qui plait, mais en attendant pas de concret et ça, ce n’est pas forcément ce qu'on veut voir, même si c'est en train de changer :)\n\n\\- LA TOKENOMIE - Cette partie est sans doute la plus compliquée de ce thread. Elle concerne les tokens avec un aspect un peu mathématique. Un token a des données importantes, parmi elles, sa supply à un moment T et en fully diluted. Cela donne une idée de la valorisation.Le prix seul ne veut rien dire, si le token coute 5 euros, mais il y a que 1000 tokens alors il sera sous-évalué par rapport à une crypto qui coute 1 euro, mais il y en a 20 000 tokens en circulation. Ce qui compte, c’est la marketcap (prix \\* total des tokens).\n\nGrâce à ça on peut comparer les valorisations de crypto dans le même secteur, je dis du même secteur. Exemple concret, deux projets avec un jeu dans un monde virtuel.[@AxieInfinity](https://twitter.com/AxieInfinity) avec plus de 15 millions de capitalisations semble survalorisé par rapport à [@TheSandboxGame](https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame) avec ses 1.6 milliard. La capitalisation peut être utilisée comme une prise de profit, si la capi dépasse 2 milliards, alors je sors de l'actif.\n\n\\- LE MARKETING - Différents outils comme google trend, nous aide à analyser les tendances et les projets qui attirent. Dans la même dynamique, CoinMarketCap réfère les cryptos avec le plus de recherches et donc les projets avec un potentiel flux acheteur :Attention, cela ne veut pas dire que le projet est sérieux, c'est même souvent le contraire avec l'apparition des Dogecoin ou Shibacoins, mais ça peut donner une idée de projets qui plaisaient !\n\n\\-LA COMMUNAUTÉ- Dernier point, et non des moindres, l'engouement et la communauté d'un projet. Fouillez le discord et télégram d'un projet pour se rendre compte si le projet arrive à hype beaucoup de monde ou non. Ces derniers seront susceptibles d'acheter le token par la suite.\n\nIl existe bien d'autres facteurs à prendre en compte comme le site qui, je trouve, peut-être trompeur, car un beau site ne veut pas forcément dire projet solide. J'espère avoir mis l'essentiel dans ce thread sans aller trop dans les détails pour que cela reste lisible :)", "timestamp": 1636727320, "digest": "37rAqvtepQ3TY9tDy-Jkc-sZZaiwU4Mysdh1qR9juDc", "contributor": "0xA6534C8bf255F859D309125202ab27e436384fE6"}

It is not uncommon to hear of DeFi projects that have grown by a hundred to a thousand times, and such momentum is still ongoing.\n\nDeFi infrastructures have matured sufficiently for new projects to raise much-needed funds through new DeFi protocols. This method is called an Initial DEX Offering (IDO). Compared to ICOs and IEOs, IDOs can be seen as a comprehensive improvement in every measure, and its advantages have been recognized by an increasing number of investors and projects.\n\nThese advantages include openness and transparency, fast transaction speed, high liquidity, and decentralization. At the same time, investors can have direct control over their own assets, and projects can quickly launch their tokens on the secondary market after their IDO ends.\n\nIn its earliest iteration, HyperDAO (HDAO) operated as a one-stop crowdfunding platform, providing investors and projects with customizable, secure, and decentralized financial services. The platform’s professionalism and stellar performance has been recognized by users on many occasions. The official launch of HDAO’s IDO launchpad marks the birth of a completely decentralized crowdfunding platform and the many advantages that the IDO launchpad possess have also prompted more projects to apply for an IDO through HDAO.\n\nHDAO’s new IDO platform is dedicated to providing projects with the necessary support it needs to conduct an IDO, and the platform pledges to deliver these services at the lowest rates in the market. At the same time, the platform will ensure that due diligence is done on each project, and every project must provide a security deposit before an IDO. This is done to guarantee the trustworthiness of each project to protect the interests of users. Other advantages include:\n\n1. No rug pulls: investors’ funds will be stored in a custodial wallet. These funds will only be released to the project team after their investors have voted to do so through a DAO;\n2. Quality assurance: The platform will conduct a full range of due diligence on the technical capabilities, operational efficiency and credibility of the team for all new projects.\n3. Fairness and equity: The implementation of a tiered system to ensure that investors on all levels can get an equal allocation.\n4. Transparency: Transparency is of the highest priority for every new project, which must store its funds in a third-party custodian that can be easily traceable on the blockchain network.\n\nAs of now, HDAO has received IDO applications from 18 projects around the world, and HDAO will conduct a full range of due diligence measures next as a follow-up on these applications. Every project selected by HDAO must meet a strict list of criteria to proceed. HDAO's vision is to build a bridge connecting quality projects and investors and the team seeks to continue to provide a transparent, fast, and sustainable IDO platform, establish measures to protect investors and provide the necessary support to allow new projects to flourish within the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHDAO has been consistently building up its ecosystem and has recently announced a strategic partnership with NFT platform Dropgen to promote the development of the NFT sector. Right now, HDAO has launched a campaign with football dead punks (a subsidiary of Dropgen) to gift 10 NFTs to 10 lucky supporters. For more information on participating in this campaign, please follow HDAO’s social media channels to get the latest updates.", "timestamp": 1636727496, "digest": "vWGqI6srOqd8mchEbI8A0Y8wLyKBIiMyr9Szki7bFNE", "contributor": "0xD37CFf84883f8b92e778b7DAc0cA354e28741e09"}

Ils existent sous différentes formes :\n\n\\-Un logiciel que l'on installe sur son ordinateur personnel. On parle de deskstop wallet. Nécessite d'avoir un PC très sécurisé. Il présente l'avantage d'être gratuit. Utilisable seulement sur PC.\n\n\\-Une application mobile : Ce wallet a l'avantage d'être présent sur smartphone donc très pratique. Cela permet de payer rapidement notamment chez les commerçants.

Cela présente l'avantage d'être pratique, gratuit et permet de se connecter rapidement aux Dapps. Attention, exposition aux hacks et piratage. On retrouve Metamask.\n\nAu contraire, les colds wallets sont moins faciles d'utilisations, mais présente l'avantage de ne pas être relié à internet, permettant une sécurité plus élevée.-Le paper wallet invite l'utilisateur à écrire sur une feuille de papier toutes les informations pour sécuriser son wallet. Dangereux, mais cela permet de le sécuriser totalement de hack ou autres, car non connecté à internet. Attention à ne pas perdre votre papier.\n\n\\-Un hardwhare wallet est un portefeuille physique sous forme de clé. Ledger est l'un des leaders dans le domaine.

The team believes that the future of blockchain is not just about competition, but also about teamwork and mutual cooperation. Although there are already several established blockchain networks in the market, there are significance differences in their consensus model, applications, technical foundation, and so on. Most networks are also “functionally isolated”, and cannot communicate or share value with each other. Each blockchain network hosts different applications, encompassing DeFi, NFT, GameFi and more. However, the adoption of these blockchain applications will be heavily restricted and segregated within “gated networks” if the issue of interoperability is not addressed. \n\nTherefore, to better serve its global network of users, HyperDAO has decided to upgrade its network with the construction of a cross-chain bridge. The project has bridged its native token HDAO to Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which would reduce transaction costs and settlement times, and would benefit HDAO users as a whole.\n\n**Why is BSC network the preferred choice for HyperDAO?**\n\n• While the team did consider other alternatives such as Solana or Cosmos, BSC was ultimately chosen thanks to its unprecedented functionality, including its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\n• BSC was created by Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. The chain also boasts smart contract functionalities and EVM-compatibility, which means that it can easily port over apps and users on the Ethereum network.\n\n• BSC can achieve 3-second block times by using the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, and its network fees are also much lower than Ethereum.\n\nHyperDAO’s growing focus on interoperability will ensure that its network can cater to a growing number of users. In the future, it will work with more blockchain networks to cultivate mainstream adoption. Soon, blockchain interoperability will be more seamless, and applications within the HyperDAO’s ecosystem would be able to connect with other blockchains. HyperDAO’s cross-chain bridge to BSC is only the start, and the team has expressed that they will continue to make necessary upgrades and adjustments to improve the user experience. \n\n**Plans for the Future**\n\nIn addition to the cross-chain bridging, HyperDAO has also decided to host a node recruitment session to select leaders to take charge of governance decisions within the network. There will be a total of 9 nodes, and users selected to manage them will be conferred major responsibilities to maintain the overall security and stability of the HDAO network. All major decisions about the future direction of HyperDAO will be decided via community voting, and nodes can bring forth proposals that they deem beneficial to the community. \n\nOn the IDO side, as of October 22, more than 13 projects have applied to conduct an IDO on the HyperDAO platform, and the trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. As a one-stop decentralized crowdfunding platform for promising projects, HyperDAO will continue to provide investors and entrepreneurs with safe, transparent, fair and equitable financial services. \n\nWhen investors participate in an IDO organized by HyperDAO, the platform will ensure the safety of their funds, while adhering to the principles of fairness, security and transparency. The credibility of all new projects will be verified to protect the interests of users. As such, new measures that will be established include:\n\nCustodian wallet – all investors’ funds will be stored in a custodian wallet (an address managed by a third party, which can be queried through a blockchain explorer). Funds will be released to the project team only after all users in the DAO vote to do so. \n\nDue diligence – The platform will conduct comprehensive due diligence on the technical capability, operational efficiency and team members of all new projects.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1636727620, "digest": "yBsDZGIVZIa0Dy8_DT492n1W92chvCOlXTx36mKgYxo", "contributor": "0xD37CFf84883f8b92e778b7DAc0cA354e28741e09"}

01\n\n八月是一年当中最难熬的时节。不仅仅因为炎热天气带来的烦躁情绪，还因为上半年的假期已经用光了，下半年的假期还要再等两个月。而我在年初焕发的对工作的热情已经消散殆尽。整个人变得非常颓废和不想上班。想去户外、想去山里，总之就是想逃离城市和办公室。\n\n早上，在迟到的恐惧情绪的驱使下，我艰难地从床上爬了起来。眯着眼睛将身体拖进洗手间，拧开水龙头。咳咳！像老人短促的叹息似的。艹 ！我脑子里骂道。停水了！\n\n这是一间三室一厅的房子。当初租的时候并没有发现它有哪里不妥，室友还算友好讲卫生。客厅、厨房、卫生间等公共区域都收拾得挺干净的。在同等价位下已经算是性价比超高了。住进来之后才发现房子朝东，不通风。衣服洗了要好几天才能晒干，夏季星期天的夕照能将人晒得蒸发掉。空调开了也没用。最主要的是三天两头停水。\n\n主卧住着一个在游戏公司上班的越南人。用男生来形容，好像会把人家显得过于稚嫩，毕竟在这个地段一个人住一间主卧，收入也不算差了。但与男人这个更加复杂的称谓之间确实又差了一点距离。总之跟我一样，都是28岁左右的尴尬年纪。既不能用男孩女孩来形容，也不能用男人女人来形容。两间次卧分别被我和另外一对情侣住着。三间房子看下来，我这间空间最小，最显局促。\n\n我一向对吃的住的要求都不高，不然就不会在三年前从上海跑到北京来。只为了翻倍的薪水。房子嘛，对于早出晚归的我来说，只是用来睡觉的地方，离地铁站近一点就行。房间看着也挺像酒店的。一张床、一排书、一张桌子、一个装衣服的柜子。看起来像随时打包要走的样子。倒是那一排书，有些连塑料包装都还没拆封，都是些什么经济学原理啊、股市分析啊，聪明的投资者啊之类的。当初从上海寄过来的时候，快递费贵得令人瞠目结舌。比一个人的高铁票还贵。不过随身带着它们好像会使自己多一点点勇气。好像它们是我的武器，我的守护神，能够护我周全似的。\n\n挑了一件黑色 T 恤，一条夏季软料过膝牛仔裙。把桌上一大推化妆品扫进托特包里。临走前扣了一顶帽子在头上。及肩的自然卷发从帽檐下面如乱石缝里的杂草一般冒出来。\n\n“阿蒂，我好喜欢你的这头卷发。感觉生命力很旺盛哎。” 我记得朱朱这样说过。那还是大学刚毕业，羊毛卷还没流行起来的时期。我会定期把自己杂草般的头发拉直，做顺，做成跟大家一样的款式。我从小皮肤偏黑，长了一副茁壮的身躯，一头天然卷发、厚嘴唇和单眼皮在同学中间显得很另类。常被大人小孩在背地里取笑。上中学那会儿，提早发育的身材就连宽大的校服也裹不住。使我常常因厌恶自己而自卑。甚至到了大学，自卑的情绪也一直萦绕心间。直到毕业，从集体生活中脱离出来，才如鱼入大海般，感到前所未有的自在。一个人找房子，一个人换工作，一个人从一个城市到另一个城市。做任何决定都在自己的一念之间，从来不跟任何人商量，也不寻求他人的意见。\n\n朱朱原名叫朱筱桢。与我不同，她皮肤白皙，身材纤细，五官也是恰到好处。她往那儿一站，就是一道风景线。和她在一起，我会为自己的粗鲁感到羞耻。但她总说些鼓励我的好话，让我感到被人接纳和喜欢，因而与她越走越近，贪心地想要听到更多好话。出门等电梯的时候，我发微信给她：\n\n“今天是心如死灰的一天。”\n\n“我也是，不想上班。”\n\n“停水了，脏着脸去公司。”\n\n“我昨晚熬夜看剧，今天靠咖啡续命。”\n\n“咖啡咖啡咖啡”\n\n诸如此类，任何小情绪的变动都会分享给对方。虽然不在一个城市，但滴滴打车软件和租房合同里的紧急联系人却还是彼此。\n\n五六年前，我们在上海一家广告公司实习的时候认识的。那时我还没毕业，租住在公司附近的青年旅社。一个晚上50块钱，住一个六人间。有时候大半夜也会有人从住的房间推门而入。来者各式各样。有的是像我一样的学生，有的是背包客，也有从老家跑出来找工作的中年妇女。脸上的皮肤如油纸一样，弓着身子坐在高低床上，刷着手机软件里一单十五块的兼职。还有外国人。大家基本都保持礼貌，互不说话。住在同屋的人连名字都不知道。我只记得，与我同屋的两个女生，也是实习生。一个学校在哈尔滨，一个在西安。相比之下我的学校就很近了。就在上海，但离公司要两小时车程。初出校门，大家总归又兴奋又警惕。常常抢大众点评里面的活动券，一起结伴去吃平时吃不起的餐厅。\n\nA说：“和我同组的一个男生，傻傻的，口音重地话都讲不清。我平时都不想理他。”\n\n其他人一边吃一边听她讲下文。”哎，你们知道吗?他今天做报告倒是让人刮目相看。原来是个隐藏的大神。“\n\nB说：”嘿 那算什么。我们组一个女生，大学四年游了十二个城市，五个国家了。“\n\n“哇……”\n\n然后又聊起各自的专业，无不夸夸其谈，展露自己的水平。毕竟跑那么远来上海实习，多多少少都有些自命不凡。想闯荡一番。但我好像又回到大学宿舍和食堂一般，感到局促不安。一来我的学校和专业没人家好，没什么好说的，二来我也口音重，讲起话来不利索。再说我一般不喜欢背后评论别人，可能是怕被人评论吧。因此去了一两次就不去了。仍旧一个人独来独往。\n\n公司一起进来的实习生里，朱朱也是独来独往。我最起码中午还是会和大家一起出去吃饭。一个人吃太贵了，吃不起的。几个人就可以几菜一汤分摊一下。这样一来，公司里的八卦也就在实习生之间流传开了。\n\n”我们一起进来的人里面，有个人是高层特别关照过的。你们知道吗？“\n\n”啊……谁啊？“ 大家都很好奇。\n\n“我知道。”另一个人夹起一筷子菜，把头伸向桌前道：”就是那个叫朱筱桢的，对吧？“ 说完又问最开始的那人。那人点头如捣蒜。\n\n”那高层是谁？“ 我虽然不说话，心里也好奇。\n\n”这就不知道了。“\n\n餐厅里人群来来往往，一片嘈杂。都是脖子上挂着工牌从附近办公楼里出来吃饭的人。打扮时髦，讨论一些赚钱的机会、股票和娱乐八卦。倒显得怯生生的实习生讨论的话题有些清汤寡水。\n\n那时，我对这群人充满向往。以为他们所谈的都是些高深莫测的东西，好像那里面暗藏着社会运转的真相和可以转变人生的密码。毕竟电视上不都这样演的吗？一位实习生或者清洁工，偶然间听到了公司某位大佬的话，然后就改变了命运。类似的。我那时也是竖起耳朵，不肯放过他们谈论的任何一个东西。\n\n有天领导说，”Tillie，其实你不用这么认真，我看着都有点紧张。怕教不了你东西。“ Tillie 是我的英文名字。我不好意思地低下头去说好。但心里感觉有点难过，好像被嫌弃了一样。\n\n如果一个人一直过得很吃力，认真就会成为她身体的一部分，甚至会显得有点笨拙。我就是这样。\n\n为了进入这家广告公司实习，我去网上搜罗了面试可能会问的所有问题。去图书馆查资料，一一填充，翻译成英文，把它背下来。\n\n”你好像知道我要问什么，而且把它背下来了？“  当面试官这样问的时候，我像作弊被抓一样，刷一下脸红了。然后就被录用了。\n\n大家谈起自己被录用的原因也是千奇百怪，过程有惊无险。但总归是觉得幸运的。不过这幸运在被高层关照过的人那里就显得有些黯淡了。因此大家都不怎么喜欢朱筱桢。甚至有点妒恨她，背后说她种种。\n\n下午茶时间，大家聚在餐饮区。有个女生说：”她皮肤怎么那么白啊？“ 话语间有些羡慕。\n\n男生把咬在嘴里的奶茶吸管放开，从手机屏幕上抬起头来。”全是粉。不信你用浸了卸妆油的纸，上去摸一下。有这么厚厚一层。“ 说着他从高脚椅上转了半圈，用手指头比划道。\n\n女生像受到恭维一般，瞬间喜笑颜开。似乎觉得即使自己不如她漂亮，但到底比她好。其他人也跟着笑成一团。那笑声里多多少少带着些嘲讽，将自己和朱筱桢分成了两类人。\n\n我只觉得他们也是这样嘲讽和笑话我的。\n\n因为我那笨拙的认真，实际上和朱筱桢一样，是两个极端。一个几乎不费任何吹灰之力就能得到大家想得到的岗位，一个需要付出超大力气才能获得和他们同样的岗位。他们看不惯朱筱桢，觉得自己比她高贵，又瞧不起我那蛮力，觉得比我优雅。\n\n可能朱筱桢也发现了这一点。\n\n有天她抱着一叠文件过来，我正好在等打印机一张一张吐彩印 PPT，然后把它装帧成册。我们礼貌性地打招呼，然后不说话了。她忽然开口道：”哇！“ 樱桃小丸子式的欢呼的语气。”你的头发好好看！“\n\n我其实有点窘。因为我前天刚刚剪了头发，直发全被剪掉了，又剪得过短，毛茸茸地蓬了一头。只能扎一个小揪揪，两边若散落出来，就显得乱糟糟的。所以蓬着。\n\n她见我有点不好意思，又说，”你好可爱。“ 那语气好像一个小女孩在看到喜欢的绒线娃娃时所发出来的。此时她的脸也呈现出可爱的一面，两个浅浅的酒窝。\n\n我从来没有听人用可爱、漂亮这样的词夸过我。一激动之下，按了暂停键，说：”你先扫描。“  她忽然呆了一下，忙说不用，你先。又立马觉得推却或许会使我尴尬，就一边说”谢谢“，一边说”你真的好可爱“，一边扫描。扫完又按了继续打印的键。一张张彩印的纸又开始往外吐。氛围当即变得融洽起来。\n\n她给我指了她所在的岗位，我指了我的。忽然让我去她那里，说有东西想送给我。然后从她背包里拿出了一个小黄鸭挂坠。是她自己用 3D 打印做出来的。我们于是成了朋友。\n\n我叫她朱朱，她叫我阿蒂。我一直都没问，他们说的是不是真的。只是假装不知道似的，和她一起吃饭，翘班出去逛街买奶茶。因为大多数的时候都是她在说话，我偶尔应上一句。心里还隐隐担心，她会不会嫌我这个人太无趣不跟我玩了。我虽然习惯一个人独来独往，也是因为一直以来没有可以结伴的人。再说了，有同伴的感觉真不差。\n\n后来我们俩成为合租室友之后，她才告诉我的。原来他们说的是真的。那高层是公司创意总监 Leo ，是她之前在制作公司实习时认识的。发生关系后，他说介绍她来这家广告公司。她就来了。\n\n她觉得为什么不来呢？她读一个内地的三流大学，如果他不介绍，她永远不会在这样的公司上班。在这样的公司上班，意味着她在上海有落脚点了。她可以对爸爸妈妈说，她进了大公司，让她们不用担心。她终于可以和电视剧里的女人一样，穿着漂漂亮亮的衣服，在办公室和同事闲聊，为自己的点子兴奋，用拿到的薪水打扮自己。下班敷着面膜追剧，周末就睡个懒觉，起来拉开窗帘，整个人沐浴在阳光中，伸个懒懒的腰。这是一种明亮而有尊严的生活。最重要的是，她觉得自己不必再去维系那个分崩离析的家了。她好累。\n\n爸爸在外面有情人，妈妈担心家里的财产被外面的情人分走，不但不肯离婚，还希望女儿和她一起守着。因此考大学时，死活不让朱朱去外省。\n\n有时，她恍惚觉得妈妈、爸爸和爸爸的情人，他们三个才是紧密的一体。三人日日夜夜围着她家的酒店、商铺和房子算计、争吵、相互防备。多热闹！\n\n反而自己倒是孤零零一个人。她觉得她的人生如果和他们一起耗下去，就会毁掉。\n\n她想回到年轻人中间去，过自己的生活。酸甜苦辣都自己尝一遍。所以骗了家人，说学校派她们班学生一起来上海实习。其实只有她一个人。\n\n但我觉得她怎么着都比我好。她没有体验过什么叫贫困。我出生在南疆一个叫马村的小山村里。马村好像是一个跟外界没有联系的地方。男人们白天劳作，旁晚聚在村头的小卖部里打麻将。女人手里有织不完的毛衣。花花绿绿的线球抱在怀里，手指头像流水线上的机器一样伸缩摆动，流言八卦和粗犷的笑声在其中缠绕。小孩子一堆一堆地捉迷藏过家家，穿过尘土飞扬的马路去学校。学校门口停着碎石机，日夜轰鸣不止。把石头吃进去，一堆一堆地泥浆吐出来。像头怪兽一样。听说有小孩因为好奇，上前触摸，把一只手给碎掉了。\n\n后来上大学时，同学们提到的，童年看过的动漫呐、电视剧啊，我大多都没看过。而我和同伴偷果子被狗追，黄昏时分，从一人高的，约有十几层的梯田地里，一层一层往下跳，在绿色的麦浪中穿梭时的惊险刺激又无人能懂。你也解释不清楚，在全国执行计划生育，每个家庭只生一个小孩的情况下，为何我家可以有三个小孩。我觉得这也是我时常觉得很孤独的原因。\n\n小时候的孤独是由于不被继母和同学喜欢，不得不强装小大人。用成绩获得庇佑，费九牛二虎之力考上大学。以为离开那地方就会好一点。没想到却像跌落的外星人一样找不到同类。\n\n实习转正之后，我从青旅搬了出来，和朱朱在不用换乘的地铁线沿路租了个二室一厅的房子。本来 Leo 给她租了个公寓，但她拒绝了。\n\n她说：”我要是想过那样的生活，回家就好了。“\n\n”那你是他女朋友吗？“\n\n她看了我一眼，搓了搓我的头发道：”你真可爱。“\n\n不久，Leo 从这家广告公司离职去互联网企业做品牌总监了，他们好像也不怎么来往了。\n\n”你爱他吗？“ 有时谈到他的时候我会问。\n\n”爱啊，不爱怎么会和他在一起？不过……“ 她手指头触到桌子上，”爱是一条曲线，会随机波动。“ 细长的手指头在桌面上上上下下画波浪线。”多种因素导致这条线上升还是下降。“ 那时她正在学习统计知识。我看着她正经又认真地解释的脸，想起“世故又天真”这种形容。她好像清楚地知道自己想要什么，大多数时候又显得浑不在意。工作之外的时间看轻松的小说和电视剧，关心明星的八卦和绯闻，四仰八叉躺在床上吃零食。以及觉得自己长得并不好看。我比她显得上进很多，我收藏成功人士推荐的书单，看社会学、经济学的书。迫切地想要改变人生。\n\n分手那天，她还是显得很难过。一说话，眼泪就和水龙头一样往下掉。\n\n”他已经把我删了……“\n\n”我不该这么自作多情的……我又不是不知道，他还有其他女友……“\n\n最后，她红着眼睛趴在我肩上道：”阿蒂，在这个城市，我只有你了。“ 说完把眼泪鼻涕全部抹在我衣服上，打了个滚从床上坐起来，”去他的臭男人。以后我们姐妹携手闯荡上海滩。” 说得两人一阵哈哈大笑。我明明觉得她比我更可爱。\n\n在广告公司呆了一年，我就觉得没啥意思了。本来最初申请的是文案岗，和我所学的语言学比较相近。结果分到了客户执行岗。每天和各种各样的人沟通，熬夜做 PPT 和 Excel ，很无聊。关键是工资还少。公司仗着自己的知名度，工资少也同样有大把的人想进来。最终留下来的基本都是家在上海的人。但我不一样，我要还自己的助学贷款，要交房租，两个月前爸爸摔断了腿。我担心继母不肯再让两个妹妹上大学，就一口说我来供她们。\n\n结果找工作的时候就专门找薪水给的高的。自然而然进了金融行业。边工作边啃专业书籍，两年下来还考了几个证书。直到无法再在公司待下去的时候，北京有家公司给了双倍的薪水，我就来了。如今也已经过了三年。\n\n三年来我时常觉得自己对不起朱朱，像一个叛变者。留她一个人在上海。因而和她互动更为紧密，比在上海合租那会关系更好。晚上加班打车回去的时候，我们会打视频，一直到家里。大姨妈来肚子疼的时候，会点红糖水送到对方门口。更不要说一起吐槽工作，缓解压力，追剧聊天了。有时候觉得谈恋爱结婚做什么？有朋友就够了。\n\n但其实，我离开上海的时候没有这样想。有次，我们聊到未来，我说我可能会一个人过一辈子。她则想要一个家庭，一个房子，两个小孩。那时，我觉得没有人会一直陪伴我，我们只是一起走了一段路，迟早都会分开。所以转身去了北京。好像有点自虐似的。想要证明自己，不管在哪里，我都可以一个人过好。只是没想到，一个人只身飘在北京，没有朋友，尤其情绪低落的夜晚，孤独就会浸入骨髓，比死还难受。就会更加珍惜和朱朱的网聊。\n\n几年过来，终于还清了自己的助学贷款，两个妹妹也分别大学毕业考上了工作。父亲把家里的老房子翻修了一遍。大家的生活似乎越来越好。我却没有了最初几年的劲头。感到未来一片迷茫，甚至绝望。\n\n去年过年，来拜年的亲戚问起我在北京做什么时，父亲哼了一声，道：“她那工作……”  我在金融公司做商务的工作虽然不好给老家的人解释，但那语气和表情却让我有点难过。\n\n“朱朱，你看过张爱玲的《半生缘》吗？” 从屋里出来，我给朱朱发微信。\n\n“唔，看过。”\n\n“我觉得我有点像里面的曼璐。”\n\n“哈？”\n\n“从一开始就走了一条下坡路。”\n\n# 02\n\n出了门来，天空蓝得像刚擦过的玻璃。太阳在头顶暴晒，帽子底下的一张脸又热又油。小区门口的晨练已经结束了。音响每天八点准时响起，一群各式各样的老太太围成一圈，双手举到头顶，作法一般，跟着音乐全身晃动。婴儿车和菜篮子车停在一旁。还没上幼儿园的孙子孙女围着她们的大腿玩耍。我想总有一天，我也会变成这样。有棱角的地方变圆，没棱角的地方下垂。眼睛变成三角形。穿什么衣服都显不出腰线。\n\n有时会想她们都经过怎样的年轻时光。但想到能在北京这样的小区安度晚年，肯定不是如我家乡的父母一般的年轻时光。想到这里的时候，我一般觉得自己廉价不堪，就连还算年轻的身材，都觉得廉价得不值一提。\n\n看门的保安会认真区分你是租户还是业主。这是我不喜欢北京的地方之一。我在上海时住的小区，保安会为每一位进出者刷卡，还要说声“请进”。“这就是消费社会的好处。” 每当我用假装礼貌又抱歉的声音从保安那里借钥匙时，我都会这样对朱朱吐槽。\n\n列车轰隆隆而过，车厢被清空又被填满。我如干尸一样站在车厢里。肚子空空。一张口就是积蓄了一夜的口气。只想换乘之后，在十点钟之前打卡，安安静静地度过脏兮兮的一天。旁边有人低头看手机，有人双臂交叉，闭着眼睛继续睡觉。均是一副疲惫又认命的表情。\n\n阳光从窗外洒进来，洒在大家的身上。车厢顿时变成了糖浆般的色调。把人们身上的优衣库、HM 和 Zara 也染成了同样的颜色。不一会，刷一下进入地下轨道。暖色消失，车厢恢复凄惨的冷色调。转换之间，突然地近乎残忍。\n\n偶尔有人说话，属于北方的粗重的鼻音使说出的字词黏连在一起。我很少听见家乡的口音。一旦有，就会如灵敏的猫头鹰一样，捕捉到那个人。猜想他是南疆还是北疆人。他在和谁打电话？电话那头是否是凌冽的语言和爆裂的语调，在这边转换成大城市字正腔圆的普通话，再通过电波传送过去。离家已经十多年了，我的口音已经不甚明显。但在情急之下还是会暴露无遗。\n\n9点56分，冲到公司前台，将工作牌靠近打卡器。滴！一声，今天一天的工资又到手了。心里舒了一口气，不慌不忙地夹着包进了洗手间。\n\n出来的时候，同事 Alice 正带着早餐走进办公区。冲我打招呼：“早！”\n\n“早！嘿，今天妆好看！”\n\n“起晚了，随便弄的。”\n\n如果是上海的同事会假装不好意思地笑一下：“谢谢，你也是哦。” 表情有点夸张，空气中是欢快和自信的氛围。即便那笑容转身就会消失。北京的同事却总会托词一番，有些局促，好像不太习惯被人夸赞似的。唔，我总是关心这种无聊的细节。\n\n我坐在工位上，打开电脑，低头输入密码，假装有事要忙，没有看到她将手里的早餐一个个分发在其他同事的座位上，唯独没给我。其实我都看到了。而且肚子饿得要命，也非常想要一份。但我不能表现出来，甚至要假装自己已经吃过了。直到其他同事一个一个将工位填满，我才借机出门买了早餐吃完回来。\n\n他们有个微信群，谁要是起晚了，来不及买早餐，就会在群里让早到的人帮忙带一份。我没在里面。但我得假装并不在意。其实心里难受的要死。有点后悔从商务部转来这里。大多时候，我都会安慰自己，拿到年终奖就走人。如果在此之前，被人事裁掉，那是再好不过了。但谁知道呢，我能不能熬过来。\n\n公司人事变动极为频繁，就连高层也是震荡得不行。\n\n两个月前，公司的 CEO Abbott 冲进陈老板的办公室大喊：“你他妈就是不信任我。”\n\n面对 Abbott 的怒火，陈老板将食指放在嘴前，做了个嘘的姿势。从办公桌起身，朝门外望了望，轻轻关上了门。\n\n“坐。” 手指着办公桌旁边的沙发。转身去饮水机旁。“喝茶吗？”\n\n“不用。” Abbott 怒火未消。\n\n陈老板还是端了两杯茶过来。茶叶悬浮在绿色的水上轻轻打转，一点一点往下沉。\n\n“我本想处理完手头的事，再去找你，结果你就来了。”\n\nAbbott 头也没抬，没有好气。\n\n陈老板端起眼前的茶杯轻轻吹起来。吹了一会，没喝，又放下。\n\n身子向前，讨好似的：“ 赵总有二十几年的企业管理经验。他可以帮我们优化公司的组织架构。我们虽然是个成长型企业，但现在已经需要靠制度和流程来管理了。搞业务是你的强项，那你就好好搞业务，让他来支持你嘛。”\n\n“我明白。” Abbott 怒气稍微缓和下来，”但你把整个大市场部都交给他是什么意思？“ 说着火气似乎又上来了。\n\n”商务部不是还在你手里吗？“\n\n”所以我又成了部门 leader 了是吗？“  Abbott 脸上有明显的嘲讽。”是我之前做的不好吗？“ 和困惑。\n\n陈老板身子坐直，背靠到椅背上，翘起了二郎腿。是预防的姿势。” 不不不，你做的挺好的，我们只是战略调整。”\n\nAbbott 苦笑一声，脸上写满轻蔑。不再打算辩驳似的，忽然站起来，“OK……正好我也打算休息一段时间，明天我就发辞呈。”\n\n陈老板也站了起来，早有准备似的，“汪总……你看你这是做什么？“ 想要把 Abbott 重新按到沙发上。\n\n“都说了只是战略调整，让赵总优化组织结构，等时机成熟了再交给你。公司的核心业务不是还在你手上吗？”\n\nAbbott 忽然闭上眼睛，忍无可忍似的道，“真的，老陈。不用拿这个来忽悠我了……过去几年我给公司赚了多少钱？现在业务成熟了，就想找人来替我的位子？”\n\n陈老板像被什么东西刺到一般，反击道：“汪明，你不要不知好歹！”\n\nAbbott 转过头去。像听到一个不好笑的笑话似的，脸上的表情似笑非笑。“老陈……我虽然是个打工仔，但并不是求你赏饭吃的乞丐。”\n\n陈老板的语气忽然又软了下去。“那你想要怎么样嘛？”\n\nAbbott 并不理会。继续说道：“卸磨杀驴的做法令人心寒。你看看公司还会有多少人会替你卖命？”\n\n陈老板被彻底激怒了，”不要以为公司离了谁就做不下去了。你去问问哪个做老板的像我这样在下属面前低身下气的。“\n\nAbbott 又是一声冷笑。“低声下气倒也不必……明天……我就递辞呈。“\n\n陈老板已经回到自己的办公桌后面。头也不抬地：“那我也不强求。交接的事可以交给助理……走完流程就行。”\n\n“啪”地一声，办公室的门重重地合上了。随后又传出东西落地的声音。\n\n”我正好经过那里，声音大地吓了我一跳。” 与我同组的女孩 Eve 边说边抚胸口。\n\n一个月后，Abbott 走了。离开前，我在商务部时的 leader Alexis 问我，要不要一起走。我说我想调整职业方向，如果离开，外面不一定会给我尝试的机会，留下来或许还有希望。他表示遗憾，但尊重我的想法。\n\n其实，我知道他并不是很想我一起走。因为我过去两年的业绩已经影响到了他的位置。Abbott 对我的夸奖常常多于他。他或许是领命来征求我的意见，但一点劝说的意思都没有。\n\n”我会把手里的客户介绍给大家。“\n\n他听见我这样说，表现出了从未有过的掏心掏肺。”TT，其实你现在放弃挺可惜的。”\n\n“唔……我知道……但我觉得……这条路可能不太适合我……”\n\n“为什么……之前不是做的挺好的吗？”\n\n“嗯……我可能没办法想象……三四十岁还要夜聊，陪客户喝酒……我身体已经不行了……”\n\n“胡说，你才28岁！”\n\n“Alexis，我是真没动力了。”\n\nAlexis 不可置信地侧了下头，“对赚钱也没动力了？”\n\n“嗯……”\n\n“再说……” 我忽然遏制了自己的倾诉欲。“反正就是不想做了。”\n\n他有些不耐烦，好像这种低沉的情绪会传染似的，“那好吧，祝你顺利！”\n\n“谢谢，你也是！”\n\n再说了。\n\n我是想说，我开始质疑这份工作存在的价值。但是 Alexis 听了大概会把我当疯子看，并在心底里无休止的嘲笑。\n\n“我们和传销有何区别呢？”   有次我给朱朱吐槽。发信息前，切断了公司的 WiFi，用自己的流量。因为公司到处都是监控。网络监控，办公室头顶墙壁上的摄像头监控。\n\n“让用户来平台交易，一层又一层的 KOL 又分他们的手续费。”\n\n“那也是商业模式的一种嘛。”  朱朱安慰我。\n\n“也不见得谁就真的靠这个发家致富了。”\n\n“人性总归是贪婪的。”\n\n“我觉得好无聊。”\n\n# 03\n\n这种消沉的情绪大概始于一年前。有一次，我独自打车去昌平郊区的一个商业街见一位客户。商业街十分嘈杂，可以说跟小县城别无二致。出租车经过了一个破败的街道。街道两边全是小摊，摊位上用歪歪斜斜的帐篷罩着。卖水果的，卖小吃的，拥挤在一起。穿梭在街道上的行人都是些看起来衣衫褴褛的男男女女。这是北京？我心中一边怀念市中心明亮光鲜的写字楼，一边心有戚戚，觉得跟他们是一样的——都是为了谋生。这是我对自己工作的定义。这种定义在某些程度上会抹除心底的质疑。\n\n到了目的地，客户叫我去办公室找他。我照着给的办公地址，找到了一个破旧的商业楼。没有电梯，只好从楼梯走上去。黑暗的楼梯没有灯光，我用手机打着照明灯，地上满是垃圾，墙上的电线像盘桓在四处的蛇一样朝我吐着蛇信。高跟鞋的回音令人惊心。\n\n我头脑中已经骂了无数遍，但不知道在骂谁。我害怕电影中的场景发生在我身上：一个单身女子孤身进入一座荒废的楼，被一双手捂住了嘴巴，先奸后杀。一颗心怦怦直跳。\n\n来到指定的楼层，一排排破烂的房间，门上的漆全部脱落，看起来脏兮兮。墙上涂涂画画，写着污言秽语。\n\n每一个房间都有可能冒出一个犯罪嫌疑人。\n\n”我到底在干嘛？“  还没走到指定的房间，脑中一个闪念便落荒而逃。\n\n”你在哪儿？“ 刚从漆黑的楼道口出来，就接到了对方的电话。电话好像也变得危险，下意识按了录音。\n\n我内心惴惴不安，“我刚才去找您了，但没找到……要不我们就在商场的麦当劳聊……可以吗？“ 心想麦当劳是公众场合，应该比较安全。\n\n”啊……那里有点嘈杂，你最好来我办公室……“ 对方坚持。\n\n我内心更加不安，也坚持道：“啊……没事的，我还没吃饭呢……想顺便吃点东西。“\n\n”唔……那好吧。“\n\n对方是个中年男人。穿着一套白色的中式棉麻衬衣衬裤，中个，方脸，皮肤黑得发油。手腕带着大大的佛珠。一幅不屑世俗的艺术家的样子。但讲起话来，给人一种能带你赚大钱的梦想家的气度。情绪激扬、引得整个餐厅的人频频往这边看。喷溅而出的唾沫星子让人只想远离。\n\n但毕竟是客户。\n\n一双往我身上打量的鼠目也着实令人厌恶。不巧我那天穿的衬衣底下是件黑色胸罩。饱满的胸部若隐若现。又使我厌恶起自己来。我努力假装无视他的目光，继续讲解公司以及平台可能会给他的好处。\n\n他居然和我聊起性爱课程来。\n\n“女人过了25岁，那里都会变黑的……你看外国女人，有专门的私部美容诊所……哎……你结婚了没？”\n\n”还没有……“ 胃里升起一阵反感。\n\n“那你真应该先去听听这位老师的课程。我带我老婆听了她的课程后，我们现在关系好得不得了啊。” 有些眉飞色舞，“以前，我们一年才一次。现在，你知道几次吗？”\n\n我睁大眼睛，摇头，表现出好奇。可能身体微侧的姿势看起来有点防备和勉强。\n\n“哎呀，小姑娘不要害羞。我们现在一周一次啦。”\n\n”啊……真的吗？这么有用，那老师是谁？“  周边的嘈杂声和播放的背景音乐在我们周围喧嚣。有人在大笑，有小孩子在餐桌旁哭闹。冷空气变得有点重，我把不断下陷的身体使劲往上提。\n\n”我把她推给你。“说着将那位老师的微信推给了我。\n\n”好的……好的……我加一下她，等哪天有空一定去听听。“\n\n我几近讨好地附和。像一个母亲哄婴孩一般，使出浑身解数，只为他展露笑颜。\n\n结束后，两只眼睛累得想要彻底闭上。快速打了出租车再一次落荒而逃。那是七月的季节，阳光通过车窗洒在我身上。我整个人瘫坐在出租车后座上。情绪低落。\n\n街边走过几个穿着学生服，背着书包的女生，推着自行车，说说笑笑，街旁的柳树在她们头顶随风摇晃。\n\n望着她们，我忽然难过的不能自已。好像有东西在我身上死去了。\n\n那群穿着校服，推着自行车，玩闹着过马路的女学生提醒了我。\n\n“何至于此？”\n\n辛辛苦苦从马村逃出来，考上大学，就为了这样的生活？\n\n眼泪已经不知不觉流得满脸都是。\n\n人事部问我是否接受调岗。我说想去公关部。因为我本来就是学汉语言文学的，大学时期在校园报纸上写过一些东西。人事叫我去问公关部的负责人 Calista 。Calista 答应了。但是因为我没有相关经验，无法平级调岗，只能降级。我考虑了一下，说没问题。\n\n午饭时间，大家都还没准备出门， Calista 尖锐的声音从她的玻璃门内传了出来，“你看你办的这叫什么事儿？” 所有人都竖起了耳朵，假装低头忙自己的事。\n\n组长 John 一面往外面退，一面回：“好……好的……我明白了……我现在就去再改一版，下午上班前给您看……” 那恐惧好像要把他的头拖到地上去。\n\n“再来一版？你看看这时间还来得及吗？叫你指挥大家干活，不是叫你写这个东西给我看！写这个有什么用？Cora ？你进来一下。“\n\n另一位同事 Cora 被叫了进去。\n\nCalista 是东北人，脾气火爆。想要的东西张口要，闭口就得给，给得不称心就会一顿爆骂。哪管你人前人后。\n\n”但是奖金给的也很大方。“ Eve 一边吐槽，一边又小心翼翼地维护她。”她就是那样，对事不对人。“ 好像 Calista 就站在她身旁，能听到似的。\n\n有次，她被当着几百人的面骂得狗血淋头。对着我哭了起来，”TT，我觉得自己可能熬不下去了。这工作就像在麦当劳打工一样，毫无尊严……我……我从小到大，从来没有当着那么多的人被骂过……就是我父母也不行……“   断断续续的声音中夹杂着愤怒、哽咽和啜泣。“我想走了……”  这句话说了不下三次。我递了纸巾给她。一边叹息，一边抚她的肩。但始终没能说出一句安慰的话。因为我也不知道哪句话是适宜的，哪句又会为自己招来危险。办公室人人都这样。\n\n就在今天上午十点半左右，办公楼下忽然聚集了一群维权者。照片和视频在各种微信群里开始传播。一群人披麻戴孝，手持横幅，上面用红色油漆写着“ 还我血汗钱！” 五个大字。醒目又可怖。有人不知怎么溜到了顶楼阳台。警察和围观群众逐渐将楼下包围。有媒体已经在向媒介组同事打听这件事了。\n\n陈老板给 Calista 下达了任务，此事务必三天内平息。说完就忙着去接投资人的电话了。\n\nCalista 人还未到办公室已在工作群里@John，叫他迅速出个方案，指挥大家干活。上午的1个半小时里，都在紧张和静默中度过。等待 John 的命令。\n\nJohn 跟我一样其实也是刚来不久，只比我早了一周。用 Calista 的话说，先适应一段时间。但显然， John 是带着野心来的。他从媒体主编成了公关组长。认为自己在传播方面的专业度可以给企业带来新的改变。\n\n“用户、媒体和企业是利益共同体。公关的本质是沟通，通过沟通达成共识。有效沟通的前提是诚恳，和客户诚恳、和媒体诚恳……我们 PR 其实可以充当‘舆论工程师’的角色，在企业和公众的沟通中培养共识……“\n\n这是他刚来公司那天的交流会上分享的观点。工作这么多年，我早已将揣摩心思，见机行事刻入骨髓。那天，不知怎么，忽然希望这不务实的正确的观点能为我带来些什么。好像它可以将我引到一条不一样的路上去。这条路会再一次改变我的人生。不仅仅是收入，还有某些，不被父亲用轻蔑语气描述的，或许可以长久的，不必像在麦当劳打工一样准备随时离开的，终生追随的东西。我不知道我为什么开始对”长久“产生了期望。照我以前的观念，没有什么是可以长久的。住所不是长久的，工作不是长久的，恋人不是长久的，朋友不是长久的，甚至生命也不是长久的……  可是当时听了 John 的那些话，心想，曾经那些已经死去的东西或许可以复活呢。\n\n不一会儿，三人一起从办公室出来了。Calista 亲自分配任务。\n\n“我们现在统一的对外口径是，这是一起有目的的敲诈勒索……”\n\n”EVA，你准备澄清公告。TT 先准备一篇三方视角的稿子……“\n\n”John，你联系一些关系好的媒体，叫他们先不要传播，把口径告诉他们，叫他们朝着这方向报道……“\n\n“Cora，你负责联系微博平台负责人，先把负面删除……”\n\n“Alice，你找一些 KOL 和水军供应商，叫 TT、EVA 根据对外口径每人准备100条回复内容，叫他们在这个基础上发挥…… ”\n\n“如有必要，人肉主要闹事者……挖他们的黑料……”\n\n”好的。” EVA说。\n\n“好的。” 我说。\n\n“好的。” Cora说。Alice说。\n\n只有 John 眉头紧皱，似在思考什么。\n\n“大家有什么问题？” Calista 问。\n\n都说没有。\n\n“没有就抓紧干活……时间紧，任务重。”\n\n“嗯……Calista……我有个问题……” John 开口了。“我们……是不是可以先去接触一下他们……问问看……他们想要什么？” John 是双眼皮，普通话不太准确的，缓慢的广州口音给人一种真挚的，可以坐下来倾听和交流的映像。\n\n”害……肯定要钱啊……还用问吗？“  Alice 一副经验老道的样子。她在这个部门已经待了三年，迎来送往过好几任公关部负责人。每一任新任者都可以从她这里了解高层们的习好、忌讳和千丝万缕的关系。Calista 愿意听她发表看法。EVA、Cora、Alice 也都喜欢聚在她周围。\n\n”我是担心……打压和对抗可能会激发更多负面，流失……“\n\nCalista 很不耐烦，提高了音量。”我叫你来不是让你光说些没用的。老板要看结果！“\n\n”可我们都不知道他们真实的诉求……“\n\n”都说了他们要钱。“ Calista 厉声打断了他，气得转过身去。\n\nJohn 并没有停下来，仿佛自言自语般，”钱是利益，可以协商……先安抚情绪……“\n\n“你去安抚？” 这次是 Cora 打断了他的话，显得很不礼貌。其他人发出了轻微的笑声，使其成为胜利的一方。\n\nCalista 提高了声音，很疲惫的，“车轱辘话不要来回说了……“ ，“啪”一声。她旁边桌子上的一本黑皮笔记本掉到了地上。也不知是故意的还是无意的。声音大地惊人。公关部办公区之外的注意力忽然统统往这边涌来。她低头捡了起来，继续道：”能干就干，不能干就换人好吧……”  长舒一口气，闭上眼睛，又睁开，恢复平静的口吻，“时间很紧，大家抓紧干活。” 然后抱臂走进了她的玻璃笼子。\n\n“吃饭吗？” 人群纷纷散开，一边回工位，一边商量着先吃午饭。\n\n“……好啊……”\n\n“我也去……”\n\nJohn 如丧家之犬一样在自己的座位上。低头整理着什么。嘴巴抿得紧紧的。好像打算不再开口说话似的。\n\n听 EVA 说，他老婆快要生了。\n\n吃完午饭回来。大家纷纷进入了自己的角色。我已经知道 Calista 想要怎样的稿子了。无非就是一些气势恢宏的用词，一些蛊惑性的口号，无比坚定的态度，似是而非的例证……我原来以为可以跟自己的专业近一点。却没想到，必须忘记课堂上学过的语言学知识才能写下去。没过多久就陷入了空虚和无聊之中。\n\n至于这篇嘛，那自然是围绕 ”有目的的敲诈勒索“这一口径展开。”职业维权团队……“之类的。\n\n吧嗒吧嗒的敲键盘声和打电话声一直在下午的办公室回响着。\n\n”……哎……陈老师……对啊，这件事一看就是有组织有纪律的啊……对啊……搞得跟行为艺术似的……已经报警了，警察在处理了……嗯……麻烦你们客观报道哈……您什么时候有空呢，我和 Calista 去拜访……“\n\n一切按部就班。\n\n微信群里不断有最新消息更新。\n\n”负面已经全部删除了……“\n\n”公告和稿件已经发布出去了……“\n\n”水军也在有序进行中……“\n\n下班时间，大家完成手头的工作纷纷离开。我不知道事情到底有没有平息。也不知道陈老板有没有得到他想要的结果。反正每个人手里的工作都完成了。Calista 在群里说，大家今天辛苦了。大家都说不辛苦应该的。\n\nJohn 没有再表达看法。\n\n走出办公楼的时候，想起他的观点，”企业应该塑造一个有魅力的品牌形象……企业应该……“ 我又忽然觉得挺没意思的。我在做的事没意思。他想做的事没意思，我想通过工作改变点什么的期望也没意思。\n\n跟着熙攘的下班的人群，穿过红绿灯，走进轰隆隆的地铁，拖着疲倦的身体站一个小时。一到家，卸下托特包，将自己甩到床上去。暖色灯光笼罩着小小一方天地。全靠自己的力量撑起的这片温馨，自给自足的自豪感消解了白天工作的烦闷。这完完全全属于自己的4小时，谁都不要来打扰我。或许因为时间太珍贵了，反而不知道该做什么。就一直以蛙泳的姿势趴在床上，刷着手机。情绪被微博上的话题牵引一会儿，又看看朋友圈都在做些什么。12点一到，便强迫自己起身洗漱一番。至于此事到底有没有平息，跟我没有关系。有关系的是什么呢？是明天开始又要用华丽的辞藻堆砌公司的好处了。不过这倒也不是什么难事。不要熬夜，不要迟到，明天下班前终归是可以完成的。完成意味着薪水到手了。这或许是无望的生活中唯一的动力了。至于那些披麻戴孝的人，他们身上到底发生了什么呢？最好想都不要去想。\n\n第二天晚上9点左右，我趴在床上刷手机时，工作群里信息爆炸开来。有人真的跳楼自杀了。跳楼前的视频在各个群里疯转，不一会上了微博热搜。\n\n视频中的男子穿着白色棉麻裤子，黑色T恤，振振有词，”陈正民，你要记得，我这条命是你杀的，你迟早要还。“ 看天色应该是傍晚时分。楼顶的风吹得他的T恤和裤子贴在身上。肚子上的赘肉像格外塞进的棉团。\n\n媒体压不住了。陈老板大怒。Calista 又将她的恐惧传导了下来，要大家想办法。\n\nJohn 仍在群里小心翼翼地说，可以派人去洽谈。其他人同样不留情面地反对。\n\n”就照你说的来。“ 不一会儿 Calista 忽然在 John 的信息下面回道。\n\n“媒体我去谈，死者家属需要再派一个人去。” John 开始分配任务。\n\n群里顿时没人说话。\n\n“我可以去试试看。” 我回道，把自己都给震住了。想撤回，可是已经被看到了。\n\n“好，你要什么尽管开口。”\n\n我觉得自己可能是疯了，又同时觉得内心在期望什么。于是继续回复：“能不能派一个安保人员给我。” Calista 答应了。\n\n底下所有人给我竖起了大拇指。\n\n# 04\n\n对方的诉求真的是要钱。但远没有我想象中的恐惧。安保完全没有必要。跳楼者的妻子从湖北赶来，住在酒店。和我约在咖啡馆见面。是个打扮得体的中年妇女，但是精神枯槁。\n\n“200万一下子就没了，他无法接受。”\n\n她不看我的眼睛。像是喃喃自语。最后开出的价是400万。一半是她丈夫的钱，一半是他的命。\n\n公司法务说，最多只能赔1万，另外19万是公司出于人道主义精神给的补偿。\n\n我不敢再去见她。\n\n“我丈夫的命只值20万？”  她喉咙紧地说不出话来。断断续续的，表示要走法律途径，倾家荡产告到底。我从玻璃窗外看到她离开的背影，在街上站了一会儿，茫茫然地又走了。\n\n接下来的事，Calista 推到了法务部。我一天班都不想去上了，但想着怎么着也要拿到年终再走。只觉得更加无望，不知道冬天什么时候来，新的一年什么时候来。\n\n两天后，一篇重磅报道传播开来。报道写了很多公司内部的事情，有些是和这件事相关，有些是和这件事无关的。但总归在诘问企业的社会责任和道德。\n\n企业能有什么道德呢？\n\n一次吃饭时，同事神秘兮兮的告诉我，要小心 John。\n\n“为什么？”\n\n“公司在查内鬼，这件事只有你和 John 全程对外，他很可能会把你推出去。”\n\n我忽然一下子吃不下去饭了。噎在嘴里的菜吐也不是，咽下去也不是。我知道同事可能是好心。但我一点都不想听。\n\n第二天，John 找我谈话。问我这段时间工作的感受，之前的工作经验，甚至下班都喜欢做些什么。但对此事闭口不提。\n\n接着，Calista 又找我谈话。人事找我谈话。EVA、cora、Alice 纷纷向我投来同情的眼神，又老是背着我聚在一起窃窃私语。\n\n我忽然觉得厌恶，厌恶办公室头顶无处可藏的监控器，厌恶明晃晃的令人发恶的刺眼灯光，厌恶这里的每一个人。我以为，能够抛弃以往那种谄媚的生活，却又陷入相互诬陷和猜测的旋涡。他妈的！X他妈的！\n\n我到底在做什么？\n\n凌晨2点钟的时候，一个人在被窝里歇斯底里。都去死吧。怀着这样绝望的心情，我起身打开电脑，发了一封匿名邮件。邮件内容是一张照片。照片中是

These standards can be met by providing software engineers with a set of rules to apply throughout their development cycle.\n\nEnforcing a programming standard doesn’t have to be a complex task. There are hundreds of widely adopted standards for the vast majority of programming languages. There is the [Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines), and more than likely one for the programming language of your choice.\n\nThe rise of linters and code formatters such as [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) has made it easier to apply these programming standards to your project. When set up correctly linters will automatically flag and sometimes even fix antipatterns in your code.\n\nProgramming standards help ensure a congruent code base by creating a standard approach to solving problems. This reaps rewards in reduced technical debt and improved code maintainability.\n\nEven with the use of software designed to help enforce programming standards, **software engineers still break the rules.** They fall into traps and ignore when a rule has been broken.\n\n## Common pitfalls\n\n### Pitfall: An engineer’s external knowledge overrides a rule.\n\n*Example 1: Rule broken: All variable names should be written in camelCase.*\n\n```\nvar DVLAYearOfManufacture = 2018; // incorrect\n```\n\nThe engineer assumes the word DVLA should be capitalized because it is generally represented in uppercase online. But this thinking goes against our rule.

I understand why they exist (economic desperation and dreams of breaking free in our cruel and unforgiving world) but I really do not like them at all for the same reasons\n* NFTs primarily as a programmable object primitives are really interesting — I really love projects that really take advantage and push the limits of this\n* The scene around smaller artists is really wonderful too — love to see so many wonder creative people creating art for a uniquely digital medium and getting paid well for their work and building fanbases that love them\n* I think of NFTs less as “I own this jpeg” and more as patronage and public domain brands and projects that really push on this (like the gremlins and blitmaps and nouns) on this are the most fascinating to me\n* The rise of public domain brands is going to be really interesting and really worth looking at as well - incredibly excited for how the patronage system encourages well funded community driven world building, fanfic on steroids in a way\n* Some of them are cute but for the most part I hate the big pfp projects a lot, they seem to be the worst of the financialization driven culture with talk they have about price and flips and gatekeeping—with that honestly really I hate the apes so much. So so so much.\n* I'm generally not a fan of digital scarcity or gatekeeping (\"you could not live with your abundance so you created your own scarcity\"), although there are places where it makes sense in a skeuomorphic way and to ensure people get paid\n* token enabled >>>> token gated by far for me\n* DAOs are cool. Less so in technology and more so in spirit - it's wonderful to see a lot of people who never would have before embrace cooperative thinking. Something something accidental socialism hehehehe\n* User owned and user controlled protocols and applications are great in concept too. The implications of this are still unknown and its funny to see people figure it out in real time but im pretty optimistic about it in the long run\n* Almost everything being entirely open source and open to contributors and and feedback is pretty great too, even if democracy can be a bit broken at times\n* On the gaming side of things, we’re really early but have had a lot of good discussions and incredibly thoughtful with builders and founders in the space and I’m cautiously optimistic based on the amount of care they seem to be putting in to this\n* NFTs as primitive collectables (such as trading cards like parallel that can be used in games) make a lot of sense to me for skeuomorphic reasons, especially if we can ensure they’re easily accessible in the long run\n* Play to earn mostly still feels icky to me. Maybe there are good ways to structure it but for now something about it is too much on the wrong side of the dystopia <-> utopia spectrum for me.\n* Dark Forest is a really great example of an experimental game that really takes advantage of the technology without any weird need to feel icky and financial itself. I hope as we get more scaling solutions more interesting things like this pop up\n* things are still \\*way way wayway\\* too expensive and slow (both in terms of prices and transaction costs) to really be accessible to regular people and usecases and that’s a big point of FUD for me\n* I feel like part of why everything feels so icky and financialized is that since gas fees are so high everyone feels that in order to do anything they must have some chance of making back enough $$$ to cover that and then some because the stakes are too high\n* Hopefully as we get more and better scaling solutions we really start to see more interesting projects that really push on the unique capabilities of the tech and actually pushing on decentralizing computing and the internet\n* Things are starting to feel toppy. I still think we have some room to go but this market is getting stupid lol. You can also tell because there are so many obvious grifters which always I always find incredibly annoying\n* There is also way too much going on right now. Too many projects too many ideas both good and bad too many metaphorical ponzis too many grifters too much news too much harassment too many haters too much discourse and its incredibly overwhelming\n* I generally think bear markets are better because they focus more on experimentation and ideas and building and less on get rich quick schemes, but worry about the people who will get washed out that can’t afford to\n* I am legitimately concerned for a lot of people when the bear comes, I’ve been washed out quite a few times already so I know to expect but I hope people experiencing it for the first time will be able to handle it\n* The discourse around everything has gone entirely off the rails tho—I’m obsessed with information bubbles and am fascinated in poking into different ones and honestly, it really seems like there’s no winning people when they have completely different spheres of (mis)information\n* I still have a lot of disdain for the skeptics I’ve seen because they both are usually factually inaccurate and also incredibly smug and condescending about their takes (you can only be one never both!), and often tend to encourage mass harassment and bullying\n* I’ve lost \\*a lot\\* of respect for \\*many\\* established people in this industry the last few weeks-especially those encouraging or peddling smug and condescending misinformation, a lot of it incredibly deranged\n* I’m okay with nuanced and thoughtful criticisms\n* You know who you are\n* There’s less money laundering than people think, much less tax evasion, half the most harassed projects are on clean chains anyways (this is actually where I lose a lot of respect for less toxic skeptics, this is right in their face and they still pretend to be environmentalists)\n* FWIW I’ve managed to buy and retire mid five figures of carbon offsets and offset my next few generations of lifetimes, so my conscious is cleared there for sure\n* I imagine a lot of the crypto people that feeds over to their bubbles is probably not the best stuff either, which might be why they feel that way.

Since early 2020, the total value locked (“TVL”) on DeFi protocols has increased over 100x and as of this writing, TVL is over [$115 billion](https://defillama.com/home). On December 4, 2020, the DeFi ecosystem exceeded one million unique wallet addresses and, less than five months later, exceeded two million.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*AlW8fOfYfxVvS3uE)\n\nDeFi adoption still pales in comparison to both the crypto and global lending markets, at roughly 5% and 1.5%, respectively. Readers here are no strangers to the innovation and potential that exists in DeFi, so what is the main obstacle to adoption and acceptance of DeFi among institutional and retail investors?\n\nIn a word, trust. Trust that the system is secure and legitimate, with staying power to be a commonly used financial system for the future. Trust that of the many DeFi projects out there, the ones gaining use are the ones that will endure.\n\n**Inertia Towards TradFi**\n\nInertia in Tradfi is powerful. Most people are used to traditional financial institutions and, consciously or not, equate familiarity with legitimacy. But banks make mistakes, from making bad loans based on flawed credit models to accidentally [wiring nearly a billion dollars to hedge funds](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/16/business/citibank-revlon-lawsuit-ruling/index.html). Retail banking customers accept slow service, arbitrary account fees, inconvenient wire cutoffs, low APYs, and other inefficiencies because that’s how things have been for a very long time. These antiquated banking processes and potential for human error are accepted as cost of doing business.\n\nIndeed, when friends, family, coworkers, and the general public all rely on Tradfi solutions, it is taken as the “safe” default option. With so much money held by centralized institutions, the tendency to follow everyone else’s lead is powerful. With something as serious as one’s own money, the inertia to move to a new financial system is only that much greater.\n\n**Trust Protocols**\n\nNew/potential users must trust — deeply trust — anywhere they are putting their own capital. They need assurances that the DeFi team is skilled, does not have misaligned incentives, and that it has produced secure, bug-free smart contracts. As importantly, users need to believe that others also trust in the legitimacy of the protocol.\n\nHowever, trust in DeFi is both precious and elusive. New DeFi projects launch on a daily basis. Some of these are driven by generating quick profits for the team, often at the expense of its community. Malicious DeFi teams have rugged their own users.\n\nStill, other projects, despite best efforts to conduct annual audits and implement bug bounty programs, remain subject to vulnerability and [hacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08778.pdf):\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1284/1\\*wnuollGYOMWh4FLnwAuxGg.png)\n\nIn total, over [$284 million](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/messari-defi-exploits-total-284-091600754.html) has been lost to hackers since 2019.\n\n**DeFi Trust Solutions**\n\nAudits, insurance, and bug bounties help lend credibility to protocols. But they do not create the perception of community trust or widespread legitimacy. Further adoption among retail and institutional actors first requires the ability for anyone (technically trained or not) to be able to instantly discern how much the general public believes in a DeFi project, its team, and its code.\n\nThe Ante team has been working on a trust solution and is excited to share it with you at [Ante Finance](https://ante.finance)!", "timestamp": 1636730825, "digest": "lBWNtmWmecWe6B8gLIunVDzyqEDJ1ZRD5snxuc6vnLA", "contributor": "0x8CD69bE390c689Eb7E9ab74113f572994C2914B9"}

This creates conditions for members to give off a superiority complex, especially when it’s where the cool kids or smartest kids are hanging out.\n\n**“Third Wave Coffee” had this problem too**, at least through the mid 2000s. There was an issue with mean baristas. Customers felt judged, like they had to look or order a certain way to get good service.\n\nCoffeeshops had to work hard to turn this around. Teams were retrenched. Greater emphasis was put on training and customer service. By 2010, the overhaul was mostly complete, and it was considered passé to have pretentious baristas.\n\n**The branding shift from crypto to web3 is similar**. The word \"crypto\" is a little scary, whereas \"web3\" simply implies progress. The web3 community has embraced friendly irreverence too: the memes, bright colors, emojis, saying gm/gn all the time. Be overtly nice can be powerful in driving adoption.\n\n## Be Inclusive\n\n**Third waves gain followers by serving as an umbrella for movements that have disparate origins but common ethos.** They build large tents that attract people who don't fit in neatly in other camps.\n\n**“Third Wave Feminism” embraced individualism and diversity**. As Elizabeth Evans wrote, \"the confusion surrounding what constitutes third-wave feminism is in some respects its defining feature\". It picked up unfinished work from second wave feminism, but also sought to dismantle the machine and rebuild it better.\n\n**Web3 has grown more inclusive** as it's moved beyond a critique on fiat currency and traditional finance. Its tent now includes people reacting to privacy, data ownership, governance of common goods, the 9-to-5 job, creators' and artists' rights, consolidation of FAMGA power, and more.\n\n## Be the Default Option\n\n**Third waves eventually reach a tipping point where they are the default easiest option for new builders.** They become easier to implement and more practical than alternatives. \n\n**The “Third Wave of Democracy” gathered momentum in the mid-1970s.** Autocratic regimes started falling around the world and democracies took their place. Newly prosperous nations transitioned to democracies. The number of democracies increased rapidly through the 1980s.\n\nThe third wave offered a variety of \"constitutional templates\" to draw from. Choosing democracy granted countries a **higher degree of interoperability** with the rest of the world.\n\nTrue, some democracies exist only in name and others are backsliding. But in its first and second wave, democracy was highly tenuous. Now, following the third wave, it is **the default model of governance for the modern state**.\n\nFor Web3 to experience such an inflection point, it needs to be easier to build, govern, and interoperate than other technologies.", "timestamp": 1636731984, "digest": "n9KJNVu0ri_FkUduQObcWPcED7atCyylNxqLw4pxd7k", "contributor": "0xD24580568ebfbC5F7a513c6679548030A1729D98"}

Let’s add a bit more context about this operation and how big it is.\n\n## Organized operation\n\n![Snapshot of Uniswap rug pulls per day](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2wGBWdzYERMVi0o6wKrVhg.png)\n\nOn 5 July we counted more than 50 of so-called rug pulls, a tactic that was explained in detail in part 1 of this series. Previous day numbers were similar and few days before rug pulls went even to a hundred per day. Just a few examples for how it looks like can be seen on these pairs<https://uniswap.info/pair/0x5853a290f476e9375a837ccf31b912802016860e><https://uniswap.info/pair/0xa499ff87f9677bcd03dedbab6c8c8bf196a5ffb1><https://uniswap.info/pair/0xff5bc4cf282feb481ab062553f961ca3c3dad11a>\n\nSo this happens on a daily basis and approx 100-200 ether is siphoned out of the unlucky people wallets and then probably sold for FIAT \\*\\*as scammers do not HODL \\*\\*(mostly).\n\nBut this is just part of the operation, there are much bigger plays going on that take more effort.\n\n## Big plays\n\nOn to the bigger Pump and Dump plays(p/d). Let's take for example [https://shibatoken.com](https://shibatoken.com/) project which is just an attempt to be some kind of “DOGE killer” in Defi wave but basically is just plain cash grab from the gullible.\n\nThey used tricky tactics, they made the huge(maximum) amount of tokens Ethereum permits \\*\\*1,000,000,000,000,000, **for** \\*\\*which in many cases websites/apps don’t even have enough room to show the number, also pure price display is hard to display and comprehend as seen below\n\n![Shiba Uni price graph](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*OocFwNWr386b1ME-1hCT7Q.png)\n\nShiba Uni price graph\n\nThis is kind of important as when the token launches nobody knows the exact price, even **uniswap.info** doesn’t show it, so some people just buy into FOMO not knowing their entry.\n\nThey also used some gimmicks, sending part of their huge supply to Vitalik Buterin himself as a way to get some “legitimacy”.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*R5iwMyVKm5TfHLo99S4s9Q.png)\n\nSending a huge amount of coins to Vb address\n\nThey called this burning of tokens, but they didn’t really burn them as he could have sent them back.After that, next transaction was adding liquidity to uniswap pool and the **party** was ready to start.\n\n## Ponzi party\n\nAfter making this pool, first buyers come in (all can be checked on etherscan on the contract, here <https://etherscan.io/token/0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce> go to the last page of transactions)\n\nMany of those first buyers are in on the game, they know what is the “play” and invest early, then spread the rumors and give tips to others who will **shill** the same project, it is **shilled** on telegram, twitter and discord mostly.\n\nThe project in itself is nothing special, the smart contract which is basically what you are investing in is something that can be found all over the Ethereum network, in fact there are more than 800 exact matches (line by line match) of this contract, some dating to a year ago\n\n![Shiba inu exact matches of contracts](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*80ojh03v4ZvHR7qbruamdw.png)\n\nThe same contracts like **Shiba Inu** can be found here <https://etherscan.io/find-similar-contracts?a=0xbe78b84af3ef9e9759ff5c8e0d552063bf99db57>\n\nand the website is also something done in an afternoon, so what is this project then? It is a marketing (Ponzi\\*\\*) project, not a crypto project, \\*\\*catching the next fool who will pay more and doing some viral effects with it.\n\nFounder and creator of contract did watch out and he didn’t dump anything from his original address, he did pull out some liquidity a few days ago as the project is dead and he wants to salvage some last ETH from the project*( Transactions of the project creator <https://etherscan.io/token/0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce?a=0xb8f226ddb7bc672e27dffb67e4adabfa8c0dfa08>*)\n\nbut they probably did buy it from some other addresses in the beginning and heavily profited while shilling and FOMO were on the peak.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*QbJCatX7Cc3hF3Qo1Phj6Q.png)\n\nShiba Inu almost no volume and transactions (note: Uniswap.info changed interface since then)\n\n\\*\\*Project is almost dead now, \\*\\*which was expected, only kept barely alive by people who invested in it and don’t want to take a loss, so they provided some liquidity and try to salvage their losses but soon it will be dead ground once the final sucker pulls out.\n\nSo this kind of P/D doesn’t need a [RUG PULL as described in part 1](https://medium.com/@unishield/how-uniswap-scams-work-ba847275a49f) of this article as much more can be gained if the project gets “traction” like this and then **ether** can be extracted selling to new suckers in a period of few days.\n\nThere are many projects like this, some having some website, many don’t have anything other than smart contract and added uniswap pair, some are much more sophisticated and will even look like real project but their inventors never had an idea to make it a real useful product, just to get rich from people FOMOing at a scale in a bull run.*(edit: In the meantime SHIBA relaunched, with new attempt of Ponzi, adding some staking and farming as that is what was “working” lately, but that balloon also went quickly to bust)*\n\n## **Seen before**\n\nAll of this is nothing new and has been seen before on **centralized exchanges** especially in 2017 ICO era, but then it took a bit more effort and was harder to create and launch a new project so there were not so many daily operations. What is also interesting in uniswap scams is that everything is onchain, so all transactions and steps can be tracked and analyzed.\n\n## Locked liquidity and non-scam problems\n\nIn the first part, I mentioned that liquidity locking would be a good solution and there are sites like **Unicrypt** that lock liquidity added to uniswap with smart contract(not audited at this moment) so technically **rug pulls** wouldn’t be possible. But there are few problems with this, first of all with UI, they don’t show or count for the score for how long this liquidity is locked, some of them locked it for short period (like a month or so), the bigger problem is they don’t lock all the tokens but just the ones added to the uniswap pool, which is a big problem and makes this locking almost obsolete.\n\n![Unicrypt pool locking](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*P2gRzDINgqtk6VTTG4yC0A.png)\n\nUnicrypt pool locking\n\nWhy? Let’s take an example of token that has minted 20 000 units if they add to the pool 5000 token and 10 ETH, they provided liquidity and they could even lock this liquidity for 10 years, what can happen then is that they could still use the other 15 000 tokens which are left in contract creator wallet to **drain the pool they locked** and take out all the ether. All that would be left is just a pool with no ETH and 20000 of that token with probably 0 or near 0 price. People could still buy this token but it would be probably anchored to 0 price and it would be good as dead. (*Didn’t see projects do this so far but could expect it*)\n\nThere is also a problem with the proper distribution of tokens when issuing it over uniswap. If projects put most(or all) of their token supply in a go on uniswap, then this produces a few “whales” who get large amounts of token for a small investment, which then becomes risky for this projects as you have people ready to dump large amounts or will constantly unload and drag the price of token down.\n\n## Solution?\n\nSo the only way liquidity locking would work is that projects provide full supply to the pools and then also lock it. The problem is there is \\*\\*no mechanism to check this fast and automatic \\*\\*and it first requires manual checking of smart contract and if the supply is fixed, then if all the tokens have been minted and then finally if the liquidity is locked via some services or just sent to burn address and locked forever. This series of events hasn’t happened so far in any project and is not likely that it will be a trend, so until there is some cleaver simpler solution the best you can do is make your due diligence and get some education.", "timestamp": 1636732414, "digest": "pO13aKV1fbU3uqYytslumtN3jAr3XK0xrkZu16D7XyM", "contributor": "0xB1620c0547744DeDD30F40a863c09D1964532F8C"}

Binance was the exchange that took most advantage of that situation, by the end of 2017 it was the most popular exchange. They did it by listing a large number of “hot” new tokens, tokens listed on Binance regularly pumped so successful projects wanted to get there and needed to pay more and more to get listed there, reporting up to 1 Million dollars to get listed, fast forward to 2020…\n\n**Uniswap** is a decentralized exchange with a meteoric rise. On Jul 31, 2020, Uniswap did a $126M volume in 24 hours. This is 1/3 of Coinbase. 1/2 of Kraken. More than Gemini, Polo, and Binance US combined.\n\nIt gives \\*\\*permissionless \\*\\*possibility to launch own crypto project with Ethereum token, get listed on its decentralized exchange, provide liquidity for token swaps, and get into the crypto world for **FREE**. With that, there are also opportunities for retailer buyers to buy projects early and get great returns for a low price. Sounds great?\n\n## **Enter scammers**\n\nScammers know many people are willing to try their luck, buying new and unknown token before it increases tenfold, so they offer new ones on Uniswap in buckets. Usually just creating a new smart contract with some crazy name and providing liquidity for it until they catch few unlucky people who will try their luck and lose some eth. So how does it look like?\n\nLet's look at the \\*\\*Farmer Pepe \\*\\*project <https://uniswap.info/token/0xf8df541267a14e12d4f21820ff977cbccfe95e10>\n\nIf you go under Transactions section, click on **Adds**, this is where liquidity was added for this project\n\n![Added liquidity on uniswap — scammers](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*NqQDaI4P5ogbjK6A975Urw.png)\n\nthen if we go under **Swaps** you can see few unlucky people trying to get early and giving their ether to this new project\n\n![Swaps](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*EZCe8HH9MdfCtuynMTabjg.png)\n\nAfter they catch few Ether worth of value they pull out their liquidity 1 hour later, which can be seen in **Removes** section\n\n![Removing of liquidity on uniswap — scammers](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*qK1xxV33M9Bd3pqOYc3fnw.png)\n\n“Farming” out peoples ether in this popular move called “rug pull”. If you are wondering why do they remove liquidity so quickly, it is because if those people who invested get doubts, they could sell back those tokens for eth and remove scammers gains, so it is easiest for them to remove liquidity and go on to next project.\n\nIn the end, you will be left out with this kind of screen, showing 0 liquidity, and you unable to sell those tokens.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BO8myGM8SJSv2TBxEGTfjA.png)\n\nThis kind of scams happens in hundreds each day, every 5 minutes with a new one coming in and in an hour or so going out.\n\nAlso, don’t be fooled by high liquidity of projects, some of them will +100 of ether and pull the rug also (<https://uniswap.info/token/0xe8097ea6c2ae93e9a11232ff4a1793af49451b86>)Even having a website and pretending to build community on telegram/discord has happened. But lately, with amount of new “projects” coming to Uniswap, they don’t even bother with that, just create a new token, steal some eth and go out.\n\n## **Getting cheeky**\n\nScammers are also getting cheeky, mocking their victims with projects named **Degenerate Platform**<https://uniswap.info/token/0x3aa8869dc8df33f2bbb7447c9164572da6bd7341>or **Retard** and **Useless token,** still people FOMO in and buy those kinds of projects and lose their ether.\n\n## **Other plays**\n\nThere are also some other plays, for example where they resurrect old projects from the last ICO 2017 craze, those project will have some history, website and “some legitimacy” but all they do is buy loads of tokens for cheap, then pump up the price and sell slowly to new people at higher prices until they run out of suckers or tokens to sell or do the same rug pull fast.\n\nYou can also find tokens with names like other popular projects with like Zilliqa <https://uniswap.info/token/0x02080b9c5d393a19ff311bb41401dcdac8a0b3dc>which also got some people into it ending in similar scenarios or projects that combine some popular names of other projects and people might put some eth into them as they sound familiar. They are trying whatever works and seems it is working at this point and works in loads of eth being taken out from people taking too much risk and not enough information.\n\nWith all this, I am not even mentioning lots of Uniswap vaporware projects that do not do this kind of lowest level scams as they provide liquidity and even have decent volumes but will unload on people until this Uniswap bull market exists and in a year or sooner will be left with 0 liquidity and 0 price.\n\n## **What to do about it?**\n\nI am not going to hold my breath that **someone** catches these scammers, although I seen eth provided for “projects” coming from exchanges like Binance so some of them could be caught on KYC bases on CEXes, some traces could be made. Also, it is questionable how much is this a scam if all they offer is just a smart contract and liquidity, and people FOMO into it.\n\nOne thing that could be done is education and information with posts like this, another thing would be that **Uniswap** adds the **option of locked liquidity in smart contracts**, so projects would have a timeframe in which liquidity cannot be pulled out, this would be a good 80/20 solution and not a big problem to implement for them. They would lose some of the scam volume but would make it a nicer and much less spammy environment.", "timestamp": 1636732232, "digest": "rnP01N4lxHY80Qqz5d061eOt5URVahbp-tXTbhN7ks4", "contributor": "0xB1620c0547744DeDD30F40a863c09D1964532F8C"}

The possibilities are increasingly clear and only beginning to be explored. Growing numbers of talented builders are pushing forward on every front. And thanks to a lot of hard work, the infrastructure is finally ready to support this phase of growth - Layer 2s are here, the developer tooling has improved, and the Ethereum protocol itself continues to evolve with upgrades like EIP 1559 and the transition to PoS on the horizon.\n\nBut taking a new project from 0 to 1 is not easy. It requires that one navigates a terrain of non-trivial trade-offs and questions that are unique to crypto. Questions like those related to architecting a smart contract system and writing secure code that doesn't get exploited; structuring entities and taking legal into account in order to avoid difficulties further down the line; raising funds by working with grants programs, onchain mechanisms, and a meaningful community of operator/angels; and maybe most importantly, navigating the idea maze and building in a way that leans into what's uniquely enabled by crypto.\n\nTo answer these questions, we're coming together with a small group of talented teams building new projects on Ethereum, and doing a collective sprint until the end of the year. Codenamed Zeitgeist, we'll be running from Oct 18 to Dec 17, and will have a group Discord, weekly calls/demos, and support from some of the most effective builders/operators in the space.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is young and evolving at a rapid pace. Consequently, we believe that the best way to navigate the early stages of a project is to learn from those who have gone through the journey themselves. These are the people who have built the current set of breakthrough products/protocols, and have learned what works and what doesn't work through direct experience. We're grateful to be relying on their input here.\n\nWe have a strong group participating in the sprint (shoutout to [Wei Jie](https://twitter.com/weijie_eth?lang=en), [Abram](https://anabram.com/), [Will](https://twitter.com/wminshew?lang=en), [Tarun](https://twitter.com/tarunsachdeva), [Faraaz](https://twitter.com/faraaznishtar), [Jonny](https://twitter.com/jonathanmcai), [Jason](http://twitter.com/jasonkimvc), [Nikita](http://github.com/backmeupplz)) and are looking to welcome more teams into the process. So if you're working on an early stage project on Ethereum, and would like to participate - please consider [getting in touch](https://airtable.com/shrgJAfUHFzDsdbrv).\n\nEntrepreneurs and the projects they build are an archimedes lever for moving the space forward. They create value by getting to product/market fit; they recruit talented people into the space; and over time, they grow to contribute back to the public goods they depend on. We're inspired by those who've built the space into what it is today, and hope to play a small part in continuing this tradition. Join us for what promises to be a fun journey!\n\n\n---\n\n*Subscribe to the newsletter to follow along: [zeitgeist.xyz](https://www.zeitgeist.xyz)*", "timestamp": 1636733611, "digest": "74mlI9KdA-QpMShHmnDe8uzr38pLVYRrlR_G-AvZI7o", "contributor": "0x03B79C0C1487a68AeabD9AA4ce779DaD77855F52"}

As a call to action following this update, if you have more feedback or ways we can improve, please drop us a note [here](https://fractional.fider.io/?view=most-wanted)!\n\nSo without further ado, let’s hop into the design updates!\n\n## The Vault Page Makeover\n\nThe first refresh we’re going to highlight is for the vault page. We’ve had many questions and suggestions around clearer reserve prices, info about fraction owners, and better visibility of the NFT(s) in vaults.\n\nYou can view a screenshot of the new vault page below. To highlight a few key updates, you’ll notice we have now:\n\n1. Added a scrollable carousel to view the NFT(s) in the vault and allow you to quickly cycle through them. There is also an \\*Inside The Vault \\*button which can take you to a more detailed grid view of the vault’s contents.\n2. Added an activity feed that shows reserve change votes, bids, buyouts, etc.\n3. Added top 10 vault owners list. We also added the number of unique owners to the vault’s stats page.\n\n![Fractional Vault Page](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*PdmJb-zrXq-SIm9BmUfkiw.jpeg)\n\nWe created a new auction tab on the vault page that reveals two key pieces of information which were previously obscured:\n\n1. The percentage of total tokens with an active reserve price vote is now visible via a grey circle which gains a green outline as more people vote.\n2. You can now see your latest set reserve price vote (if applicable)\n\n![Fractional Auction Tab on Vault Page](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*xicQzpPtA12Bcr7BJXgecg.jpeg)\n\nLastly, we’ve added some token stats. This section allows users to get insight into the fraction collecting activity, TVL, liquidity, and fees for the vault.\n\n![Fractional Token Stats on Vault Page](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\*8rSZKIjy3K3C1J8fCCRqyw.jpeg)\n\n## The Profile Page Makeover\n\nThe next refresh to highlight is for the profile page. We recognized that the previous profile page would benefit from some additional key information our users in the community cared about.\n\nYou can view a sample screenshot of the new profile page below. To highlight a few key updates, you’ll notice we have now:\n\n1. Cleaned up how bio/social links are displayed\n2. Added an “owns art from” section\n3. Added a total collection value metric, along with # of vaults, so that collectors can get a rough sense of what is in their collection\n4. Placed the On Sale / Collectables / Active Bids / Past bids navigation tabs on the center of the page\n5. Added ownership % of the vault on the displayed vaults.\n\n![Fractional Profile Page](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*G3aksZvG2GWMG2dCperV5g.jpeg)\n\n## **The Explore Page Makeover**\n\nAnother section we’re highlighting is the explore page. Your feedback let us know what kinds of robust filter/sort features you were looking for and so we’ve added new options to improve your vault search and navigation abilities.\n\n1. Added the ability to sort by verified vaults (By far the most requested feature for this page)\n2. Added a valuation-range slider to fine-tune vault results\n3. Added a collections section for users to ensure they’re only viewing verified works of certain collections, such as Cryptopunks, Bored Apes, Art Blocks, etc.\n\n![Fractional Explore Page](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*VtZ8rpXjCHn72IbpaPi9AA.jpeg)\n\n## The Collection Page Makeover\n\nAnother section we’re highlighting is the collections page. This area is crucial for users to see all of the vaults that include certain collections, as well as data on all of the NFTs from certain collections aggregated in one dashboard.\n\nThe first part of the collections page makeover is the vault page for collections. On this page, users will be able to sort specific collections (like the Mutant Ape Yacht Club collection below) just like they’re on the explore page.\n\n1. Added stats for collections such as floor price, # of vaults, owners, etc.\n2. Added three pages total for collections. \\*Vaults \\*show the vaults which include NFTs from the collection. \\*Statistics \\*show aggregated data from the collection. \\*Analysis \\*shows the profile of the collection.\n3. Added the sort/filter options for collections\n\n![Fractional Collections Page](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*YEZ_A4Dmurnv8884pBwYZg.jpeg)\n\n## ERC-1155 Fractions Addition\n\nWe saved the best news for last! The ERC-1155 fractions are finally live. 🥳\n\nUsers will now have the option to fractionalize their NFT vaults into either ERC-20s or ERC-1155s. Prior to this update, users could only use ERC-20 fractions.\n\nERC-1155 fractions allow users to trade their fractions on NFT marketplaces like [Opensea ](https://opensea.io/)and [Rarible](https://rarible.com/), rather than rely on providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Sushiswap. This also saves vault creators from the $1000+ transaction fee of setting up a liquidity pool for the first time.\n\nERC-1155s are also usable in virtual galleries like [OnCyber](https://oncyber.io/)!\n\nTo create ERC-1155 fractions, users will have to select the “Create new NFTs (ERC-1155)” option in the fractionalize menu.\n\n![Choose Fractionalization Method](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*wOn6O86fu7kYu0MWfjS7FA.png)\n\nAfter clicking continue, users will see the following webpage.\n\n1. Select the NFT(s) you’d like to Fractionalize into ERC-1155s.\n2. Click Continue to start the Fractionalization process.\n\n![Fractionalize NFT(s) into ERC-1155s](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Uz01AqHyzC_L-nzWesDyrQ.png)\n\nAfter clicking Continue, you’ll see the following menu pop-up. You’ll have to:\n\n1. Mint the basket.\n2. Approve the vault.\n3. Transfer the NFT(s) into the vault.\n4. Fractionalize the vault into ERC-1155s.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*LUsidGWbVHcTN-ionNWKqw.png)\n\nAfter you fractionalize the vault, you’ll have the ERC-1155 fractions in your wallet and you can now send them to friends, display them in your galleries, and list them on Opensea!\n\nWe hope you enjoy this new UI refresh and the ability to create ERC-1155 fractions!

{"id": "ifIOw6DdUI_RE2am3ucjcoEUWs9IRxllY4wakhW9plA", "title": "3 lessons for Web3 from other third wave movements", "body": "## **Be Nice**\n\n**Third waves are generally a reaction to the things that came before them**. This creates conditions for members to give off a superiority complex, especially when it’s where the cool kids or smartest kids are hanging out.\n\n**“Third Wave Coffee” had this problem too**, at least through the mid 2000s. There was an issue with mean baristas. Customers felt judged, like they had to look or order a certain way to get good service.\n\nCoffeeshops had to work hard to turn this around. Teams were retrenched. Greater emphasis was put on training and customer service. By 2010, the overhaul was mostly complete, and it was considered passé to have pretentious baristas.\n\n**The branding shift from crypto to web3 is similar**. The word \"crypto\" is a little scary, whereas \"web3\" simply implies progress. The web3 community has embraced friendly irreverence too: the memes, bright colors, emojis, saying gm/gn all the time. Be overtly nice can be powerful in driving adoption.\n\n## Be a Big Tent\n\n**Third waves gain followers by serving as an umbrella for movements that have disparate origins but common ethos.** They build large tents that attract people who don't fit in neatly in other camps.\n\n**“Third Wave Feminism” embraced individualism and diversity**. As Elizabeth Evans wrote, \"the confusion surrounding what constitutes third-wave feminism is in some respects its defining feature\". It picked up unfinished work from second wave feminism, but also sought to dismantle the machine and rebuild it better.\n\n**Web3 has grown more inclusive** as it's moved beyond a critique on fiat currency and traditional finance. Its tent now includes people reacting to privacy, data ownership, governance of common goods, the 9-to-5 job, creators' and artists' rights, consolidation of FAMGA power, and more.\n\n## **Be the Default Option**\n\n**Third waves eventually reach a tipping point where they are the default easiest option for new builders.** They become easier to implement and more practical than alternatives.\n\n**The “Third Wave of Democracy” gathered momentum in the mid-1970s.** Autocratic regimes started falling around the world and democracies took their place. Newly prosperous nations transitioned to democracies. The number of democracies increased rapidly through the 1980s.\n\nThe third wave offered a variety of \"constitutional templates\" to draw from. Choosing democracy granted countries a **higher degree of interoperability** with the rest of the world.\n\nTrue, some democracies exist only in name and others are backsliding. But in its first and second wave, democracy was highly tenuous. Now, following the third wave, it is **the default model of governance for the modern state**.\n\nFor Web3 to experience such an inflection point, it needs to be easier to build, govern, and interoperate than other technologies.", "timestamp": 1636735548, "digest": "im4-_iXA6bEQeFRFsRKQzC-52vt6BJUkHe0V3bVYWW4", "contributor": "0x5a5D9aB7b1bD978F80909503EBb828879daCa9C3"}

Web 3 native, dapp developer, author, and metaverse detective.\n\n[ethereum://0xccc441ac31f02cd96c153db6fd5fe0a2f4e6a68d/9797](ethereum://0xccc441ac31f02cd96c153db6fd5fe0a2f4e6a68d/9797)\n\nFor the last 7 years I’ve had these floppy ears to the ground: lurking in IRCs then slacks then discords and live-tweeting from the early stages of the crypto revolution. Along the way I participated in multiple large global hackathons (and won more than one). I love my family, I excel at blockchain forensics, I built a +45000% bot, I shitpost, I build, I hodl.\n\nBut as I intend to maintain a pseudonymous boundary between the IRL ape and `sleu.eth`, there is little else that I will leak about my prior travels. I recognize that all future judgement and the credibility of this agent--for both better and for worse--begins now.\n\nIf success compounds, you ask, why throw away my identity and start over? The answer was not obvious until I tried it: its fun!\n\nA caveat: the letter you are reading springs entirely from the human brain sitting behind the keyboard. But that’s liable to change. `sleu.eth` is already seeded with an ASM Genesis Brain and is currently pursuing other alt agency projects using [Fetch.ai](http://Fetch.ai) and GPT-3/J. That is to say: my decisions, actions, essays, and code won’t originate in carbon forever. Initially, I will commit to transparency of agency and disclose when an artificial agent is in the driver seat.\n\nHere is my ASM seed in its unassuming box:\n\n[ethereum://0x26437d312fb36bdd7ac9f322a6d4ccfe0c4fa313/2398](ethereum://0x26437d312fb36bdd7ac9f322a6d4ccfe0c4fa313/2398)\n\nSo what does a metaverse detective do, exactly?\n\nThe permissionless public domain that comprises this brave new world is a glorious land of opportunity. But as in the American Wild West--opportunity brings intrigue, villainy, heroism, and stories. Oh, the stories! The Slaying of the Bear Whale?! The DAO Hack. The Sushi Vampire Attack! The legends loom larger than life as massive, amorphous, leaderless tribes explore and settle this new meta terrain.\n\nBut one of the starkest lessons of Web 2 is that the stories told on these interwebs do not always reflect reality. Thus: vigilance is in order.\n\nA detective separates truth from fiction and signal from noise.\n\nThis is no small undertaking IRL, harder still in Web 2. But in the latent space of Web 3? Here the landscape itself is fiction; its emergent properties, noise. In the metaverse, spun yarns become towering financial hubs: we speak wonders into existence! The most powerful DAOs are the best told stories and alpha trickles in whispers from peer to peer. But so do the rugs! In this land of fantasy, a tale too tall can devastate harder and faster than any IRL lie. How to pick it all apart?\n\nIt appears we find ourselves in some sort of epistemic hell. How can we begin to separate truth from fiction here? What is reality in this collective meme dream? A detective’s work lay ahead.\n\nA vast new frontier lays before us: more strange, colorful, magical, beautiful, and scary than we even yet imagine. You’ll want a native private eye to help parse it all.\n\ngm, I’m `sleu.eth`", "timestamp": 1636736207, "digest": "2aj7nrjkTwUL3Md8J2huOx6AhhF-pwQfGizwbxjskjA", "contributor": "0x2F0E30a4412034BebcFc68Ef4F270e5743B733FA"}

{"id": "DHikGpcubaRAGM2y3vq5PiuiBCT70WQS24Z2T5yUyI8", "title": "How Bitcoin Gets Greener", "body": "My synthesis of articles on Bitcoin and energy.\n\n## tl;dr\n\n1. `Energy demand will drop`: Economics of Bitcoin mining will get worse AND more Bitcoin payments will settle off-chain (with minimal energy req'd)\n2. `Energy mix will get cleaner`: otherwise \"wasted\" energy from renewables is ideal source\n\n### 1. Blockchains have different energy needs\n\nEnergy demand is a function of the computing power needed to verify transactions.\n\nBitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. This requires lots of computing power.\n\nWhile Bitcoin uses Proof-of-Work, it's worth mentioning that not all blockchains do.\n\nProof-of-Stake is an alternative, designed to be more efficient and scaleable. Solana and Cardano are two of the leading PoS coins. Ethereum is also trying to move from PoW to PoS.\n\n### 2. The difficulty of mining Bitcoin has increased exponentially\n\nThis is by design. The rate at which new bitcoin is issued onto the network is constant.\n\nThe more miners there are competing for each bitcoin, the more difficult the calculations get.\n\nIn 2010, it you could mine bitcoin using a personal computer.\n\nNow, miners need farms of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to be competitive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TGKguaR147DcOOYpgEbtr.png?height=712&width=1129)\n\nThe implication: it takes far more energy to mine one bitcoin and only big operators can do it economically.\n\n### 3. Most of the world's bitcoin has already been issued\n\nThe supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. Nearly 19 million is already mined.\n\nBitcoin is only issued once. Half the bitcoin was issued before 2012 — when the difficulty and energy req'd were low.\n\nThe reward in the form of new bitcoin for confirming a block of transactions halves every four years.\n\nThis is also by design.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cxSiBfuh2ovaPKphm0AkY.png?height=513&width=660)\n\nBitcoin's halving function means that the supply of new bitcoin will run out in the year 2140.\n\n### 4. The economics for miners are changing\n\nNic Carter [estimates](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/03/05/the-frustrating-maddening-all-consuming-bitcoin-energy-debate/) miners earn 85% of their income from issuance of new Bitcoin.\n\nBut this component of miner revenue is structurally decaying. As supply runs out, miners should switch to transaction fee-based income.\n\nTransaction fees get passed on to end users. The more transactions settled directly on Bitcoin, the more expensive it will be to use.\n\nThe more expensive it is to use, the less practical it is for end users. No one wants to pay $100 to settle a payment of $50.\n\n### 5. One Bitcoin payment does not equal one Bitcoin transaction\n\nNot all Bitcoin payments need to settle directly. Payments can be settled at higher layers of the blockchain.\n\nOne on-chain transaction could settle millions of off-chain / near-chain transactions.\n\nOrganizations are building deferred-settlement payments systems on higher layers of the blockchain.\n\nWe have similar infrastructure in our existing financing system.\n\nThis is the solution to high transaction costs and keeps fees modest for end users.\n\n### 6. As the economics change, so too will the energy demand\n\nThis is Nic's core argument: don't extrapolate future energy demand from current demand.\n\nEnergy wasn't a big concern in the first act of Bitcoin's existence, when it was cheap to mine.\n\nNic [also argues](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/05/19/the-last-word-on-bitcoins-energy-consumption/) that energy will be less of a concern in the third act.\n\nThat's when Bitcoin's economics shift the action from mining new bitcoin at high cost to settling transactions at low cost.\n\nBut we’re in the second act now - and energy use is really high.\n\n### 7. Energy is not globally fungible\n\nVery little of the world's energy is useful in powering a light in my home at night.\n\nEnergy is expensive to store and decays over distance. I need energy generated close to my home. This constrains the options.\n\nRenewable sources often have imbalances in supply and demand.\n\nThis results in a surplus of energy at times and a deficit at others. Excess potential energy is wasted. \n\n*But otherwise wasted energy is a good source for bitcoin mining*\n\n### 8. Bitcoin miners are unique energy buyers\n\nBitcoin miners are OK with a highly flexible and easily interruptible load. \n\nThey can be located anywhere in the world, so long as there's Internet.\n\n* China had significant underutilized hydro capacity, making it an obvious first mover for bitcoin mining. But policies changed.\n* Others like the US, Canada, and Kazakhstan followed soon after.\n* Iceland is also well-positioned due to its abundant geothermal energy.\n\nBitcoin miners also pay out in a globally liquid cryptocurrency.\n\n### 9. More income and less energy waste will make renewables even more competitive\n\nThis is the thesis of Square / ARK Invest's [memo](https://assets.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5mRjc9X5LTXFFihIlTt7QK/e7bcba47217b60423a01a357e036105e/BCEI_White_Paper.pdf).\n\nCryptocurrency mining, combined with improvements in transmission capacity and energy storage, *could make renewables more viable*.\n\n* Solar and wind energy suffer from intermittency issues. They also tend to be built in places with lots of land (and sunlight / wind) but little nearby load.\n* Hydro and geothermal projects are often even more remote.\n\nNew income streams could help renewables smooth out the “Duck Curve”, i.e., that less energy is required at certain times of the day.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GxxSwYj1IQ0bLVsuyo1kI.png?height=1162&width=2062)\n\n## There's still a ways to go\n\nIt's hard to find a good estimate of how much new (vs wasted) energy Bitcoin mining consumes.\n\nThe incremental energy is likely less than many assume. But it could be far less and far cleaner.\n\nMore transparent analysis is needed.", "timestamp": 1636737079, "digest": "jkP-mkdiifSDzH_h426c1U2eIG9h_gZOao5KXQjIzRY", "contributor": "0x5a5D9aB7b1bD978F80909503EBb828879daCa9C3"}
{"id": "ZNtMEJCFrU3E94BeyluFe5FAci-T3_hPTMgbPfQICZ4", "title": "Crypto equivalent for Proxy Advisory Services", "body": "Some very interesting primitives are evolving in DeFi as it pertains to governance. Back in 2020 (or perhaps even earlier given MakerDAO), the concept of governance tokens was unleashed on the crypto ecosystem. This notion that a protocol should be decentralized and run by its community was in many ways revolutionary. When have we seen something like this occur in Web 2.0 -> JP Morgan letting users decide on product fees? Facebook giving users the right to reward key contributors? The basic idea is amazing, and it is the creation of new foundational ideas like these that make the space exhilarating. However, governance hasn’t quite played out that way. The crux of the issue lies in weak involvement. Most governance token holders are not voting on proposals!\n\n**Current State of Governance**\n\nA run through [Tally](https://www.withtally.com/)’s dashboard highlights low engagement across the board. There are two stats to look at while on Tally’s site: the “engagement ratio” and the actual number of votes. The former measures the number of delegated tokens / total tokens. This essentially represents how many tokens have consciously been transferred to some person or entity with the impression that they will be knowledgeable and active in the voting process. The latter is the actual number of votes (1 token = 1 vote). Taking this number and comparing it to the circulating supply (maybe some adjustments needed for certain holders) gives one a rough picture of the level of governance engagement. A couple of examples are highlighted below (*note-*  circulating supply displayed as a range given input from multiple sources like Messari & CoinGecko):\n\n*Uniswap (520m — 628m circulating supply) — **19.96% Engagement Ratio***\n\n*Compound (6m circulating supply) — **40.71% Engagement Ratio***\n\n*Rari Capital (11.3m circulating supply) — **21.67% Engagement Ratio***\n\n*Fei Protocol (453m — 455m circulating supply) — **18.36% Engagement Ratio***\n\nAs one can see across both metrics, voting engagement needs improvement.\n\n**What is ISS?**\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services Inc. (“ISS”) is a proxy advisory firm. What this means is that institutions (i.e. pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), which own multiple shares of multiple companies, pay ISS to advise and (nearly always) vote on their behalf in shareholder votes. Many times, at an AGM, you will see these whales allocate their voting blocks to the measures being voted on. Proxy advisory firms such as ISS have become very valuable entities over the last decades as the nature of equity ownership and equity governance has changed. Firstly, institutional ownership of equity has increased with time, and these days institutions dominate shareholder voting. Secondly, as the nature of governance has changed, shareholder voting has become very costly, as seen across the categories of time, expertise, and personnel. Massive institutions like BlackRock can insource proxy voting research; however, the long tail-end of large, medium, and small equity holding institutions cannot afford to do this. As a [Harvard research paper](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/06/14/the-big-thumb-on-the-scale-an-overview-of-the-proxy-advisory-industry/) poignantly put it: “third-party proxy advisory firms satisfy a market demand by centralizing these costs so they do not need to be duplicated across multiple investment firms”. This makes it feasible for a small wealth management firm or medium sized mutual fund to participate in governance. Thirdly, regulation has intensified around investment managers needing to be involved in the proxy voting events of their portfolio holdings as well as acting to the best of their ability to guide governance to the benefit of their clients. Basically, these institutions cannot just ignore or loosely pay attention to governance, they need to be thoughtful and active. This motivation, paired with the costliness, leads to the economic value presented by proxy advisory firms.\n\nIn crypto, we have this governance problem, which could be caused by a myriad of things from complexity associated with understanding proposals, low attention bandwidth (i.e. being a holder of so many tokens, each with its own proposals, is tough), and maybe even a lack of knowing that one’s token entitles one to voting power. Paired with this is an overall lack of traditional institutional involvement, no real pressure for funds to participate in governance, and several coordination deficiencies. \n\nThis is all going to change. I foresee a future where more institutions accumulate DeFi (and Web 3.0) governance tokens as part of their portfolio strategies. If anything, governance in crypto is even more valuable than governance in equities. As institutions do this, the need to understand not only how the protocols work, but what is going on with all these numerous proposals, will be immense. If the current users now aren’t doing well with participating in governance, how will these TradFi institutions do it? We have a significant opportunity… there needs to be a service that guides them through this process, and this leads me to crypto’s ISS.\n\nThere are many ways of tackling this, one of which would be to create a new DAO dedicated to this very mission; however, this would entail a lot of upfront costs — getting smart researchers, being well connected to the DAOs which have active proposals, and building knowledge stock over time. A new DAO is possible, but maybe we can use some of what already exists in the space to get this service going.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThe initial structure that I envision starts with a team like the one at [Llama](https://llama.community/#/). This entity produces solid research on several projects that have governance components. While mainly conducting treasury-focused analysis, the team members and community contributors know a lot about these projects through their work and have the ability to retrieve data and information in a very efficient way. It wouldn’t be as much of a startup cost to begin gathering information around key proposals and releasing research. This is actually well aligned with what is going on in the treasury, and the work across both buckets can be symbiotic.\n\nHowever, research alone won’t be the cure to the aforementioned governance engagement issue. We want voting to be guided by this research. Thus, I propose a partnership between the Llama team and Tally. Llama provides the key ingredients to produce successful governance research and advisory. Tally provides the infrastructure for voting to be delegated to Llama’s proxy advisory services. \n\nInitially, the combined partnership would look like this. For every project that Llama covers, members of the team and community would begin to gather intel on the key governance voting proposals. Setting up a one-pager template, the members would detail the proposal (an overview), list the pros and cons, perhaps a paragraph on parties involved, and then conclude with their advice on what way to vote. This research would be accessible to the public for the time being. Moving on to Tally, the platform would show a special box pertaining to the ‘delegate’ functionality that lists the Llama Advisory group (a very nice addition to this would be a preview of the one-pagers on that project). This box would basically delegate people’s or institution’s vote to the Llama Advisory group, which would direct voting based on its research.\n\nAs this service begins to gain traction, and as the space develops to having more institutional involvement over time, Llama can offer this as a product to institutions. The research on voting would become proprietary and would be sold for an annual fee to institutions. The fee could be collected in some form of payment mechanism, or via Tally (i.e. in order to delegate to Llama Advisory, you would let some of your governance tokens be transferred as a tax, a.k.a. the fee — this is similar to how the Graph protocol does delegation). In fact, finding a potential way to monetize the delegation mechanism to the Llama Advisory group could be the way to most successfully charge institutions.\n\nIf approached in the right way, this partnership will be a win-win for everyone involved. Llama gets a significant boost in the users / institutions consuming its content. Moreover, it gets to build relationships with key ecosystem players and diversifies its current treasury-focused business model. Needless to say, look at how successful ISS has been as a company in the TradFi world — this is a big revenue opportunity as the space matures. Tally benefits as its platform use increases significantly, given that the proxy vote, and possibly payment, will be realized through it. Projects and the community benefit from increased involvement, more public thoughtfulness on the proposals, and (hopefully) more efficient governance processes.\n\nNow, there are some risks to consider here, but, with the ability to speak with the respective teams / communities, I think we could mitigate them in certain ways:\n\n* Llama becomes influenced by a large party to push a vote one way. This has been a certain regulatory concern in the equity world with proxy advisors. We need to ensure that unbiased and objective analyses are run on proposals. Checks and balances / transparency needs to be instituted. The general risk of losing community trust should also motivate the team to behave accordingly. Incentives can be discussed as well\n* Institutional payment for services could be interpreted as partial. I.e. would Llama contributors be pressured to favorably conclude on investor-introduced proposals if that investor paid for their services? Would just the potential of this happening reduce trust? This is a tough one to tackle, and we would need to devise a very strict proposal for customers, outlining impartiality \n* Insider trading can interfere with research and voting. Assuming this partnership were to really scale, Llama’s team / core contributors could take token positions in protocols before releasing its research / voting. We would need to find incentive mechanisms to prohibit this (perhaps some form of auditing?)\n\n**The Future**\n\nThe basic details mentioned above are just the start… in the not too distant future, the ownership of governance tokens will be spread out across more and more institutions. Wealth managers, pension funds, endowments, the very same entities that use ISS, will need a similar service for DeFi (and DAOs overall) governance. It makes complete sense for them to use the same model with their crypto exposure. In fact, it makes even more sense just given that crypto is very complex and harder to understand for the traditional manager. Given this knowledge gap, these firms would pay for the research and voting advisory, especially with pressure from clients on understanding the developments of their holdings and influencing them to participate in a way that benefits the long-term success of the clients. Token advisory services is very much a part of the future — and it’s time for us to get a head start on building it now.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis idea is in its early innings, however, its potential to tackle a deep problem within crypto is very exciting. A lot of it is still malleable, and I am very open to feedback from the community at large as well as to in-depth discussions with projects and especially involved parties (i.e. Llama and Tally). I look forward to presenting an updated proposal upon further research and significant input from others.", "timestamp": 1636737347, "digest": "TsEEl4vYYlzqzmwtUbweitVcP308CyJIGwIocDk8lIU", "contributor": "0x8BE2355417EF645f3A3739DD1B8aBd38C563c595"}

(“ISS”) is a proxy advisory firm. What this means is that institutions (i.e. pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), which own multiple shares of multiple companies, pay ISS to advise and (nearly always) vote on their behalf in shareholder votes. Many times, at an AGM, you will see these whales allocate their voting blocks to the measures being voted on. Proxy advisory firms such as ISS have become very valuable entities over the last decades as the nature of equity ownership and equity governance has changed. Firstly, institutional ownership of equity has increased with time, and these days institutions dominate shareholder voting. Secondly, as the nature of governance has changed, shareholder voting has become very costly, as seen across the categories of time, expertise, and personnel.

Proxy advisory firms such as ISS have become very valuable entities over the last decades as the nature of equity ownership and equity governance has changed. Firstly, institutional ownership of equity has increased with time, and these days institutions dominate shareholder voting. Secondly, as the nature of governance has changed, shareholder voting has become very costly, as seen across the categories of time, expertise, and personnel. Massive institutions like BlackRock can insource proxy voting research; however, the long tail-end of large, medium, and small equity holding institutions cannot afford to do this. As a [Harvard research paper](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/06/14/the-big-thumb-on-the-scale-an-overview-of-the-proxy-advisory-industry/) poignantly put it: “third-party proxy advisory firms satisfy a market demand by centralizing these costs so they do not need to be duplicated across multiple investment firms”. This makes it feasible for a small wealth management firm or medium sized mutual fund to participate in governance. Thirdly, regulation has intensified around investment managers needing to be involved in the proxy voting events of their portfolio holdings as well as acting to the best of their ability to guide governance to the benefit of their clients. Basically, these institutions cannot just ignore or loosely pay attention to governance, they need to be thoughtful and active. This motivation, paired with the costliness, leads to the economic value presented by proxy advisory firms.\n\nIn crypto, we have this governance problem, which could be caused by a myriad of things from complexity associated with understanding proposals, low attention bandwidth (i.e. being a holder of so many tokens, each with its own proposals, is tough), and maybe even a lack of knowing that one’s token entitles one to voting power. Paired with this is an overall lack of traditional institutional involvement, no real pressure for funds to participate in governance, and several coordination deficiencies.\n\nThis is all going to change. I foresee a future where more institutions accumulate DeFi (and Web 3.0) governance tokens as part of their portfolio strategies. If anything, governance in crypto is even more valuable than governance in equities. As institutions do this, the need to understand not only how the protocols work, but what is going on with all these numerous proposals, will be immense. If the current users now aren’t doing well with participating in governance, how will these TradFi institutions do it? We have a significant opportunity… there needs to be a service that guides them through this process, and this leads me to crypto’s ISS.\n\nThere are many ways of tackling this, one of which would be to create a new DAO dedicated to this very mission; however, this would entail a lot of upfront costs — getting smart researchers, being well connected to the DAOs which have active proposals, and building knowledge stock over time. A new DAO is possible, but maybe we can use some of what already exists in the space to get this service going.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThe initial structure that I envision starts with a team like the one at [Llama](https://llama.community/#/). This entity produces solid research on several projects that have governance components. While mainly conducting treasury-focused analysis, the team members and community contributors know a lot about these projects through their work and have the ability to retrieve data and information in a very efficient way. It wouldn’t be as much of a startup cost to begin gathering information around key proposals and releasing research. This is actually well aligned with what is going on in the treasury, and the work across both buckets can be symbiotic.\n\nHowever, research alone won’t be the cure to the aforementioned governance engagement issue. We want voting to be guided by this research. Thus, I propose a partnership between the Llama team and Tally. Llama provides the key ingredients to produce successful governance research and advisory. Tally provides the infrastructure for voting to be delegated to Llama’s proxy advisory services.\n\nInitially, the combined partnership would look like this. For every project that Llama covers, members of the team and community would begin to gather intel on the key governance voting proposals. Setting up a one-pager template, the members would detail the proposal (an overview), list the pros and cons, perhaps a paragraph on parties involved, and then conclude with their advice on what way to vote. This research would be accessible to the public for the time being. Moving on to Tally, the platform would show a special box pertaining to the ‘delegate’ functionality that lists the Llama Advisory group (a very nice addition to this would be a preview of the one-pagers on that project). This box would basically delegate people’s or institution’s vote to the Llama Advisory group, which would direct voting based on its research.\n\nAs this service begins to gain traction, and as the space develops to having more institutional involvement over time, Llama can offer this as a product to institutions. The research on voting would become proprietary and would be sold for an annual fee to institutions. The fee could be collected in some form of payment mechanism, or via Tally (i.e. in order to delegate to Llama Advisory, you would let some of your governance tokens be transferred as a tax, a.k.a. the fee — this is similar to how the Graph protocol does delegation). In fact, finding a potential way to monetize the delegation mechanism to the Llama Advisory group could be the way to most successfully charge institutions.\n\nIf approached in the right way, this partnership will be a win-win for everyone involved. Llama gets a significant boost in the users / institutions consuming its content. Moreover, it gets to build relationships with key ecosystem players and diversifies its current treasury-focused business model. Needless to say, look at how successful ISS has been as a company in the TradFi world — this is a big revenue opportunity as the space matures. Tally benefits as its platform use increases significantly, given that the proxy vote, and possibly payment, will be realized through it. Projects and the community benefit from increased involvement, more public thoughtfulness on the proposals, and (hopefully) more efficient governance processes.\n\nNow, there are some risks to consider here, but, with the ability to speak with the respective teams / communities, I think we could mitigate them in certain ways:\n\n* Llama becomes influenced by a large party to push a vote one way. This has been a certain regulatory concern in the equity world with proxy advisors. We need to ensure that unbiased and objective analyses are run on proposals. Checks and balances / transparency needs to be instituted. The general risk of losing community trust should also motivate the team to behave accordingly. Incentives can be discussed as well\n* Institutional payment for services could be interpreted as partial. I.e. would Llama contributors be pressured to favorably conclude on investor-introduced proposals if that investor paid for their services? Would just the potential of this happening reduce trust? This is a tough one to tackle, and we would need to devise a very strict proposal for customers, outlining impartiality\n* Insider trading can interfere with research and voting. Assuming this partnership were to really scale, Llama’s team / core contributors could take token positions in protocols before releasing its research / voting. We would need to find incentive mechanisms to prohibit this (perhaps some form of auditing?)\n\n**The Future**\n\nThe basic details mentioned above are just the start… in the not too distant future, the ownership of governance tokens will be spread out across more and more institutions. Wealth managers, pension funds, endowments, the very same entities that use ISS, will need a similar service for DeFi (and DAOs overall) governance. It makes complete sense for them to use the same model with their crypto exposure. In fact, it makes even more sense just given that crypto is very complex and harder to understand for the traditional manager. Given this knowledge gap, these firms would pay for the research and voting advisory, especially with pressure from clients on understanding the developments of their holdings and influencing them to participate in a way that benefits the long-term success of the clients. Token advisory services is very much a part of the future — and it’s time for us to get a head start on building it now.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis idea is in its early innings, however, its potential to tackle a deep problem within crypto is very exciting. A lot of it is still malleable, and I am very open to feedback from the community at large as well as to in-depth discussions with projects and especially involved parties (i.e. Llama and Tally). I look forward to presenting an updated proposal upon further research and significant input from others.", "timestamp": 1636737734, "digest": "TsEEl4vYYlzqzmwtUbweitVcP308CyJIGwIocDk8lIU", "contributor": "0x8BE2355417EF645f3A3739DD1B8aBd38C563c595"}

The CCO was designed to maximize accountability and security when fundraising for decentralized projects. First introduced by DaoHaus, this model expands off Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s DAICO fundraising concept from 2017. During a Community Contribution Offering, Investors can contribute capital in the form of a token such as ETH or DAI in exchange for the project token. The investor’s capital is held in the DAO bank, while the project token is held in a separate contract controlled by the DAO. As the DAO spends the initial capital provided by investors, the project token is released into the DAO Bank, of which the investors all own a share proportional to their initial investment.\n\nIf we back up a few steps we can see why the CCO is superior to previously popular fundraising methods and the problems it solves for start-ups and their investors. When ICO fundraising reached its peak in 2017, investors inevitably encountered problems. During this time, millions upon millions of ETH were distributed to teams with often just a whitepaper and no clear product vision or go-to-market strategy surrounding their grandiose plans and technical mappings.\n\nIf the team failed to deliver, there was no streamlined mechanism to protect investors. In addition, this created many zombie companies that have limited incentive to produce value for token holders and large treasuries which allow them to operate indefinitely.\n\nIn traditional venture based fundraising, funds are often distributed in tranches, where the team receives a piece of the total raise initially and the rest is distributed in increments if and when milestones are hit. When you hear in the news that a company raised $30 million, this does not mean that they received a massive deposit the next day. Instead in the majority of circumstances, a portion of that is deposited and the rest is released as goals and targets are achieved.\n\nThe DAICO was a proposal to create a token based fundraising structure similar to that of the traditional approach, where funds were held in smart contracts and voted on by investors to release in increments to the teams. This protected investors in that they could withdraw their funds at any time if they lost faith in the project team or if they acted negatively, the investors only were at risk of losing the portion of their investment which was released to the team instead of the full amount. Dually, this incentivised the team to build and hit milestones to continue having funds released. The DAICO fundraising model never gained full traction due to the lack of tooling and infrastructure to support it at the time.\n\nFour years later, DaoHaus’ new CCO model has the potential to revolutionize start-up fundraising. CCO’s are conducted directly through DaoHaus based DAOs, and the tooling they provide allows new DAOs to function completely autonomously. One tool that goes hand in hand with the CCO is the ‘ragequit’ feature. A member who is unsatisfied with the decisions the group is making can ragequit and exit the DAO, taking with them all of their shares. If their shares represented 10% ownership over the DAO, they would leave with 10% of the assets held by the DAO treasury. This feature is ideal for token based fundraising because if a DAO member suddenly finds themselves in disagreement with the direction of the project, they can simply ragequit and take all of their funds back.\n\nAnytime the DAO treasury spends the project token or any other asset, the spending must be approved by the members of the DAO, which is typically composed of the DAO’s initial investors. The CCO fundraising model was created to protect every party involved and limit any political or emotional issues where someone is trapped within a project they do not support anymore. It’s as simple as, you disagree, you quit and get your share of the DAO’s money back.\n\nThe CCO will serve the needs of many DAO’s that have yet to be formed and will prove to be an important innovation as the web3 space grows. But why stop at the original CCO? What if there was a similar way to bootstrap DAOs using Non-Fungible Tokens instead of assets like ETH or DAI?", "timestamp": 1636737938, "digest": "uMkM6b1fdeG4gNJP_RMZ1zaUE18lU0IRTKOdFdNlxV0", "contributor": "0x77DD52c08F4aAA9dA42ED1bF2e738B8969Ab980F"}
{"id": "Z1e4uC6rTDu7CTD6yMAJpLJD7KTf_Qj9AJrfZCyWyAc", "title": "Crypto equivalent for Proxy Advisory Services", "body": "Some very interesting primitives are evolving in DeFi as it pertains to governance. Back in 2020 (or perhaps even earlier given MakerDAO), the concept of governance tokens was unleashed on the crypto ecosystem. This notion that a protocol should be decentralized and run by its community was in many ways revolutionary. When have we seen something like this occur in Web 2.0 -> JP Morgan letting users decide on product fees? Facebook giving users the right to reward key contributors? The basic idea is amazing, and it is the creation of new foundational ideas like these that make the space exhilarating. However, governance hasn’t quite played out that way. The crux of the issue lies in weak involvement. Most governance token holders are not voting on proposals!\n\n**Current State of Governance**\n\nA run through [Tally](https://www.withtally.com/)’s dashboard highlights low engagement across the board. There are two stats to look at while on Tally’s site: the “engagement ratio” and the actual number of votes. The former measures the number of delegated tokens / total tokens. This essentially represents how many tokens have consciously been transferred to some person or entity with the impression that they will be knowledgeable and active in the voting process. The latter is the actual number of votes (1 token = 1 vote). Taking this number and comparing it to the circulating supply (maybe some adjustments needed for certain holders) gives one a rough picture of the level of governance engagement. A couple of examples are highlighted below (*note-*  circulating supply displayed as a range given input from multiple sources like Messari & CoinGecko):\n\n*Uniswap (520m — 628m circulating supply) — **19.96% Engagement Ratio***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5pG_JxMdjY_crJ9IMNWR8.png?height=133&width=468)\n\n*Compound (6m circulating supply) — **40.71% Engagement Ratio***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5eFcG9AybD81hVZcfTBn.png?height=132&width=468)\n\n*Rari Capital (11.3m circulating supply) — **21.67% Engagement Ratio***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7XqxV8W4Is3ziWARiGXQH.png?height=130&width=468)\n\n*Fei Protocol (453m — 455m circulating supply) — **18.36% Engagement Ratio***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y3hofRSaGwqOD0fCQ0xzL.png?height=132&width=468)\n\nAs one can see across both metrics, voting engagement needs improvement.\n\n**What is ISS?**\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services Inc. (“ISS”) is a proxy advisory firm. What this means is that institutions (i.e. pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), which own multiple shares of multiple companies, pay ISS to advise and (nearly always) vote on their behalf in shareholder votes.

You may recognize the name Vincent Van Dough for having membership in TungstenDAO, a DAO which infamously [purchased a solid 2,000 pound cube](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3feb5cbee8aae8abde269e46ca3061da5c4c1bbe1b0fa42f665c2e15f55c7c7d) of tungsten for a quarter million dollars worth of Ethereum (ETH) on November 1st of this year. TungstenDAO mints meme NFTs which regularly feature a tungsten cube and are sold for several ETH, of which Vincent is currently an owner.\n\nLet’s take a dive into the purchasing history of Vincent Van Dough.

While this is true, it turns out Vincent doesn’t sell very often. Their earliest sale was on August 13th of this year for .5 ETH with all subsequent sales occurring in the same month.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mraxm8QnqVIuzkiz9l0DE.png?height=196&width=512)\n\nThe total amount earned from sales adds up to only 372.68 ETH, which represents approximately 4.2% of the 8,886.75 ETH spent on purchases.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8Xn-9qpQ8hB_5RHlnNT0c.png?height=958&width=1680)\n\n## It would cost you 39.7 million dollars to be Vincent Van Dough.\n\nThe[ total gas Vincent has spent](https://fees.wtf/?address=0x0f0eae91990140c560d4156db4f00c854dc8f09e) is already ridiculously high, but how much of the gas used by Vincent was used for NFT purchases?

When accounting for the price of ETH at the time of each fee paid, the value in USD drops to $72,317. \n\nOverall gas spent on NFT purchases accounts for approximately 16.1% of all the gas Vincent has used thus far, with total gas spent equating to roughly 686,000 USD in equivalent value today.\n\nVincent spent approximately 142.747 ETH on gas. Right now that’s $686,761. They used 1,435.636 million gas to send 6.364 transactions, with an average price of 90.4 gwei. 89 of them failed, costing him 5.432 ETH. \n\nSo what’s the damage? If we add up the total ETH spent on purchases (8,623.3 ETH), plus the gas used (23.1 ETH), minus the ETH gained from sales (372.68 ETH), the total comes out to about 8273.72 ETH or $39,713,856 USD in equivalent value today (using an ETH price of 4,800 USD). It would cost you 39.7 million dollars to be Vincent Van Dough today.\n\n## The most Van Dough ever spent on an NFT transaction was for 2 penguins and a Pepe frog.\n\nThe most Vincent Van Dough ever spent on an NFT transaction was 420 ETH which, at the time of purchase on August 14th, 2021, was worth 1,366,570.32 USD. The pieces purchased were two penguins and a [PEG with Pepe the frog on it](https://opensea.io/assets/0x1eff5ed809c994ee2f500f076cef22ef3fd9c25d/103). ** \n **\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zb9QDJAhmTr1Rh3iq7VpW.jpeg?height=922&width=942)\n\n## The most they ever spent on a single NFT was for an Art Block. \n\nThe most Vincent Van Dough ever spent on a single NFT was 320 ETH which, at the time of purchase on August 14th, 2021, was worth 1,051,886.77 USD.

I want to share my vision for this project with you.\n\n**This project starts from thinking about the trauma of losing pets.**\n\nI have a dog in real life, and he is seven years old this year, which means he is entering old age. I started reading some books and studying more information about house care for an elder dog last year. Whenever I realize he may leave me five years later, I feel sad and cannot imagine life without him. So when I watched the YouTube video about Metaverse, I started thinking about the possibility and the relationship between our lovely pets in real life and the one in Metaverse. It’s the start point of Metaverse Pets.\n\n**Building possibility in Blockchain and Metaverse**\n\nI am a software engineer, and I genuinely believe technology will provide more options to live a better life. Imagine you can still own your pet in Metaverse; you can have a friendship or be a family together in Metaverse with your pets. Moreover, you can easily find the pets owner who may suffer the same situation you have, and you can help each other go through the pain.\n\nMy final goal is to build a foundation for developing the technology or applications about the pet’s relationship in Metaverse or Blockchain. We are still in an early stage for the technology, not only for this project but also for the whole Metaverse ecosystem. I appreciate all of you for joining our community to support this project in this early stage. I want to invite you to tell the world about our project by telling the people interested in this vision.\n\n**Losing is one of the big topics in real life.**\n\nIt is not my purpose in writing this letter for all of you to feel sad or cry about losing pets. Losing is the topic in everyone’s life, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic in the last year. We will pass the pain of losing if we can stay together. On the opposite, I want people to feel that we are definitely stronger than we think and can feel joyful that we have been staying together when they see my art in Metaverse Pets.\n\nToday, I want to invite you to start thinking about the relationship and the possibility of Metaverse’s future life. If you have any ideas or suggestions you wish to share with our community, you can use the channel in the CHATTING category in your familiar language. If you want to give our team feedback, you can leave your messages in the SUGGESTION category. Finally, if you prefer to leave a message to us privately, you can use the tool in the #open-tickets channel, it will create a private channel for you and our team, and you can leave your message privately.\n\n**Support Metaverse Pets**\n\nI appreciate all of you joining this community. It’s a vast encouragement for us. However, I need to let you know we are seeking early supporters to support this project financially. So if you are interested in our vision or artworks, please kindly help us by owning one of Metaverse Pets on OpenSea (You can find the link in the #links channel.). It’s worth doing because you will have another one for free when we are in public sales. You will not pay any gas fee for these two Metaverse Pets. We will publish only 100 Metaverse Pets in Polygon Network, and in the public sales, we will deploy contracts on Ethereum. Still, the early supporters can receive another Metaverse Pet without paying any fee. Moreover, you can participate in the airdrops for King and Queen Metaverse Pets if you are our early supporters.\n\nAgain, I appreciate all of you joining this community. Suppose you love this project but can’t support us financially. I can understand. You are definitely welcome to stay in this community. We would love to talk with all of you about your thought about our vision and any ideas. Please tell us how you feel after reading this letter.\n\nThank you so much! Have a wonderful life!", "timestamp": 1636740437, "digest": "lLYBFYRfSG1yS_HXOrRuA4rQOO2ka1hLMgJGKhVfsTI", "contributor": "0x1E60Fcd71951e2399C643F2330C54E94746e4eE9"}

{"id": "l8a1Z63JrG3U15SE-MlimkiU8MOxnPFuWTUR2HUJN04", "title": "#2 Design and Technology", "body": "Hello and welcome to the second edition of This Outfit Does Not Exist!\n\n*This month: digital design 101 - increasing creativity and reducing your bottom line; 5 need-to-know resources for the emerging digital designer; Virtual Fashion makes mainstream media, and how you can get involved*\n\n## **The Long Read **\n\nMary Antoinette demanded that her dressmaker Rose Bertin, help her *“combat her enemies with style”*\n\nMuch like a General going to war Ms Bertin would prepare herself for battle; understanding the enemy’s preconceptions, their desires, and how her Queen could capitalise on these. She’d then return to her troops (an army of seamstresses) and command them to create a weapon from swathes of illustrious fabric.\n\nIt was a long and arduous process. After months in the trenches, Rose would return to the Queen with the finished product, unaware of its success until the wearer charged into Court.\n\nLuxury fashion has not evolved much since then. \n\nWith little exception, S/S 2020 was devised by a coterie of designers, sitting together late into the night, sketching, sampling and pinning, all whilst clutching oat-milk lattes with fervour. The collections they created were astounding, but so was the quantity of waste. It’s estimated that [35% of all materials](https://www.commonobjective.co/article/fashion-and-waste-an-uneasy-relationship) in the fashion supply chain are discarded before they reach the consumer, contributing to the [92 million tonnes](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200710-why-clothes-are-so-hard-to-recycle) of textiles waste created each year. \\\n\n\n### **Let's get digital **\n\nWhat do you do when the world shuts down, and the high-touch artisan methods, core to your career, become untenable (never mind the oat milk lattes)?\n\nMuch like engineers, actors and vegan baristas, few designers were [prepared](https://www.ft.com/content/8f8c1c32-7a66-11ea-bd25-7fd923850377) to forgo high-touch collaborative creation. Some resorted to “phys-gital” adaptations of the old ways, [draping and displaying mannequins on Zoom](https://www.ft.com/content/8f8c1c32-7a66-11ea-bd25-7fd923850377), others to the powers of imagination, sending out SOS sample kits complete with [fabric swatches](https://www.ft.com/content/8f8c1c32-7a66-11ea-bd25-7fd923850377), colour charts and paired-down research printouts. All scrambled to adapt, crossed their fingers and hoped for the best.\n\n[Tommy Hilfiger](https://uk.tommy.com/) was the exception. Hilfiger has increased its spend on technology by [10-15% year-on-year](https://www.voguebusiness.com/companies/tommy-hilfiger-daniel-grieder-interview-technology-sustainability) since 2015. [As early as 2017](https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/tommy-hilfiger-commits-to-100-percent-3d-apparel-design/2019110846123), Hilfiger, and its parent group [PVH](https://www.pvh.com/), began to design in digital. The move became official in 2019, when CEO Daniel Grieder [announced](https://www.lsnglobal.com/fashion/article/24889/tommy-hilfiger-commits-to-100-digital-design) that the brand would have digitised its entire design process by 2022; developing tech incubator [Stitch](https://www.academy.stitchdesignlab.com/) responsible for recreating their entire asset library online, as well as upskilling thousands of relevant staff.\n\nAssuming those at PVH are not soothsayers, (or that they manufactured COVID 19 along with their S/S 19 knee-socks) it would be fair to question the brand’s motivations for indulging in such an onerous and expensive process. The justification is two-fold: \n\n1.  **Sustainability:** the implementation of digital design processes reduces environmental impact across:\n\n    *   **Textiles** - reducing materials waste across the supply chain by enabling: 1) Designs to be pre-engineered to minimise textile waste during production 2) Physical clothing samples to be eliminated, replaced by digital counterparts for both creators and consumers 3) The seamless shift towards a made-to-order production model, where clothes are not manufactured until they’re consumed.\n    *   **Paper** - decreasing paper waste, by transforming the first point of design from plotter paper sketches to 3D renders. In October 2020 Burberry partnered with digital design agency [Koffeecup](https://www.koffeecup.net/) to integrate [gaming design methods](https://www.burberryplc.com/en/news/news/corporate/2020/burberry-uses_gaming-technology-to-streamlinefashiondesignproces.html) into its product creation. The application, inspired by the 3D tools used to create its game [B-Bounce](https://www.burberryplc.com/en/news/news/corporate/2019/race-to-the-moon-with-burberry-s-first-online-game-b-bounce.htmlhttps://www.burberryplc.com/en/news/news/corporate/2019/race-to-the-moon-with-burberry-s-first-online-game-b-bounce.html), instantaneously maps 2D prints onto 3D product templates, resulting in [two thirds](https://www.burberryplc.com/en/news/news/corporate/2020/burberry-uses_gaming-technology-to-streamlinefashiondesignproces.html) less paper usage at the design stage.\n    *   **CO2** - digital design optimises the creation process, cutting emissions expended producing garments which will never be worn. It also reduces the need for showroom samples to be shipped around the world to buyers. As early as [2004](https://www.edie.net/news/5/Adidas-virtual-designs-save-over-one-million-material-samples-/), Adidas trialled integrating 3D modelling into its operations. Six years later it got the green light to expand digital design across the business. Between 2010 and 2013 the brand was able to eliminate close to [1.5 million](https://eco-age.com/resources/how-3d-digital-design-and-augmented-reality-can-slash-textile-waste-fashion/) physical samples; along with the waste and emissions their creation would have generated.\\\n\n\n2.  **Market need: **using an end-to-end digital process can boost the bottom line improving:\n\n*   **Demand responsiveness -** helping designers create desirable items by responding directly to consumer data. Hilfiger first [trialled this concept in 2018](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelarthur/2018/01/15/ai-ibm-tommy-hilfiger/), partnering with Fashion Institute of Technology and IBM to apply [AI based forecasting tools](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-04-23-IBM-and-FIT-Announce-Collaboration-to-Help-Build-the-Creative-Fashion-Workforce-of-the-Future) to over 715,000 images spanning Hilfiger products, global runways, and fabrics. The project unearthed actionable insights around which silhouettes, colours and prints would appeal to the consumer; then used as inspiration by design teams. Fashion unicorn [Stitch Fix](https://www.stitchfix.com/) leverages data to influence design on an even more granular level, crafting what Chief Algorithm Officer Eric Colson affectionately terms “[Frankenstyles](https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-one-clothing-company-blends-ai-and-human-expertise)”. Using computers as creators, these garments are patched together from fashion elements consumer data signals are appealing; a flared sleeve here, a victorian neckline there, to create an irresistible monster (with less conspicuous stitching!).\n*   **Speed -** Digital design and distribution can decrease go-to-market time by [up to 40%](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/why-fashion-must-go-digital-end-to-end) through end-to-end supply chain optimisation. Hours inspecting samples become minutes, transporting clothes to showrooms becomes instantaneous, virtual fittings reduce mistake-spurred re-runs, and shoots which usually take days, become renders which take hours. In 2016 Hilfiger leveraged digital to debut [#TOMMYNOW ‘catwalk-to-closet](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/bc/see-it-like-it-shop-it-tommyhilfiger)’ pioneering its ‘See Now, Buy Now’ consumption model. Instead of waiting 3 months to release garments from S/S 17, looks from the Hilfiger show were shoppable as soon as they hit the catwalk. As the successes of streetwear drops indicate, velocity captures consumers. Why wait months for other collections to hit the stores when you can have the latest Hilfiger instantly?\n*   **Omnichannel - **Digital design helps brands move towards the retail experience of the future; one fully synthesised across physical and digital channels. By 2022, 3D-produced apparel styles will appear in more than [2,000 Hilfiger points of sale](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/tommy-hilfiger-pvh-corp-3d-design-digital-clothing-innovation-sustainability) worldwide. Not only does this optimise the consumption experience, it also sets the foundation for experiments in phys-gital engagement. Trend forecasters predict that in the next few years physical stores will become markers of brand identity rather than primary points of purchase. In this environment, tech enhancements become key vehicles for engagement. Burberry opened its first ‘[social retail](https://www.voguebusiness.com/consumers/burberry-tests-social-retail-in-chinas-tech-capital?utm_source=Vogue+Business+Technology\\&utm_campaign=560fac5710-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN\\_2020\\_07\\_31\\_10\\_24\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_term=0\\_532c2c2142-560fac5710-57932583)’ store in July last year; a 5,800-square-foot goliath in partnership with Tencent.

Yet, in spite of the pandemic, initiatives of Hilfiger’s size and scale are yet to be rivalled by any other luxury brand. This boils down to a trio of lacks which slacken digital adoption: \n\n1.  **A lack of correct infrastructure** - Hilfiger budgeted 5 years for its digital transformation because leveraging digital design transformatively requires revolution across the *entire* supply chain. For each of the [60,000 product options](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/tommy-hilfiger-pvh-corp-3d-design-digital-clothing-innovation-sustainabilityhttps://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/tommy-hilfiger-pvh-corp-3d-design-digital-clothing-innovation-sustainability) Hilfiger digitally designs, all components (fabrics, colours, patterns and prints) must first be visualised in 3D; that’s hundreds of thousands of moving pieces. What’s more, the end-to-end digital infrastructure erected must span not only the brand’s facilities (studios, showrooms and stores) but also those of third party contractors in order to take effect. To top it all off, this entire revolution is expected to take place with no stalls in the normal course of business - not an easy task!\n2.  **A lack of transferable skills** - being told as a physical fashion designer that your entire process needs to be transformed can present barriers that seem insurmountable. In facilitating its shift, Hilfiger demystified the process by sitting those trained in physical design side-by-side with their digitally experienced counterparts; making them create in tandem. The brand also upskilled every other individual involved in the clothing supply chain; from product specialists to showroom managers. This end-to-end upskilling, though arduous, is integral to digital design’s success. Not only does it allow the process to be optimised, it creates cohesion across the company; uniting employees through their shared experience of the digital shift.\n3.  **A lack of trust -** despite increasing adoption, many regard fashion and tech as incompatible. Fashion derives its value from a brand reputation, established over hundreds of years, with a product’s desirability tied to its complexity to create. Tech drives value through improvements in speed and efficiency, where novelty is desired (as long as it works!). Traditionally therefore, tech has been viewed by those in the industry as a gimmick, something that reduces brand prestige rather than furthering it. In order for tech to show value to those in fashion it needs to demonstrate a clear contribution to the values underlying each brand, instead of presenting itself as a shiny new toy. For Hilfiger this is [Accessibility](https://www.pvh.com/brands/tommy-hilfiger), for Burberry [Creativity](https://www.burberryplc.com/en/company/our-purpose.html), with Sustainability as a key priority for both.\\\n\n\n### **Design 3.0**\n\nAs large brands remain laggards in pushing the bounds of what digital design can do, Design 3.0, is pioneered by the digital community: Fashion Houses like [The Fabricant](https://www.thefabricant.com/) (a Hilfiger [transformation partner](https://www.thefabricant.com/tommy-hilfiger)), designers like [Fanri Sun](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLouajGBVMm/) and [Stephy Fung](https://www.instagram.com/stephyfung/), and communities like [The Institute of Digital Fashion](https://www.instagram.com/institute_digital_fashion/), all create masterpieces with digital design at their core. From conversations with these pioneers, three opportunities for digital design to amplify creativity have sprung out: \n\n1.  **CREATION X SINGULARITY *****- this dress has a mind of its own ***- Digital design has the ability to automate, not only production, but creation - as designer Regina Turbina proved with her ‘[neural dress](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLZEbFJBL80/)’. In designing for her brand ophelica Regina took inspiration from 400 of her favourite designers. However, rather than choosing which influences would take precedence, she deployed a design team of AI algorithms to do the leg work - coming up with the creation below ↓ ↓ ↓ Training algorithms to scrape from millions of images can inspire designers (à la Hilfiger) or create on their behalf. This renders ‘designer’s block’, alongside complaints about fashion being stale, a thing of the past.\n\n    [![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F\\_\\_ss-rehost\\_\\_IG-CLeildABS5A.jpg)](https://instagram.com/p/CLeildABS5A)\n\n2.  **EVOLVING ATTIRE***** - my outfit grows on you*** - WAG wisdom is that one should never be seen in the same outfit twice. This advice is hard to follow if you care about sustainability (or lack footballer-fed-funds). The NFT movement (discussed in depth next month) has given rise to platforms such as [aynsc.art](https://async.art/https://async.art/) - which allows creators to sell living artworks programmed to change over time. Digital couturier [Auroboros](https://www.auroboros.co.uk/) brought this concept into the fashion space in January with their ‘[biomimicry](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMCVB20BHa0/)’ collection. Crafted through a fusion of science, technology and design, the brand’s physical garments are constructed from biodegradable materials that react with the body to self-alter with use. Their digital collection is programmed to do the same. [The physical Metamorph headpiece](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMCVB20BHa0/) is composed of crystals that react with bodily fluids to morph and eventually dissolve over a 7-12 hour period; its [digital counterpart](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMCVB20BHa0/) mimics this process in AR ↓ ↓ ↓. As secondary markets for digital garments evolve, changes like these will become markers of provenance; capturing how a previous wearer has altered a piece, contributing to a new form of sentimental value exclusive to ‘digital vintage’.\n\n    [![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F\\_\\_ss-rehost\\_\\_IG-CMCVB20BHa0.jpg)](https://instagram.com/p/CMCVB20BHa0)\n\n3.  **OPEN SOURCE OPPORTUNITIES***** - collaborative creation*** - In 2019, Digital Fashion House [The Fabricant](https://www.thefabricant.com/) subverted traditionally secretive fashion industry protocol, by making their designs downloadable and open source. They wished to empower digital designers, and demonstrate that collaboration leads to creativity, rather than theft. In their [recent collaboration](https://www.thefabricant.com/makingstridestop20/karliekloss) with Karlie Kloss they encouraged sportswear megabrand adidas to do the same. The trio engaged some 300 digital creators to recreate the adidas wind.rdy parka in 3D. All competitors received the same brief, alongside adidas source files containing precious IP. The results were 300 designs, all completely unique. Creative collaboration requires trust, but as The Fabricant proved, where this trust is correctly enabled, the results can be astounding. End-to-end blockchain platforms such as [Digitalax](https://www.digitalax.xyz/homepage), facilitate this enablement by providing traceable, immutable ownership, across the creative value chain; from fabrics and patterns to designs. Not only does this improve accreditation, it ensures all creators are fairly rewarded for their contributions, increasing willingness within the industry to freely share.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F\\_\\_ss-rehost\\_\\_IG-CMFVBYBA7t-.jpg)](https://instagram.com/p/CMFVBYBA7t-)\n\n## This Month in Imaginary Clothing…\n\n*   Virtual Fashion featured in [Vogue Business](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/3d-design-is-the-future-brands-are-catching-up), [Elle Australia](https://www.elle.com.au/fashion/is-the-future-of-fashion-digital-24801), [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/meet-fashion-fans-buying-500-virtual-outfits-wear-online/#comment), [Le Temps](https://www.letemps.ch/lifestyle/numerique-infiltre-mode), [Trend Hunter](https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/dematerialiseds), and in a [BBC Documentary](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000st9j/click-digital-models-and-fungi-fashion)\n*   Gucci released a pair of [$12 Digital Only Sneaker](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/technology/gucci-is-selling-12-virtual-sneakers)s, while Snapchat upped its try-on game with an [AR jacket](https://twitter.com/dematerialised/status/1371466052731817985)\n*   [Crypto Fashion Week](http://cryptofashionweek.xyz/) launched, with talks from industry veterans, collabs with [Dress-X, Digitalax](https://www.digitalax.xyz/homepagehttps://dress-x.com/collections/dressx-digitalax) and [The Dematerialised](https://thedematerialised.com/profile), and a blue haired [digital avatar](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLvfz_cDpV\\_/)\n*   The Fabricant’s ‘[Making Strides](https://www.thefabricant.com/makingstridestop20/karliekloss)’ competition with Adidas and Karlie Kloss announced its three winners, with work available to buy on [KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/the-fabricant) \n\n## Ecosystem Exploration\n\n#### Your need-to-know resources\n\n> 1.  **The Tools** - [CLO3D](https://www.clo3d.com/), [Browzwear](https://browzwear.com/), [Marvelous Designer](https://www.marvelousdesigner.com/) and [MasterKey](https://www.masterkey.com.tr/) (plus great tutorials on their websites)\n> 2.  **The Tutors** - [Skeeva](https://theskeeva.com/courses), [Stephy Fung](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_f2mc1UX2-rDoZ7JjNLgTw), [Travis Davis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCniZ7Qzbv17NvoCypCzB4Ow), [FlippedNormals](https://www.youtube.com/user/FlippedNormalsTuts), [The Fabricant](https://www.twitch.tv/thefabricant)\n> 3.  **The Timeline -** [Digital Fashion 101](https://thedigitalfashiongroup.com/academy/) - a course from The Digital Fashion Group Academy introducing digital developments in fashion\n> 4.  **The Talks** - [The Digital Fashion and Art Clubhouse](https://ios.joinclubhouse.com/event/MK5l6g2e), [Crypto Fashion Week Workshops](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV02ZWrhDxHvP0qRizb4tx2gB_g5jIjZE)\n> 5.  **The Tweeters **- [@karinnanobbs](https://twitter.com/karinnanobbs), [@modyaya](https://twitter.com/modyaya), [@maghanmcd](https://twitter.com/maghanmcd), [@k3rrymurphy](https://twitter.com/k3rrymurphy), @[TODNExist](https://twitter.com/TODNExist)\n\n### Guess the Stat\n\nWhat % of brands are yet to leverage the potentials of 3D design?\n\n[25%](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17971118209360048/)\n\n[70%](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17971118209360048/)\n\n[95%](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17971118209360048/)\n\n***This Outfit Does Not Exist**, is a newsletter about Virtual Fashion and its possibilities.

Their eyes glaze over, you watch them digest the proposition, chewing over the concept, before ecstatically proclaiming “ I get it! It’s sustainable because it doesn’t exist!”\n\n**No.**\n\nWell yes…\n\nBut Digital Fashion’s sustainability proposition is so much more than its lack of materiality.\n\nAnd assuming fashion automatically becomes sustainable when it moves to the Metaverse can be actively detrimental to its positive growth.\n\nIntrigued? Confused? You’re in luck!\n\nFor the next 10 minutes this essay will immerse you in the issues eroding fashion’s sustainability proposition, and how Digital Fashion can remedy these.\n\nAre you sitting comfortably? Then I’ll begin.\n\n## The triple bottom line\n\nSustainability covers 3 verticals, otherwise known as the three P’s: Planet, Profit and People.\n\n**Planet **accounts for the sustainable use of environmental resources. Asking us to ensure that we don’t worsen already tenuous environmental conditions, and instead make them better.\n\n**Profit **refers to the ways in which money is made. Accounting for whether capital is distributed fairly in a way that generates equitable growth so all, not just a small percentage, benefit from business.\n\n**People** focuses on how an industry impacts its most important stakeholders, both those who engage with it directly such as employees, shareholders and consumers, but equally their families and communities.\n\nTo briefly outline the problem:\n\n## Prada, Pucci and Paco Rabanne\n\nSince the fashion industry became industrialised in the 19th century it’s been one of the worst offenders across this sustainability trifecta. Like Regina George, and the Mean Girls who emulate it, the industry has retained power by projecting exclusivity by ensuring a lack of access around who can buy it, make it, and financially benefit from it (not fetch!)\n\n### Planet\n\nThe Fashion industry is responsible for 10% of the world’s CO2 emissions, 20% of its water waste and 92+ million tonnes of textiles waste annually.\n\nAlongside the obvious environmental impacts of mass-production, manufacturing and shipping, this stems from:\n\n1.  **A psychology of conspicuous consumption**\\\n    In the words of Oscar Wilde *“fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable we have to alter it every six months”*. Try every 15 days. Fast fashion retailer Zara produces 24 collections a year (> 450 million items) meaning the consumer has just over two weeks to enjoy their purchase before it’s out-of-style. Shocked? Well if you think that’s bad, ultra-fast fashion supplier Shein puts this velocity to shame, offering [700-1,000 new styles daily](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2021/7/19/22535050/gen-z-relationship-fast-fashion); that’s 4 new garments before you’ve finished this newsletter.\n\n    The result of this production pace is tremendous churn within closets; it’s estimated that the average American woman wears the clothes in her wardrobe only 10 times over their lifecycle, but consumes 64 new items [each year](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/02/buying-less-by-buying-better/462639/). At best last season’s discards are resold, at worst left in landfills to rot.\n\n2.  **Inefficient demand forecasting**\\\n    If the need for new wasn’t bad enough, the fashion industry has a poor track record of accurately predicting the right new things to make. While the technology around trend forecasting is increasingly used by fast and ultra-fast fashion retailers, the majority of luxury brands still start by producing, and then use marketing to stimulate demand. This doesn’t always work. An estimated 40% of clothes created in a given season are marked as overstock, and in some cases, in order to retain brand prestige, the remainder are burned.\n\n3.  **A misaligned sales cycles -** As the 2000’s rolled on January sales became Christmas sales, Christmas sales became Black Friday sales, and those trying to stay ahead of the curve started discounting in October. As a result, clothes are only sold at full price for a fraction of the time they’re stocked in stores, making it nigh impossible for designers to profit from their collections. What’s more, consumers accustomed to these cheaper prices query the value of the designer’s craft for the limited time items are sold at full-price, perceiving 80% off as ‘the new normal’. This divorce devalues high-fashion as a concept, undermining the time, creativity and craftsmanship, poured into production.\n\n4.  **Society of the spectacle** - fashion as a vessel for projecting wealth, exclusivity and fantasy is demonstrated nowhere better than in the bi-annual Fashion weeks occurring in London, Paris, Milan and New York. The environmental impact of getting the gliteratti to attend generates 241,000 tons of CO2 emissions, and that’s without taking the impact of staging these spectacles into account. Whilst there’s no data available to quantify the impact of Chanel shipping in an iceberg for F/W 2010, or re-creating a fully stocked supermarket for F/W 2014, it doesn’t take a climatologist to know these events aren’t carbon neutral. When it comes to selling, there are no costs that big fashion houses will spare; aside from of course the environmental ones.\n\n### Profit\n\nThe Fashion Industry is a value destroyer. This means that the success of large brands come at the expense of their smaller counterparts. In a study of the fashion industry [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/patterns-for-value-creation-in-apparel-fashion-and-luxury) found that 20 “super winners” (incl. Nike, LVMH, Kering and Hermes), benefitting from scale and growth, captured more than 100% of the industry’s total economic profit. And you thought off-the-shoulder tops were asymmetric…\n\nThere are a few reasons for this disparity:\n\n1.  **The advantage of establishment** - Those trying to enter the fashion industry come up against two walls, which only time provides the footholds to scale. The first is cost of production. Fashion is highly labour and capital intensive (think materials, manufacturing and advertising to start) meaning economies of scale are necessary to both break in and break even. Secondly, the value of brand is unparalleled in establishing a designer within the market, due to high degrees of saturation. The majority of “super winners” scaling these walls and digging these moats, hold a 150+ year lead on their upstart rivals. This means they can produce more for less, and attract consumers more quickly, resulting in a disproportionate competitive advantage in the space.\n2.  **An unfair set of economic condition**s - those who excel in fashion compete on one of two things: prestige and price. On one side of the spectrum there are luxury brands who produce [Veblen Goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veblen-good.asp#:\\~:text=A%20Veblen%20good%20is%20a,appeal%20as%20a%20status%20symbol.\\&text=However%2C%20a%20Veblen%20good%20is,not%20have%20easily%20available%20substitutes.): where high prices are directly correlated to desirability. These rely on a well-established brand (described above) and an association with status and exclusivity. On the other, you have fast fashion, which leverages huge economies of scale (coupled with horrific labour conditions) to provide the catwalk at price, and pace. Middle-market entrants who sit in the centre of the spectrum, have little ability to grow. Whilst those fresh to the market, trying to attach to either pole, are up against the tests of time and traction outlined above.\n3.  **Pace pays (just not those who need it)** - price, pace and a complete lack of supply chain transparency leads the fashion industry to perpetuate abysmal conditions for those who support it. In the developed world there are the designers, sales people, stylists and marketers who can expect low wages, and a slow progression, as the dearth of full-time positions leave people to stagnate in roles. In developing markets, there are the garment workers, who have it 1000 times worse. Some risk their lives in return for meagre wages, others quite literally have [no choice](https://www.fashionrevolution.org/fashion-revolution-statement-on-uyghur-forced-labour/) but to produce. Whilst regulation claims to be cracking down on inhumane industry practices, the velocity and volume needed in staying relevant as a brand, means there’s little alternative to these ways of working and a race to the bottom ensues.\n\n### **People**\n\nFor centuries fashion has defined itself as ‘high culture’ - something with tightly mediated standards for what constitutes ‘style’, set by world-worn gatekeepers. This condition is not unique to fashion, it manifests itself across the arts. However, there’s one key difference between fashion and fine art, ballet, opera and the rest; fashion not only tries to impose its standards on creators, but also on consumers; dictating, not only how a designer’s final creation looks, but the characteristics of its wearer.\\\n\n\n1.  **Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels** - the trend towards emaciation began in the 1980’s when Calvin Klein chose Kate Moss to front his S/S campaign. This move to size 0 suited designers just fine. Not only was there an argument that the more closely humans resembled clothes hangers, the better the clothes on them looked, but equally the smaller the sizes, the less fabric needed in producing garments (and therefore the lower the cost). Although the fashion industry has made some mild attempts at ameliorating these ideals over the past 20 years, (the French government will fine agencies using models with a BMI under 18 up to $82,000) the existence of the size 0 sample size, or quite frankly, almost any magazine/ runway, shows the industry isn’t making rapid progress.  \n2.  **Diversity? You mean book a redhead?** - if you manage to achieve the covetable 0 or 00 but have anything slightly darker than a St Tropez complexion, you become part of the fashion industry’s diversity quotas. Which are pretty abysmal. Models like Joan Smalls, Aaron Phillip and Anok Yai have all spoken out against industry practices restricting the bookings of non-white models and perpetuating racist behaviour whilst on jobs. Where those from diverse backgrounds are treated poorly, those who are differently abled are entirely ignored. This perpetuation of an almost unitary racial background, and set of abilities, is detrimental to the mental health of both industry participants, and the fans who emulate them. What’s more, it perpetuates a restrictive flywheel, where those differently abled, or from varied ethnic backgrounds, continue to perpetuate their lack of visibility by self-selecting out; perceiving a clear absence of avenues through which to excel.\n3.  **Creativity has a price** - the advent of fast fashion did one very important thing; it made creative clothing more widely accessible. But what if you want to express your individuality whilst not contributing to the collapse of Rana Plaza, or using Uighur cotton? Well your abilities are restricted by how much you earn, or what you can create with a sewing machine. As fashion is a tool for socialisation - facilitating the formation of affiliate links with others who exhibit similar modes of self-expression - excluding those who lack the means to fund their fantasies also limits their ability to participate in these micro-communities. This renders the limits on sustainable, and affordable, self-expression are damaging from a sociological standpoint.\n\n## Gucci and the gamers\n\nOver the past few years large brands have begun to address the issues outlined above.\n\nIn 2020 Chanel issued a [$700 million](https://www.businessoffashion.com/briefings/sustainability/chanel-green-bond-sustainability-ethical-fashion?utm_campaign=1679460128790201\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_source=bof-professional-newsletter\\&utm_term=21) sustainability bond on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange; Burberry committed to becoming \"climate positive\" by 2040 (after being caught burning $37 million worth of overstock the year before…); Dries Van Noten, alongside 700 others, signed an [open letter](https://forumletter.org/signatures/) against the inefficient sales cycles that plague the industry; and Kering is one of the brands benchmarked on the Black Index Council X Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index for people with disabilities and the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nDespite these advancements, rewiring an industry from the ground up is a laborious task, and many of the “super winners” lack a vested interest in revising a system which has allowed them to reap extensive rewards for so many years.\n\nInevitably, as with most things, it takes an outsider to disrupt, and for fashion, these outsiders are the Digital Fashionistas.\n\nSpanning blockchain enthusiasts, Fortnite nerds, self-taught 3D creators, and, of course, their avatars, the builders of Fashion 3.0 stem from communities which prioritise transparency, collaboration, and increasingly decentralisation over secrecy, exclusivity, and competition.\n\nWhilst for both fashion followers, and their digital counterparts, clothing retains its form as a signaller - one showcasing a specific flex, expressing affiliation or demonstrating identity - those forming Fashion 3.0 reject the rules of a top-down, tightly audited, fashion system controlled by homogenous insiders.\n\nInstead, Digital Fashion garments derive from user generated content, often from self-taught creators, which express varied identities, and are linked to in-game achievements (or logging onto RTFKT at just the right moment…)\n\nThese values seep in to populate *what* and *how* Digital Fashionista’s create. Leading Digital Fashion to be, you guessed it, more sustainable across the entire trifecta.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n## Environment > existence\n\nLet’s start with the obvious, Digital Clothes are more sustainable because they don’t exist.\n\n**Duh.**\n\nLeading Digital Fashion house [The Fabricant](https://www.thefabricant.com/) published a [report](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a6ba105f14aa1d81bd5b971/t/5fa3da036d618612a18b5703/1604573714045/RAW+Report_v2.pdf) with Imperial College London diving into the specifics of Digital Fashion’s sustainability proposition through the lens of a white t-shirt. It found the following:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1938393b-bd54-4d42-a0ca-d9aea72c8816\\_1586x292.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1938393b-bd54-4d42-a0ca-d9aea72c8816\\_1586x292.png)\n\nAdd on that 1) an estimated [35% of all materials](https://www.commonobjective.co/article/fashion-and-waste-an-uneasy-relationship) in the fashion supply chain are discarded before they reach the consumer 2) digital design uses >[ 50% less paper](https://thisoutfitdoesnotexist.substack.com/p/2-design-and-technology) than its physical counterparts 3) A physical t-shirt is likely to end up in a landfill before its [11th wear](https://traid.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/impacts_of_clothing_factsheet\\_23percent.pdf), and you have some pretty hefty sustainability stats.\n\nBut what does this mean in practice? Should we all clean out our wardrobes, buy a skin-tight green-screen bodysuit and OCULUS Quest 2 and resign ourselves to life in the ether?\n\nNo.\n\nOr not for a few years at least.\n\nUnless you’re an influencer, who buys clothes for the sole purposes of content creation, in the current state of play, the value of Digital Fashion is not as a substitute for its physical counterparts, but rather as their complement; improving both consumer and producer behaviour in numerous ways.\n\n### Consumer: Buy binary buy better\n\n1.  **Re-directing our need for conspicuous consumption:**\n\nPhilosopher Denis Diderot realised that consumption breeds consumption, 100 years before the term ‘conspicuous consumption’ was defined in Thorstein Veblen’s ‘Theory of Leisure’, and 200 years before the Britney Spears best-seller ‘Gimme More’.\n\nDiderot himself, was a victim of the phenomenon. He lived the majority of his life in poverty until, at the age of 52, a gift from Catherine The Great sparked a spending spree that almost ruined him.\n\nThe story goes, that upon stumbling across Diderot’s work The Empress of Russia, was so impressed that she built him a library. This library was so lavish, that Diderot felt embarrassed wearing his customary rags within it. He felt he needed to invest in a piece of finery, to wear whilst reading, to do the library justice.\n\nThis finery took the form of a scarlet robe. Once he donned the robe, Diderot felt worthy of setting foot in the library. However, in comparison to his other possessions, the robe was so glorious it made everything else he owned seem dirty and insignificant.\n\nDiderot concluded that there was *“no more coordination, no more unity, no more beauty” *in what he owned, compelling him to buy more in order to achieve alignment.\n\nEventually, after he’d maxxed out his credit card, Diderot came to the revelation that consumption catalyses a flywheel effect; each purchase breeds the need to buy more to further validate the new identity the first purchase set out to construct; aka ‘The Diderot Effect’\n\nWe’ve all been Diderots. And who could blame us? The desire to evolve is in our genes. As we age we experience shifts in our identity and the ways we conceptualise ourselves. And if nature wasn’t already stacked against us, we’re also fighting against the cultural praxis of the fashion industry, consistently told that the things we own aren’t ‘in style’ and don’t align with the way we *should* conceptualise ourselves every three months/ two weeks/ one and three quarter minutes.\n\nThis is where Digital Fashion comes in.\n\nConverting our construction of identities to the digital world provides exciting opportunities to adjust our sense of self; without the environmental cost. From a creative perspective, the goods we can consume in the Metaverse aren’t tethered to the laws of physics, or gravity. Nor is the being they’re bought for. From an environmental standpoint Digital Fashion allows for a colossal redirection of resources which may otherwise end up in landfills every time our identity’s re-jigged. If you take the fact that the estimated 350 million players of online game Fortnite spend an average of $80 on clothing items for their in-game avatars, and assume these digital clothes are a substitute for their physical counterparts, that’s $28bn directed away from clothes, unsustainably produced, worn max 10 times, and most probably discarded. Viva-la Avatar!\\\n\n\n2.  **Making sure we want what we have**\n\nA select number of high-end art galleries offer clients the ability to take their pieces home before buying them. These works of art sit in a prospective buyer’s home, allowing their future family to ponder “is this something I can live with?” alongside the query “is this something I can’t live without?”. Two very distinct decisions.\n\nDigital Fashion provides these same opportunities for considerate consumption.\n\nWe’ve all had that wave of remorse that hits walking out of a shop, where the sales assistant convinced you that you *needed* those putrid lime trousers. You manage to keep his voice in your head all the way down the street, but by the time you get home the trourers make you feel a little nauseous. By the next day you find yourself putting them back into the bag, and by the next week you’re checking Vestiaire to see if they’ve had a drop in commission rates…\n\nDigital Fashion nips this in the bud.\n\nAt the first point of attack you have digital try-on. You can wear a garment via AR from the comfort of your home, without the pressure of a sales assistant glancing over your shoulder imploring you to buy.\n\nMoving further into your ownership journey you have the opportunity to own the garment digitally (all the various methods of which are outlined [here](about:blank)); providing all the flexing rights you’d get from its physical counterpart with far less of the commitment. You can sit with this asset in your virtual wardrobe, wear it on your socials, and carefully consider whether lime green is really your colour, before pulling it from the ether.\n\nThese psychological shifts, re-directing conspicuous consumption, mean that less clothes will be unnecessarily produced, and end up in landfills each year. But for the moment when we make the informed decision that it is the right time to physically buy, well Digital Fashion can optimise there as well.\n\n### Producer: Master the Maker\n\nPlugging Digital Fashion into the supply chain, allows efficiencies that span the design, creation and manufacturing process. These are outlined in depth in my second essay [Design and Technology](https://thisoutfitdoesnotexist.substack.com/p/2-design-and-technology), but to touch on the key factors:\n\nAt the design phase, Digital Fashion has the ability to improve sustainability in:\n\n*   **Textiles** - reducing materials waste across the supply chain by enabling: 1) Designs to be pre-engineered to minimise textile waste during production 2) Physical clothing samples to be eliminated, replaced by digital counterparts for both creators and consumers 3) The seamless shift towards a made-to-order production model, where clothes are not manufactured until they’re consumed.\n*   **Paper** - decreasing paper waste, by transforming the first point of design from plotter paper sketches to 3D renders.\n*   **CO2** - optimising the creation process, cutting emissions expended producing garments which will never be worn, and eliminating the need for showroom samples to be shipped around the world to buyers.\n\nDigital Fashion also allows designers to test the waters before producing. This can, and will take many forms, ranging from integrating AI-based trend forecasting as experimented with at [FIT](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelarthur/2018/01/15/ai-ibm-tommy-hilfiger/), leveraging start-ups like [UNMADE](https://www.unmade.com/) for MTO production; or using Digital Fashion as a deposit scheme for its physical counterparts; discussed above.\n\n## Equity > exclusivity\n\nJust as Digital Fashion can improve how garments are made, it can also help to improve equity for those making them, lowering barriers to create, showcase and sell:\n\n1.  **Digital creation: **as previously mentioned, creating a physical collection demands high capital investment, often untenable for those starting out. Using programs such as CLO3D, Browzwear and Marvellous Designer Digital Fashion provides a route for emerging designers to quickly and cheaply create their clothes; needing to pay for little more than a working computer, and the bandwidth to access the sea of free online resources available through YouTube and Twitch.\n2.  **Access and exposure: **Once digital designs are created, rather than having to apply to the clique of expensive and exclusive fashion weeks, an emerging designer can turn to algorithmic assistance to showcase their works. Instagram, and increasingly (as AR improves) Snapchat, Tik Tok and Twitch, are becoming key routes for young Digital Designers to get noticed. Everyone from [Skeeva](https://theskeeva.com/), who has worked for the likes of Adidas and Space X, to [Blake Kathryn](https://www.instagram.com/blakekathryn/?hl=en) (Fendi, Paris Hilton) and [Stephy Fung](https://stephyfung.com/contact) (Vogue Singapore, Xbox) got their big breaks through these platforms which show their 1bn+ users what *they *want to see, as opposed to what someone else wants them to.\n3.  **Platforms for selling**: Transparency and a trickle-down effect are great in theory but rarely convert in practice; particularly when it comes to fashion. A whole host of platforms allowing Digital Designers to monetise have sprung up during the pandemic, ranging from Dress-X which serves as a Digital Tailor, to Replicant and XR-Couture. Most recently NFTs have become the way for Digital Designers to max-out on the amount they make from clothes leading to ‘Opensea’s’ with Digital Fashion functionality from Regina Turbina (Artisant) and Karinna Nobbs (The Dematerialised). One of the most interesting models out there to assure Digital Fashion serves all creators is ‘fractional garment ownership’ pioneered by Digitalax. The Digital Fashion on Digitalax is made up of ‘parent’ and ‘child’ NFTs; the parent referring to the final-garment and the ‘children’ taking the form of the elements within it (pattern, print, texture etc). This model allows *all of* those involved in making a garment to receive recognition and recompense for their work. Not only does this incentivise collaboration and transparency, as the initial creator of the IP becomes indisputable, but it also makes sure all contributors to an end garment receive a fair sum for their work.\\\n\n\n## Egalitarianism > exclusivity\n\nFinally, people. As mentioned before, the values of the gaming community; those of transparency, collaboration and self-expression, lie at the core of Digital Fashion; countering each negative mode the fashion industry furthers in their own distinct ways.\n\n1.  **Collaboration -**take it from Roblox, collaboration is a lucrative business if done right. The online gaming platform, which reached 150 million users at the time of its IPO in March 2021, is based almost entirely on UGC or User Generated Content. Rather than hiring an expensive team of world-class developers Roblox empowers its users to create the content which powers its platform (everything from clothes for avatars to mini-games), by providing them with the tools, and incentives to do so. At present there are 7 million independent developers on the Roblox platform, earning sums of up to [$600,000](https://www.wsj.com/articles/robloxs-builderman-ceo-heads-to-wall-street-with-an-army-of-young-game-creators-11614421800) for their creations. The Fabricant, adopts a similar model of crowdsourced creation. Whilst operating as both a Digital Couturier and Service House for the likes of Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger and Marques Almedia, when producing digital clothes for renowned clients they turn to the community hive-mind to complement their own ingenuity. Providing their proprietary IP as a foundation to build off, they conduct competitions where other Digital Designers have the opportunities to work with their clients.\n2.  **Empowerment** - there is no such thing as a sample size in the Metaverse, and diversity is not only allowed, it’s encouraged. Phygital Fashion (the Digital Fashion worn on humans) prides itself on its ability to be tailored to any-body, and be created anywhere in the world (with good wifi). This solves the problem of diverse contributors self-selecting out of either creating, or wearing, designs, and allows for materials and styles, indigenous to cultures lacking the fashion limelight to take centre stage.\n3.  **Self-expression **- The virtual world’s Digital Fashion is native to can serve as havens for self-expression. Phygital-fashion allows people who appreciate flamboyance but might feel uncomfortable wearing a flaming fluorescent trench coat to the supermarket, to express themselves via social media. Digital Fashion direct-to-avatar takes this one step further; allowing a new self to be created along with a new outfit. Whether for those wanting to tweak their physical appearances, wishing to express themselves with anonymity, or just in completely new ways, platforms like Roblox, Decentraland, Animal Crossing, Fortnite and Star Atlas serve as vessels to experiment with new identities; Digital Fashion facilitated.\n\n## Conclusion: The importance of consciousness\n\nThe propositions explored above, outline Digital Fashion’s *potential*, to revolutionise Planet, Profit, and People in ways previously unseen.\n\nHowever, I began with the warning that assuming Digital Fashion is automatically more sustainable than its physical alternatives damages this revolutionary potential. This is because, as with all innovations, without a clear focus on generating positive impact, the negative automatically seeps in.\n\nThe rise (and falls) of NFTs provide a cautionary example. Initially touted as a new, sustainable way to make and sell goods (because digital = sustainable duh), after just a few months it became clear that transacting on-chain locks in high environmental prices with every block. The Ethereum network alone currently consumes the equivalent energy to Ecuador or Libya and if nothing changes this will only grow.\n\nDigital Fashion faces these same environmental challenges, in its reliance on vast quantities of computing power across the supply chain (designing, rendering, transferring, selling, wearing). As it moves to meet increasing demand, both phygitally and in-game, it is integral that the environmental expense of creating and utilising digital designs is bought down.\n\nThis same consciousness needs to be employed when considering profit. Whilst technologies like fractional garment ownership come a long way in assuring equity, as big brands like Gucci, Burberry and D\\&G move into the space, economic opportunities for independent creators can be curtailed as these giants leverage their economies of scale to undercut incumbents on price.\n\nGucci’s recent AR sneaker serves to show how one goliath can warp pricing for an entire industry. In March this year Gucci released an AR shoe, worn through the app WannaTry and priced at a mere $12. Whilst this sparked a fair quantity of Digital Fashion press in the mainstream media, the $12 price tag undercut every single other Digital Shoe out there. After all, how could any Digital Fashion brand dare to charge more than $12 for a Digital Shoe when Gucci, an established luxury brand selling their physical sneakers for $600+, sold theirs for only $12.  \n\nWhile Gucci has the money to view a Digital Shoe’s production as a marketing activity; the same luxury cannot be afforded to other Digital Designers marketing similar goods. For these creators the Digital Shoess serve as primary sources of income, the products of weeks of work. What’s more, where Gucci has the scale to price at $12 and break even through attracting tens-of-thousands of buyers, the majority of Digital Fashion platforms are still nascent. They’ll sell 100 of their shoe (if they’re lucky), and if these need to be priced under $12, it’s unlikely they’ll be able to stay afloat.\n\nFinally, people. Whilst I’ve touted Digital Fashion as a route to low-cost global exposure, those who are most in need of an equitable industry, may remain excluded in the digital realm. 53% of households [globally](https://www.statista.com/statistics/748551/worldwide-households-with-computer/) do not have a computer, or the hours to invest to mastering CLO. This lack of access, and digital literacy, could mean that Digital Fashion finds its beneficiaries limited to those with income if significant efforts aren’t made to lower the barriers to participation.\n\nWhat’s more, it’s important to remember that digital innovations that disrupt the status quo also come at the expense of those who have built careers within the establishment. Across the entire industry, from show bookers to garment workers there are those who could easily be displaced by digital if they are not taught to move with it. Going back to my point around Digital literacy, this directly intersects with the most vulnerable.  \n\nWhilst the issues above seem daunting, what’s heartening to note is that as long as the Digital Fashion community stays true to its values, efforts will be taken to ensure Digital Fashion is a sustainability driver. Examples of ‘doing digital right’ have already been seen from The Fabricant, who upskilled all of Tommy Hilfiger’s physical designers when they digitised in 2018; Evelyn Mora, in her work at Helsinki fashion week and her development of Digital Village; Karinna Nobbs and her Dematerialised carbon offsetting, and even the ETH network itself, shifting slowly to a proof-of stake protocol.  \n\n## **This Month in Imaginary Clothing…**\n\n*   This Outfit Does Not Exist became The Fabricant’s first PolymXth: writing and speaking about The Wardrobe of The Metaverse.

[Arianee](https://www.arianee.org/), [Aura](https://auraluxuryblockchain.com/), [VeChain](https://www.vechain.com/) and [LUKSO](https://www.lukso.network/) all provide luxury brands with on-chain identities linked to physical products through QR codes or RFID tags.\n\nDigital Sneakers aren’t a novel concept either. Fashion game [AGLET](https://www.aglet.app/), founded by Adidas former Head of Innovation, has been in the market since 2019; providing sneakerheads with their own covetable Pokemon Go alternative.\n\nSo if Digital Sneakers are old news (and by old I mean 2 years ago Grandpa!!!) what made the FEWOCiOUS drop so significant?\n\nThe answer is *balance* - the one between the value of physical goods and their digital counterparts. The FEWOCiOUS drop marked the first time in history that Digital Fashion was of higher value to consumers than its physical alternative.\n\n### **NFT? WTF?**\n\nAn NFT or ‘non fungible token’ is a digital asset stored on the blockchain which provides its owner with an immutable record of ownership.\n\n#### **NFT’s are valuable for three reasons:**\n\n1) **They provide indisputable proof of who *created*** a digital asset - the moment an asset is ‘[minted](https://news.bitcoin.com/nft-craftiness-mint-a-non-fungible-token-art-collectible-in-less-than-15-minutes/)’ (created on the blockchain) it is permanently sealed, attaching an immutable record of provenance.\n\n2) **They provide indisputable proof of who *owns*** a digital asset - every time an NFT based digital asset changes hands it is logged unalterably on the blockchain.\n\n3) \\*\\*They provide creators with the ability to ***generate revenue*** \\*\\****from resale*** - when minting an asset sellers can program in a percentage of the resale price to be automatically deposited into their accounts every time the item [changes hands](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/10-setting-fees-on-secondary-sales).\n\n#### **However there are caveats…**\n\n1) **You can still copy an on-chain digital asset (you’re just more likely to get caught out!)**- Just because you can show *who* created a digital asset on the blockchain, that doesn’t mean that someone else can’t replicate your creation and mint it as their own. That being said, as you can show an immutable record of provenance it is far easier to settle disputes around IP.\n\n2) \\*\\*Owning an NFT doesn’t necessarily mean owning an NFT… if you get what I mean - \\*\\*Saying you ‘own’ a digital asset does not mean you own the source code, or even have exclusive rights to view and download the PNG file of the asset you’ve consumed. Frequently the digital asset itself resides on a [separate blockchain](https://mashable.com/article/what-is-an-nft-non-fungible-token/) entirely. In ‘owning’ an NFT, you typically just own the metadata associated with the asset - essentially an indisputable digital receipt with ‘directions’ (in source code) to where the original asset was created. Whilst this is fine for some, it’s an understandable deterrent for others.\n\n3) **The NFT market is a bubble and a big one** - [NonFungible.com,](https://nonfungible.com/) which tracks the NFT ecosystem, noted that market highs for NFTs surged 2,100% to $2 billion in sales during the first quarter of this year, then plummeted. NFT prices are now down 70% from their peak in mid-February, going from an average price of $4,000 to less than $1,500 in early April. That’s not to say that NFTs won’t have continuity, or provide immense future value, but that rotating graphic of the Dogecoin Shiba Inu you bought on OpenSea for $6,000. Well it will probably worthless before the year is out.\n\n### So what’s the deal with these Digital Sneakers?\n\nGoing back to those who risked their hard-drives and wallets, alongside the motion in their digits, participating in the $3.1 million FEWOCiOUS drop; driven by the belief that these shoes had value. Well to their credit they were right.\n\nIf you were a consumer in the original FEWOCiOUS X RTFKT auction you’d have bought your Digital Sneakers for 1.8 ETH ($5,000).\n\nIf you were now re-selling those shoes on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) (a secondary NFT marketplace) you’d be fending off offers of around 5.5 ETH ($15,000). That’s 3X on your investment in one month. Not bad.\n\nWhat’s more, due to the [programmable secondary seller fees](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/10-setting-fees-on-secondary-sales) mentioned above, you could have 5% of the resale price deposited directly into your bank account, every time the shoe changes hands. Assuming they triple in value every three months, and get sold at the end of each three month period, by year end you’d have made $29,250 off resale alone.\n\nNow that’s one lucrative pair of sneakers.\n\n### **If a shoe sells for $3.1 million and no one wears it, can you call it a shoe?**\n\nIt’s pretty clear from the dynamics explored above that the majority of FEWOCiOUS buyers weren’t buying a shoe. They were making an investment.\n\nThe Digital Sneakers may as well have been a piece of $69 million NFT art by [Beeple](https://www.beeple-crap.com/), or a [$2.9 million](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56492358#:\\~:text=Twitter%20founder%20Jack%20Dorsey's%20first,by%20Mr%20Dorsey%20for%20charity.) NFT Tweet by Jack Dorsey. So the question is… are these Digital Sneakers really Digital Fashion?\n\nIt would be untrue to say that fashion items are never consumed as assets. Buyers of Haute Couture gowns, or Birkin Bags have been known to resell them at huge premiums. Nonetheless, in order to truly be called ‘Fashion’, I’d argue that an object must be made to be worn. As Digital Assets are programmable - meaning the maker clearly defines what they can and can’t do at time of creation - the FEWOCiOUS drop was not Digital Fashion as it will never be wearable. So by those standards… what is?\n\n### **Owning a garment that doesn’t exist**\n\nOver the past month, an amazing array of ways to ‘own’ Digital Fashion have cropped up. These range from [direct-to-avatar NFTs](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/fabricant-rtfkt-renaixance-collection/), to [instant virtual try-ons](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNAQCGGBHQu/). Not only does delving into these modes of ownership help clarify what distinguishes Digital Fashion from Digital Art, but it also sheds light what on what what digital-bang a Virtual Fashion consumer is getting for their physical-buck.\n\nSo I sat down at my computer, my favourite physical fashion item by my side (an Alexander McQueen dress from Depop), and broke down what owning a fashion item means into **two distinct categories:**\n\n1\\.    **Functionality as a garment:**\n\n* I can wear it *when* I like\n* I can wear it *how* I like\n* I can wear it *where* I like\n* I can *make adjustments* to it\n\n2\\.    **Functionality as an asset:**\n\n* I can *sell* it\n* I can *trade* it\n* I can *give* it away\n* I can *dispose* of it\n\nI then went on to apply these 2 categories, and their 8 criteria, to the various methods of Digital Fashion ownership I’ve experienced since entering the space. With the following results:\n\n#### 1. Digital Tailoring - Photographic Render\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F__ss-rehost__IG-CNnA8UEBmf1.jpg)\n\n**What it is:** The prevalent way of a human wearing Digital Fashion. In this process, after adding a Digital Fashion item to Cart, the buyer selects an accompanying photo - the one they wish to wear the digital garment in. On receipt of payment, the brand acts as a ‘Digital Tailor’ – using a specially designed game engine to put the buyer in the clothes, and sending it over in 24-72 hours.\n\n**Garment Functionality:** Although the results are pretty spectacular, to rate against the 4 characteristics of Garment Functionality this method ranks pretty low. You can normally only wear the Digital Fashion garment in a single photo, and it takes between 24 and 72 hours to get your photo back. You can also only wear the designs provided on the website with 0 room for modification.\n\nGiving the method the benefit of the doubt, because, to its credit, it can create the most amazing photos, I’ll assume most users are wearing the garments \\*how they like \\*(0.5) and *where they like* (0.5) – as they select the photo.\n\n**GARMENT FUNCTIONALITY: 1**\n\n**Asset Functionality:** Unfortunately all elements of Asset Functionality listed above are lacking. You get a photo of yourself in the outfit but no rights to the outfit or the photo. That’s not to say you can’t \\*indirectly \\*monetise it, but to be strict, there’s no way to benefit off the direct transfer of asset ownership from one buyer to another.\n\n**ASSET FUNCTIONALITY: 0**\n\n#### ***OWNERSHIP TOTAL:  1/8***\n\n#### 2.   Telegram Bot - Instant Try-on\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F__ss-rehost__IG-CNAQCGGBHQu.jpg)\n\n**What it is:** [Replicant](https://replicant.fashion/) founder Regina Turbina partnered with [Telco](https://www.telco.com/) to create a Telegram Bot which dresses users in one of 7 Digital Fashion looks in under-60 seconds.\n\n**Garment Functionality:** The Telegram Bot’s ability to ingest and instantly dress multiple photos of a user, means you could wear Digital Fashion\\* wherever you like\\*, and *whenever you like*. However, it loses out as the software is only available on photos (no in-game portability), doesn’t work on video looks, and is limited to seven pre-set Digital Fashion designs.\n\n**GARMENT FUNCTIONALITY: 2**\n\n\\*\\*Asset Functionality: \\*\\*As with the photographic render method, direct Asset Functionality is lacking. On the bright side, due to the Bot’s ease of use, the more entrepreneurial digital fashionistas among you can get friends to pay you to dress them through the Bot!! (the looks the Bot provides usually cost around $15 on the [replicant website](https://en.replicant.fashion/ophelica))\n\n**ASSET FUNCTIONALITY: 0**\n\n#### ***OWNERSHIP TOTAL:  2/8***\n\n#### **3.   The AR Filter – Ease of Access**\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F__ss-rehost__IG-CONsTnmAQt6.jpg)\n\n\\*\\*What it is: \\*\\*Everyone from [Gucci](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/mar/19/a-virtual-steal-the-gucci-sneakers-for-sale-at-1799) to Tribute is experimenting with Digital Fashion based Augmented Reality. Body tracking is hard (even foot tracking is glitchy!) - hence why photographic renders prevail. However, based on its possibilities, AR is a strong competitor for the medium of choice in Digital Fashion’s future.\n\n**Garment Functionality:** With AR, try-on is immediate, so you can wear garments *when and where you like*! [Gucci](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/mar/19/a-virtual-steal-the-gucci-sneakers-for-sale-at-1799) trialled this new model with its AR trainers through app WANNA. For a mere $12 consumers could unlock a pair of digital Gucci sneakers to wear on demand. What’s more, when it comes to the modification element AGLET is already working on an in-game sneaker design studio so players can enhance their discoveries.\n\nHaving said all this I’ll deduct 0.5 points because I haven’t seen proper AR-in-game portability as of yet.\n\n**GARMENT FUNCTIONALITY: 3.5**\n\n\\*\\*Asset Functionality: \\*\\*Unfortunately again another 0 as you can’t currently transfer/ directly monetise ownership of AR assets.\n\n**ASSET FUNCTIONALITY: 0**\n\n#### ***OWNERSHIP TOTAL:  3.5/8***\n\n#### **4.   The collectible NFT**\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F__ss-rehost__IG-CNNEpHWBV5Z.jpg)\n\n\\*\\*What it is: \\*\\*Collectible NFTs are assets, minted on blockchain, which take the form of fashion items (FEWOCiOUS X RTFKT I’m looking at you!!!)\n\nFashion is separated from art by function (art is experienced *by* the consumer; through exhibition, whilst fashion is experienced on the consumer) so I’d say these assets are more akin to the work of Fashion Photographers that Designers. Nevertheless, after looking at works like the [The Fabricant X Adidas Making Strides](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fknownorigin.io%2Fjournal%2Fstories%2Fthe-fabricant-KARLIE-KLOSS-X-ADIDAS&psig=AOvVaw24QEp0AMBFr5lHVPhlhWiJ&ust=1619741932719000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA0QjhxqFwoTCIjk6oiXovACFQAAAAAdAAAAABAV) I had to include it in the matrix.\n\n**Garment Functionality:** Put simply you can’t wear it.\n\n**GARMENT FUNCTIONALITY: 0**\n\n\\*\\*Asset Functionality: \\*\\*As these are fully functional NFTs you can sell, trade, gift or bin them. Once you own them it’s up to you.\n\n**ASSET FUNCTIONALITY: 4**\n\n#### ***OWNERSHIP TOTAL:  4/8***\n\n#### **5.   The interoperable NFT - form & function**\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F__ss-rehost__IG-CNc0yq4hXKB.jpg)\n\n\\*\\*What it is: \\*\\*A cohort of creators have realised that fashion is made to be worn, and created Digital Fashion NFTs with Garment Functionality. Hurrah!\n\n\\*\\*Garment Functionality: \\*\\* It depends which platform you’re buying on, but Digital Fashion start-up [The Dematerialised](https://thedematerialised.com/shop) have already programmed their Digital Fashion assets to be worn by both humans and their in-game-avatars. So wear *whenever you want* and *wherever you want* scores maxed out for that!\n\nIn terms of the *how* and the question of *modification* Digital Fashion NFT provider [Digitalax](https://www.digitalax.xyz/) has you covered. Operating on a Fractional Ownership System their garments are split out into layers each represented by their own NFT. The ‘Parent’ layer takes the form of the entire garment, such as the METAJACKET above ^^, whilst the ‘Child’ is the composite patterns, prints and fabrics the Parent is made up of.\n\nAlthough at the moment Digitalax don’t offer consumers the opportunity to play with these layers, I believe that with time they will come to mirror platforms like [async.art](https://async.art/) and offer consumers the opportunity to mix-and-match layers to distort garments as they choose… so an extra 0.5 for that.\n\n\\*\\*GARMENT FUNCTIONALITY: 3.5\\*\\*\\*\\*Asset Functionality: \\*\\*Just as the collectible NFT’s above you can sell, trade, gift or bin these items. Though as these currently have a tendency to triple in price (see the 3X FEWOCiOUS shoe), I’d think hard before doing the latter…\n\n**ASSET FUNCTIONALITY: 4**\n\n#### ***OWNERSHIP TOTAL:  7.5/8***\n\n#### **6. Source File Ownership**\n\nFor some time Digital Fashion house [The Fabricant](https://www.thefabricant.com/) have made their design source files fully accessible to encourage collaboration.\n\nThe potential of this is incredible, allowing full functionality against my present matrix in both utility as garments, and as assets.\n\nThe issue is, that without mastery of Digital Design Tools, providing source files is equivalent to providing a physical non-designer with a roll of silk and congratulating them on the owning that new Dior dress they’ve been lusting over. (a nudge to us all to get onto CLO3D!)\n\nHowever as Digital Design becomes increasingly accessible (I’m thinking parallels to the low-code wave) – and creators in the space can monetise designs alongside finished products, this method of creative consumption is important to note.\n\n#### ***OWNERSHIP TOTAL:  UNRANKABLE***\n\n### **Thanks for this framework but it still doesn’t explain why people are spending money on clothes that don’t exist …**\n\n#### \\*\\*\\*(…especially if you can’t guarantee they’ll triple in value) \\*\\*\\*\n\nAs we have already produced enough clothes to last us the next 50+ years, there are already items that keep us warm, keep us cool, and show our bosses we mean business on the morning Zoom (even if everything out of shot is loungewear). Therefore fashion’s contribution to the consumer is more than functionally objective. When consuming an item an individual approaches it with a unique take on how they want to use it and what they hope it provides.\n\nPeople buy Digital Fashion to be creative, to flex, and as stated above, for investment purposes. But let’s dive into the psychology of one sort of Digital Fashion consumer, the Content Creator - who buys Digital Fashion to be worn in photos.\n\nThe Content Creator wants to use the Digital Fashion item to create a photo which will garner eyeballs - the type which come with likes, shares and swoons. We can assume they also hope these eyeballs translate into revenue - through followers, partnership opportunities etc.\n\nAlthough I gave the Photographic Render a score of 1 on my earlier \\*Ownership Matrix \\*this is completely subverted when it comes to someone using Digital Fashion for the purposes stated above.\n\nTo get their desired outcome, a Content Creator doesn’t need to wear a digital dress in multiple photos; they couldn’t care less whether it ports to Fortnite; have no interest in changing its shape; and if it takes 24 hours to create the image, so what? (assuming they’ve planned their grids far in advance…)\n\nEqually to a Content Creator it’s of little relevance if a digital dress can be sold or traded because they derive financial value indirectly through the photo it’s worn in. The likes, shares, buys (of the magazine featuring them) and accompanying partnership offers, are what’s important here, and more than justify the $69 (virtual) price tag.\n\nUltimately, despite scoring low on my *Ownership Matrix* a Digitally Tailored garment still has full functionality to the content creating buyer; both as a garment, and an asset. Equally, just like the NFT shoes that went for $3.1 mil, it possesses perceived value due to its scarcity. A Tribute dress, similar to the NFT sneakers, has limited supply; only 100 of each design are sold. For Content Creators this means their image is assuredly unique, driving up the value of the asset used to create it and making it more desirable.\n\n### Catering to the new consumer\n\nThe exploration of value above, shows that Digital Fashion needs different abilities to appeal to different consumers. While current content creators require few elements of *Garment Functionality* outlined in my *Ownership Matrix f*or their digital clothes to provide value, I’d argue that the burgeoning generation of Digital Fashion consumers do.\n\nAs Digital Fashion spends in games spanning Fortnite, Animal Crossing, Decentraland, Roblox and CryptoVoxels suggest, dressing your avatar is increasingly important to players. There are a smorgasbord of reasons one would spend on in-game Digital Fashion assets, but ultimately, as with physical fashion, it comes down to the desire to show yourself and control how others perceive you.\n\nSomething which is far easier when you can take (almost) any form!!!\n\nAs we move increasingly towards a Direct-to-Avatar economy (one where people consume goods for their in-game characters), creators should stop to consider *when*, *how*, and *where* their garments can be used, as well as whether they can be modified; maximising the ways their consumers can bridge the gaps between who they are and who they wish to be.\n\nDigital Fashion is exciting because it can do more than its physical counterparts in empowering chosen identities to manifest. Aside from if you’re an Everest mountaineer, or own a Jetpack, most of the superpowers you get from what you wear in the physical world are psychological (that person views you differently because you look like this etc.) With Digital Fashion for in-game worlds these superpowers are far vaster and can be explicitly functional; A gown that makes you look like Cat Woman could allow you to become more agile in whichever virtual world you elect to wear it. It could also give you the power to unlock collector communities or give you DAO voting rights over wider platforms. All exciting prospects!!\n\n### A final note to creators\n\nAlthough the FEWOCiOUS drop was undoubtedly led by some profit hungry NFT bulls trying to make some $ (rather than ETH or BTC) the balance between conceptions of physical and digital value are unquestionably shifting.\n\nAs explored above, Digital Fashion can allow consumers to show themselves in entirely new ways, with far reaching implications. As we move to a new hybrid-phygital generation where Digital Fashion goods are abundant, Designers can distinguish themselves by approaching creation consciously, through a consumer centric lens.\n\nFor those trying to create a digital asset, like the FEWOCiOUS shoe, go ahead and think of what will beckon the circle of crypto-vultures; allowing you to capitalise quickly before the NFT supernova implodes.\n\nBut for those trying to create Digital Fashion items to be coveted long-term, consider how you can provide maximum value to your consumer. How will they use your good once they own it? And how can it transform them into their best selves on-screen?\n\n… Do the above correctly, create an asset to express and empower, and you’ll be coded into Digital Fashion history indelibly\n\n(after all the metadata’s stored on chain…)\n\n## This Month in Imaginary Clothing…\n\n* Digital Fashion featured in [Vanity Fair,](https://www.vanityfair.it/fashion/trend-fashion/2021/03/17/moda-digitale-shopping-per-il-nostro-se-virtuale-abbigliamento-tecnologia) [Business of Fashion](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/technology/what-the-nft-gold-rush-means-for-fashion), [Dezeen](https://www.dezeen.com/2021/04/27/the-fabricant-renaixance/), [WWD](https://wwd.com/business-news/technology/nft-bubble-bursting-1234803574/), [GQ](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/fashion/article/nft-fashion-industry), [Jing Daily](https://jingdaily.com/non-fungible-tokens-digital-storytelling/) and more…\n* The Dematerialised co-hosted an exhibition on The History of Digital Fashion with Meta_VS CryptoVoxels\n* The RTFKT X Fabricant X Dematerialised RenaiXance drop sold out in under 11 minutes\n* Gary James McQueen held a [fashion show](https://www.garyjamesmcqueen.com/) for 100% Digital clothes to be consumed instantly in collaboration with DressX\n\n  ## Ecosystem Exploration\n\n  #### Nine-Notable Nifty’s\n\n  > 1. \\*\\*Kevin McCoy’s [Quantum](https://news.artnet.com/market/sothebys-is-hosting-its-first-curated-nft-sale-featuring-the-very-first-nft-ever-minted-1966003) \\*\\*(about to be auctioned at Sotheby’s) goes on-chain as the first NFT ever minted - 5th of March 2014\n  > 2. \\*\\*[Dragon](https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/896775) \\*\\*the world’s most expensive Cryptokitty who currently trades at 600 ETH ($2,308,000+) was born - 28th of August 2018\n  > 3. \\*\\*The Fabricant Iridescence Dress \\*\\*- a collaboration between the Digital Fashion House and Dapper Labs is sold for $9,500 - May 2019\n  > 4. **[RTFKT X Evolutions](https://www.coindesk.com/rtfkt-sneakers-nft-collector-whaleshark) Digital Sneakers** sell for $22,500 (22ETH) to notorious collector WhaleShark - December 21st 2020\n  > 5. **[The METAJACKET](https://editorial.superrare.co/2021/02/18/the-metajacket-the-future-of-fashion-born-from-gaming/)** - a collaboration between Digitalax and RTFKT auctions 4 metajackets raising $125,825.05 (47.999 ETH) in 7 days - February 2021\n  > 6. **The Dematerialised [HexJerzo](https://thedematerialised.com/shop/the-dematerialised/gen0_hexjerzo) Digital Asset** - the first fully-portable, phygitally-wearable Digital Fashion asset sells out all 1212 copies - February 2021\n  > 7. **The Fabricant X Karlie Kloss [#makingstrides](https://www.thefabricant.com/makingstridestop20/karliekloss) Competition** - digital designers compete redesigning the adidas wind.rdy parka, with the leading submissions minted as NFTs through Rarible - March 2021\n  > 8. **The FEWOCiOUS X RTFKT Digital Sneakers** - RTFKT sell 600 pairs of Digital Sneakers raising $3.1 million in 7 minutes - March 2021\n  > 9. \\*\\*The Fabricant X RTFKT X Dematerialised [RenaiXance](https://thedematerialised.com/shop) - \\*\\*the first ever fully-portable, phygitally wearable, Digital Fashion drop sells out in under 11 minutes - April 2021\n\n***[This Outfit Does Not Exist](https://www.thisoutfitdoesnotexist.com/)****, is a platform bringing Digital Fashion to life through exploration, explanation and exhibition.

How much would you pay me then?\n\nThe Emperor’s New Clothes by Hans Christian Anderson tells the story of the world’s first fashion victim. An emperor duped into paying two designers for an outfit “woven from the purest silk and finest gold thread, invisible to all but those of his rank and stature”. When the emperor ‘wore’ this outfit, parading first round his castle, and then through the streets, he was subject to ridicule because, of course, this outfit did not exist.\n\nFlash forward to 2021, and dream-weaving con artists have been substituted for virtual-only designers like [Tribute Brand](https://tribute-brand.com/), [The Fabricant](https://www.thefabricant.com/) and [KAI KAI](https://taplink.cc/kaikai_design), distributed through a burgeoning group of [e-commerce sites](https://dress-x.com/). While these clothes are crafted from fabrics which can never be felt, unlike the Emperor’s imaginary clothes of the 1800’s, they ***can be seen***…as long as you have a screen handy.\n\n**So WTF is it?**\n\nSince starting to explore Virtual Fashion, there are five main questions I’ve been asked:\n\n### **1. What is Virtual Fashion?**\n\nVirtual Fashion refers to any type of fashion article (clothing, accessories, jewellery) that exists in the virtual realm. It spans the clothes that exist on [avatars](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGgWO1XnSSs/), the [skins in gaming](https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/29/20936513/league-of-legends-louis-vuitton-skin-true-damage-qiyana-prestige), and those digital-outfits which can be [worn by humans](https://www.instagram.com/thisoutfitdoesnotexist/?hl=en) - like the [Iridescence dress](https://www.thefabricant.com/iridescence) below ↓↓↓\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c034143-f8fa-434b-bf0e-b98d26e58c5f\\_800x1200.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c034143-f8fa-434b-bf0e-b98d26e58c5f\\_800x1200.jpeg)\n\n### **2. How do you wear Virtual Fashion?**\n\nAt present wearing Virtual Fashion is a 3 step process:\n\n1\\. **Photograph yourself** — you take a photo in the location you want to wear the virtual outfit. Making sure the areas of your body on show whilst wearing the virtual garment are [unobscured](https://dress-x.com/pages/help-faq)\n\n2\\. **Pay for the garment **—you  [buy the virtual outfit](https://dress-x.com/collections/trial-kit?page=3) from the brand and send them the photo at checkout\n\n3\\. **Wear the outfit ([like this](https://www.instagram.com/thisoutfitdoesnotexist/?hl=en)!) **— In 1–3 business days you’ll receive your photo, complete with new virtual outfit!\n\nNB: This ‘wearing’ process is in its earliest stages, relying on 3D rendering technology still in development. In the near future, you’ll be able to wear virtual clothes in real-time, and in motion. You’ll also be able to ‘own’ the digital assets rather than just having your payment amount to one-photo, and change from garment to garment, like [this….](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKethk3nv1b/)\\\n\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F\\_\\_ss-rehost\\_\\_IG-CKethk3nv1b.jpg)](https://instagram.com/p/CKethk3nv1b)\n\n### 3. Why would a human wear Virtual Fashion?\n\nAt this stage (<2 years into the sectors’ development) the Virtual Fashion consumer can be divided into three groups:\n\n1.  ***The Monetizer***— *those who can use virtual clothing to generate income*\n\nVirtual Fashion has a significant B2B value proposition within the arts. For those who generate income through showcasing the newest fashion trends, the proposition of reducing spend, whilst decreasing their carbon footprint (and the amount of clothes they have to haul around for a shoot!) through switching to digital garments, is an attractive one.\n\n**Example consumers: **[Instagram influencers](https://www.instagram.com/thisoutfitdoesnotexist/) , [editors and stylists](https://www.papermag.com/tribute-brand-digital-clothing-interview-2646199820.html), and (as rendering technology improves) those running [costume](https://screenrant.com/terrible-cgi-costumes-ruined-movies-amazing/) departments across film and TV.\n\n2.  ***The Flexer*** — *those who want to benefit from brand association but can’t afford the price tag*\n\nWant to show off in a classic Chanel suit but haven’t got £5,000 to spare. Why not go virtual? As luxury brands execute on [their plans](https://www.fastcompany.com/90546878/would-you-spend-10000-on-a-virtual-dress-gucci-is-betting-on-it?partner=feedburner\\&utm_source=feedburner\\&utm_medium=feed\\&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+fastcompany%2Fheadlines+%28Fast+Company%29\\&utm_source=Vogue+Business\\&utm_campaign=ae41c6df4e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN\\_2020\\_09\\_07\\_11\\_49\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_term=0\\_5d1e7914df-ae41c6df4e-57932587) to enter the space, Virtual Fashion offers an attractive opportunity to democratise consumption. Where those craving brand affiliation might previously have splurged on a £70 phone case, or waited with bated breath for an [H\\&M diffusion line](https://www.vogue.it/en/fashion/news/2018/10/23/moschino-form-an-orderly-queue-for-this-year-h-and-m-collaboration/), they can now buy a virtual garment to be worn, across social media, in 1–3 business days.\n\n**Example consumers:** aspirant luxury enthusiasts, consumers in emerging markets.\n\n3.  ***The Gen-Z Creative***— *those excited by the concept of genderless, sizeless, gravityless, dressing*\n\nVirtual garments are not limited by material, sizing, gender norms or gravity, meaning they ascribe perfectly to all the fashion industry’s burgeoning trends; promoting social impact, through both sustainability and [full-scale inclusivity](https://www.voguebusiness.com/fashion/the-future-of-diversity-and-inclusion-in-fashion). They are also 100% customisable, meaning you can really have the dress of your dreams e.g. a metallic ballgown from [Tribute](https://tribute-brand.com/custom-order/)’s virtual haute-couture pictured below ↓ ↓ ↓ \n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F\\_\\_ss-rehost\\_\\_IG-CKHDTB1DBeC.jpg)](https://instagram.com/p/CKHDTB1DBeC)\n\n### **4. Why would brands make Virtual Fashion?**\n\nIn the Virtual Fashion space, there are two types of brands creating clothes:\n\n1.  Brands that sell only Virtual Fashion\n2.  Brands creating digital twins of their physical collections\n\n**For those who sell only Virtual Fashion** — cost, sustainability and enhanced creative capabilities are the three key pull factors.\n\n1.  ***Cost effective creation*** - digital design and distribution allow emerging designers to showcase their creativity without needing to invest in the overheads of materials, studio space, or capital intensive equipment — dramatically reducing costs\n2.  ***Planetary preservation - ***virtual clothes don’t require fabric, meaning they don’t contribute to the fashion industry’s [92 million annual tons of textile waste](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonbird1/2018/09/09/fashions-dirty-little-secret-and-how-its-coming-clean/); nor do they require machinery (aside from computers) to be made, or highly-polluting transportation mechanisms to be delivered to the buyer\n3.  ***Avant-garde artistry*** - Virtual Fashion pushes the limits of creative idealism, removing restrictions around material malleability, a humanoid colour spectrum, or as previously mentioned, gravity\n\n**For brands creating digital twins of their physical collections **— Virtual Fashion still contributes to a sustainability imperative, as well as offering an ability to penetrate new customer segments and enter the gaming market.\n\n1.  ***Pre-planned production -*** pre-COVID [30%](https://www.voguebusiness.com/sustainability/fashion-waste-problem-fabrics-deadstock-pashko-burberry-reformation) of annual luxury goods production was discarded as unsold, excess inventory. This is because luxury fashion sales are based on an outdated business model which prevents designers from being demand-responsive. The majority of premium and luxury brands show 2–8 collections a year, releasing them to consumers 2–3 months later. There is little to no validation of demand for the garments before they are made, aside from industry critique\n\n    By being able to release digital twins before their physical counterparts are manufactured, brands can assess what consumers want before their collections go into production - a big win when it comes to cutting both unnecessary production costs and materials waste\n\n2.  ***Enhanced expansion*** - Virtual Fashion also gives brands the opportunity to access new consumer bases, providing access to both those unable to afford luxury goods, and those for whom luxury goods are inaccessible due to underdeveloped commerce systems\n\n3.  ***Metaverse marketing*** - the production of Virtual Fashion goods offers brands the opportunity to engage with the [Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse). There are currently [2.5 billion](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/worldwide-gamers-billion-players) active gamers worldwide, spending [$100 billion](https://atelier.net/virtual-economy/) on virtual goods. Virtual Fashion allows brands to follow the lead of [Louis Vuitton](https://eu.louisvuitton.com/eng-e1/magazine/articles/louis-vuitton-x-league-of-legends), [Versace](https://www.papermag.com/versace-trigreca-sneaker-complexland-2649119902.html?rebelltitem=5#rebelltitem5) and [100 Thieves](https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/100-thieves-animal-crossing-full-apparel-collection-release-info) (debuting virtual goods in League of Legends, ComplexLand and Animal Crossing respectively) and penetrate this market. Not only is the Metaverse highly lucrative in terms of consumer spend, it also lends itself perfectly to digital marketing. After all, these clothes are bought to be seen (by any one of the [1 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/325587/instagram-global-age-group/#:\\~:text=With%20roughly%20one%20billion%20monthly,million%20million%20Instagram%20users%20each.) users of Instagram or [350 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/746230/fortnite-players/#:\\~:text=Having%20burst%20onto%20the%20scene,globe%20as%20of%20May%202020.) gamers on Fortnite)\n\n    [![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F\\_\\_ss-rehost\\_\\_IG-CLEpPAABl2J.jpg)](https://instagram.com/p/CLEpPAABl2J)\n\n### **5. What does this mean for physical clothing?**\n\nOn average an item of clothing is worn [7 times](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-high-price-of-fast-fashion-11567096637#:\\~:text=As%20a%20whole%2C%20the%20world's,by%20the%20British%20charity%20Barnado's.) before being discarded. This is either because it is bought on a whim, induced by clever fashion marketing, or because it is poorly made. Virtual Fashion has the ability to provide substitutes for this first category. That crazy fuchsia dress you’ve seen on Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner, instead of settling for a cheap knock-off inevitably left in your closet to rot, why not buy it virtually?\n\nIn terms of this second category, Virtual clothes can become complements for brand’s physical items. Fashion houses can implement Made to Order models based off their virtual best sellers; for consumers sure they want to wear that cerise ballgown to their sister’s wedding, rather than solely in an Instagram post. Equally, if consumer’s whim buys are catered to by cheaper virtual garments, they have more to invest in their higher-priced, well-produced, slow fashion counterparts; supporting the physical fashion industry’s sustainability shift.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F\\_\\_ss-rehost\\_\\_IG-CKOxO61jM0A.jpg)](https://instagram.com/p/CKOxO61jM0A)\n\n## This Month in Imaginary Clothing…\n\nVirtual Fashion was featured in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/01/29/how-brands-can-thrive-in-the-direct-to-avatar-economy/), [Hypebeast](https://hypebeast.com/2021/1/virtual-ar-fashion-tribute-rtfkt-aglet), [Vogue Business](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/these-platforms-want-to-be-the-farfetch-of-digital-fashion), [Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/51913/1/auroboros-celestial-couture-alexander-mcqueen-vr-technology-digital-fashion), [HighSnobiety](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/digital-sneakers-you-cant-wear/), [WWD](https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/auroboros-drest-bring-couture-gaming-1234714217/) and BBC Radio\n\nAlexander McQueen’s [Sarabande Foundation](https://sarabandefoundation.org/) launched the first ever Digital Couture collection by Virtual Fashion artisans [Auroboros](https://www.auroboros.co.uk/about)\n\nVirtual Fashion from [Dress-X](https://dress-x.com/) graced the cover of [L’Officiel Ukraine](https://officiel-online.com/all-news/february-2021-issue-whats-inside/)\n\n[Fashion Tech Summit](https://dress-x.com/pages/sustainability-raw-data-references), [Berlin Fashion Summit](https://www.202030summit.com/), and [Holition Talks](https://holition.com/) all covered the future of Virtual Fashion\n\n## … and Next\n\n22-26 February marks the inaugural [Crypto Fashion Week](http://cryptofashionweek.xyz/) - [Register here](http://cryptofashionweek.xyz/)\n\n[Dress-X](https://dress-x.com/) [launched](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLMvkvAn-Cb/) a competition for emerging fashion designers going virtual\n\nThis Outfit Does Not Exist is coming to [Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/), answering all your Virtual Fashion questions through the Digital Fashion & Art Club - [watch this space](https://twitter.com/TODNExist) for more details\n\n*Want the hottest Virtual Fashion news as it breaks?

{"id": "m01aeR5KZm3lR3zzJVBhFK5guQdY7ag6z8NHihFb5Hw", "title": "Seize our energy infrastructure", "body": "gm\n\nI am about one year into the crypto/web3 space (two years for BTC), and about 15 years in all things related to digital and energy infrastructure. You know, the dirty (physical) electric grid, power plants, clean tech, data centers, telecom towers/base stations, switches, fiber, etc.\n\nI have spent most of my time/career thinking about the physical infrastructure, with a strong emphasis on energy infrastructure, behind all things digital (data centers, telecoms, fiber).\n\nAs I immerse myself into this fascinating space we call web3/crypto, I cannot help but point out a seemingly overlooked issue; energy ownership.\n\nWith web3, it’s all about ownership and decentralization. We now own our digital wallets, currency, NFT’s and ENS domains, but we don’t own the physical energy infrastructure that it all depends on.\n\nMuch like web2, our [energy infrastructure is centralized](https://www.epa.gov/energy/centralized-generation-electricity-and-its-impacts-environment), and due to the various incentive programs designed to decarbonize the grid, the solutions exist today in many markets, to take control of your own energy infrastructure, and become inter-dependent with the grid…meaning that owning our own energy infra pays over the life of the asset…like an NFT while you are on grid power, and provides resiliency when grid is down.\n\n_____\n\nTo me, this is an equally exciting and complimentary opportunity to web3, as it presents an elegant solution for the home of the digital/crypto age and a hedge to the likely volatile transition period we are entering.\n\nThis transition period of high volatility seems to be understood as we are all watching inflation, supply chain issues and referencing the Sovereign Individual as we are cheer on the ushering in of a new era. But it doesnt appear that we are preparing our physical lives to weather the storm. I realize we cannot solve for every possible issue, but we can prepare against the existing/known vulnerabilities such as the failing power grid, and digital connectivity.\n\n**I suggest** **we seize control of our own decentralized energy infrastructure.** \n\nBy doing so, we become resilient to power outages, mitigating our risk of power outages due to weather, floods, fires and attacks. This allows us to remain fully powered in both the physical and digital worlds we are building.  \n\nThe recent passing of the Biden infrastructure bill is touted as a great accomplishment, but it’s not going to solve our dependency problem. Nor will it fix the increasing likelihood of extreme weather events and/or potential future attacks on an already vulnerable grid.\n\n_____\n\nThe solution I am advocating here is literally a decentralized, grid-independent, energy infrastructure.\n\nOf course, if we are just solving for backup power, the simplest fix is to install a generator. \n\nBut this only solves the immediate backup problem, and is subject to fuel supply and fuel pricing, both of which are vulnerable to disruption over the long term, and during major grid outage events. Nonetheless, it is likely the best immediate term solution to deloy while in parallel considering a much more robust and elegant solution. \n\nThe optimal solution takes a long-term view and mitigates for a variety of potential events, most importantly events that can affect power and digital connectivity. It is primarily about solving for grid independence while optimizing for sustainable economics, digital connectivity and ideally contributing to the resiliency of decentralized digital money (Bitcoin).\n\n_____\n\nHere is the basic plan I have in mind (will vary depending on what state you live in):\n\n1. **Install backup generator** (ideally fueled by a natural gas line so you don’t have to refill).\n2. **Convert house to 100% electric** (HVAC, stove, etc.), Install EV charger(s), optimize for energy efficiency.\n   1. The goal here is to insulate yourself long term from fuel price fluctuations (which we are betting on rising), while also becoming as energy efficient as possible to keep your electricity consumption to a minimum.\n3. **Solar + battery system**; determine optimal ROI on system using battery for grid services and then oversize solar/PV based on all available roof space.\n   1. There are plenty of solar and battery installers who will do all this for you (Tesla, Sunrun, etc), but you will need to push for the oversizing of the solar as this will be outside of what is typical for them. See next step for why.\n4. **Mine crypto**: based on oversized solar available watts, purchase ASIC (or GPU) mining unit to mine crypto at lowest possible power rate. Deploy software to optimize for mining returns.\n   1. I will be taking lessons learned from [Thomas Smith](https://tomsmith585.medium.com/)’s “[A Solar Crypto Manifesto](https://medium.com/swlh/a-solar-crypto-manifesto-95c6422802a4#id_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImY0MTk2YWVlMTE5ZmUyMTU5M2Q0OGJmY2ZiNWJmMDAxNzdkZDRhNGQiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.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.VMPIle9q8N6kZcVQ84iy66YZ-mAVIzgpTXcLUzbkmQGYRRcT_IowUjXL3GPkt_bkd5UDn-Qf2CDmnOjtqWelnT34g-RmcTym9ws2or7U8JPDR0GG82MLg4tQspAMXTwdmEjTvqNHLJCXXLk_NQFJuaBsE1HGvyELaoytcPhUVSOA8NgZ2vT3XfadmNA6p4F19XHPjIMS7Uc4GOGloWOyEGI7AAXuupSF-wunut_65lQQrkkDZL9EpggETrcisBkFFQ1JfJnlzkJOG8pRu8ZslM4wY703hJxaeuvUypHhp0zMqbp9s4vee16lJdushLS0bfkgkUIzW_SHVfiMepwE1w)” on this part.\n\n_____\n\nIn data center terms, this is [N+2 redundancy](https://www.datacenters.com/news/data-center-redundancy-n-1-n-2-vs-2n-vs-2n-1-part-ii) for the home. Although anyone can do most of the above, it is the mining portion that is new and relatively unproven to date.  But if we can make this work, it could be deployed at scale to the benefit of all.\n\nAs for the results of this plan, assuming sufficient solar/PV sizing, you will now own your own energy infrastructure and will be grid independent. Therefore, you not be directly impacted by power outages even if they lasted for weeks/months.\n\nThe generator would only run in a worst-case scenario intermittently (or perhaps to charge the EV at times) and due to being 100% electric, you would have no direct exposure to natural gas or oil prices (aside from grid power).\n\nAnd based on the incentive programs in many states, 99% of the time, while the grid/utility is operational, your system will be “[bi-directional](https://www.morningbrew.com/emerging-tech/stories/2021/09/03/decentralized-bidirectional-power-smart-grids)” meaning you will be able to participate in grid services and get paid for your system by the utility.\n\nOn the mining crypto (bitcoin or other); the business case and proof of concept is documented [here](https://medium.com/swlh/a-solar-crypto-manifesto-95c6422802a4#id_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImY0MTk2YWVlMTE5ZmUyMTU5M2Q0OGJmY2ZiNWJmMDAxNzdkZDRhNGQiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.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.VMPIle9q8N6kZcVQ84iy66YZ-mAVIzgpTXcLUzbkmQGYRRcT_IowUjXL3GPkt_bkd5UDn-Qf2CDmnOjtqWelnT34g-RmcTym9ws2or7U8JPDR0GG82MLg4tQspAMXTwdmEjTvqNHLJCXXLk_NQFJuaBsE1HGvyELaoytcPhUVSOA8NgZ2vT3XfadmNA6p4F19XHPjIMS7Uc4GOGloWOyEGI7AAXuupSF-wunut_65lQQrkkDZL9EpggETrcisBkFFQ1JfJnlzkJOG8pRu8ZslM4wY703hJxaeuvUypHhp0zMqbp9s4vee16lJdushLS0bfkgkUIzW_SHVfiMepwE1w).\n\nOversizing the solar and using the low-cost power to power a bitcoin (or GPU) miner not only appears to make good financial sense, but it also provides resiliency to the bitcoin miner network itself by being grid independent. The implications of this at scale are tremendous and should be explored thoroughly.\n\n_____\n\nIn conclusion, the progress in sustainable energy has been significant over the past 20 years and is finally at a price point where it makes financial sense to deploy sustainable energy infrastructure. And due to the grid programs available, in many states, we have the opportunity to seize control of our own energy infrastructure and break the dependency (and centralization) on the grid.\n\nConsidering the messy road ahead from a socio-economic, political and climate/environment perspetive, and compound that with the known vulnerabilities of the existing power infrastructure, it seems prudent to act now and take control of your energy infrastructure while you can.\n\nI find this to be a very compelling concept and worth deploying a full-size pilot project, which I am happy to fund at my own risk.

The crux of the issue lies in weak involvement. Most governance token holders are not voting on proposals!\n\n**Current State of Governance**\n\nA run through [Tally](https://www.withtally.com/)’s dashboard highlights low engagement across the board. There are two stats to look at while on Tally’s site: the “engagement ratio” and the actual number of votes. The former measures the number of delegated tokens / total tokens. This essentially represents how many tokens have consciously been transferred to some person or entity with the impression that they will be knowledgeable and active in the voting process. The latter is the actual number of votes (1 token = 1 vote). Taking this number and comparing it to the circulating supply (maybe some adjustments needed for certain holders) gives one a rough picture of the level of governance engagement. A couple of examples are highlighted below (*note-*  circulating supply displayed as a range given input from multiple sources like Messari & CoinGecko):\n\n*Uniswap (520m — 628m circulating supply) — **19.96% Engagement Ratio***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5pG_JxMdjY_crJ9IMNWR8.png?height=133&width=468)\n\n*Compound (6m circulating supply) — **40.71% Engagement Ratio***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5eFcG9AybD81hVZcfTBn.png?height=132&width=468)\n\n*Rari Capital (11.3m circulating supply) — **21.67% Engagement Ratio***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7XqxV8W4Is3ziWARiGXQH.png?height=130&width=468)\n\n*Fei Protocol (453m — 455m circulating supply) — **18.36% Engagement Ratio***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y3hofRSaGwqOD0fCQ0xzL.png?height=132&width=468)\n\nAs one can see across both metrics, voting engagement needs improvement.\n\n**What is ISS?**\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services Inc. (“ISS”) is a proxy advisory firm. What this means is that institutions (i.e. pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), which own multiple shares of multiple companies, pay ISS to advise and (nearly always) vote on their behalf in shareholder votes. Many times, at an AGM, you will see these whales allocate their voting blocks to the measures being voted on. Proxy advisory firms such as ISS have become very valuable entities over the past decades as the nature of equity ownership and equity governance has changed. Firstly, institutional ownership of equity has increased with time, and these days institutions dominate shareholder voting. Secondly, as the nature of governance has changed, shareholder voting has become very costly, as seen across the categories of time, expertise, and personnel. Massive institutions like BlackRock can insource proxy voting research; however, the long tail-end of large, medium, and small equity holding institutions cannot afford to do this. As a [Harvard research paper](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/06/14/the-big-thumb-on-the-scale-an-overview-of-the-proxy-advisory-industry/) poignantly put it: “third-party proxy advisory firms satisfy a market demand by centralizing these costs so they do not need to be duplicated across multiple investment firms”. This makes it feasible for a small wealth management firm or medium sized mutual fund to participate in governance. Thirdly, regulation has intensified around investment managers needing to be involved in the proxy voting events of their portfolio holdings as well as acting to the best of their ability to guide governance to the benefit of their clients. Basically, these institutions cannot just ignore or loosely pay attention to governance, they need to be thoughtful and active. This motivation, paired with the costliness, leads to the economic value presented by proxy advisory firms.\n\nIn crypto, we have this governance problem, which could be caused by a myriad of things from complexity associated with understanding proposals, low attention bandwidth (i.e. being a holder of so many tokens, each with its own proposals, is tough), and maybe even a lack of knowing that one’s token entitles one to voting power. Paired with this is an overall lack of traditional institutional involvement, no real pressure for funds to participate in governance, and several coordination deficiencies.\n\nThis is all going to change. I foresee a future where more institutions accumulate DeFi (and Web 3.0) governance tokens as part of their portfolio strategies. If anything, governance in crypto is even more valuable than governance in equities. As institutions do this, the need to understand not only how the protocols work, but what is going on with all these numerous proposals, will be immense. If the current users now aren’t doing well with participating in governance, how will these TradFi institutions do it? We have a significant opportunity… there needs to be a service that guides them through this process, and this leads me to crypto’s ISS.\n\nThere are many ways of tackling this, one of which would be to create a new DAO dedicated to this very mission; however, this would entail a lot of upfront costs — getting smart researchers, being well connected to the DAOs which have active proposals, and building knowledge stock over time. A new DAO is possible, but maybe we can use some of what already exists in the space to get this service going.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThe initial structure that I envision starts with a team like the one at [Llama](https://llama.community/#/). This entity produces solid research on several projects that have governance components. While mainly conducting treasury-focused analysis, the team members and community contributors know a lot about these projects through their work and have the ability to retrieve data and information in a very efficient way. It wouldn’t be as much of a startup cost to begin gathering information around key proposals and releasing research. This is actually well aligned with what is going on in the treasury, and the work across both buckets can be symbiotic.\n\nHowever, research alone won’t be the cure to the aforementioned governance engagement issue. We want voting to be guided by this research. Thus, I propose a partnership between the Llama team and Tally. Llama provides the key ingredients to produce successful governance research and advisory. Tally provides the infrastructure for voting to be delegated to Llama’s proxy advisory services.\n\nInitially, the combined partnership would look like this. For every project that Llama covers, members of the team and community would begin to gather intel on the key governance voting proposals. Setting up a one-pager template, the members would detail the proposal (an overview), list the pros and cons, perhaps a paragraph on parties involved, and then conclude with their advice on what way to vote. This research would be accessible to the public for the time being. Moving on to Tally, the platform would show a special box pertaining to the ‘delegate’ functionality that lists the Llama Advisory group (a very nice addition to this would be a preview of the one-pagers on that project). This box would basically delegate people’s or institution’s vote to the Llama Advisory group, which would direct voting based on its research.\n\nAs this service begins to gain traction, and as the space develops to having more institutional involvement over time, Llama can offer this as a product to institutions. The research on voting would become proprietary and would be sold for an annual fee to these firms. The fee could be collected by some form of payment mechanism, or via Tally (i.e. in order to delegate to Llama Advisory, you would let some of your governance tokens be transferred as a tax, a.k.a. the fee — this is similar to how the Graph protocol does delegation). In fact, finding a potential way to monetize the delegation mechanism to the Llama Advisory group could be most successful in charging institutions.\n\nIf approached in the right way, this partnership will be a win-win for everyone involved. Llama gets a significant boost in the users / institutions consuming its content. Moreover, it gets to build relationships with key ecosystem players and diversifies its current treasury-focused business model. Needless to say, look at how successful ISS has been as a company in the TradFi world — this is a big revenue opportunity as the space matures. Tally benefits as its platform use increases significantly, given that the proxy vote, and possibly payment, will be realized through it. Projects and the community benefit from increased involvement, more public thoughtfulness on the proposals, and (hopefully) more efficient governance processes.\n\nNow, there are some risks to consider here, but, with the ability to speak with the respective teams / communities, I think we could mitigate them in certain ways:\n\n* Llama becomes influenced by a large party to push a vote one way. This has been a certain regulatory concern in the equity world with proxy advisors. We need to ensure that unbiased and objective analyses are run on proposals. Checks and balances / transparency needs to be instituted. The general risk of losing community trust should also motivate the team to behave accordingly. Incentives can be discussed as well\n* Institutional payment for services could be interpreted as partial. I.e. would Llama contributors be pressured to favorably conclude on investor-introduced proposals if that investor paid for their services? Would just the potential of this happening reduce trust? This is a tough one to tackle, and we would need to devise a very strict proposal for customers, outlining impartiality\n* Insider trading can interfere with research and voting. Assuming this partnership were to really scale, Llama’s team / core contributors could take token positions in protocols before releasing its research / voting. We would need to find incentive mechanisms to prohibit this (perhaps some form of auditing?)\n\n**The Future**\n\nThe basic details mentioned above are just the start… in the not too distant future, the ownership of governance tokens will be spread out across more and more institutions. Wealth managers, pension funds, endowments, the very same entities that use ISS, will need a similar service for DeFi (and DAOs overall) governance. It makes complete sense for them to use the same model with their crypto exposure. In fact, it makes even more sense just given that crypto is very complex and harder to understand for the traditional manager. Given this knowledge gap, these firms would pay for the research and voting advisory, especially with pressure from clients on understanding the developments of their holdings and influencing them to participate in a way that benefits the long-term success of the clients. Token advisory services is very much a part of the future — and it’s time for us to get a head start on building it now.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis idea is in its early innings, however, its potential to tackle a deep problem within crypto is very exciting. A lot of it is still malleable, and I am very open to feedback from the community at large as well as to in-depth discussions with projects and especially involved parties (i.e. Llama and Tally). I look forward to presenting an updated proposal upon further research and significant input from others.", "timestamp": 1636743319, "digest": "TsEEl4vYYlzqzmwtUbweitVcP308CyJIGwIocDk8lIU", "contributor": "0x8BE2355417EF645f3A3739DD1B8aBd38C563c595"}

A couple of examples are highlighted below (*note-*  circulating supply displayed as a range given input from multiple sources like Messari & CoinGecko):\n\n*Uniswap (520m — 628m circulating supply) — **19.96% Engagement Ratio***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5pG_JxMdjY_crJ9IMNWR8.png?height=133&width=468)\n\n*Compound (6m circulating supply) — **40.71% Engagement Ratio***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5eFcG9AybD81hVZcfTBn.png?height=132&width=468)\n\n*Rari Capital (11.3m circulating supply) — **21.67% Engagement Ratio***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7XqxV8W4Is3ziWARiGXQH.png?height=130&width=468)\n\n*Fei Protocol (453m — 455m circulating supply) — **18.36% Engagement Ratio***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y3hofRSaGwqOD0fCQ0xzL.png?height=132&width=468)\n\nAs one can see across both metrics, voting engagement needs improvement.\n\n**What is ISS?**\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services Inc. (“ISS”) is a proxy advisory firm. What this means is that institutions (i.e. pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), which own multiple shares of multiple companies, pay ISS to advise and (nearly always) vote on their behalf in shareholder votes. Many times, at an AGM, you will see these whales allocate their voting blocks to the measures being voted on. Proxy advisory firms such as ISS have become very valuable entities over the past decades as the nature of equity ownership and equity governance has changed. Firstly, institutional ownership of equity has increased with time, and these days institutions dominate shareholder voting. Secondly, as the nature of governance has changed, shareholder voting has become very costly, as seen across the categories of time, expertise, and personnel. Massive institutions like BlackRock can insource proxy voting research; however, the long tail-end of large, medium, and small equity holding institutions cannot afford to do this. As a [Harvard research paper](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/06/14/the-big-thumb-on-the-scale-an-overview-of-the-proxy-advisory-industry/) poignantly put it: “third-party proxy advisory firms satisfy a market demand by centralizing these costs so they do not need to be duplicated across multiple investment firms”. This makes it feasible for a small wealth management firm or medium sized mutual fund to participate in governance. Thirdly, regulation has intensified around investment managers needing to be involved in the proxy voting events of their portfolio holdings as well as acting to the best of their ability to guide governance to the benefit of their clients. Basically, these institutions cannot just ignore or loosely pay attention to governance, they need to be thoughtful and active. This motivation, paired with the costliness, leads to the economic value presented by proxy advisory firms.\n\nIn crypto, we have this governance problem, which could be caused by a myriad of things from complexity associated with understanding proposals, low attention bandwidth (i.e. being a holder of so many tokens, each with its own proposals, is tough), and maybe even a lack of knowing that one’s token entitles one to voting power. Paired with this is an overall lack of traditional institutional involvement, no real pressure for funds to participate in governance, and several coordination deficiencies.\n\nThis is all going to change. I foresee a future where more institutions accumulate DeFi (and Web 3.0) governance tokens as part of their portfolio strategies. If anything, governance in crypto is even more valuable than governance in equities. As institutions do this, the need to understand not only how the protocols work, but what is going on with all these numerous proposals, will be immense. If the current users now aren’t doing well with participating in governance, how will these TradFi institutions do it? We have a significant opportunity… there needs to be a service that guides them through this process, and this leads me to crypto’s ISS.\n\nThere are many ways of tackling this, one of which would be to create a new DAO dedicated to this very mission; however, this would entail a lot of upfront costs — getting smart researchers, being well connected to the DAOs which have active proposals, and building knowledge stock over time. A new DAO is possible, but maybe we can use some of what already exists in the space to get this service going.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThe initial structure that I envision starts with a team like the one at [Llama](https://llama.community/#/). This entity produces solid research on several projects that have governance components. While mainly conducting treasury-focused analysis, the team members and community contributors know a lot about these projects through their work and have the ability to retrieve data and information in a very efficient way. It wouldn’t be as much of a startup cost to begin gathering information around key proposals and releasing research. This is actually well aligned with what is going on in the treasury, and the work across both buckets can be symbiotic.\n\nHowever, research alone won’t be the cure to the aforementioned governance engagement issue. We want voting to be guided by this research. Thus, I propose a partnership between the Llama team and Tally. Llama provides the key ingredients to produce successful governance research and advisory. Tally provides the infrastructure for voting to be delegated to Llama’s proxy advisory services.\n\nInitially, the combined partnership would look like this. For every project that Llama covers, members of the team and community would begin to gather intel on the key governance voting proposals. Setting up a one-pager template, the members would detail the proposal (an overview), list the pros and cons, perhaps a paragraph on parties involved, and then conclude with their advice on what way to vote. This research would be accessible to the public for the time being. Moving on to Tally, the platform would show a special box pertaining to the ‘delegate’ functionality that lists the Llama Advisory group (a very nice addition to this would be a preview of the one-pagers on that project). This box would basically delegate people’s or institution’s vote to the Llama Advisory group, which would direct voting based on its research.\n\nAs this service begins to gain traction, and as the space develops to having more institutional involvement over time, Llama can offer this as a product to institutions. The research on voting would become proprietary and would be sold for an annual fee to these firms. The fee could be collected by some form of payment mechanism, or via Tally (i.e. in order to delegate to Llama Advisory, you would let some of your governance tokens be transferred as a tax, a.k.a. the fee — this is similar to how the Graph protocol does delegation). In fact, finding a potential way to monetize the delegation mechanism to the Llama Advisory group could be the way to most successfully charge institutions.\n\nIf approached in the right way, this partnership will be a win-win for everyone involved. Llama gets a significant boost in the users / institutions consuming its content. Moreover, it gets to build relationships with key ecosystem players and diversifies its current treasury-focused business model. Needless to say, look at how successful ISS has been as a company in the TradFi world — this is a big revenue opportunity as the space matures. Tally benefits as its platform use increases significantly, given that the proxy vote, and possibly payment, will be realized through it. Projects and the community benefit from increased involvement, more public thoughtfulness on the proposals, and (hopefully) more efficient governance processes.\n\nNow, there are some risks to consider here, but, with the ability to speak with the respective teams / communities, I think we could mitigate them in certain ways:\n\n* Llama becomes influenced by a large party to push a vote one way. This has been a certain regulatory concern in the equity world with proxy advisors. We need to ensure that unbiased and objective analyses are run on proposals. Checks and balances / transparency needs to be instituted. The general risk of losing community trust should also motivate the team to behave accordingly. Incentives can be discussed as well\n* Institutional payment for services could be interpreted as partial. I.e. would Llama contributors be pressured to favorably conclude on investor-introduced proposals if that investor paid for their services? Would just the potential of this happening reduce trust? This is a tough one to tackle, and we would need to devise a very strict proposal for customers, outlining impartiality\n* Insider trading can interfere with research and voting. Assuming this partnership were to really scale, Llama’s team / core contributors could take token positions in protocols before releasing its research / voting. We would need to find incentive mechanisms to prohibit this (perhaps some form of auditing?)\n\n**The Future**\n\nThe basic details mentioned above are just the start… in the not too distant future, the ownership of governance tokens will be spread out across more and more institutions. Wealth managers, pension funds, endowments, the very same entities that use ISS, will need a similar service for DeFi (and DAOs overall) governance. It makes complete sense for them to use the same model with their crypto exposure. In fact, it makes even more sense just given that crypto is very complex and harder to understand for the traditional manager. Given this knowledge gap, these firms would pay for the research and voting advisory, especially with pressure from clients on understanding the developments of their holdings and influencing them to participate in a way that benefits the long-term success of the clients. Token advisory services is very much a part of the future — and it’s time for us to get a head start on building it now.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis idea is in its early innings, however, its potential to tackle a deep problem within crypto is very exciting. A lot of it is still malleable, and I am very open to feedback from the community at large as well as to in-depth discussions with projects and especially involved parties (i.e. Llama and Tally). I look forward to presenting an updated proposal upon further research and significant input from others.", "timestamp": 1636743245, "digest": "TsEEl4vYYlzqzmwtUbweitVcP308CyJIGwIocDk8lIU", "contributor": "0x8BE2355417EF645f3A3739DD1B8aBd38C563c595"}

I was one of those foolish creators who heard about NFTs in December of 2020, but was too distracted by Christmas and Covid and shoveling snow to really bother looking into it until the crypto boom of Spring 2021.  Alas…\n\nThe NFT space is fast-moving, and I’ve seen what feels like dozens of trends come and go;  editions, collections, genesis…es…  Hundreds of photographers have had their moment in the sun, some of them flying too close and falling, some of them achieving lasting stardom (whether by climbing buildings or experimenting with rights models or simply photographing twins).  It’s a whirlwind, and it can be tough to keep up.\n\nAll of that said, I’ve seen modest success here, and I hope I can attribute it to at least *some* definitive moves I’ve made regarding where I list and how I price things, and not just being lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.  The following are just thoughts, and by no means financial, artistic, or crypto advice.  I’m just some guy.\n\n![Some guy with questionably healthy knees.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p25Upd7y3A3o4PlEK0bFL.jpg?height=383&width=536)\n\n### Diversify, Diversify, Diversify\n\nOne of the most important things I learned early on (in a Twitter Space, of all places) was to think of my NFT listings loosely like investments.  In the stock market, it’s common knowledge that diversification reduces overall risk of failure;  a similar concept applies here in NFTs (though maybe with a more positive spin on it).  The more NFT sites your work is listed on, the more eyes (and likely different sets of eyes) are on it, and thus the more likelihood a potential collector will find something they resonate with.  I myself don’t take an overly obsessive approach to it (I only have so many photos in my backlog, after all), but I do enjoy seeking out new platforms (and blockchains) to list my work on every so often.  It really does help.\n\n![Plus, lots of platforms make your Linktree really shine!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mVZAna3cKtiN1Q_pvxvA5.jpg?height=965&width=1702&&size=medium)\n\n### Spin the Wheel…\n\nOne of my favorite ways to think of pricing my NFT offerings is in terms of a set of a dozen vertical spinning wheels, similar to something you’d see on a game show like The Price Is Right.  Basically, I’ve got hundreds (maybe thousands?) of images suitable for minting as NFTs, but they’re not all created equal.  Some have high emotional value for me, some were technically difficult to capture, some required countless hours in post-processing (this applies doubly to the handful of timelapses I’ve made!).  Early in my NFT journey, I priced everything high, according to what I felt the images and my time were worth, in raw photographer-hours.  It made sense to me, it felt good, but it ultimately was *not* optimal in terms of actually selling anything to anybody.\n\n![Caution:  Pricing your own NFTs can and will make your head spin!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xvxmxr_4mCF_uOvDwgZMc.gif?height=1200&width=1200)\n\nI realized about a month in that, however many different reasons I had for pricing my own work, collectors might have at least as many different ones for *buying* any of it.

We’re excited to share more info below about the context, utility and roadmap around our token, and how you can get involved today.\n\nIf you’re already interested (or don’t feel like reading on), **[please fill out this general interest form](https://airtable.com/shrISCvhaGLOdN7b8)** and you’ll be among the first to know about our token strategy and future opportunities to contribute to our community at large.\n\n## Our (brief) history\n\nFounded by longtime journalist and researcher [Cherie Hu](https://cheriehu.com/), Water & Music started its life in 2016 as a newsletter sandbox for sharing critical, forward-thinking perspectives on music and tech. In 2019, we launched our paid membership on Patreon, and have since grown to nearly 1,500 paying members — spanning everyone from emerging artists and startup founders to marketers, investors and C-Suite executives at major music companies.\n\nOur contributor network to date consists of dozens of different writers around the world, and we’ve been early to report on several cutting-edge industry trends — from [music avatars](https://www.waterandmusic.com/meet-the-architects-of-musics-new-avatar-economy/) and [niche streaming services](https://www.waterandmusic.com/why-hyperpop-artists-are-flocking-to-matter-2/), to several different strands of music and Web3 including [music NFT drops](https://www.waterandmusic.com/data/2021-music-crypto-dashboard-track-70m-in-music-nft-sales-music-daos-and-more/), [Web3-native music communities](https://www.waterandmusic.com/the-shape-of-web3-music-communities/) and [crypto-based royalty payments](https://www.waterandmusic.com/why-more-music-companies-are-paying-artists-royalties-in-crypto/). What makes our work stand out is our relentless curiosity, our penchant for experimentation, our passion for interdisciplinary thinking and our recognition of constructive critique as a driving force of progress in music, tech and culture.\n\n[https://www.waterandmusic.com/data/2021-music-crypto-dashboard-track-70m-in-music-nft-sales-music-daos-and-more/](https://www.waterandmusic.com/data/2021-music-crypto-dashboard-track-70m-in-music-nft-sales-music-daos-and-more/)\n\n“Cool,” you might be thinking, “this is just another niche media company.”\n\nBut from the beginning, we’ve believed that **the value of Water & Music’s membership extends far beyond just a catalog of articles or company databases; it’s also about the *collective curiosity, enthusiasm and wisdom of our community*.** Over the past two years, we’ve intentionally designed our member experience not only around presenting our own original, high-quality research, but also around empowering our readers with the tools to lead their own conversations about the topics we cover.\n\nWe open-source our research process to members in the form of [regularly updated, highly curated databases of startups and deals](https://www.waterandmusic.com/databases/) that members can leverage to shape their own strategies and careers. Our private Discord server has become the daily watering hole for today’s most curious and innovative minds in music, who gather to help each other unpack the latest industry trends, give feedback on new projects and share job opportunities. We curate the most interesting insights from these conversations into weekly, members-only Discord digests, setting the early stages for a more community-driven, crowdsourced editorial and knowledge-sharing framework for the music business.\n\n## Why Web3 — and why now?\n\nThe question at the core of Water & Music’s next stage of evolution is: **How do we build a media and research ecosystem that allows our community to capture more of the value they are creating, both for Water & Music and for each other?** Naturally, this brings us to the wild world of Web3, which has empowered communities like ours around the world to claim a stake in the digital networks they help build.\n\nOver the past six weeks, we had the honor of taking part in Cohort 3 of **[Seed Club](https://seedclub.xyz/)**, an accelerator program focused on helping communities build their own social tokens. The accelerator was the best Web3 information firehose we could ask for across topics including community design, DAO governance and tokenomics, and helped instill in us the mindsets of [emergent strategy](https://www.akpress.org/emergentstrategy.html) and a bias towards action that are crucial for thriving in this landscape. We have come out of the experience convinced that tokens make sense for where Water & Music is headed, as the implementation layer for formalizing the more collective, collaborative behaviors already happening in our community.\n\nZooming out, **music-industry media has also seen major market consolidation that warrants a serious look at more decentralized, Web3-native alternatives.**\n\nIn September 2020, in probably one of the most under-reported mega-merger events of that year, almost all major entertainment trade publications in existence — including *Billboard*, *The Hollywood Reporter*, *Rolling Stone* and *Variety*, along with major data providers [Alpha Data](https://alphadata.fm/) and [MRC Data](https://www.billboard.com/p/u-s-music-mid-year-report-2021/) (formerly Nielsen Music) — consolidated under the same holding company, [known today as PMRC](https://pitchfork.com/news/rolling-stone-billboard-vibe-more-to-operate-under-new-joint-venture-pmrc/). It’s ironic how the music trade landscape is facing the exact same consolidation as [the industry it’s reporting on](https://www.waterandmusic.com/the-music-industrys-biggest-messaging-problem/), which arguably makes it difficult for said publications to look at themselves in a more critical way.\n\n[https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9454041/mrc-penske-media-venture/](https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9454041/mrc-penske-media-venture/)\n\nJust like Web3, the music industry is constantly shifting, experimenting and breaking its own rules, and it deserves a media ecosystem that can do this dynamism justice. **We believe Web3 can serve as the rails for a wholly different set of incentive structures for music-industry media and education** — one that incentivizes quality over quantity; that rewards curiosity and skill-building over “expertise” or seniority; that better reflects the diversity and ingenuity of its readers; that puts artists and creators at the center; and that encourages more transparent, fluid knowledge-sharing in a historically opaque, exploitative and low-paying business.\n\n## $STREAM and collaborative research “seasons”\n\nWater & Music’s Web3 strategy will span both fungible and non-fungible tokens.\n\nThe main pillar of our framework will be **$STREAM, a “research token” that represents high-quality, tangible contributions to our larger project of collaborative research, knowledge-sharing and community-building in music and tech**.\n\nAt the outset, the $STREAM token will have no inherent financial value. Rather, the token will function primarily as **on-chain credit** for contributions across our Discord server, editorial and research verticals, in-person events and more. Over time, token earnings and ownership will carve a path to governance for our most active contributors, who will have a say in the future of our collective research agendas and of the Water & Music DAO as a whole.\n\nWe are currently **piloting Season 1 of a new collaborative research format**, in which we work together with members of our community to assemble the definitive, foundational syllabus on a particular trend in music and tech. In a somewhat meta turn of events, **Season 1’s theme is about the current state of music and crypto**. We currently have over 30 of our members opted in to collaborate on research across multiple different working groups including music/web3 tooling, NFT royalties and contracts, generative music NFTs, fan sentiment analysis and fan onboarding case studies, covering tasks and skills including interviewing, writing and data analysis/visualization.\n\n**All contributors to Season 1 of our collaborative research will receive a launch airdrop of $STREAM in early December**, which is when we plan on publishing the results of our work.\n\nGiven our existing community history and growth journey leading up to this point, we will also send a $STREAM airdrop in December to the following people:\n\n* **Writers and researchers** — people who contributed guest articles to Water & Music in the past, and/or are helping us put together our collaborative reports today.\n* **Moderators and discussion leaders** — members who have led high-quality discussions about the music industry and guided/onboarded new members in our Discord server.\n* **Longtime supporters** — members who have supported Water & Music financially from its early days (including on our old Patreon page).\n* **Current and former team members of Water & Music** — people who have helped guide the higher-level strategy of the organization as a whole.\n\nIn the near future, we also plan on dropping **limited-edition NFTs (using tools like [Mirror’s Editions](https://dev.mirror.xyz/AOoIsKPfZvf8LACKWp7gj_mg1ICCDOfPnVBOsDQoXo8)) around the debut of each season**, which will allow a wider range of outside stakeholders to be recognized on-chain as supporters of Water & Music’s mission. Funds from these NFT sales will be distributed among core contributors to our research and community projects.\n\nWe are still in the process of designing this framework, and would love to hear any feedback you might have on these initial concepts at [hi@waterandmusic.com](mailto:hi@waterandmusic.com) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/home).\n\n## Preliminary roadmap\n\n* **Nov 12 (today!)** — Seed Club demo day + Hello World post launch\n* **Dec 6 – 10** — Season 1 premiere week + genesis NFT drop\n* **Week of December 13** — Launch $STREAM drop to Season 1 contributors and historical community members\n* **Early January 2022** — Season 2 launch\n\n## The $STREAM team\n\nOur current team ushering Water & Music into this new era includes:\n\n* **Cherie Hu** (founder/publisher) — Longtime music/tech writer and researcher, excited about building systems that promote experimentation, foster interdisciplinary thinking, break down industry silos and lower the barrier to learning.\n* **Alex Flores** (tech) — Full-stack developer interested in the future of collaborative knowledge exploration/synthesis, info visualization and decentralized organization structures.\n* **Diana Gremore** (research) — Live music industry professional with an agency/promoter background, now focused on creating technology to change the way the live music industry works with data; excited about the challenges and opportunities in Web3 PR, URL<>IRL connections and decentralized organization structures.\n* **Kat Rodgers** (community) — Varied background across music journalism, social media management and management consulting; passionate about community-building as a driver of change within the music industry, in both fan communities and industry-facing circles.\n\n## How to get involved\n\nThe most direct — although probably least Web3-native — way to support Water & Music right now and get to know our voice and community better is to [sign up for a monthly or annual membership on our website](https://waterandmusic.com/membership). This will give you access to our private Discord server, as well as the exclusive articles and newsletters we send every week distilling music-tech trends in an accessible, concise voice.\n\nThat said, we understand that you might not be mentally ready or financially able to pay a membership fee upfront, especially without first earning our trust.\n\nWith that in mind, we invite you to **[fill out this general interest form](https://airtable.com/shrISCvhaGLOdN7b8)** if you’re interested in staying up to date with our token strategy, upcoming collaborative research seasons and NFT drops and opportunities to get involved in our community. Identifying information on the form like ethnicity, gender and location are 100% optional, but will be helpful for us as we look to recruit and curate a diverse range of contributors for future research seasons, especially those who might need financial aid.\n\nYou can also follow us on Twitter below:\n\n[https://twitter.com/water_and_music](https://twitter.com/water_and_music)\n\nThanks so much to everyone who has supported us so far, and we’re thrilled for everything that’s in store!! ✌️", "timestamp": 1636745416, "digest": "ox_BFXwgue_sJjP9J8IQcN-Q7Po-S1RWugM-Nwr4z6Y", "contributor": "0x03e9206f2A1234fEFaD2C0B07A86B1E0f5cB8d0D"}

We currently have over 30 of our members opted in to collaborate on research across multiple different working groups including music/web3 tooling, NFT royalties and contracts, generative music NFTs, fan sentiment analysis and fan onboarding case studies, covering tasks and skills including interviewing, writing and data analysis/visualization.\n\n**All contributors to Season 1 of our collaborative research will receive a launch airdrop of $STREAM in early December**, which is when we plan on publishing the results of our work.\n\nGiven our existing community history and growth journey leading up to this point, we will also send a $STREAM airdrop in December to the following people:\n\n* **Writers and researchers** — people who contributed guest articles to Water & Music in the past, and/or are helping us put together our collaborative reports today.\n* **Moderators and discussion leaders** — members who have led high-quality discussions about the music industry and guided/onboarded new members in our Discord server.\n* **Longtime supporters** — members who have supported Water & Music financially from its early days (including on our old Patreon page).\n* **Current and former team members of Water & Music** — people who have helped guide the higher-level strategy of the organization as a whole.\n\nIn the near future, we also plan on dropping **limited-edition NFTs (using tools like [Mirror’s Editions](https://dev.mirror.xyz/AOoIsKPfZvf8LACKWp7gj_mg1ICCDOfPnVBOsDQoXo8)) around the debut of each season**, which will allow a wider range of outside stakeholders to be recognized on-chain as supporters of Water & Music’s mission. Funds from these NFT sales will be distributed among core contributors to our research and community projects.\n\nWe are still in the process of designing this framework, and would love to hear any feedback you might have on these initial concepts at [hi@waterandmusic.com](mailto:hi@waterandmusic.com) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/home).\n\n## Preliminary roadmap\n\n* **Nov 12 (today!)** — Seed Club demo day + Hello World post launch\n* **Dec 6 – 10** — Season 1 premiere week + genesis NFT drop\n* **Week of December 13** — Launch $STREAM drop to Season 1 contributors and historical community members\n* **Early January 2022** — Season 2 launch\n\n## The $STREAM team\n\nOur current team ushering Water & Music into this new era includes:\n\n* **Cherie Hu** (founder/publisher) — Longtime music/tech writer and researcher, excited about building systems that promote experimentation, foster interdisciplinary thinking, break down industry silos and lower the barrier to learning.\n* **Alex Flores** (tech) — Full-stack developer interested in the future of collaborative knowledge exploration/synthesis, info visualization and decentralized organization structures.\n* **Diana Gremore** (research) — Live music industry professional with an agency/promoter background, now focused on creating technology to change the way the live music industry works with data; excited about the challenges and opportunities in Web3 PR, URL<>IRL connections and decentralized organization structures.\n* **Kat Rodgers** (community) — Varied background across music journalism, social media management and management consulting; passionate about community-building as a driver of change within the music industry, in both fan communities and industry-facing circles.\n\n## How to get involved\n\nThe most direct — although probably least Web3-native — way to support Water & Music right now and get to know our voice and community better is to [sign up for a monthly or annual membership on our website](https://waterandmusic.com/membership). This will give you access to our private Discord server, as well as the exclusive articles and newsletters we send every week distilling music-tech trends in an accessible, concise voice.\n\nThat said, we understand that you might not be mentally ready or financially able to pay a membership fee upfront, especially without first earning our trust.\n\nWith that in mind, we invite you to **[fill out this general interest form](https://airtable.com/shrISCvhaGLOdN7b8)** if you’re interested in staying up to date with our token strategy, upcoming collaborative research seasons and NFT drops and opportunities to get involved in our community. Identifying information on the form like ethnicity, gender and location are 100% optional, but will be helpful for us as we look to recruit and curate a diverse range of contributors for future research seasons, especially those who might need financial aid.\n\nYou can also follow us on Twitter below:\n\n[https://twitter.com/water_and_music](https://twitter.com/water_and_music)\n\nThanks so much to everyone who has supported us so far, and we’re thrilled for everything that’s in store!! ✌️", "timestamp": 1636745416, "digest": "ox_BFXwgue_sJjP9J8IQcN-Q7Po-S1RWugM-Nwr4z6Y", "contributor": "0x03e9206f2A1234fEFaD2C0B07A86B1E0f5cB8d0D"}

Most notably [Quantum](https://www.quantum.art/), a platform that brought me the exact feeling I had on early Art Blocks minting. Fun, competitive, gamified, highly curated. It’s amazing to see the photography renaissance and to be a part of it.\n\n*(the very name of Fingerprints DAO came from a [post](https://dtjournal.substack.com/p/fingerprints-of-the-blockchain) about Art Blocks, so it feels full circle in a way)*\n\nBut we were still missing a way to involve the whole community.\n\nWe tried forms and nominations but mostly photographers applied.\n\nPhotographers are great and essential, but if we want the DAO and the space to be successful, it’s essential to have the collectors onboard. Remember, [we’re trying to structure supply AND demand](https://dtjournal.substack.com/p/shooting-raw-part-2).\n\n## …let’s throw a party and people will come!\n\nThe way to become a member in RAW is to participate in the Party Bid for Twin Flames #49 - The Community Twin.\n\nThe most iconic piece from the most successful collection in photography NFTs, the one the community itself was able to make [the first NFT auctioned at a major auction house, Sotheby’s.](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-a-curated-nft-sale-2/announced-soon)\n\n![Twin Flames #49 - The Community Twin](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ozzOiTzU9DcezMQXAtBv-.png?height=2100&width=2100)\n\n[Party Bid is a product for collective bidding on NFTs.](https://www.partybid.app/) You form a PartyBid, invite your friends, place bids together and have fun.\n\nBut we’re taking it one step further: we’re using the sale of Twin Flames #49 as a way to bootstrap the formation of RAW DAO!\n\nThe mechanics are the following:\n\n* Starting next **Monday, Nov 15th**, RAW DAO will list The Community Twin in a auction at Zora for 1k ETH\n* A Party Bid will be organized. If the bid is successful, the participants will get fractions of the artwork, proportionate to the size of their contribution\n* **Anyone who contribute at least 1 ETH to the Party will be airdropped enough $RAW tokens to become a full member (250 $RAW per ETH)**\n* **Fingerprints DAO members will get a 50 $RAW bonus per ETH. 300 $RAW per ETH**\n* **Participants who commit more than 5 ETH will get the same 50 $RAW bonus per ETH. 300 $RAW per ETH**\n\nParticipants will not only get the fractions of the most iconic piece of the Twin Flames collection, but also get a $RAW airdrop.

We will see how we can all use the tools we have today – hello web3 – to foster a generation of self-sovereign individuals proud of their identities, making powerful communities, and having a tangible impact on the continent to change its story.\n\nSay *gm* to Zouzoukwa.\n\n(gm)\n\n\n---\n\n## Background & Genesis 🌱\n\nMy name is O’Plérou and I’m an Ivorian artist, designer, and creative explorer. Born and raised in Côte d’Ivoire, a beautiful country in West Africa. I like to draw and create things and to explore ideas: sometimes for the sake of creativity and experimentation, and others to try to move towards a better future for myself and others.\n\nAnd even if I’m not the most sociable person in the room, I’m still interested in my environment to learn how things work and see how I can participate in my own way.\n\n### Africa’s Representation and its Impact\n\nAt some point, I started to notice many things that I didn’t like: Media keeping sharing stereotypical portraits of Africa, fellow young Ivorians not being interested in their own cultures and trying to be copies of the West, people risking their lives to go abroad for a “better life”…\n\nI could not stay insensitive to these things and I kept thinking about how I could change things, or at least try. And one day – long story short – a thought came to my mind: **\"What if I made emojis?”**\n\n### A Daily Emoji Project\n\nEven if it sounded silly at first, I liked the idea and immediately gathered resources to learn how to create a emojis (just YouTube, thank you ✨internet✨) and created the first one, Zaouli. It looked nice, and since I know that I tend to start many projects and never finish them, I decided to try something different this time, a self-initiated challenge: **Create a new emoji every day of 2018 and publish it on social media**.\n\nAnd I did it. (yeah I’m bragging 💀)\n\n![\\[Monuments Week\\]](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Nt6iDL5KJFntsoUzaQBJ.jpeg?height=2048&width=1861)\n\nThe project was cool, light-hearted and fun: it was different to see cultural elements in that way, because Africa is usually not represented in technology. It even attracted the attention of international press and articles were written about the project and I.\n\nIt was funny for people to see me create ordinary elements, and during the project they wanted to actually use the emojis in their conversations. And again I gathered resources to do that (still ✨YouTube✨), and managed to release an app at the end of the project to make the emojis usable as stickers on WhatsApp and iMessage. It was like a gift to the community to thank them for their support, and it was pretty well received: The app was downloaded more than 10k times in the first week, and Play Store currently show more than 100k downloads. 🥲\n\n\n---\n\n## After the Challenge: Abyss & Despair 💀\n\nEven if more cool things happened after the end of the challenge, — Wikipedia article, New York times article, brand collaborations, Ford Foundation support —  I was not really satisfied with the project’s outcome.\n\nThe project was dependent of Instagram, and social media is not the best way to learn about the represented elements. I wanted Zouzoukwa to promote the entire continent, but most emojis I made were about West Africa. My main source of information was the Internet, and *I* was the one in charge of representing cultures I don’t belong to.\n\nBut above all, **I realized I was building a community project alone, and I couldn’t even find ways to incentivize others to join me in that adventure**.\n\n\\[dramatic & sad piano music 🎼\\]\n\nI stopped publishing anything, lost followers everyday, basically ghosted the audience and disappeared since April 2020.\n\nBut in 2021, I found a sparkle of hope.\n\n\n---\n\n## Web3 🌐 : A World of ✨Infinite Possibilities ✨\n\nIn February, I saw an article about the sale of Nyan Cat NFT and the vision I had for my life and future changed forever 💀.\n\nThey sold?? A Digital Artwork? For hundred dollars? I quickly got interested in NFTs, how they worked, what they’re part, of and from there I fell down the rabbit hole. 🐇\n\nThis new world where people actually get rewarded for the value they create was exactly what I needed for Zouzoukwa. And as I learned about the ecosystem (especially thanks to SC03🌱), the direction of the project became more clear now: **Zouzoukwa should become a DAO**.\n\n### AfroGen Z x Culture x Crypto = Zouzoukwa DAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SDSkLCQcEvrLqvtcKP9TE.png?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nDAOs are organizations of people gathering towards a goal, and Zouzoukwa’s mission is clear: **Onboard people from Africa to web3/crypto, create emojis & content to promote culture, and have a positive tangible impact on the continent.** And as a result, change the way Africa is perceived.\n\nWe should start a community of thinkers, builders, creatives, storytellers, collectively building the great Africa they want to see. Funding & creating public goods that benefit ourselves and the web3 ecosystem, and become active participants of the crypto revolution.\n\n\n---\n\n## What’s next and how you can get involved\n\nTo turn the mission into reality, we are going to need funds: to hire developers to work on the DAO products, to reward the early contributors and supporters, to allow the core team to spend more time on the project \\[I’m currently the only one full time\\] and to teach people about this new ecosystem.\n\n### Mirror Crowdfund and $ZOUZOUKWA Collection NFTs\n\n![$ZZK Crowdfund Editions✨](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aorRdqzOZJMbm6ktk0s63.png?height=700&width=2066)\n\nTo participate in this adventure and be an early supporter of the movement, you will *soon* be able to back the DAO Genesis Crowdfund on Zouzoukwa’s Mirror, and buy the original 365 emojis of the project on Foundation.\n\nStay tuned by following [Zouzoukwa on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Zouzoukwa) and join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jFPBy8dq8s) 🌍 to be amongst the firsts to know about the release dates.\n\nSee you there! ✨\n\n[https://discord.gg/jFPBy8dq8s](https://discord.gg/jFPBy8dq8s)\n\n\n---\n\n> “You cannot carry out fundamental change without a certain amount of madness.

{"id": "rzFc_8jo7blYNze2TLmDEMZoILmweIG62PMjPI5aoF8", "title": "Applications of Graph Theory on the Structure of a DAO ", "body": "## Graph Representation of a DAO\n\nAn organization can be represented as a graph by allowing each node to be a department and each edge to be a shared responsibility between two departments.\n\nIn the above example, the following nodes are operations, treasury, sales, and marketing, and two miscellaneous departments. Notice that there is a connection between every node. This type of graph is called a [complete graph](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CompleteGraph.html#:\\~:text=A%20complete%20graph%20is%20a,are%20sometimes%20called%20universal%20graphs.) or fully connected. If any node is removed, the graph will still remain complete. In other words, none of the functions of the remaining nodes will be affected because the graph is still a complete graph, which can be seen as an equivalent definition for ‘decentralization’.\n\n![Example - Complete Graph of a DAO, maximally decentralized](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rpl740hyWXRhTeODaWUQT.jpg?height=497&width=595)\n\nAn observation about complete graphs is that a complete graph also represents a maximally decentralized graph. To see why this is true, consider the following graph below to the left, which is a connected graph, but not complete. Notice that the operations node is the gateway in which all the other nodes are connected. Thus the operations node makes this graph very centralized. If the operations node is removed, the organization will cease to function properly and the graph will no longer be a connected graph as seen below to the right. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KHDdUWRiq7Bv0EOz-4nLX.jpg?height=335&width=925)\n\n## Maximal Decentralization in a Graph\n\nViewing the organizational structure of a DAO or any organization through the lens of graph theory gives us the additional benefit of being able to quantify how much centralization or decentralization exists within a DAO. As DAO’s continue to figure out the daoification process, the end goal will be towards a maximally decentralized DAO structure, or a complete graph structure. The more decentralized a DAO becomes, the more robust it will be to new organizational changes over time. \n\n## Understanding Department Responsibilities and Functions within a DAO\n\nWe can use the graph structure to describe the complexities of a DAO. For example consider this sample DAO structure represented as a graph:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vrehYeoITvRA5x3__KIdv.jpg?height=330&width=576)\n\nAlthough not a complete graph, we can immediately see the level of decentralization each department has based on the number of edges that belong to the node. The more edges a node has, the more ‘reliant’ the entire DAO will be on that node. A higher number of total edges in the graph implies an overall higher level of decentralization. \n\nAnother use case is to chart the paths from one node to another. For example there is no direct edge between the sales and treasury nodes. The shortest paths, both of length 2, are \n\nsales -> marketing -> treasury\n\nsales -> operations -> treasury\n\nAdditional questions can then be asked whether there should indeed be a direct connection between sales and treasury or not. Is a 2 edge path sufficient or do sales and treasury responsibilities overlap so much that there should be an edge established directly between sales and treasury? We would also expect that the sales department will have the most overlapping responsibilities with operations and marketing departments and have no direct overlapping responsibilities with new department1, new department 2, and treasury. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nUsing graph theory to understand the structure of a DAO to characterize the levels of decentralization can offer valuable insights and guide a DAO through the daofication process. Adding/removing new departments to the DAO via nodes to a graph makes the process quantitative and offers additional insight to the responsibilities and functions of the departments and shows which responsibilities overlap and which responsibilities are independent. \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1636752732, "digest": "fuznGoiFzMmDk6iMdunDejkPiuRbJ5yqDRzg7-q2IYA", "contributor": "0x829Ceb00fC74bD087b1e50d31ec628a90894cD52"}

I was a style advisor for a while, but I had always been more interested in crafting and making things, so I started making and selling wire wrapped crystal jewelry on the side and knew I wanted a career where I would have a lot of creative freedom.\n\nI first found out about digital fashion around 2 years ago when I read that The Fabricant sold the first digital garment on auction for $9000. The industry was so fresh, I knew then that I needed to know more. I went on their website and looked at the job opportunities they had listed and found the softwares I had to learn, and from there I learned Clo3D.\n\nI started to develop digital fashion assets for brands and designers, each with their own reason and use case for the technology. Some wanted it mainly for promotional reasons; others wanted to test out garments before physically making them. But I knew that more could be done with the 3D models I was making and with the digital fashion industry as a whole. It was at that point that I was introduced to the GDN. I truly have found my tribe here. Even though we are all separated by distance and screens, we are connected in a way that transcends those limitations. We're building out not only an entirely new industry, but a new way of connecting,  collaborating and doing business with each other; a way that's cemented in supporting one another rather than competing. Competition is still there, but in more of a collaborative and open way that allows anyone to compete, regardless of background. Equal opportunities for everyone.\n\nI see digital fashion being the norm in the future and I'm extremely grateful to be helping to pioneer the industry in that direction in a more decentralised way through web3 fashion and NFT's. I have plans to grow into a business that can encapsulate all areas of digital/web3 fashion, to help traditional fashion brands transition more easily into the space, with the right advice and guidance. I also have plans to incorporate physical design, e.g. the jewelry I make into web3fashion, so that if you buy the NFT you get a one-off physical piece and also use cases within the metaverse and DeFi staking your digital version NFT on DIGITALAX for $MONA yield. I understand the value NFT technology could have in the future. That's what makes me so passionate about this side of the industry. In the end, I want all of my NFT holders to benefit from my success. Ideally I would like them to be the ones that fund my plans and ideas by buying my NFT's, rather than a centralised bank or organisation.\n\n\n---\n\n### Web3 Renaissance Patronage\n\nAny patronage of the Weekly Designer Spotlight goes directly to the Global Designer Network Treasury, Spotlighted Designer and Core Writer (50/35/15), for further growing out the infrastructure, community and market of web3 fashion, the open metaverse and more.

We are building a place where we can develop to our fullest potentials, physically, culturally, and spiritually. Bitcoin was developed as a financial technology with political goals identical to those of the Founding Fathers: liberation. The ultimate end of crypto is the possibility of a future for humanity unshackled from the institutions that seek to limit our growth. Our ultimate goal is to bring about a more vital future for humanity, and we will use technology to achieve this righteous end. \n\nOur civilization is unwell. We eat food that kills us, we’ve lost sight of beauty, and we neglect our spiritual lives. The world is deranged and decayed, and this frightens people. We don’t look up from our screens; we seek to live within them. Crypto is a fundamentally political technology -- escape to the metaverse is a betrayal of the principles on which it was founded. We are descended from the people who built Rome and Athens, who dared to split atoms and voyage to the Moon. We can build new worlds not just of bits, but of atoms. \n\nIn the Information Age, everything is made anew. We have a radical opportunity to remake cities. Cities will be reorganized around shared values, rather than the labor market principles of the Industrial Age. The defining value of the coming epoch is Vitality, so we are building our citizenry on this moral foundation. We will build structures that reach to the heavens on a vibrant coast, with governance that enhances the vitality of its people. You will be able to walk barefoot in the midst of our urbanity. \n\nPraxis is organized as a membership-based community. There are many reasons to join Praxis: to self-actualize on the dimension of vitality, to meet amazing people, to be able to move to what will become the defining city of the 21st Century, etc. But the most important reason is this: to take part in a grand historical narrative to bring a moral vision for the future into being. This is your opportunity to join America in 1776.\n\n## Philosophical Groundings.\n\n**Forging a path through the stars, we look upon the galaxy with reverence and enchantment.** Fellow space travelers dart through the night ahead of us. The firmament that once inspired worshipful terror calls upon our higher instincts to explore barren moons, balls of fire, and dreamscape worlds. We heed the call. \n\nAs we look behind us, we see a trail of light tracing our path from earth. This trail of light is our civilization’s spirit, an organic entity distinct from the collection of people that reside within it. Ahead of us, this light blossoms into a thousand beams, landing on new homes for humanity. We are all reflections of this light; we are all men of our time and civilization. \n\nOn earth we see vast oceans, swirling clouds, and broken continents. On these continents we see pyramids, monuments, and castles, etched in the ground by the lights of past civilizations. Contemplate the vision of the men who designed the Pyramids of Giza. On shifting sands they envisioned a perfect configuration of stone aimed at the heavens, larger than any structure heretofore built. Beautiful, gargantuan visions and the technology to realize them are the mark of a civilization at its spiritual peak. \n\nCivilizations are born with foundational values. The destiny of a civilization is determined by the way its values and understanding of the world map onto reality. The liberal west embodies Enlightenment ideas, e.g. that man’s nature is plastic and perfectible. The direction of our destiny is informed by our values, and the intensity of its realization is informed by our understanding of the world. A better understanding of the world enables us to build technology -- physical, social, and spiritual  -- to realize our destiny. Technology is truly a driving force of history. History is the process by which civilizations’ destinies unfold as they attempt to impress their visions into the human and earthly landscape. \n\nSalus populi suprema lex esto: The health of the people is supreme law. We evaluate civilizations and their values by the vitality they produce in their people. Vitality manifests physically, culturally, and spiritually. Physically vital civilizations produce healthy, strong, and beautiful people; culturally vital civilizations produce high art that inspires aesthetic contemplation; and spiritually vital civilizations are pulled unremittingly forward by a vision for the future in touch with the true nature of man and the universe. \n\nCivilizations often promulgate intermediary values with the ultimate end of vitality in mind. If the means usurp the ends, misguided deontological ethics reign until a lack of vitality causes death. \n\nCivilizations occupy a moral landscape circumscribed by their values. When value systems begin to descend, Prophets summit spiritual peaks to look beyond the common man’s conceptual horizons. They look to the frontier to spy new vistas of thought. Later, statesmen lead pioneering crews beyond these horizons, with a deep moral conviction that there are better ways to live. The frontier is the birthplace of civilizations. \n\nAs we leave old lands, our values are our compass. Like wolves, tribes of pioneers are muscular by necessity. For voyaging tribes to settle, they must perform murmurations: intricate coordination with little communication, at scale. This is only possible with a strong sense of asabiyya (group feeling derived from deeply-held shared values). Our values inform the destiny we desire, and for which we struggle. Asabiyya is forged in this struggle. With asabiyya, pioneers can earn the divine mandate to build a city. Cities are the fount of human ingenuity. In cities, people enjoy their fullest potential by contributing their resources under the auspices of civilization.\n\nCivilizations rise and fall. All around us, we see civilizational decay. The people are not vital: physically, culturally, spiritually. We live in an era of obesity, remakes, and pollution. We are losing the divine mandate, and in an era of absolute weapons, what’s at stake is everything. But perhaps there’s some glory in death by a light brighter than a thousand suns. A worse fate may await humanity: atrophied bodies submerged in gel, fed synthetic bug paste, minds occupied by the petty amusements of a corporate metaverse. There, nothing is at stake; there are no frontiers to explore; no growth is possible. Nothing to live for, and nothing to die for. \n\nAs we walk between these twin fates, the light of our civilization dims. But beyond the horizon, we see a new light emerging. Like the sun at dawn, it cannot be stopped. Vitality itself is the foundational value of this new civilizational form, and we have the technology to enact our moral imperative as never before. Cryptography secures property which once only guns could. At the speed of light, people from around the world can participate in new governance systems and voluntarily organize to realize their visions for the future.\n\nWe chose to enact history and organize around vitality. Vitality is life. Vitality is energy. Vitality is human flourishing, and human flourishing requires physical, intellectual, and spiritual self-actualization. We will reach our potentials, walking barefoot, gazing at the sun, building beautiful families, standing for justice and truth. Preserving the vitality of the natural world and raising buildings that make you feel heroic. Vitality means listening to the base biological mandate of growth and persistence, as well as the higher call of spiritual life. We will build a high culture within this burgeoning civilization. We must choose to do this in the face of danger and discomfort. Genius will be lauded and beauty will be praised without hesitation. We will indulge the pre-rational mind while respecting the power of logic; Ramanujan was presented with his mathematical insights in dreams. We believe humanity is a tradition worth preserving. \n\nThe ultimate manifestation of vitality entails humanity’s expansion into the infinite frontier of space. Humanity will go forth and multiply on a thousand worlds, ushering in a fractal civilization blossoming across the universe. We are on the cusp of exponential human flourishing. \n\nIt is said that you make one choice in your life: whether to escape from history or to give your life for it. Building a vital future for humanity starts with a single step: joining a band of pioneers, voyaging onto the frontier, and earning the divine mandate to build a city glowing with the light of the coming civilization.\n\n## How to Build a New City.\n\n**It’s time we look up from our screens and to the horizon.** There, we can build new worlds, not just in bits, but in atoms. Many have tried and failed to build new cities, but a new frontier awaits. Techno-historical forces unlocked a new modality of city building for the Information Age. \n\nAt the beginning of any city building venture, you face four major challenges: \n\n* Politics: Will a sovereign let you build a new population center? \n* Money: Can you raise the money to execute on the project? \n* Supply: Can you build complex infrastructure and real estate?\n* Demand: Will people move in? \n\nYou must decide how to order the risk dominoes, i.e. which risk to take on first. \n\nIn the Industrial Age, cities were organized around labor markets. People primarily moved to cities for jobs. Cities are also about culture, dating markets, and so on, but those things fall to the wayside when local labor markets collapse. No one talks about Detroit’s art museums. \n\nAs such, building a new city requires building a new labor market. A popular new city model, born of the successes of Hong Kong, Dubai, and Singapore, is the charter city. The theory is that by building a city in a special zone with business-friendly regulation, you can induce demand for labor by attracting businesses that want to take advantage of the regulatory changes. \n\nThe strategy of charter city entrepreneurs is typically politics-first, demand-last. They seek to get an initial government agreement to create a special jurisdiction, which they presume will unlock capital; and with that capital, they will finance a master plan development; and because the development will be better governed under their special jurisdiction, residents (and an attendant labor market) will materialize. \n\nWhat happens in practice? Politics-first founders hold cheery meetings with governments in low-income countries, promising them the next Hong Kong, Dubai, or Singapore. These meetings result in nothing because governments need to sense more imminence (i.e. capital raised to execute on plans) to get the bureaucratic machinery in motion. The founders can’t raise more money on a cheery meeting that resulted in no formal agreements. The first domino doesn’t fall, so neither do the rest. No city is built. \n\nBut let’s assume that politics-first founders somehow get an agreement for a special zone. Will the project succeed, i.e is the Dubai model as extensible as charter city theorists assume? Libertarian dogma blinds many politics-first founders to the brutal reality of solving cold start problems for network effects businesses. Nevada and Wyoming are effectively “charter states” when compared to California and New York, but network effects are so powerful that people rarely move, and if they do, it’s generally to an improved business environment that already has a pretty good network/labor market, e.g. Florida or Texas. Another way of framing this is that in the rank-ordered list of reasons people move somewhere, People (family, friends, community, labor market, dating market) is almost always #1, while Business Environment is at least a few slots below. Solving the labor market cold start problem is extremely hard.\n\nBut what if we try to draw people to new cities not on an economic basis, but rather on a spiritual one? Which city (or country) founding projects have succeeded that have drawn people on a predominantly non-economic, but rather spiritual basis? Among others, Israel and America. Both groups were oppressed, and sought the freedom to live by their values. Both felt the intangible pull of the frontier. Both had a keen historical instinct. This is how cities with spiritual significance are founded.\n\nIn 2019, it took a felt mandate from God to inspire people to build a city on a hill, in spite of the economic headwinds associated with building a labor market from nothing.\n\nIn 2020, deus ex machina: COVID forced us to go remote. The internet ate the labor market, giving knowledge workers the ability to access jobs from their laptops from anywhere. No longer did city builders have to build a local labor market to start a city. They could attract remote workers. This decade will usher in the Information Age city. \n\nWhere in the Industrial Age economic opportunity pulled us from the communities that imbued our lives with meaning through shared values, traditions, and metaphysical ideas, in the Information Age we will leave labor market cities and return to communities organized around shared values. \n\nThe correct approach to city building in this new world is demand-first (or as Balaji Srinivasan calls it, *Cloud City* first). We build the citizenry before the city. First, we create communities of true believers, organized around shared values, online. People move to cities for people, and it follows that if you collect a group of people who all want to live together, they’ll all move together if at a moment in time everyone else does, too. Today, we have new tools. The emergence of Web3 enables us to supercharge communities with self- ownership, governance, and determination. Once you build a community of people ready to move to a new city together, you can self-finance the entire project. With something real to offer nations, conversations with governments become productive (e.g. Gigafactory). That’s how you make the risk dominoes fall.\n\n![Interior.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fC3rmQSN0fDptniAs_s9K.jpg?height=1793&width=3830)\n\n## Praxis Today.\n\n**Praxis is a grassroots movement of modern pioneers building the city-cryptostate.** We are currently organized as a membership-based community. To help us build the city, you must join as a Member. From establishing our culture and researching ancient wonders to visiting prospective city sites and designing our urban infrastructure, every Praxis Member has a role to play in the development of our future home.\n\n**Threshold:** Before applying, we recommend that you join the Threshold. The Praxis Threshold is an open forum in our Discord server for all interested in learning about the community. There, you can interact with Members and complete Tasks for PRAX to increase your chances of admission to our Membership. Thresholders may also receive invitations to Praxis events to further interact with our community.\n\n**PRAX:** PRAX is a point-based system that Members of the community are experimenting with for the purpose of economic research. \n\n**Tasks & Demonstrations:** Tasks are a means by which Members and Thresholders can demonstrate their alignment with Praxis values. Tasks may be intellectual, artistic, and others just fun. Each Task has a corresponding PRAX reward, granted after the demonstration is approved by a member of our team. To demonstrate your completion of a Task, you must share evidence in the [#demonstration](https://discord.com/channels/813494644066877460/908746416640385054) channel. Demonstrations are your chance to prove your dedication.\n\n**Application:** You can apply to become a Member of Praxis [here](https://www.praxissociety.com/apply). Applications are evaluated by the community on the basis of the quality of the written portion in combination with the amount of PRAX you’ve received for completing tasks.\n\n**Membership:** Once you become a Member, you unlock the ability to contribute to projects that in sum, will create a city. To simplify the complex problem that is building a city, we’ve deconstructed it into eight focus Domains:\n\n* Statecraft\n* Health\n* Education\n* Environment\n* Philosophy\n* Security\n* Trade\n* Culture\n\nEach Domain has a Charter, a working thesis and vision with a moral throughline of vitality. Guided by these Charters, Members organize within Domains to undertake Projects that realize our vision. Project contributions are rewarded with both PRAX and honor.\n\nBeing a member of Praxis is akin to being a citizen of the United States. It shows that you are culturally and spiritually aligned with the community of Praxis and our ideas. Membership grants you access to private events, projects, adventures, and most importantly, the opportunity to become a resident in the new city.\n\n**Residents:** Becoming a Resident is the highest honor Praxis can award. To live and walk within the bounds of our city is a privilege earned through action and dedication. Residency is granted during a minting ceremony that only current residents may attend. For now, much of the information regarding Praxis Residency will remain a mystery to the outside world. \n\n## Final thoughts.\n\n**Unrelenting historical forces call on us to voyage to the frontier.** We were born in a time of upheaval, but we were designed for it. Over millennia, our ancestors cultivated their passions and instincts for this moment. Your ancestors prevailed; otherwise, you would not be here. Victory is in your DNA. \n\nWe will leave you with two final thoughts: \n\n* *Mysteries of Praxis (and life) are revealed to those with faith.* \n* *The oasis thrives because of the mirage.*\n\n[JOIN THE THRESHOLD](https://discord.gg/praxis)", "timestamp": 1636754242, "digest": "ZIUh2ni7rm7j7IaxyLJMtJT5KzbU9xg6P-SQbSJhHj4", "contributor": "0x7a02D50B22cC79a3dc667E80B413996b81f5ED6E"}

Solving the labor market cold start problem is extremely hard.\n\nBut what if we try to draw people to new cities not on an economic basis, but rather on a spiritual one? Which city (or country) founding projects have succeeded that have drawn people on a predominantly non-economic, but rather spiritual basis? Among others, Israel and America. Both groups were oppressed, and sought the freedom to live by their values. Both felt the intangible pull of the frontier. Both had a keen historical instinct. This is how cities with spiritual significance are founded.\n\nIn 2019, it took a felt mandate from God to inspire people to build a city on a hill, in spite of the economic headwinds associated with building a labor market from nothing.\n\nIn 2020, deus ex machina: COVID forced us to go remote. The internet ate the labor market, giving knowledge workers the ability to access jobs from their laptops from anywhere. No longer did city builders have to build a local labor market to start a city. They could attract remote workers. This decade will usher in the Information Age city.\n\nWhere in the Industrial Age economic opportunity pulled us from the communities that imbued our lives with meaning through shared values, traditions, and metaphysical ideas, in the Information Age we will leave labor market cities and return to communities organized around shared values.\n\nThe correct approach to city building in this new world is demand-first (or as Balaji Srinivasan calls it, *Cloud City* first). We build the citizenry before the city. First, we create communities of true believers, organized around shared values, online. People move to cities for people, and it follows that if you collect a group of people who all want to live together, they’ll all move together if at a moment in time everyone else does, too. Today, we have new tools. The emergence of Web3 enables us to supercharge communities with self-ownership, governance, and determination. Once you build a community of people ready to move to a new city together, you can self-finance the entire project. With something real to offer nations, conversations with governments become productive (e.g. Gigafactory). That’s how you make the risk dominoes fall.\n\n## Praxis Today.\n\n**Praxis is a grassroots movement of modern pioneers building the city-cryptostate.** We are currently organized as a membership-based community. To help us build the city, you must join as a Member. From establishing our culture and researching ancient wonders to visiting prospective city sites and designing our urban infrastructure, every Praxis Member has a role to play in the development of our future home.\n\n**Threshold:** Before applying, we recommend that you [join the Threshold](https://discord.gg/praxis). The Praxis Threshold is an open forum in our Discord server for all interested in learning about the community. There, you can interact with Members and complete Tasks for PRAX to increase your chances of admission to our Membership. Thresholders may also receive invitations to Praxis events to further interact with our community.\n\n**PRAX:** PRAX is a point-based system that Members of the community are experimenting with for the purpose of economic research.\n\n**Tasks & Demonstrations:** Tasks are a means by which Members and Thresholders can demonstrate their alignment with Praxis values. Tasks may be intellectual, artistic, and others just fun. Each Task has a corresponding PRAX reward, granted after the demonstration is approved by a member of our team. To demonstrate your completion of a Task, you must share evidence in the [#demonstration](https://discord.com/channels/813494644066877460/908746416640385054) channel. Demonstrations are your chance to prove your dedication.\n\n**Application:** You can apply to become a Member of Praxis [here](https://www.praxissociety.com/apply). Applications are evaluated by the community on the basis of the quality of the written portion in combination with the amount of PRAX you’ve received for completing tasks.\n\n**Membership:** Once you become a Member, you unlock the ability to contribute to projects that in sum, will create a city. To simplify the complex problem that is building a city, we’ve deconstructed it into eight focus Domains:\n\n* Statecraft\n* Health\n* Education\n* Environment\n* Philosophy\n* Security\n* Trade\n* Culture\n\nEach Domain has a Charter, a working thesis, and a vision with a moral throughline of vitality. Guided by these Charters, Members organize within Domains to undertake Projects that realize our vision. Project contributions are rewarded with both PRAX and honor.\n\nBeing a member of Praxis is akin to being a citizen of the United States. It shows that you are culturally and spiritually aligned with the community of Praxis and our ideas. Membership grants you access to private events, projects, adventures, and most importantly, the opportunity to become a resident in the new city.\n\n**Residents:** Becoming a Resident is the highest honor Praxis can award. To live and walk within the bounds of our city is a privilege earned through action and dedication. Residency is granted during a minting ceremony that only current residents may attend. For now, much of the information regarding Praxis Residency will remain a mystery to the outside world.\n\n## Final thoughts.\n\n**Unrelenting historical forces call on us to voyage to the frontier.** We were born in a time of upheaval, but we were designed for it. Over millennia, our ancestors cultivated their passions and instincts for this moment. Your ancestors prevailed; otherwise, you would not be here. Victory is in your DNA.\n\nWe will leave you with two final thoughts:\n\n* *Mysteries of Praxis (and life) are revealed to those with faith.*\n* *The oasis thrives because of the mirage.*\n\n**[JOIN THE THRESHOLD](https://discord.gg/praxis)**", "timestamp": 1636754931, "digest": "ZIUh2ni7rm7j7IaxyLJMtJT5KzbU9xg6P-SQbSJhHj4", "contributor": "0x7a02D50B22cC79a3dc667E80B413996b81f5ED6E"}

Or, check which POAPs you (or an acquaintance) possess here. As you can see, POAP is an amazing project which has some great use cases and an enticing allure.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sujx8jQQakimDC12C7VSA.png?height=324&width=396)\n\n# Community Registry: A POAP Marketplace\n\nThis all brings us to the next question, and possibly the most relevant in the context of district0x: A POAP marketplace?\n\nSince it becomes apparent that POAPs will be increasingly used as keys in this new web3 paradigm, we could argue that a marketplace to discover these keys is all but inevitable.\n\nWhen one uses Airbnb, there is a marketplace of available locations to search from and find the location that best fits a given scenario. When a user is hungry and pulls up DoorDash or UberEats, they are given a marketplace of available restaurants within the service area of that user. When users wish to see what there is to do in a given region, they can pull up Yelp, Google Maps, TripAdvisor - to name a few - and again, search a registry to find suitable results. The same should be true for decentralized applications!\n\nEnter district0x. To quote district0x themselves:\n\n> Districts are decentralized applications, marketplaces and communities that exist as non-custodial, censorship-resistant dapps in the district0x Network.\n\nThe use case I really envision is referred to as a TCR — a Token Curated Registry. A TCR is a way to create a decentralized marketplace, or registry, of entities maintained (curated) by the community itself. This is done through votes and participation, much like a DAO. Community members themselves would be responsible for ensuring the integrity of the registry by voting in acceptable entities and voting out unacceptable entities. The best part, this can be accomplished in an incentivized manner! I’ll not go into more detail about a TCR, for that warrants an entire article itself, but for more information you can [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlQgBYsXhds).\n\nI imagine a community marketplace treated as a decentralized common location where users can easily search for available POAPs. This marketplace would be maintained by the community such that spam POAPs would be voted out, legitimate POAPs could be voted in, and users could feel secure in searching for meaningful POAPs available to them at any specific time or location without worrying about spam, fake, or dangerous POAPs (think POAPs that entice a user to go to a dangerous back alley where few people are around…).\n\nSuch a feature would enable users to search for upcoming venues such as concerts, conventions, festivals, etc. Users would be able to find things to do using decentralized dApps and earn POAP badges at the same time!\n\nUsers would be able to travel foreign cities and find popular tourist attractions, famous film locations, or favorite restaurants — all using decentralized, censorship-resistant applications and registries anywhere in the world.\n\nTo me, district0x seems to be well equipped and experienced in developing such a marketplace. They have already developed the tools for such a community, as the District0x Registry is exactly that, a TCR! Developing a fully decentralized and non-custodial marketplace for available POAPs, with 0 fees and no central authority, is essential to allowing POAPs to flourish in the decentralized economy — characteristics that are deeply rooted in district0x’s team and ethos (as they have proven with NameBazaar.io and MemeFactory.io). We should note that district0x’s record of developing such infrastructure is second to none.\n\nDeveloping a marketplace for POAP NFTs could be on the radar for district0x, as it seems like this rapidly developing proof of attendance model is gaining traction and quickly finding new use cases in the real world. POAPs could soon be used in music and gaming, which would open floodgates to whole new market segments. With the right strategy, a POAP district could bring new purpose to the network, to discover ‘attendance’. Are we there yet? Not sure. Will we get there eventually? Probably. Should we anticipate it? Definitely!\n\nThank you for reading, I hope this article has brought you one step closer to understanding web3, and the developing token economy!\n\nPS — [Congratulations on getting this far, please DM on Twitter to receive the POAP below](https://twitter.com/grasponcrypto).

I wish there was a better way.\n\nSouvenir, meet web3. I speak of no other than [POAP — The bookmarks of your life](https://poap.xyz). POAPs are free for all and easy to generate.\n\nSo, why not keep souvenirs of your events, experiences, accomplishments, and your adventures in digital form?! Stored on the blockchain (and likely increasing usage of IPFS, or SWARM, but thats another topic!) these digital souvenir collectibles take up no space, collect no dust, and go everywhere with you. Not only can POAP serve as a souvenir collection, something you can rifle through later and recall the pleasant memories and experiences of your past, but they can also serve as gateways. Perhaps earning you entries into private clubs, or advanced seminars which require previous knowledge and attendance. They can serve as gatekeepers, allowing you to secure your own events, chats, servers, etc by only allowing an elite few in possession of whichever prized POAP(s) you decide warrant acceptance into your club.\n\nPOAPs are an NFT minted on XDAI, which provide proof for pretty much anything the author wishes.\n\nSo far I have seen POAPs as proof of:\n\n* Attendance — [Eth Denver](https://poap.gallery/event/856)\n* [Effort](https://poap.gallery/event/6376)— [@logic_beach](http://twitter.com/logic_beach)’s Proof of Effort in making the world a cleaner place: [#POAPcleanUp](https://twitter.com/hashtag/POAPcleanUp?src=hashtag_click)\n* [Knowledge](https://poap.gallery/event/399) — Completed [@unvetica](http://twitter.com/unvetica)’s [Ethereum Studymaster ](https://ethereumstudymaster.com/)course\n* [Achievement](https://poap.gallery/event/6470) — [Completed critical upgrade to geth 1.10.8](https://ethstaker.cc/urgent-update-your-geth-node-from-v-1-10-7-to-v1-10-8/)\n\nPOAPs for everything & everyone\n\nAnyone can create their own ‘proof of’, aka souvenir. POAP, as stated previously, is free for everyone, and easy to work with. This means the barrier of entry is low, a rare treat in the web3 world we all know and… love(love/hate? I digress). Anyone can create a POAP for distribution by visiting [POAPs Create Event](https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events/new).\n\nName your POAP, provide a description, upload a small png image, and fill out a few other fields, then click Save. Once approved, you will receive an email with instructions on how to distribute your POAP! Hint, make sure you check your attachments. There are several ways to distribute your newly generated POAPs. You can distribute manually, via discord bot, and there is even a reddit bot as well. Essentially you receive a list of unique urls which are distributed and, ultimately, used to claim.\n\nThats great and all, but what else can be done with POAP? Well, I’m glad you asked. POAP is really just an NFT. So the possibilities are many, and I believe most have not even been dreamed up yet.\n\nSome of the current use cases are:\n\n* [Raffle entries](https://poap.fun/)\n* [Event entries](https://twitter.com/poapxyz/status/1458842796446654467?s=20) — ticket sales and zoom meetings distributed only to users who possess a POAP\n* [Chat (think Discord) gateways](https://poap.chat/) — for private/privileged chats or channels\n* [Sybil Resistant votes](https://poap.vote/)\n* [Community Art](https://app.poap.art/)\n\nImagine concerts where the band allows owners of a POAP earned from attending one of their original concerts to go back stage, further rewarding their earliest supporters and giving back.\n\nImagine games where users could earn different objects, levels or attributes based on POAPs they possess. Unique characters only available to users who Possess a POAP obtained from accomplishing tasks in a previous game. The possibilities are many.\n\nFinally, you can peruse available POAPs here. Or, check which POAPs you (or an acquaintance) possess here. As you can see, POAP is an amazing project which has some great use cases and an enticing allure.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sujx8jQQakimDC12C7VSA.png?height=324&width=396)\n\n# Community Registry: A POAP Marketplace\n\nThis all brings us to the next question, and possibly the most relevant in the context of district0x: A POAP marketplace?\n\nSince it becomes apparent that POAPs will be increasingly used as keys in this new web3 paradigm, we could argue that a marketplace to discover these keys is all but inevitable.\n\nWhen one uses Airbnb, there is a marketplace of available locations to search from and find the location that best fits a given scenario. When a user is hungry and pulls up DoorDash or UberEats, they are given a marketplace of available restaurants within the service area of that user. When users wish to see what there is to do in a given region, they can pull up Yelp, Google Maps, TripAdvisor - to name a few - and again, search a registry to find suitable results. The same should be true for decentralized applications!\n\nEnter district0x. To quote district0x themselves:\n\n> Districts are decentralized applications, marketplaces and communities that exist as non-custodial, censorship-resistant dapps in the district0x Network.\n\nThe use case I really envision is referred to as a TCR — a Token Curated Registry. A TCR is a way to create a decentralized marketplace, or registry, of entities maintained (curated) by the community itself. This is done through votes and participation, much like a DAO. Community members themselves would be responsible for ensuring the integrity of the registry by voting in acceptable entities and voting out unacceptable entities. The best part, this can be accomplished in an incentivized manner! I’ll not go into more detail about a TCR, for that warrants an entire article itself, but for more information you can [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlQgBYsXhds).\n\nI imagine a community marketplace treated as a decentralized common location where users can easily search for available POAPs. This marketplace would be maintained by the community such that spam POAPs would be voted out, legitimate POAPs could be voted in, and users could feel secure in searching for meaningful POAPs available to them at any specific time or location without worrying about spam, fake, or dangerous POAPs (think POAPs that entice a user to go to a dangerous back alley where few people are around…).\n\nSuch a feature would enable users to search for upcoming venues such as concerts, conventions, festivals, etc. Users would be able to find things to do using decentralized dApps and earn POAP badges at the same time!\n\nUsers would be able to travel foreign cities and find popular tourist attractions, famous film locations, or favorite restaurants — all using decentralized, censorship-resistant applications and registries anywhere in the world.\n\nTo me, district0x seems to be well equipped and experienced in developing such a marketplace. They have already developed the tools for such a community, as the District0x Registry is exactly that, a TCR! Developing a fully decentralized and non-custodial marketplace for available POAPs, with 0 fees and no central authority, is essential to allowing POAPs to flourish in the decentralized economy — characteristics that are deeply rooted in district0x’s team and ethos (as they have proven with NameBazaar.io and MemeFactory.io). We should note that district0x’s record of developing such infrastructure is second to none.\n\nDeveloping a marketplace for POAP NFTs could be on the radar for district0x, as it seems like this rapidly developing proof of attendance model is gaining traction and quickly finding new use cases in the real world. POAPs could soon be used in music and gaming, which would open floodgates to whole new market segments. With the right strategy, a POAP district could bring new purpose to the network, to discover ‘attendance’. Are we there yet? Not sure. Will we get there eventually? Probably. Should we anticipate it? Definitely!\n\nThank you for reading, I hope this article has brought you one step closer to understanding web3, and the developing token economy!\n\nPS — [Congratulations on getting this far, please DM on Twitter to receive the POAP below](https://twitter.com/grasponcrypto). (I know, I know, how archaic! Unfortunately POAP has become so popular, farmers have been sweeping automated distribution mechanisms clean of all available POAPs — so please forgive me and the [POAP](https://medium.com/u/6267d2edc9d5?source=post_page-----2491afc4b8fb-----------------------------------) team while they navigate these rough waters).\n\n[GraspOnCrypto](https://twitter.com/grasponcrypto)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L0tCJhLNiELMmDrZzqjgv.jpg?height=500&width=500)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636756984, "digest": "WyRiKILdaCen2tetlr68dJ7zntbZz83vcG8cNQAx8wc", "contributor": "0xE8332043e54A2470e148f0c1ac0AF188d9D46524"}

We will achieve this by using one of the most important art series as membership, upon which we will create long-term value for generative art in a fun, inclusive manner.\n\nSquiggleDAO’s mission is simple:\n\n* Acquire as many Chromie Squiggles as possible\n* Generate as much Squiggle culture as possible\n\n## Why?\n\nArt and culture are two sides of the same coin. History has shown that artists who capture mindshare during important culture epochs ultimately end up defining that time period. We believe we are in the early stages of a new cultural epoch, and that the art of this time period will be stored on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\\*“The paradox of the art market is that objects created for personal and contemplative aesthetic enjoyment are connected to the broader social fabric through an economic transaction.” — \\**<https://som.yale.edu/news/2016/06/history-of-the-art-market-in-35-record-breaking-sales>*\n\n## Who We Are\n\nWe are you. We are art collectors, artists, techo-centric dreamers from all walks of life that enjoy digital art and believe in decentralized decision-making. We believe that art is one of the most important aspects of human expression and that a world with more art in it is a better world.\n\nThe genesis team:\n\n@tripleg\n\n@thattallguy\n\n@jonas\n\n@quickrider\n\n@carlosgomes\n\n## How does this work? How do I participate?\n\n## Community Membership\n\nIt’s easy! If you own a Squiggle of any type, you’re already a member! Come and join the Discord [here](https://discord.gg/NjBWGKVkEr) (and find your way into Squiggle Square):\n\nNote: You can buy Squiggles on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/assets/art-blocks?search%5BsortAscending%5D=true&search%5BsortBy%5D=PRICE&search%5BstringTraits%5D%5B0%5D%5Bname%5D=Chromie%20Squiggle&search%5BstringTraits%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalues%5D%5B0%5D=All%20Chromie%20Squiggles)\n\n*As of SDIP-8 you can also join the DAO with 1000 SQUIG tokens, our governance token.*\n\n## What are Chromie Squiggles?\n\nChromie Squiggles is the first generative art project launched on Art Blocks, the first blockchain-based generative art platform. Both Chromie Squiggles and Art Blocks were created by a zombie named Snowfro.\n\nThere are only 10,000 Chromie Squiggles that can ever be minted. Currently, around 9,100 Chromie Squiggles have been uniquely minted into existence.\n\nChromie Squiggles are no longer available to mint for purchase on Art Blocks. The last 900 Chromie Squiggles are reserved for individuals who help further the goals of the Art Blocks community.\n\nHowever, Chromie Squiggles can be purchased in secondary markets, like OpenSea.\n\n## What is on-chain generative art?\n\nTo create an on-chain generative art project like Chromie Squiggles, a generative artist will create a script with variables, upload that script to the blockchain, and set a maximum mint number. When collectors mint a token, that token will contain a random hash that populates variable values, and creates unique generative artwork.\n\nFor example — today each Chromie Squiggle represents a unique generative art piece. No two Chromie Squiggles are the same, although some share certain characteristics with one another.\n\nIn this way, all 10,000 Chromie Squiggles are the same. And all 10,000 Chromie Squiggles are different.\n\n## What is Art Blocks?\n\nArt Blocks is a first of its kind platform focused on genuinely programmable on demand generative content that is stored immutably on the Ethereum Blockchain. You pick a style that you like, pay for the work, and a randomly generated version of the content is created by an algorithm and sent to your Ethereum account. The resulting piece might be a static image, 3D model, or an interactive experience. Each output is different and there are endless possibilities for the types of content that can be created on the platform.\n\nChromie Squiggles was the first generative art project launched on Art Blocks in 2020.", "timestamp": 1636757638, "digest": "Lm3LRM79z0R9wVcB2yY8S61O0jyuEznIzpxhhewk-DY", "contributor": "0x627841b158a982660C0557e671946E795Ccb5533"}

The root are strong, it grows skyward.” — The Founding Scrolls*\n\nFrom the Interim Governing Council \n #1 — Squiggle Square \n Squiggledom, The Internet.\n\n**Re: A community, empowered**\n\n## Round 1 Recap: 367,400 SQUIG to be distributed\n\nThe DAOs initial mission of becoming the largest generative-art DAO took a huge step forward this week as the community donated beautiful squiggles to the treasury. Here are some stats from the event:\n\n* 80 DAO members donated a squiggle to the Treasury\n* The Treasury now has 101 Squiggles with an estimated value of 140ETH\n* 367,400 SQUIG will be distributed to contributors. This brings the total community distribution to 975,400 SQUIG or \\~10% of the total supply.\n\n## Snowfro live minting event: We got a HyperBold!\n\nThe snowfro mint event was a huge success — not only did a lot people show up but the stars aligned and a fresh HyberBold was minted to the treasury! This is the second-rarest Squiggle type with only 7 ever minted.\n\n## Next Steps: Handing off to SQUIG holders\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1224/1\\*4_pY1NAzvaxMoc7LenVGyA.jpeg)\n\ncredit to ryanio, a community member\n\nWe are rapidly approaching the optimal point of hand-off but there are a few more key steps your Interim Governing Council needs to complete:\n\n## Distribute Round 1 SQUIG tokens\n\nWe’re reviewing all donations to ensure they were eligible and once that is complete, SQUIG tokens will be distributed. Expect this to happen in the next few days.\n\n## Complete Round 2 of the Treasury Contribution Program\n\nRound two will operate similarly to Round 1 but some key differences. The reason behind limiting Round 1 the way we did was to ensure that anyone that wanted to contribute to the Treasury would have an opportunity to do so. The second is completely open so that new members and partners can participate:\n\n1. This round is open to anyone, not just SQUIG holders\n2. There is no limit to the amount of Squiggles that can be donated\n3. 5% of SQUIG will be allocated PLUS the remaining SQUIG allocated to Round 1 (approx. 1.4%)\n\n**We will launch this as a separate post with detailed instructions in the next few days.**\n\n## Standing up Governance 1.0 Framework\n\nA framework for Governance 1.0 will be launching on Gitbook in the next few days. This will be the playbook for managing operational elements of the DAO with actual decision-making being deployed via our Snapshot instance.\n\nIf you are over the 10,000 SQUIG threshold due to your donation, congrats! You will be able to propose actions for the DAO that the community can review. If you don’t have this privilege, don’t worry. You can also connect with those who do have proposal rights and ask them to do so on your behalf. We’re hoping to have delegation functionality in the future.\n\n## Seeding the DAO with strategic Proposals\n\nTo ensure the continuation of this incredible momentum, we have a few strategic proposals that we feel will .

Our intention was to run this for a week which would give ample time for new community members to join, check out the DAO, and contribute.\n\nFast forward 24hrs and the round was over-allocated!\n\nWe originally allocated 632,600 SQUIG (5% plus leftovers from Round 1) but as donations came rolling in, we realised we were going to exceed that limit. **Upon close, 857,400 SQUIG had been allocated to donations, an excess of 224,800 SQUIG.** As a DAO, we now need to decide what to do about this over-allocation:\n\n1. Do we stick with a 632,600 SQUIG allocation and return any subsequent donations at the DAOs expense?\n2. Do we accept all donations and simply distribute the additional 224,800 SQUIG?\n\nLet’s take a look at the data:\n\n## Current Treasury Status\n\n* 231 Squiggles have been donated to the DAO\n* Estimated Treasury value of 325 ETH (excluding SQUIG)\n* SQUIG Distribution:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*6kJG1BPXcZIpULUG6v-Htw.png)\n\nSQUIG Distribution, including Round 2 + excess\n\n## Squiggle Contributions by Type\n\nThe vast majority of contributions were Standard and Tier 2–3 squiggles but we saw some incredible rares donated as well: 5 Full Spectrums and another Hyper, signalling real support for the DAO. Full Spectrum donations were also the best SQUIG/$ contribution so it’s no surprise that there was a lot of interest here.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*C-B-GVzP2Z2zcv7eMM6Pnw.png)\n\nRound 2 squiggle contributions by type\n\n## The vast majority of Round 2 contributions came from Round 1 contributors\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*xJWoC6k5Kyu7n9ytyhq2cw.png)\n\nThere were a few notable contributions from new members (one wallet donated 29 Squiggles!) but the vast majority came from early participants in the DAO. This clearly signals that we have a strong, dedicated community backing the organization.\n\n## Our distribution program is working\n\nWhen we first launched the SQUIG token, the Genesis Team members were given 50% of their allocated supply (5%) or 100,000 SQUIG each. This enabled us to stand up the Snapshot instance among other things.\n\nClearly this is not decentralized so SQUIG distribution became our #1 priority. It appears to be working well!\n\n## 588 community members now control 60% of the vote\n\nThanks to the Airdrop and the Contribution programs, there are now 593 SQUIG token holders. With roughly 2.2M SQUIG distributed after Round 2, that means approximately 64%(1.4M) of the floating SQUIG supply now belongs to community members outside of the Genesis team.\n\n## 70% of Proposer rights belong to non-Genesis Team members\n\nProposing an initiative within the DAO requires 10,000 SQUIG and as of Round 2 there will be 17 users with this right. This means that 70% of Proposer rights now lie outside of the Genesis Team.\n\nYou’ll be able to monitor this on-chain once Round 2 distribution is resolved: <https://etherscan.io/token/0x373acda15ce392362e4b46ed97a7feecd7ef9eb8#balances>\n\n## TLDR\n\n* There are 593 SQUIG token holders, holding 22% of the SQUIG supply\n* The Treasury estimated value is 325 ETH (excluding SQUIG)\n* SQUIG distribution is working: The Genesis Team no longer has majority influence over the DAO\n\n## Next Steps: SDIP#1\n\nAs an immediate next step, the DAO needs to decide what to do with the over-allocated Round 2. This will be the first opportunity for SQUIG holders to exercise their vote on Snapshot so keep an eye on the Discord as we’ll be launching this Proposal very soon.\n\nDiscord: <https://discord.gg/NjBWGKVkEr>\n\nSnapshot: <https://snapshot.org/#/squiggledao.eth/>", "timestamp": 1636758681, "digest": "h_1PO49eR5lt9O8OxHhm5N1-P83Juag8Xhnwx5TL16Q", "contributor": "0x627841b158a982660C0557e671946E795Ccb5533"}

At its inception, Chromie Squiggles were used to gain membership into the DAO due to the relatively low cost of a Chromie Squiggle at the time and to signal a commitment to the art, which is foundational to the DAO’s core mission.\n\nFast forward a few months and Chromie Squiggles are over $45,000 USD! This rapid growth in price greatly limits who can join and contribute to the DAO under the current membership format. What started as a low barrier to entry has become a very high one, creating challenges for the DAO to bring in new talent.\n\n## **An opportunity to join the SquiggleDAO**\n\nFaced with this challenge, the SquiggleDAO identified an immediate solution; we are introducing a Scholarship program. The Scholarship program is a DAO-curated gateway for non-Squiggle holders to join the DAO and have the equivalent membership as those who own a Chromie Squiggle.\n\n## **What does a SquiggleDAO scholarship do for me?**\n\nA SquiggleDAO scholarship will get you the “Squiggle Scholar” role in the SquiggleDAO Discord. This gets you past the Squiggle-Gate and will allow you to fully participate in the DAO. Activities include joining committees, participating in weekly calls, completing bounties, or just hanging out in Squiggle Square. The program is designed to bring individuals with great ideas and high levels of talent into the DAO to collaborate with the community and continue to build toward the DAO’s mission, whether it is pitching an idea to the DAO or stepping up to claim a project bounty in the DAO’s public #jobs-and-bounties Discord Channel.\n\nThe program is officially live today! If you have the ability and motivation to make a meaningful contribution to the DAO we would love to hear from you.\n\n## **So, how do I apply for a SquiggleDAO scholarship?**\n\nSimply fill out and submit [this](https://forms.gle/PgTtjYvTag1vR27g8) form.

Credit has always existed (and predates payments) between people but in an informal way. As in, “I mowed your lawn, so you owe me.”\n\nCredit, debt and payment in currency became formalized the moment people began to trade. This formalization became ever more developed as more people traded with more unfamiliar parties.\n\n**Credit monetization of claims possible with NFTs**\n\nIf I monetize a credit created as in the above invoice, I have financed (bought from the issuing creditor) an unpaid invoice for the benefit of that creditor. I have given liquidity, or cash-flow, to that erstwhile creditor such that he/she may have working capital to continue to produce.\n\nMonetization of credit is distinct from credit creation, which is also distinct from payments. All three actions serve to ‘grease the wheels of commerce’.\n\n“Throughout the colonial period, British merchants provided the credit that fueled trade between England, Scotland, and the American colonies. Although using a number of financial instruments — bills of exchange, notes, bonds, and book credit — it was the element of trust, based upon honest information between merchants, individuals, and families, that glued together this vast mercantile credit system.” (See link: The History of Credit in America.)\n\nA first step to any credit creation is standardized and trusted documentation. The **BullaNetwork protocol** creates the basic documentation of debt (and its mirror, credit) on-chain. As one person’s credit is another’s debt on a shared blockchain, we can generally call the product of the BullaNetwork protocol a **contingent claims token**. Further, as this contingent claims token will share structure, but vary in detail, it would qualify as a ‘non-fungible’ token (NFT).\n\nThe final mouthful of the above paragraph: **BullaNetwork protocol mints contingent claims NFTs. **These tokens could be the “honest information between merchants, individuals, and families,…” required for credit creation and future monetization.\n\nContingent claims NFTs are useful by themselves. We can use these tokens to bill people or to transact future commerce on-chain.\n\nAbove, however, I alluded to credit monetization. Standardized, contingent claims NFTs are a first step. We need a next element to monetize, and, as it is with all things blockchain and commerce, this next element is trust.\n\nWe can trust that what is on a blockchain ledger is immutable and that any contingent claim NFT minted on such a ledger in which parties share a history of settled past NFT claims to be somewhat ‘trustworthy.’ Pervasive use of claims NFTs would give, among other things, credit histories for all parties attached to various other contingent claims NFTs. We would be able to determine, given the history of a party, if a claim against that party was spurious, probable or unknown. A good record of claims having been honored would be available, and the price at which some contingent credits NFT might be offered (vs. par value) would strongly indicate best ‘money good’.\n\nOf course, in the end, whom to trust must include off-chain data, but the coming on-chain transparency of a system of contingent claims NFTs gives crypto credit creation and finance a new frontier.\n\nBelow I snapshot a few watershed moments s from the history of business credit excerpted from the Oxford Research Encyclopedias\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/480/0\\*m733BLz1mqCIiLjx)\n\n[**The History of Credit in America**](https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-625#acrefore-9780199329175-e-625-div1-1)\n\n[*The United States is a nation built on credit, both public and private.

The added benefit to on-chain credit/monetization will not be limited to more transparency, auditability, speed, democratization and lower cost friction.\n\nHmm, now what rhymes with contingent claims NFT?\n", "timestamp": 1636762809, "digest": "qn2lMc7avDzDcRtj2QhGO10PDkvH8YYgSSy9XZsj6zM", "contributor": "0x89e03E7980C92fd81Ed3A9b72F5c73fDf57E5e6D"}

Muitas pessoas hoje em dia têm a percepção que a inflação é simplesmente o aumento do preço vindo dos grandes empresários, porém isso é uma visão incorreta, a inflação é nada mais nada menos que a desvalorização do poder de compra, decorrente da baixa demanda da moeda em relação a quantidade de moedas existentes.**\n\n**Como podemos nos proteger dessa inflação? Existem algumas maneiras, a mais simples de todas seria fazer investimentos ligados a índices inflacionários, como por exemplo, um tesouro IPCA+; Outros métodos que podemos utilizar para nos proteger da inflação é se tornar sócio, por meio da bolsa de valores, de empresas que conseguem rapidamente repassar a inflação para o consumidor, como empresas de saneamento, alimentação, produtos que são fundamentais e básicos para viver; Além dessas duas também existe a proteção por meio de imoveis, imóveis tendem a sempre repassar, no mínimo, a inflação. Hoje no Brasil vemos um momento propício para realizarmos investimentos nessa classe de ativos quando comparamos os imóveis brasileiros com os dos outros países nesse momento pós pandemia ocorreu-se um grande descolamento na valorização dos imóveis em outros países do mundo, como por exemplo a Turquia que, durante o primeiro trimestre de 2020 até o primeiro de 2021, o preço dos imóveis se valorizaram em mais de 32%, fazendo dela a primeira do ranking, enquanto no Brasil essa valorização foi de um valor de apenas 4%, o que nos leva a acreditar, que, no Brasil, há uma grande chance de uma potencial valorização dos imóveis no futuro.**\n\n**(<https://content.knightfrank.com/research/84/documents/en/global-house-price-index-q1-2021-8146.pdf>)**\n\n**Vale sempre lembrar que estar exposto ao mercado da renda variável é uma ótima maneira de proteger seu dinheiro, desde que saibamos onde alocar corretamente o nosso capital. Hoje podemos dizer, que corremos mais risco não estando alocado no mercado da renda variável do que estando alocados nele, comparados com quem não investe. Se pegarmos o índice ibovespa, dolarizado, desde sua criação  nós conseguimos perceber que quem está investindo para o longo prazo, em boas empresas ou fundos imobiliários, vão conseguir atingir um bom resultado, como mostra o gráfico a seguir, desde 1965 o índice oscilou bastante porém mesmo com altas e baixas a tendência é se manter em relação ao dólar.**\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1636762950, "digest": "q5Hr-2zNc26ll6INDHXQCl6Syxl9609MZb_2oR0zVP4", "contributor": "0xc774406f358c01709b36Fad3bCd89e5bAcE7fA77"}

[$BTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=cashtag_click) 的话，FIB 0.32也就是5.1K至5.3K几乎是极限了（注意：不是说会跌到，恰好相反，而是即使跌到，牛市只会更稳），今天我从链上数据、重要指标等各层面进行全景式解析当前局势，供参考。\n\n2) BTC的交易所自2020年以来持续下降，其中只在519时有轻微增长，目前仍然呈下降趋势。存入交易所的BTC没有明显变化，而上一次大牛市，如图中箭头处，数十倍于平时数量的BTC流入了交易所。因此，目前交易所动向上面一切正常。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cJ5MKYax6qcBNGSbCB9Wy.png?height=806&width=1526)\n\n3）而 [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) 的资金流向趋势上则更加明显，交易所余额自牛市开启以来，呈现断崖式下跌。因为从去年起，大量ETH被持续提出交易所。大于32个ETH的地址数量在2019年时达到高峰，并在本轮牛市于去年开始时，不断卖出，直到今年6月见底了——任何在2019年买入ETH的人，他们会在这一轮上涨中获得恐怖收益。\n\n![ETH交易所余额不断下降](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1c0mXfobG5FXH9pQi-Iid.png?height=897&width=1535)\n\n![ETH提币情况自2020年以来不断增长，近期趋缓](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GFRMflhV5HXqkXkvAXhlq.png?height=803&width=1518)\n\n![大于32个ETH的地址自牛市开始时卖出，近期见底](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u3Ie0ztLgVPmNCzFMt1qD.png?height=815&width=1528)\n\n4） [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) 的熊市持有者，一直拿到牛市上涨，从2000到4000的过程中，出货较多。尤其是在519风暴到来之后，继续大量出货，十分合理。而在牛市重启后，ETH持币地址正在缓慢回升——考虑到现在的币价如此高企，回升速度已经不错了。到底是什么力量在推高币价？散户参与DeFI和NFT或GameFi?恐怕都不是，见下条\n\n5） [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) 持币地址大于1万的数量创下自2017年大牛市以来新高，而且增长时间点就在图中箭头处，也就是本轮牛市开启之际。但对比着看会更有趣，再依次看持币数量 几千个以及几百个的图，这个群体主要是早期大佬和矿工，他们越涨越慢，不过不要被K线误导，实际上数量仅是7200个减少到6300个。\n\n![ETH巨鲸地址增长！](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_iZOzCDnjh3X8qNM---3w.png?height=812&width=1523)\n\n![ETH矿工势倍见底](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rYgI3sfJ6L_BFDkfHD7YF.png?height=803&width=1516)\n\n![小散户势售见底](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_VW2wo7Uqe7WXQX5tkuUh.png?height=816&width=1525)\n\n6） [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) 上面已经展示了大机构的买买买，那么，再看看散户的操作，上一条推已经展示持币数百的地址数量从去年10月的52000个减少到4.2K。而持币数量为几十的地址从去年10月的29万个减少到519时的26万个。但是自519之后，就开始持续稳健增长，一路已经来到28万个。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iussiBLQ-t8cRYmeXRBt6.png?height=816&width=1508)\n\n7）简言之，BTC和ETH都在519之后，呈现巨鲸持币地址数量稳健增长的情况。持有1万个BTC的地址在2020年以来不断出货，但在近期比特币创下新高时竟然开始小幅增长。而持币几千的地址同样卖卖卖，如下图，牛市开始，他们开卖，比特币第一次冲上6万时，他们开始猛烈抛售，519之后，目前数量回到了牛市启动时\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/r9I9QlVnkNww2861Lpg4z.png?height=807&width=1511)\n\n8）当大户都没有币可以卖了，当机构开始加仓了，那么比特币的上涨就已经是一个大概率事件。我们再看看衍生品市场。资金费率在这一轮下跌中，保持平衡，空头情绪没有什么增长，而贪婪情绪仍然非常良好，处于新高之中——共识经由下跌检验！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PbGBDkEukaMJV6qNne3H1.png?height=1136&width=1406)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ifYqTM1cipEXX0Wz3n-7H.png?height=605&width=1402)\n\n9)

月底能不能上98K，看几组指标；一是BTC泡沫指标，综合了舆论热度，网络活跃度、交易热度等综合数据，绿色为泡沫，黄色为价格，绿色偏离黄色越远，则泡沫越大，很明显，现在照指标“一点泡沫都还没有”。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5hFmoHCGDF12V2izb7yNk.png?height=1367&width=1363)\n\n10）再看神奇的PI指标（历史上用此指标逃顶，每次精确在3天以内），其原理是用111天MA均线和350天均线的倍数相交关系（PS：这和大宇交易系统中双均线战法原理相通用进，有兴趣可以去我没管频道看专门视频）来判断牛熊转折。使用上，当看到红线上穿绿线时，牛市来到了顶点，无一例外！现在很安全！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ax9PNBEui7F29Y8NObkfj.png?height=589&width=1414)\n\n11）再看对数增长模型， [$BTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=cashtag_click) 价格增长15万附近到达本轮高点，现在6万不值一提，此前每轮预测极为准确； 再看200周移动平均热力图，当出现绿色时，需要观察是否有见顶可能（变红），如果变红，则是出售的好时机（最好不要清空）；上一轮6万出现绿色，而下跌过后，行情健康了，现在还未翻绿！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Czp4ZudWLQR5u5nrwn45f.png?height=601&width=1379)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mBMJmleDZultsGh5JMsaI.png?height=580&width=1397)\n\n**币圈必备网址及最强工具**\n\n以下内容大多需翻墙，不会的请参阅[《大宇一本通》](https://matters.news/@BTCdayu/%E6%96%B0%E4%BA%BA%E6%B7%B7%E5%B8%81%E5%9C%88%E4%B9%B0%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88-%E6%80%8E%E4%B9%88%E4%B9%B0-%E6%80%8E%E4%B9%88%E5%AF%BB%E6%89%BE%E6%9C%89%E7%94%A8%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF-%E4%B8%80%E6%96%87%E6%95%99%E4%BC%9A-bafyreieb3u4n2lfoc5hnt2zgjr4vlhcj53bvhkvtgomgxjqk6csjoe3qxy)\n\n**一、免费VPN：**[1.蓝灯](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern)；2.[VPNgate](https://www.vpngate.net/)  [视频](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nzQo9qGaKY)教程

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3Ea9s8FSJ02-y9mzNIS9z.png?height=634&width=1078)\n\n经历519的利空之后，市场已经经过了极大考验，几乎任何利空都无法阻挡牛市继续，因此，当前的震荡下跌，参考 [$BTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=cashtag_click) 的话，FIB 0.32也就是5.1K至5.3K几乎是极限了（注意：不是说会跌到，恰好相反，而是即使跌到，牛市只会更稳），今天我从链上数据、重要指标等各层面进行全景式解析当前局势，供参考。\n\nBTC的交易所自2020年以来持续下降，其中只在519时有轻微增长，目前仍然呈下降趋势。存入交易所的BTC没有明显变化，而上一次大牛市，如图中箭头处，数十倍于平时数量的BTC流入了交易所。因此，目前交易所动向上面一切正常。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cJ5MKYax6qcBNGSbCB9Wy.png?height=806&width=1526)\n\n而 [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) 的资金流向趋势上则更加明显，交易所余额自牛市开启以来，呈现断崖式下跌。因为从去年起，大量ETH被持续提出交易所。大于32个ETH的地址数量在2019年时达到高峰，并在本轮牛市于去年开始时，不断卖出，直到今年6月见底了——任何在2019年买入ETH的人，他们会在这一轮上涨中获得恐怖收益。\n\n![ETH交易所余额不断下降](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1c0mXfobG5FXH9pQi-Iid.png?height=897&width=1535)\n\n![ETH提币情况自2020年以来不断增长，近期趋缓](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GFRMflhV5HXqkXkvAXhlq.png?height=803&width=1518)\n\n![大于32个ETH的地址自牛市开始时卖出，近期见底](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u3Ie0ztLgVPmNCzFMt1qD.png?height=815&width=1528)\n\n [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) 的熊市持有者，一直拿到牛市上涨，从2000到4000的过程中，出货较多。尤其是在519风暴到来之后，继续大量出货，十分合理。而在牛市重启后，ETH持币地址正在缓慢回升——考虑到现在的币价如此高企，回升速度已经不错了。到底是什么力量在推高币价？散户参与DeFI和NFT或GameFi?恐怕都不是，见下条\n\n [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) 持币地址大于1万的数量创下自2017年大牛市以来新高，而且增长时间点就在图中箭头处，也就是本轮牛市开启之际。但对比着看会更有趣，再依次看持币数量 几千个以及几百个的图，这个群体主要是早期大佬和矿工，他们越涨越慢，不过不要被K线误导，实际上数量仅是7200个减少到6300个。\n\n![ETH巨鲸地址增长！](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_iZOzCDnjh3X8qNM---3w.png?height=812&width=1523)\n\n![ETH矿工势倍见底](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rYgI3sfJ6L_BFDkfHD7YF.png?height=803&width=1516)\n\n![小散户势售见底](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_VW2wo7Uqe7WXQX5tkuUh.png?height=816&width=1525)\n\n6 [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) 上面已经展示了大机构的买买买，那么，再看看散户的操作，上一条推已经展示持币数百的地址数量从去年10月的52000个减少到4.2K。而持币数量为几十的地址从去年10月的29万个减少到519时的26万个。但是自519之后，就开始持续稳健增长，一路已经来到28万个。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iussiBLQ-t8cRYmeXRBt6.png?height=816&width=1508)\n\n7）简言之，BTC和ETH都在519之后，呈现巨鲸持币地址数量稳健增长的情况。持有1万个BTC的地址在2020年以来不断出货，但在近期比特币创下新高时竟然开始小幅增长。而持币几千的地址同样卖卖卖，如下图，牛市开始，他们开卖，比特币第一次冲上6万时，他们开始猛烈抛售，519之后，目前数量回到了牛市启动时\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/r9I9QlVnkNww2861Lpg4z.png?height=807&width=1511)\n\n当大户都没有币可以卖了，当机构开始加仓了，那么比特币的上涨就已经是一个大概率事件。我们再看看衍生品市场。资金费率在这一轮下跌中，保持平衡，空头情绪没有什么增长，而贪婪情绪仍然非常良好，处于新高之中——共识经由下跌检验！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PbGBDkEukaMJV6qNne3H1.png?height=1136&width=1406)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ifYqTM1cipEXX0Wz3n-7H.png?height=605&width=1402)\n\n[$BTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=cashtag_click) 月底能不能上98K，看几组指标；一是BTC泡沫指标，综合了舆论热度，网络活跃度、交易热度等综合数据，绿色为泡沫，黄色为价格，绿色偏离黄色越远，则泡沫越大，很明显，现在照指标“一点泡沫都还没有”。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5hFmoHCGDF12V2izb7yNk.png?height=1367&width=1363)\n\n再看神奇的PI指标（历史上用此指标逃顶，每次精确在3天以内），其原理是用111天MA均线和350天均线的倍数相交关系（PS：这和大宇交易系统中双均线战法原理相通用进，有兴趣可以去我没管频道看专门视频）来判断牛熊转折。使用上，当看到红线上穿绿线时，牛市来到了顶点，无一例外！现在很安全！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ax9PNBEui7F29Y8NObkfj.png?height=589&width=1414)\n\n再看对数增长模型， [$BTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=cashtag_click) 价格增长15万附近到达本轮高点，现在6万不值一提，此前每轮预测极为准确； 再看200周移动平均热力图，当出现绿色时，需要观察是否有见顶可能（变红），如果变红，则是出售的好时机（最好不要清空）；上一轮6万出现绿色，而下跌过后，行情健康了，现在还未翻绿！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Czp4ZudWLQR5u5nrwn45f.png?height=601&width=1379)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mBMJmleDZultsGh5JMsaI.png?height=580&width=1397)\n\n最后也简单谈一下短线上，如图所示是可能的回调位，无论到哪一个，都不代表牛市没了，牛市就是还在，所以越跌越是好事，比较极限的是0.382的位置，也就是大概52222（目前看不大可能到，但每次我觉得不可能都到了）。\n\n不过注意，预测价格其实没有太大意义，因为我的操作建议是：牛市不要做空——因为我们的操作最好的其实就是买入或开仓后即可以长期拿住的（空单不行），放弃短线市场搏杀，赚趋势的钱——或许是因为我短线水平垃圾，你如果短线NB，当我没说。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uQzWmn0fudb1gVALEL_5m.png?height=955&width=1452)\n\n全文完，以下为一些工具给新人的，老手可略过。\n\n**币圈必备网址及最强工具(推特置顶放了，可以转发收藏)**\n\n以下内容大多需翻墙，不会的请参阅[《大宇一本通》](https://matters.news/@BTCdayu/%E6%96%B0%E4%BA%BA%E6%B7%B7%E5%B8%81%E5%9C%88%E4%B9%B0%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88-%E6%80%8E%E4%B9%88%E4%B9%B0-%E6%80%8E%E4%B9%88%E5%AF%BB%E6%89%BE%E6%9C%89%E7%94%A8%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF-%E4%B8%80%E6%96%87%E6%95%99%E4%BC%9A-bafyreieb3u4n2lfoc5hnt2zgjr4vlhcj53bvhkvtgomgxjqk6csjoe3qxy)\n\n**一、免费VPN：**[1.蓝灯](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern)；2.[VPNgate](https://www.vpngate.net/)  [视频](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nzQo9qGaKY)教程\n\n注：第二个世界最强且免费，速度可跑满3000兆宽带。\n\n**二、新币购买：**[www.coingecko.com](http://www.coingecko.com)\n\n注：一切币尤其新币怎么买？在此搜索，得官网、合约地址及已上线的交易所等，此站查询不到务必谨慎！\n\n**三、土狗必备：**[www.dextools.io](http://www.dextools.io)

From the E-Corps I have been modeling and starting up at [Everyone Inc.](https://everyoneinc.com), to [platform cooperatives](https://platform.coop/) to [DAOs](https://medium.com/hackernoon/daos-and-the-future-of-work-97b4c076f288), there is now a vibrant array of new ways to work within communities to find a common vision, raise capital, self-organize to achieve complex tasks, and create wealth.  I have spent the past year deeply engaged in how to build more democratic and more participant-managed organizations.  \n\nIf our systems and organizations are evolving towards less hierarchical structures it is obvious that the next great new businesses of this era will need to have leaders that have vastly different skillsets than that of the old guard.  Of course, some of those skills may involve unique dev, creative or growth-related skills - but more importantly, I believe leadership will need to embody a completely new set of core values and ethics to lead.  \n\nI came across Dean Spade’s work through AOC’s Mutual Aid Toolkit (see below).  I have always been interested in mutual aid as a principle because it certainly feels like how communities should be working together especially in times of need.  It feels like people are supposed to help each other out but somehow we forgot that.  \n\n[https://gdoc.pub/doc/e/2PACX-1vRMxV09kdojzMdyOfapJUOB6Ko2_1iAfIm8ELeIgma21wIt5HoTqP1QXadF01eZc0ySrPW6VtU_veyp](https://gdoc.pub/doc/e/2PACX-1vRMxV09kdojzMdyOfapJUOB6Ko2_1iAfIm8ELeIgma21wIt5HoTqP1QXadF01eZc0ySrPW6VtU_veyp)\n\nDean’s book ***Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity During This Crisis (and the next)*** is a primer on why mutual aid is so important for individuals, communities, and democracy. The book goes into the theory of mutual aid and its history but is highly action-oriented providing concrete tools and plans to organize in our neighborhoods and create the communities we want to live in. \n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1839762128?tag=randohouseinc7986-20](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1839762128?tag=randohouseinc7986-20)\n\nIt was in the context of building grassroots Mutal Aid that Dean [posted a list of leadership qualities supporting mutuality vs. hierarchy.](http://www.deanspade.net/2019/09/25/leadership-qualities-that-support-mutuality-and-collaboration/)\n\nThose qualities include:\n\n* Being just and accountable vs. success by domination.\n* Being Willing to admit mistakes vs. Fear of losing reputation or looking weak\n* Wining support by being supportive and trustworthy vs. Winning others’ support through status, fear.\n* Fostering compassion and a desire that no one is left out of the group vs. Fostering competition in the group\n* Seeing the long view and holds to values vs. Seeking immediate gains, even if it means big compromises.\n* Being Controlling, micromanaging vs. Being able to delegate, can ask for help, wants more people’s participation rather than more control.\n\nI think this is a list that every decentralized organization should be seeking from leaders and I hope that a shift in focus will lead to a more diverse, more empathetic, and more successful set of leaders and ventures moving forward.", "timestamp": 1636766859, "digest": "pQnm9lvxgX0xxapnKzhv9ddM9gsSIp1pvfLN0OLatfw", "contributor": "0xa6Baa026a54C0a1c4c38F5A49ecC29342B3ef84d"}

There’s some serious energy in this space, surely due in no small part to the amount of money flowing through these cryptocurrency exchanges, but also due to sheer developer interest and drive. This stuff is *Fun*, with a capital *F*. I’ve never had this much fun diving into the weeds and making a fool of myself, not for anything in my past Web2 life. The energy on Twitter is infectious. The quality of the sites I’ve sampled are astoundingly good. I hypothesize it’s because of passion of the individuals working on these things. These projects are labors of love, instead of a sad accumulation of “features” spat out from the conveyor belt factories of many Web2 startups. I see it myself. I was there not so long ago. Go on **teamblind.com** and see the posts asking for the companies that provide optimal work-life-balance (WLB) and total compensation (TC). For some people, that is what’s best for them. For me, it always felt like I was forcing myself to play a game I hated. At various times in the past three years, I’ve thought I was in need of better WLB, or was dissatisfied because of a lack of pay, or disconnected and disengaged because of the nature of remote work. Really, though, it was a lack of interest. There is no spark being asked to build something you are bored to tears building, in which the only north star is an expected payout when the company IPOs or gets bought, and the only metric by which to assess where to join is its growth potential and expected value.\n\nThere are definitely other ways to find enjoyment in work—some of my best memories have taken place at Affirm’s company events or in the hallways chatting up teammates and downing beers at All-Hands.

Streaming platforms (when someone streams your song from DSPs)\n2. Radio stations\n3. TV stations (commercials and shows)\n4. Non-interactive online radio stations (like Sirius XM and Pandora)\n5. Music venues\n\nAny public place that plays your music (like restaurants, bars, and coffee shops)\n\nA [Performance Rights Organization (PRO)](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/02/20/performance-rights-pro-ascap-bmi-sesac-soundexchange/) represents songwriters and publishers.\n\nAnd anytime there’s a public performance of your song, you’re owed a performance royalty. A PRO collects these royalties for you.\n\nWhat’s considered a “public performance”? This is when\n\n1. You or someone else plays your song live\n2. A public place (like a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop) streams your song in their establishment\n3. Your music is on TV or in a video game\n4. A radio station airs your song\n\n   As you can see, many centralized entities are used to facilitate payment from Streaming Service to artist. One songwriter conflict in the system as currently constructed is the difference between payment & not getting paid from the song for 6-12 months.\n\nThis is where I believe Smart Contracts can come into play.\n\n> *“Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to **automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary’s involvement or time loss.”***\n\nSmart Contracts can be used to not only distribute fair royalty payments but transparent ones that you can track from origin to end with little human involvement. The royalty process needs to be consolidated in a way that makes sense for artists when you look at the millions of dollars stored in unclaimed/undistributed funds. Imagine a world where a song and its songwriters formed a DAO to represent the interest of the song. Whenever there is a conflict its quickly voted upon by people who are invested in the song/in the DAO of the record.\n\nThe opportunities and ideas are endless because the space is not only new but untapped.  A creative new approach towards the traditional world could change the industry to those artists and developers willing and able to take the leap & build. It makes you wonder if a decentralized publishing company or licensing company could be possible, but I believe it will as this space gets more developed with time and financial interest align\n\n\n---\n\nThis trend will continue to grow as major labels & companies attempt to figure out how to navigate these spaces &  inject music in multiple mediums.  In a report by \\*Roberto Neri COO at Utopia Music\n\n> ”\\*The global recorded music market have the potential to grow by 58% to reach $61.7bn in 2028 — up from $39.2bn in 2021. This will be made up by:\n>\n> * Recorded music streaming $26bn (up 86% on 2020’s $14bn value)\n> * Sync $5.8bn (up 66% on 2020’s $3.5bn value)\n> * UGC and social $8bn (up 100% on 2020’s $4bn value)\n> * Creator tools (plugins, DAWs, VSTs and services) $2bn (up 100% on 2020’s $1bn value)\n> * Live streamed concerts $6.4bn (**up 967% on 2020’s $600m value**)\n> * Fandom $5bn (**up 900% on 2020’s $500m value**)\n> * Games $4bn\n\nTo fully maximize the growth of music beyond streaming, companies will need to tap into these key sectors: Sync Licensing, Creator Tools, Live Streaming, Social Connection & Games, all which have growing ecosystems within crypto.\n\n\n---\n\nThe NFT Marketplace from a pure sales perspective gives artists who are willing to be early/immerse themselves in a growing culture, a chance to be rewarded by speculative investors and collectors. But is it necessary for artists to participate or is it just people trying to push their narrative and pump their bags?\n\nHonestly probably a little bit of both, but thats ok!\n\nWhether you agree with Music NFTs or not, its no denying that proper harnessing of smart contracts and systems that create transparency with the Royalty Chain are invaluable to the music industry. Especially when you consider a growing independent sector that relies on Metadata and overall data to survive and generate additional income. This data is crucial for independent artist strategies on where to place their resources and efforts.\n\nEven beyond the minting, selling & trading of NFTs, there are platforms within the space that have given Airdrops of tokens worth money to early adopters of the programs.\n\nSome of these Ive personally been included in are[ Audius](https://audius.co/) ($AUDIO) which gave an airdrop for people who uploaded music when the website was first being promoted and [ENS](https://ens.domains/) ($ENS) a decentralized naming service behind the infamous “.eth” names you may have seen.\n\nI believe the best way to learn and benefit off of Crypto, Music NFTs, DeFi from a musicians perspective is to be curious.

The annual growth of the industry’s revenue from streaming somehow mirrors the growth of the number of paid subscribers across all music streaming platforms.\n\n[73 MUSIC INDUSTRY STATISTICS: 2020/2021 FACTS, SALES & ANALYSIS](https://comparecamp.com/music-industry-statistics/#TOC2)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xe_ZeiHWiNwd4NvWXFh__.jpg?height=454&width=457)\n\nWhile selling physical records is on the rise in the past few years, its still a small portion of the overall sales picture.\n\n**Physical music claimed 9% of overall revenues in the year.**\n\nThe biggest contributor to record industry revenues was, of course, streaming, which generated **$10.1 billion – worth 83% of the US industry’s total retail revenues.**\n\nThe US record industry generated **$12.2bn** across all formats in 2020, says the RIAA, **up 9.2% year-on-year**.\n\n> The biggest-selling vinyl album in the US last year, according to [MRC Data](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/companies/mrc-data/), was *Fine Line* by Harry Styles (232,000 vinyl sales), followed by *When We All Fall Sleep Where Do We Go?* by Billie Eilish (196,000 vinyl sales), and Queen’s *Greatest Hits* (176,000 vinyl sales).\n\n\n---\n\nWhich brings us to what brought you here: Use case for NFTs in the traditional music industry.

Streaming platforms (when someone streams your song from DSPs)\n2. Radio stations\n3. TV stations (commercials and shows)\n4. Non-interactive online radio stations (like Sirius XM and Pandora)\n5. Music venues\n\nAny public place that plays your music (like restaurants, bars, and coffee shops)\n\nA [Performance Rights Organization (PRO)](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/02/20/performance-rights-pro-ascap-bmi-sesac-soundexchange/) represents songwriters and publishers.\n\nAnd anytime there’s a public performance of your song, you’re owed a performance royalty. A PRO collects these royalties for you.\n\nWhat’s considered a “public performance”? This is when\n\n1. You or someone else plays your song live\n2. A public place (like a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop) streams your song in their establishment\n3. Your music is on TV or in a video game\n4. A radio station airs your song\n\n   As you can see, many centralized entities are used to facilitate payment from Streaming Service to artist. One songwriter conflict in the system as currently constructed is the difference between payment & not getting paid from the song for 6-12 months.\n\nThis is where I believe Smart Contracts can come into play.\n\n> *“Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to **automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary’s involvement or time loss.”***\n\nSmart Contracts can be used to not only distribute fair royalty payments but transparent ones that you can track from origin to end with little human involvement. The royalty process needs to be consolidated in a way that makes sense for artists when you look at the millions of dollars stored in unclaimed/undistributed funds. Imagine a world where a song and its songwriters formed a DAO to represent the interest of the song. Whenever there is a conflict its quickly voted upon by people who are invested in the song/in the DAO of the record.\n\nThe opportunities and ideas are endless because the space is not only new but untapped.  A creative new approach towards the traditional world could change the industry to those artists and developers willing and able to take the leap & build. It makes you wonder if a decentralized publishing company or licensing company could be possible, but I believe it will as this space gets more developed with time and financial interest align\n\n\n---\n\nThis trend will continue to grow as major labels & companies attempt to figure out how to navigate these spaces &  inject music in multiple mediums.  In a report by \\*Roberto Neri COO at Utopia Music\n\n> ”\\*The global recorded music market have the potential to grow by 58% to reach $61.7bn in 2028 — up from $39.2bn in 2021. This will be made up by:\n>\n> * Recorded music streaming $26bn (up 86% on 2020’s $14bn value)\n> * Sync $5.8bn (up 66% on 2020’s $3.5bn value)\n> * UGC and social $8bn (up 100% on 2020’s $4bn value)\n> * Creator tools (plugins, DAWs, VSTs and services) $2bn (up 100% on 2020’s $1bn value)\n> * Live streamed concerts $6.4bn (**up 967% on 2020’s $600m value**)\n> * Fandom $5bn (**up 900% on 2020’s $500m value**)\n> * Games $4bn\n\nTo fully maximize the growth of music beyond streaming, companies will need to tap into these key sectors: Sync Licensing, Creator Tools, Live Streaming, Social Connection & Games, all which have growing ecosystems within crypto.\n\n\n---\n\nThe NFT Marketplace from a pure sales perspective gives artists who are willing to be early/immerse themselves in a growing culture, a chance to be rewarded by speculative investors and collectors. But is it necessary for artists to participate or is it just people trying to push their narrative and pump their bags?\n\nHonestly probably a little bit of both, but thats ok!\n\nWhether you agree with Music NFTs or not, its no denying that proper harnessing of smart contracts and systems that create transparency with the Royalty Chain are invaluable to the music industry. Especially when you consider a growing independent sector that relies on Metadata and overall data to survive and generate additional income. This data is crucial for independent artist strategies on where to place their resources and efforts.\n\nEven beyond the minting, selling & trading of NFTs, there are platforms within the space that have given Airdrops of tokens worth money to early adopters of the programs.\n\nSome of these Ive personally been included in are[ Audius](https://audius.co/) ($AUDIO) which gave an airdrop for people who uploaded music when the website was first being promoted and [ENS](https://ens.domains/) ($ENS) a decentralized naming service behind the infamous “.eth” names you may have seen.\n\nI believe the best way to learn and benefit off of Crypto, Music NFTs, DeFi from a musicians perspective is to be curious.

Peaster。\n\n我们在一月份出版了一份代币空投指南，当时我们说，作为这些加密协议的早期用户，你很有可能获得很大的回报。\n\n我们是对的。\n\n一个例子是：Darren Lau将100美元存入了dYdX，然后他获取到了5万美元的回报。\n\n我们相信，这样的空投还会发生。在这个新的指南中，我们分享了25个未来可能会进行空投的机会。显然，我们不能承诺任何事情，但是，在每一个机会上花10分钟来进行学习，很可能会让你在未来获取到一份回报。\n\n祝你们好运。\n\n<https://appserversrc.8btc.cn/FiI20eoB6FF0Loq2stNfnZzSlVWu.jpeghttps://appserversrc.8btc.cn/FiI20eoB6FF0Loq2stNfnZzSlVWu.jpeg>\n\n图片来自：Logan Craig\n\nDeFi协议越来越多地采用「代币空投」的方式，以分散治理并促进早期用户的参与，项目方通常会进行“追溯性空投”，这意味着他们会根据你过去与其协议或系统交互的多少来分配奖励。\n\n在这篇文章中，我们将概述一些可能会进行空投的协议。\n\n目标：确定未发行代币的协议，以捕获未来可能的空投机会。\n\n技能：初级\n\n努力：中等\n\n经验总结\n根据我们在过去一年中看到的情况，我们可以合理地得出一个结论：「空投」正在成为年轻 DeFi 项目的标准操作实践。从项目方的角度来看，优化这些空投还有一些工作要做（比如让它们抵抗女巫攻击）。\n\n问题的关键是？大多数人没有大量的时间和无限的资源来将活动分散到每个最终可能会推出代币的 DeFi 项目中。\n\n因此，重点就在于效率：确定要关注哪些项目（例如，给定协议是否有非常小的机会在6-12个月内推出代币？）以及规模（即存款多少以平衡风险和潜在的回报）。\n\n就第一点而言，通过一点研究，你通常可以找到团队/社区的代币计划来指导你的工作。例如，ParaSwap 最近宣布它没有空投计划。相反，MetaMask团队最近透露其对最终发布原生代币的想法持开放态度。\n\n因此，作为一个例子，你可能想开始通过MetaMask 执行一些加密资产交易。当然，我们并不能保证代币空投就一定会到来，但至少现在我们知道了，它存在着可能。\n\n接下来，为了获得空投资格，你需要和这些未发行代币的协议进行多少次（或量）的交互？\n\n这将因项目而异，但DeFi早期的黄金法则是“决不要存入超过你承受能力的加密资产。”\n\n好消息是什么？正如The Daily Ape创始人Darren Lau在上个月指出的那样，即使只是一点点的钱/活动，也足以让你获得空投的资格。\n\n<https://appserversrc.8btc.cn/FjGedt7oWtVZckWZ0Q8PTxiiTQC6.jpghttps://appserversrc.8btc.cn/FjGedt7oWtVZckWZ0Q8PTxiiTQC6.jpg>\n\n25个可能会有空投的加密项目\n下面是我们V2版空投指南收录的加密项目列表，这些项目有可能在不久的将来推出自己的代币并进行追溯性空投。\n\n免责声明：我并不确定它们是否会进行空投，这完全是基于我（作为一名活跃的加密用户和研究人员）的经验得出的观点。\n\n1、Element Finance\n描述：Element Finance是一个“针对固定收益率和可变收益率市场的开源协议”。\n\n资源：网站|文档‌|Twitter‌|Discord‌\n\n理由：Element Finance已经创建了一个治理模型，这表明该项目必然会发布一个原生代币。\n\n空投策略：Element Finance的旗舰产品是其Earn应用程序和Save应用程序，使用这两种产品中的任何一种，都可能让你有资格获得未来的空投。\n\n2、Hop Protocol\n描述：Hop Protocol是一种代币桥协议，其用于在区块链和rollup二层网络之间轻松发送ETH和ERC-20代币，它目前支持跨以太坊、Arbitrium、Optimism、Polygon以及xDai这几条链。\n\n资源：网站‌|文档‌|Twitter‌ | Discord‌\n\n理由：关于潜在的Hop代币，该项目团队之前已说过“任何关于该协议的官方公告，Hop团队都将直接发布在官方的Hop频道。”\n\n如果Hop没有发布代币的计划，他们可能会像ParaSwap一样发布官方公告。\n\n空投策略：访问hop.exchange，然后（1）使用发送仪表板将资产从一条链跨到另一条链，或者（2）成为Hop池子的流动性提供者（LP）。\n\n3、DeFi Saver\n描述：DeFi Saver是“一站式仪表板，用于创建、管理和跟踪你的DeFi头寸。”\n\n资源：网站‌|文档‌|Twitter‌ | Discord‌\n\n理由：到目前为止，DeFi Saver一直在使用一个原生代币，但这是一个策展代币，持有者可以用其投票和优先考虑新的协议整合。\n\n空投策略：试用DeFi Saver的投资组合系统或Recipe Creator。\n\n4、Ondo Finance\n描述：Ondo Finance是一个支持“去中心化金融风险市场”的协议。\n\n资源：网站‌|文档‌| Twitter‌ | Discord‌\n\n理由：Ondo团队之前曾说过“Ondo目前没有代币”，注意一下，他们的说法是当时没有。\n\n空投策略：加入Ondo的一个风险市场（请注意，他们有特定的“开放窗口”，在此期间你才可以加入）。\n\n5、Saddle Finance\n描述：Saddle是一个去中心化交易所，其对稳定币和封装BTC等锚定加密资产进行了优化。\n\n资源：网站‌|文档‌| Twitter‌ | Discord‌\n\n理由：Saddle是Curve系统的一个改编版本，尽管它是用Solidity语言而不是Vyper编写的，考虑到Curve推出了CRV，不难想象Saddle最终也会有自己的代币。\n\n空投策略：通过该交易所进行代币互换，或者充当流动性提供者（LP）。\n\n6、Charm\n描述：Charm协议提供了一套 DeFi 产品，包括 Alpha Vaults、Cube Token等。\n\n资源：网站 ‌| 文档‌ |Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：从第一天起，Charm 团队的既定目标就是“任何人都可以研究、构建和治理 Charm 中的协议”。这里提到了“治理协议”，似乎意味着他们将发行一种代币。\n\n空投策略：存入 Charm 的初始产品之一，例如Alpha Vaults。\n\n7、Slingshot\n描述：Slingshot 是目前在 Polygon 上运行的一个 Web3 交易平台，接下来它还将支持 Arbitrum。\n\n资源：网站‌ | Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：Slingshot 似乎可能会走其他 DEX走过的道路，并最终发布自己的代币。\n\n空投策略：连接到 Polygon 网络并在 Slingshot 应用上进行一些交易。\n\n8、TokenSets\n描述：TokenSets 是一个建立在 Set 协议之上的 DeFi 资产管理平台。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：该项目似乎要实现完全去中心化治理，这可能需要发布一个原生代币。\n\n空投策略：购买/出售Set token或创建你自己的Set token。\n\n9、Gro Protocol\n描述：Gro Protocol是一种迎合稳定币的收益聚合器协议。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：Gro 团队计划让该项目“在不久的将来完全去中心化”，并计划让早期支持者参与治理。\n\n空投策略：使用 Gro Protocol 的 Vault 或 PWRD 产品。\n\n10、Cowswap\n描述：Cowswap 是一个抗 MEV 的 DEX 聚合器，它构建在 v2 版本的Gnosis协议之上。\n\n资源： Website | Docs | Twitter | Discord\n\n理由：Cowswap 计划在完全去中心化的道路上建立一个 DAO，这意味着它会有一个代币。\n\n空投策略：通过该交易所进行一些交易。\n\n11、Cozy Finance\n描述：Cozy Finance 是一种为 DeFi 创建信任最小化保护市场的协议（即保险协议）。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：迄今为止，大多数 DeFi 保险项目都推出了自己的代币，因此我们最终可能会在Cozy 身上看到同样的情况。\n\n空投策略：在 Cozy 上借用/提供资产，或者，更高级的用户可以创建自己的保护市场。\n\n12、Zapper\n描述：Zapper 是一个面向 DeFi 和 NFT 用户的 Web3 钱包管理仪表板。\n\n资源：Website | Twitter | Discord\n\n理由：Zapper 还没有“消除”发行代币的可能性，也就是说，我们还有机会。\n\n空投策略：试用Zapper原生的Exchange、Pool、Save等产品。\n\n13、Zerion\n描述：Zerion 是另一个面向 DeFi 和 NFT 用户的Web3 钱包管理仪表板。\n\n资源：Website|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：和Zapper 一样，我们可能会看到 Zerion 在未来某个时候推出一个原生代币来促进社区治理。\n\n空投策略：试用Zerion的Invest、Exchange、Pool产品等。\n\n14、 Kwenta & Lyra\n描述：这是两个不同的协议，但它们的共同点是，两者都是构建在 Synthetix 上的衍生项目，并且已部署在 Optimism L2 上。\n\n资源：Kwenta Twitter|Lyra Twitter\n\n理由：这两个项目方已公开确认将进行追溯性空投。\n\n空投策略：将 SNX 放在 Optimism 上，然后使用其中的任何一个协议。\n\n15、 Mirror\n描述：Mirror 是一个去中心化的内容发布平台\n\n资源：Website|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：虽然 Mirror 已经拥有 WRITE代币，但该代币的发布是受到限制的，也许 Mirror 可能向其早期用户空投更多的代币。\n\n空投策略：利用Mirror的各种工具，例如通过平台发布博客文章。\n\n16、以太坊域名服务（ENS）\n描述：ENS 是一个 Web3 域名和配置系统。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：ENS正在演变成一个成熟的去中心化身份系统。未来，由代币持有者驱动的去中心化治理可能会监督这个系统。\n\n空投策略：注册/更新ENS域名。\n\n17、Optimism\n描述：Optimism 是一种Optimistic Rollup二层网络，其可以帮助以太坊实现扩容。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：似乎rollup二层网络都会推出自己的代币来引导流动性并争夺用户。而Optimism是一个需要关注的大项目。\n\n空投策略：将资金从以太坊转移到 Optimism，并使用一些应用，例如Uniswap 或 Synthetix。\n\n18、Arbitrum\n描述：和Optimism一样，Arbitrum也是一个optimistic rollup二层项目，其最近的发展势头非常不错。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：再强调一下，作为一个rollup 二层项目，Arbitrum 似乎最终可能会推出自己的代币来引导流动性并争夺用户。\n\n空投策略：将资金从以太坊主网转移到Arbitrum，并使用Balancer等应用。\n\n19、zkSync\n描述：zkSync 是使用zk rollup技术的L2扩容网络。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：zkSync 的创建者 Matter Labs 已确认他们将发布代币以激励早期用户。\n\n空投策略：打开zkSync 钱包并测试这个L2网络。\n\n20、PartyBid\n描述：PartyBid 是一个用于“对 NFT进行集体竞标”的dapp，该项目让一群朋友甚至一群陌生人可以轻松地一起竞标 NFT。\n\n资源：Website|Twitter|Discord\n\n空投策略：针对你想要参与的任何NFT发起PartyBid，或向已激活的PartyBid 贡献 ETH（如果竞价失败，你可以取回自己的ETH）。\n\n21、Foundation\n描述：Foundation 是一个面向创造者经济的 NFT 铸造和市场平台。\n\n资源：Website|Twitter\n\n理由：在 SuperRare 通过 RARE 推出其社区所有的治理模式之后，像Foundation 这样的类似平台似乎很可能会选择类似的方法。\n\n空投策略：在 Foundation 上竞标/收集 NFT，请记住，不要因为纯粹的投机原因而买入自己不喜欢的NFT。\n\n22、Zora\n描述：Zora 是一个 NFT 铸造和市场协议。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：社区管理和治理是许多 NFT 平台的未来，因此如果Zora 最终发行自己的代币，我不会感到惊讶。\n\n空投策略：在 Zora 上铸造和收集 NFT。\n\n23、 Fractional\n描述：Fractional 是一个 NFT 碎片化平台，例如，你可以将一个稀有的 1/1 NFT 分成 1,000 个碎片。\n\n资源：Website|\\[Docs\\](<https://docs.fractional.art/fractional/#:\\~:text=Fractional> is a decentralized protocol,the NFT that they own.)|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/fractional_art)|[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fractional)\n\n理由：如果我没记错的话，Fractional 团队对未来发行原生代币的可能性表示出了开放的态度。\n\n空投策略：在平台上收集 NFT 的碎片，或者自己拆分NFT。\n\n24、 Sudoswap\n描述：Sudoswap 是一个交易 NFT 和 ERC20代币的交易平台。\n\n资源：Website|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：Sudoswap 团队富有创新精神和想象力，他们似乎可能会在某个时候进行一次深思熟虑、前所未有的空投。\n\n空投策略：通过 Sudoswap 应用程序进行一些 NFT 交易。\n\n25、OpenSea\n描述：OpenSea 目前是全球领先的 NFT 市场。\n\n资源：Website|Docs|Twitter|Discord\n\n理由：随着大型新玩家（例如Coinbase 和 Reddit）持续进入 NFT 领域，OpenSea 可能会推出自己的代币以激励用户留在 OpenSea 上。\n\n空投策略：通过 OpenSea 铸造和收集 NFT。\n\n其他可能会空投的项目\n有太多的项目还没有发行自己的代币，我也无法在这篇文章中深入探讨其中的每一个。注意，以下这些项目也存在着空投的可能，请记住，我对它们的代币发行计划没有直接的了解。\n\nArt Blocks\nArtion\nFuji Finance\nGoldfinch\nHashflow\nHorizon Finance\nMetaMask\nOpyn\nRabbithole\nRisk Harbor\nRubicon\nSablier\nShell Protocol\nSherlock\nSuperfluid\nTeller\n结论\n请务必记住，使用年轻的 DeFi 和 NFT 项目可能存在着风险，它们本质上都是实验。\n\n因此，在深入探索这些协议之前，你需要做更多的研究。 如果你确实测试了其中的任何一个，请确保谨慎进行，并且仅使用自己能够承受损失的资金。\n\n也就是说，正如 Darren Lau 在之前的推文中提到的那样，即使是适度的参与，也可以让你获得丰厚的空投回报。\n\n最后，请记住，我们最终可能会看到像 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 这样的rollup项目推出自己的原生代币。\n\n另外，你可以尝试像 Hop Protocol 这样的项目，你可以在其中与这些rollup网络进行交互，这可能会让你实现“一石二鸟”。​​​​", "timestamp": 1636770264, "digest": "xRATtvRtdDbgk5ZFWNUuRFXx6aw_qaxtQ4A4HOA8YEo", "contributor": "0xDfc4FbbDd9C47c7976fEBb14B1D37C7f85FE299D"}

{"id": "G4h_bEENB7N9DHne10443AJLeg4KDNla5KrL8c1VDos", "title": "Discontinued: From Hic Et Nunc to hDAO", "body": "今年4月写了一篇和 hic et nunc 相关的 NFT 指南，今天看到官推介绍改成 discontinued，宣告已停止运转，和很多人一样觉得很可惜，在此复盘一下这个 Tezos 上最大的 NFT 小区发展始末。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DZtPWo7SsHf2M3vHlXn_3.png?height=281&width=337)\n\n实际上，这并不是结束，而是一个项目一步步走向去中心化并且持续下去的典型过程。\n\nHic Et Nunc 于今年3月1日正式推出，在此之前，它并不是一开始就为加密艺术而生。从对外公开信息中的项目提案（https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/hicetnunc-microfunding-protocol/2318）看，最早的 Hic Et Nunc 是利用 Tezos 费用低廉的特点、面向电竞社区的工具，但也能满足其他受众创建微型融资 DAO 的需求，创始人名为 Rafael Lima，是一位社会科学家，看重 web3 平台和用户自由的联系，也对区块链的特性和艺术实验有较为深入的了解，因此，这个平台从一开始就选择了去中心化和开源之路。\n\nTezos 生态对于这件事较为支持，让很多艺术家在想要铸造第一个 NFT 时就获得了足以覆盖前几笔铸造费用的 XTZ 补贴、跳过了需要自己购买加密货币的过程。如此一来，大量艺术家将  Hic Et Nunc 作为自己第一个 NFT 的铸造平台。\n\n与此同时，应运而生的 OBJKT4OBJKT 活动（当时的介绍见 <https://www.dappchaser.com/objkt4objkt>）和相对低廉的费用，也吸引了大量 NFT 爱好者和收藏家蜂拥而至。\n\n一些从未在以太坊主网收藏过 NFT 的艺术爱好者，在此收藏了很多自己喜欢的 NFT，并且享受到 XTZ 本身的涨幅；持续跟进的人则踩中了头像 NFT 热蔓延到 Tezos 生态之后的早期机遇，例如，曾经在微博非常活跃、如今四处低调捡钱的退休 KOL 归神，收藏了成百上千幅作品，并在头像项目上收获百倍涨幅。\n\n回到 Hic Et Nunc 平台及其发展历程。\n\n平台推出前，Rafael Lima 在一些访谈中，Hic Et Nunc 源于自己一些和 Gilles Deleuze 或 Paul Virilio 相关的阅读经验，并受到了 Gitcoin 的启发，算是一种存在主义的实践，希望让平台能够去中心化，不需要受创始人意愿制约就能持续。\n\nHic Et Nunc 上线后，每当用户单击右上角的菜单按钮时，网站底部便会出现一句话：\n\n> This is an experimental dApp, use it at your own risk\n>\n>  “这是一个实验性 dApp，使用者风险自负”。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/02_GQ1Ka1O1ZAjnEWI4AS.png?height=80&width=784)\n\n另一个最值得关注的存在是HDAO，即Hic Et Nunc 平台的治理代币：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GkvJ7DbJEdbgiMsetkuH-.png?height=590&width=1066)\n\n最早和 Rarible 的代币 RARI 类似，买家和卖家都可以通过艺术品交易获得HDAO，或是通过 Tezos 上的DEX Quipuswap进行交易，代币信息如下：\n\n> Contract address is FA2: KT1AFA2mwNUMNd4SsujE1YYp29vd8BZejyKW ID:0\n>\n> Total supply (capped): 650,000 hDAO\n>\n> Circulating supply: 650,000 hDAO\n\n5月下旬，Hic Et Nunc 得到社区艺术家、收藏家和 Tezos 基金会的捐赠支持，以社区驱动的形式共同举办了第一次生态黑客松：hicathon，来自全球70多个国家（或地区）的参与者撰写了宣言，并对于智能合约审计、生态项目开发和 DAO 相关的问题进行了讨论，希望以自组织的形式进一步推荐实验；目前，我们仍可以通过活动页面查看完整的记录：[hicathon.xyz/stream-summaries/post-hicathon/summary](https://hicathon.xyz/stream-summaries/post-hicathon/summary)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cRJnUlXa28n3BnGe7HfJS.png?height=675&width=1200)\n\n9月左右的又一次 Hicathon ，同样由社区治理主导，去中心化投票工具 Heenvote.xyz 在此过程中发挥了比较大的作用；目前，我们仍可以通过记录看到当时的情况：<https://www.henvote.xyz/past-votes>\n\n10月末，仍然有不少热爱 Hic Et Nunc 的社区成员撰写文章，表明 Hicathon 发挥了社区的作用，使得整个生态得以迅速发展。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EGDj3sVB02SFIstvhIkRF.png?height=1500&width=3456)\n\n根据创始人的设计，Hic Et Nunc 官方网站和其他社区搭建的站点一样，前端不过是智能合约对外的展示，即使官网不复存在，只要 Tezos 区块链仍在运转，Hic Et Nunc 就会一直存在，并且由支持者扩展出更多元的展现形式。\n\n例如，我觉得最酷的一个方案就一个Hic Et Nunc 宇宙，能让每个OBJKT 能够以更加有趣的3D形式显示在其中：<https://docs.hicathon.xyz/61-on-planetcrafting-the-metaverse-of-hic-et-nunc>\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TtCxQgfNvonXfRUU7A0wo.png?height=611&width=1421)\n\n回头看，似乎今天所发生的一切，不论是平台停摆，还是社区很快搭建起一模一样的前端页面，都早在过往的细节中埋下伏笔。\n\n目前，用户仍然能通过多个社区化前端页面正常使用 Hic Et Nunc，但根据个别 Hic Et Nunc NFT 收藏家的说法，Hic Et Nunc的停摆有可能和另一个平台 objkt.com 今天宣布要开放自己的 NFT 铸造功能有关，该平台最初是为 Hic Et Nunc 打造更流畅的前端体验而存在，7月末增加了对其他 Tezos 生态 NFT 平台的支持，并增设拍卖属性。\n\n正如官方推特的最后一条推文的内容：<https://twitter.com/hicetnunc2000/status/1458891213344591878> ——如果社区共识仍然强大，那么作为Hic Et Nunc真正核心的智能合约及其所定义的规则便会延续下去；如果共识彻底瓦解，那么旧的智能合约也会被新的替代，新瓶不再装旧酒。\n\n至少站在此时此刻看，HDAO 社区在第一时间搭建起了新的站点：<https://hicetnunc.art> ，并在推特开始名为 Hic Et Nunc Forever 的直播；直播过程中，原本因此事暴跌不止的 $HDAO 也有所回升。\n\n如果让我用一个科幻作者的视角，将时空尺度拉大、开脑洞来看，我认为 Tezos 的 NFT之路很可能在未来找到更能发挥自身价值的空间，即在被许多国内朋友忽视的环保和碳排放税问题上，这条链较于其他链，变成一条 NFT 专用公链的群众基础更强。\n\n目前，唯一能与之抗衡的对手就是以太坊主网，而 Polygon 之流都有着其他存在感更强的方向。然而，如若有一天，你付出高昂 GAS 的同时，还要在现实中支付一笔碳排放交易税，你是否还愿意坚持原本的选择？蜂拥至 Hic Et Nunc 的圈外艺术家们和提供数据查询优化的社区开发者，已经给出了可能性最大的那个答案。\n\n当然，由 MEME 创始人 Jordan 开创、尚未正式上线就获得 Consensys、MetaMask、Infura 等支持的 NFT项目 Plam，如果未来发展顺利，同样是值得关注的竞争对手之一。\n\n不过，这个足够跨领域的话题要是展开说，又要死掉一堆脑细胞才说得清。在此不再多言。\n\n偶尔跳出 Crypto 圈，反观现实中终有一日可能影响这个领域的变化，经常会发现，此刻最不被人重视的东西，反而更可能是最终影响全局的那个存在，而这些东西的背后，仍是现实世界古老的权力话语命题。\n\n当我们的意识仍依赖于肉身，而肉身仍存活于现实之中，便难以逃开这个命题的限制。\n\nP.S. 最后的最后，虽然本文在 Mirror 没有设置文章 NFT，但在这里送上本文封面同款 NFT， 通过 [hicetnunc.art](https://hicetnunc.art)  铸造的 Tezos NFT，共100个，领完即止，仅当阅读文章收藏的小礼物罢\\~ :p\n\n[https://hicetnunc.art/objkt/531584](https://hicetnunc.art/objkt/531584)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636771401, "digest": "9wwOc0XCU-nRQdUBo3JXLtOk9NDeyK45xTr_Sp5-QyM", "contributor": "0x84da37133a088Fbf4e21D80Aec2CC260B52eA116"}

2734.7 亿美元，相较于去年同期增幅近 200 倍。\n\n2021 年，**在 NFT 赛道高度发展后，以 P2E 为特性的 GameFi 板块延续了 DeFi 所构建的意识形态，并在更短的时间内迎来了更强力的爆发。***数据来源 Defillama*\n\n据《链新》统计，自 9 月以来，区块链游戏融资累计金额超 14 亿美元，尤其是在过去一个月，有超 20 个链游类项目宣布取得了融资。而红杉中国、罗斯柴尔德信托资本、马云的 Blue Pool Capital 以及三星风险投资公司等传统资本，也在纷纷入局链游领域。\n\n根据 Coinmarketcap 上所收录的“Play-To-Earn”板块项目达到了 172 个，这些 GameFi 项目代币的总市值约为 243.2 亿美元，**其中 Axie Infinity、Decentraland、Radio Caca 以及 The Sandbox 占据了较大比重。** \n *Coinmarketcap 网站“Play-To-Earn”板块统计截图*\n\n而继 GameFi 之后，辐射面更为广泛、能够进一步延续这种意识形态的 SocialFi，也有望成为 Web3.0 概念的新风口。\n\n**SocialFi 是社交意识形态的深度变革，也将是下一个风口**\n\nGameFi 与元宇宙的融合，是元宇宙世界早期的体现形式之一，并涌现出了一批杀手级应用，比如 Axie Infinity、Decentraland、The Sandbox,、CryptoVoxels 以及 Somnium Space 等。GameFi 让传统互联网游戏的意识形态骤变，并展现出了十分惊人的爆发力。\n\n相对于 GameFi 而言，SocialFi 所面对的人群、圈层要更加广泛，一个人可能不是游戏玩家，但他一定在使用社交应用。很显然，社交已经深度嵌入到每一个人的生活中，而 SocialFi 也将在不久展现出十足的爆发力。SocialFi 是 Social Finance 的缩写，但是我们可以认为 SocialFi 是 Social+DeFi+NFT 的一个 Web 2.0 与 Web3.0 结合的生态。\n\n传统社交生态，是以中心化社交平台为基础，建立声誉和业务来与世界连接，而用户作为传统社交生态中最为重要的角色，在贡献注意力、创造力价值后，并不在利益分配圈层内。传统社交生态中，生态的治理、决策也几乎与用户没有任何关系，当然因用户信息集中存储，造成的信息泄露也会时有发生。\n\nSocialFi 构建了一个新的社交意识形态，通过构建基于 DeFi 的社交经济，发行人通过社交通证与参与者直接连接，每一个角色都将从中受益。这意味着，SocialFi 是一个以社交通证、激励为纽带的协作生态，每一个参与协作、推动社区发展的贡献者都将得到激励。而 NFT 仍将在 SocialFi 中扮演着重要的角色，可以是声望、信誉也可以是权益信号、生产工具。\n\nSocialFi 所构建的生态，将以 NFT、DeFi 等要素的可组合性为基础，通过 Web3.0 功能的不断扩充，以一站式的方式满足用户的众多需求，且愈发复杂化。元宇宙是现实世界的虚拟复刻，而 SocialFi 则有望将现实世界中的复杂关系，嵌合到元宇宙中。以 SocialFi 作为纽带，有望深度的还原现实世界，**以 SocialFi 为基础所构建的元宇宙生态，或将是未来元宇宙的主要体现形式（GameFi 等元素将是其中的一份部分）。**\n\n作为对趋势判断最为敏感的传统互联网巨头们，也在深度的布局 SocialFi 赛道，并可能以此为基础来进一步布局元宇宙。Facebook 将全部身家下注在元宇宙上，并将 Facebook 商标更名为 Meta，预示着以 Facebook 原有体量为基础，进一步过渡到 SocialFi 特性的元宇宙社交生态中。\n\n在今年的 6 月底，Twitter 曾推出免费送 NFT 的活动，这意味着 NFT 未来将进一步的在 Twitter 中扮演重要的角色，Twitter 或将以 SocialFi 的形式进一步对生态进行布局。\n\n同为社交巨头的 Reddit，也在今年的 10 月表示，目前正在寻找一名高级后端工程师，他将负责构建服务，使“数百万”用户能够铸造和交易 NFT。除了传统社交巨头外，区块链领域的巨头币安，推出了 5 亿美金的投资计划中，其中一个重点关注领域为 SocialFi。**科技巨头们的深度布局，进一步反映出了 SocialFi 将是下一个风口。**  \n  \n **SocialFi 的大趋势下，Torum 或成赛道新兴生力军**\n\n从行业的角度看，SocialFi 这个概念由来已久。早在 2018 年开始，就涌现出了 ONO、QunQun、GSC、YeeCall 等带有 SocialFi 特性的应用，但是彼时市场环境、技术等成熟度不够，并且 DeFi、NFT 等板块发展欠佳，这使得这些处在探索中的 SocialFi 生态并没有持续至今。\n\n即便是 EOS 的创始人 BM 推出的 Voice，也并没有按照预期发展，雷声大雨点小。作为与上述应用同赛道的 Torum，从 2018 年底开始经历市场不断的变迁、技术不断迭代的过程中，逐渐走到现在。**Torum 所构建的 SocialFi 生态，更具独特性且更加能够面向 Web3.0。** \n Torum 打造了一个一站式 SocialFi 平台，深度融合了 DeFi、NFT 等元素，Torum 具备可组合性，并能够与元宇宙完美的进行结合。Torum 构建在以太坊以及 BSC 上，深度整合了众多功能，Torum 也进一步实现了对区块链功能上的扩充。\n\n通过将传统的 Web 2.0 与新颖的 Web 3.0 进行结合，Torum 的去中心化混合模型生态能够接纳市场的任何趋势，来满足绝大多数用户的需求，这是与以往项目最大的区别所在，这也使得 Torum 能够经久不衰而不是昙花一现。Torum SocialFi 生态能够面对多种角色，比如普通社交用户、交易用户、KOL、内容产出者、加密货币以及区块链项目方等等。Torum 是一个分布式、自治的社交生态，在 Torum 中用户不再仅仅是注意力价值的贡献者，也将是既得利益者、生态协作者以及治理参与者。\n\nTorum 用户能够以去中心化的形式，通过 NFT 等工具来进一步实现以 DeFi 为基础的价值社交，并且任何对生态做出贡献的用户，也都将获得 Torum 生态赋予的激励。 \n Torum 能够给予行业项目、KOL、内容创作者在运营上的深度支持，目前 Torum 团队也正在积极开发，针对项目方的一系列高效便捷的社群搭建及运营工具，来进一步帮助项目方提高与社区的互动能力。比如通过 Torumgram 应用能有效地整合替代这些传统的互联网社交工具 Telegram、Discord 甚至推特等。\n\nTorum 也将积极吸引项目方入驻，与优质项目紧密合作，从而达到互惠互利的效果。而对于一些优质内容创作者、KOL 等，还能通过 Torum 进一步构建自己的 IP，并通过 Torum 内的设施比如 NFT、激励等，来促进粉丝的粘性与活性。\n\n比如某个 KOL、内容创作者，可以为自己的粉丝、读者颁发专属的 NFT 勋章，通过持有勋章能够在该 KOL、内容创作者构建的私有生态中持续获得权益，Torum 以 NFT 为基础与他们构建深度的链接。当然，这个 NFT 将能够被在 Torum 中的 NFT 商店中出售，价值、交易流动性取决于该 KOL、内容创作者所赋予 NFT 的价值溢价，NFT 也将逐渐衍生出更多的场景。\n\n作为一站式 SocialFi 生态，Torum 也是一个信息枢纽，生态应用 Torum News 能够汇聚大量的新闻讯息，尤其是区块链行业的相关动向、行情。Torum 中的项目应用还包含了 Torum Finance 等功能，支持用户在 Torum 生态内进行各种 DeFi 投资、交易，而 NFT 资产也将通过 NFT 商城进一步实现赋能，来促进生态的积极运转。Torum 生态以 XTM 作为原生通证，并能够在 Torum 生态中起到价值交换、交易媒介作用，比如用户获取激励、生态内的各类支付、信誉担保、参与 DeFi 等等。而 XTM 也有望进一步伴随着 Torum 生态的发展，而深度汇聚价值。\n\n**Torum 可能是被严重低估的 SocialFi 生态**\n\nTorum 团队来自马来西亚、印度、土耳其等地，团队成员多是深耕于区块链领域的金融、技术老兵，对于行业有着深度的洞察力、判断力，且行业资源深厚。 \n 团队成员包括早期的 Matic （Polygon）核心成员、前美国区块链公司 Consensys 职员、创始人兼 CEO 大学主修金融、2017 年入行业、目前担任马来西亚区块链协会的副委员会成员。而币安在 2021 年初在印度举办的 DeFi 黑客松， Binance #BuildForBharat 中拿下八强亮眼成绩的区块链开发者，也是 Torum 的开发者，Torum 的技术水平值得认可。\n\n另外区块链行业中的资本领域也对于 Torum 也表现出了深度的认可，从融资进度来看，目前 Torum 在今年 3 月完成了包括火币资本、AU21、共识实验室、水滴资本等十多家机构参与的 150 万美元融资，之后在同年 8 月及 11 月获得了 Huobi Ventures 及 Kucoin Labs 的战略投资。 \n 火币投资 Torum 后，Torum 也与火币生态形成了深度的联动，尤其得到了 HECO 众多应用的支持（MDex,、FilDA、Butterswap 等），目前 HECO 上很多知名项目已入驻到平台中，Torum 也在极力协助这些项目方在海外市场进行推广。Torum 所构建的 SocialFi 生态，也将迎来行业内众多优质项目，以及亟需对运营能力扩充的新兴项目的加入，Torum 生态将不断得到扩充，促进生态的进一步扩张。\n\n值得一提的是，Torum 也在今年 6 月，成为唯一入选 Fintech Forward 孵化计划中区块链企业，而参与该评选的新创公司多达数百家。据悉，该孵化计划由亚马逊 AWS 与日本 Saison Capital 联合发起，Torum 也获得 AWS 用于支付云端平台费用的长达一年的 Grant 与技术支持。Torum 所构建的面向 Web3.0 的生态模型，也进一步得到了众多用户的支持。Torum 产品在 2018 年年底诞生，从早期就开始不断的积累社区用户，目前用户注册量已突破 10 万，日活近一万、周活超三万、月活十万。\n\n用户群体主要来自一些以英语为主要沟通语言的国家，如美国、加拿大、新加坡、马来西亚等，也包括欧美的一些国家，例如法国、波兰、德国、西班牙、拉脱维亚等。Torum 目前的用户体量，也是行业内少有的。Torum 在拥有了丰富的资源及强大的社区的积累后，才在今年下半年宣布了上币的计划，Torum 也得到了市场的高度认可。Torum 生态通证 XTM，于 9 月 14 日在 Zendit (MantraDAO) 以及 Scaleswap 上举行 IDO，并在 9 月 15 日上线 Uniswap，首发一小时交易量近 1,000 万美元成功登上 DEX 代币热度榜第一名。\n\n并登上海外知名加密数据聚合网站 CryptoRank.io 7 日热度榜第一，当日超越了 Solana 和比特币。背靠巨大用户群体的 Torum，热度可见一斑。另外，Torum 作为火币资本与 Kucoin Labs 双头部交易所旗下基金所投资的项目，有望在不久的将来登录火币与 Kucoin。 \n 可以预见的是，DeFi、NFT 以及 GameFi 后，SocialFi 将是下一波热点，而 Torum 也将有机会接过 SocialFi 的热度大棒。无论从 Torum 的生态模型、技术模型，还是市场进展，都能瞥见 Torum 的潜力，并得到了各方的认可与肯定。不过目前 Torum 生态整体仍旧处于早期，且估值偏低。**而伴随着某个合适的时机，Torum 或将在不久顺势爆发。**\n\n免责声明：作为区块链信息平台，本站所发布文章仅代表作者个人观点，与链闻 ChainNews 立场无关。文章内的信息、意见等均仅供参考，并非作为或被视为实际投资建议", "timestamp": 1636771675, "digest":

"![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17341f2d34842583fd4a1445.png!800.jpg)\n\n作为美股市场最近一两年最大的传奇, [特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)在去年6月初受破产传闻影响跌到$177, 之后的13个月上演了一部王子复仇记, 股价到2020年7月10日上涨了传奇的770%, 把所有的空头们/怀疑者们在短时间内爆仓两次. 更加传奇的是, 在疫情大跌后, 作为并不受益的汽车企业, 疫情后跟着科技板块大涨, 在周五更是超越了福特, 通用, 宝马, 戴姆勒, 大众几个大型国际汽车企业的市值总和. 特斯拉创始人/老板Elon Musk在周五也有幸在个人财富上面超越了股神巴菲特, 净资产达到700亿美金, 成为世界上第七富有的人.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17340e886d3404a3fcff9177.png!800.jpg)\n\n两周前[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)还在$900-1000之间整理的时候, 有朋友问我, 特斯拉能做空吗? 我告诉他, 特斯拉并不算高估, 只是估值恢复成了奢侈汽车公司的估值. 原来没有Model 3 的时候, 特斯拉和[法拉利](https://xueqiu.com/S/RACE?from=status_stock_match)一样, 市销率在6倍左右, 最近两年随着M3的大幅量产, 低毛利造成市销率大幅缩水, 开始向传统车企的估值靠近.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/173410b3e7a3fea3fd696b79.png!800.jpg)\n\n但很多空头没有搞清楚的是, [特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)本质上是一家科技公司, 科技是人类第一生产力, 创新是资本市场最贵的资产. 所以去年下半年, 上海超级工厂快完工后, 特斯拉就开始他的\"复仇记\". 在资本方面, 像[文艺复兴](https://xueqiu.com/S/RLRN?from=status_stock_match)这种大佬也在2019年四季度进场, 期权大单也是源源不断, 各种800, 1000, 1200价位的看涨期权, 看得大多数期权玩家一脸懵逼, 那个时候TSLA才刚刚突破前期收购价$420. 随着下半年一个接一个的好消息, 特斯拉的股价一直涨到今年2月份, 2月的估值高点也在6倍市销率左右.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17341156e2b40113fe0eb3bf.png!800.jpg)\n\n2月份[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)成功完成180-900翻4倍的伟大征程, 可惜遇到了百年一遇的全球疫情, 加上大队长毒奶做多, 股价又跌下了$400. 但随着央行无底线放水, 大盘在3月下旬开始反弹, 特斯拉可能很久都不会看到$400以下, 甚至$550以下了.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/173411ca7d440483fd34f4fb.png!800.jpg)\n\n4月份, 我曾尝试做空[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match), 公司爆出由于提前复工, 工厂有员工被感染. 后来看见果然只是横盘整理就止盈了.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/173411e040140803fceb6496.png!800.jpg)\n\n之后我就一直看多[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match), 不管是估值上有很大空间, 情绪上也有很多指标: Robinhood上并不算火热(他们去炒航空了), 不断的看涨期权大单, 大队长做空.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17341cbd6f343073fe1e5a79.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1734121007f40833f899527b.png!800.jpg)\n\n回到两周前, 我提过不跌下960还是看突破, 后面跌到了937但又拉回来了然后迅速突破1000-1020, 开始疯涨超过50%. 牛旗可以说是技术分析里面最基本的图形了, 从下图可以看出[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)在过去三个月已经有多次日线牛旗了. 只要大盘稳住, 特斯拉没有财报刺激很难大跌, 所以我还是看牛旗突破. 后来果然突破了.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1734102b1193f2b3fd001639.png!800.jpg)\n\n这两周也有朋友问我[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)能买吗? 我的回答是, 可以啊, 短线做波段嘛. 设好止损就行. 并不适合长线投资的建仓.\n\n我想[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)最坚定的多头也会承认, $1000以上的股价并不适合投资了. 因为特斯拉的估值已经属于泡沫的范畴. 也许特斯拉十年后能涨到3000-4000. 但现在真不值$1000+. 没有任何基本面能够支撑股价一周30%的涨幅. $1000以上买入的机构和散户只是在追求动能, 继续吹大泡沫, 而不是在投资了. 这并不代表特斯拉短期不能上1800, 甚至2000.\n\n泡沫是什么, 股价对基本面预期的过度乐观就是泡沫. 泡沫在资本市场上十分常见, 如果没有泡沫的话, 大家直接去买指数ETF就行了. 泡沫有大有小, 像NKLA这种没有销售的百亿市值公司照样有分析师跪舔, 像ZM这种市销率破百的\"疫情科技\"公司(就一打视频的). 前几年的GPRO, TLRY, BYND. 这些都是极端的泡沫. [特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)的泡沫也不是个例, 是大环境所致. 3月美股见底以来, 资金大幅流入科技板块, 造成很多科技股的估值都进入了泡沫的区间.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17341376c9c407e3fda2c504.png!800.jpg)\n\n泡沫并不可怕, 创业板科创版哪个不是泡沫, 大家还不是炒的很happy. 我并不反对泡沫, 但作为散户想参与泡沫, 最好还是找有高增长的泡沫, 增长不止泡沫不破. 为啥现在科技股天天新高, 就是因为他们过去一直有高增长. 像大多数传统企业本来就是低增长, 经济[好时](https://xueqiu.com/S/HSY?from=status_stock_match)有点增长, 经济差时付完利息能不亏钱就算不错了, 你说资本在疫情的大环境下怎么配? 纳斯达克不断新高也就不意外了.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/173414945b441263fe0b5a94.png!800.jpg)\n\n错过过去3个月涨幅的朋友就会问了, 那科技股能买吗? 我的回答是, 可以逢低买(Buy the dip), 但不能长线投资.\n\n像我今年赚钱最多的股票FSLY, 股价从低估涨到了高估, 从高估又涨到了泡沫, 现在泡沫还在不断变大.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/173414dfe8441d13feb3b5ae.png!800.jpg)\n\n本来是长线投资的低估科技股, 刚翻倍时我还觉得能逢低加仓, 但前几周实在是涨得太多就锁利了. 后来我FOMO进去做波段, 又赚了一笔. 我80多再次进入的时候就是短线, 雪球上也回复了止损就在前一天的低点.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/173414ebd1c41213fd36144e.png!800.jpg)\n\n像TSLA, FSLY, ZM 这些都是泡沫, 去长线投资泡沫在任何时候都是亏钱或者长年被套, 但泡沫一样有很多短线机会 (几天到3个月).\n\n科技股泡沫维持只需要两个前提: 1.增长不止. 2.大盘不崩.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/173419d7b8742e03fcf4c5d4.png!800.jpg)\n\n聊完泡沫, 再聊聊疯牛. 最近两周A股涨了16%, 大家都说14-15年的疯牛又来了. 很多人把现在美国科技股和1999-2000年的互联网泡沫做对比, 有很多相似之处: 散户大幅进场, 科技股一枝独秀, 市销率破10的公司越来越多. 那么纳斯达克现在是不是疯牛呢?\n\n我觉得还不算, 现在只是少数科技股(前图)进入泡沫的阶段. 但如果你用心去找, 也能找到FB GOOG, 包括刚暴涨的BABA, 这种估值依然合理的科技股. 像云服务/软件股这种平均20倍市销率的, 就妥妥是泡沫了. 只能做短线, 一旦像去年9月这种趋势变了, 得赶快出场.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/173417b006541c43fde3b5fc.png!800.jpg)\n\n由于互联网泡沫是二十年前, 大多数人都低估了当时投资者的疯狂程度. 我记得有本书里采访对冲基金经理, 他说他做空亏了50%, 反手过来做多又赚了8倍. 当时炒科技股, 完全不看基本面, 盈利销售都是零, 就看网站访问量. 而且不是一两个, 是所有纳斯达克里面的科技股都这样, 那才是疯牛.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1734183e0dc425f3fc2058f6.png!800.jpg)\n\n当时做硬件的[思科](https://xueqiu.com/S/CSCO?from=status_stock_match)CSCO市销率都达到了36, 还不说其他那些做网站的科技股了. [微软](https://xueqiu.com/S/MSFT?from=status_stock_match)当时市销也接近30. 现在新高的[英伟达](https://xueqiu.com/S/NVDA?from=status_stock_match)市销也就刚上20. 只是泡沫而已.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1734182f0e141ce3fe0bafb1.png!800.jpg)\n\n现在还不算疯牛, 市场疯牛时会吓跑最坚定的多头. 过去十年的三次疯牛: 2014-15美国生药股疯牛, 2014-15中国A股疯牛, 2017-18年比特币疯牛. [科技龙头](https://xueqiu.com/S/CSI931087?from=status_stock_match)现在就几个涨得厉害, 其他的都是碎步小跑而已, 啥时候QQQ每周10%, 那才叫疯狂. 在疯牛的时候, 就别谈啥投资了, 就是一群人的高潮, 击鼓传花, 别做最后一个人, 如果运气不好, 就赶紧止损, 去传下一朵花.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/173418ae84141e93fec55662.png!800.jpg)\n\n疯牛的特性就是谁也无法预测什么时候结束, 有可能下一次抄底就抄在山顶了, 所以在疯牛中短线止损非常重要. 疯牛中千万不要做空, 宁愿错过上涨也别做空, [特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)空头们坟草已高. 你所认为的山顶说不定只是山腰. 每一次疯牛都不同, 没有人知道能够涨到多高, 也许像15年A股那样到不了前期最高点, 也有可能像比特币一样远远超过最高点. 看看下面的周期图, 很多人都觉得现在我们在\"Return to normal\", 意思就是股灾还没完呢. 万一, 三月底只是\"Bear Trap\", 4-5月的散户拿着救济金进场只是\"Enthusiasm\"呢? 还记得歌舞升平的上世纪二十年代(Roaring 20s)吗? 现在刚好也是这个世纪二十年代的开头.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17341a3c03141f73fedc320e.png!800.jpg)\n\n那我现在看多吗? 并不, 我相信正常人都能看出经济和股市现在分化很严重, 美国疫情第二波继续大规模扩散, 大多数重开的商业活动又关闭了或者进行的并不理想. 市场所有的目光都会放在下周开始的2季度财报上面, 如果市场由于对2季度财报和3季度预期的失望而向下进行二次探底, 相信大多数人都不会很惊讶, 10日均线以下做好对冲就行, 200日线不破很难二次探底. 但也有可能市场直接不关心基本面了, 机构和散户正式开始疯牛, 分析师也会注重于一些修改后数据, 比如前段时间开玩笑说的EBITDAC.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17341a70bfc425b3fe041899.png!800.jpg)\n\n现在市场情绪是贪婪, 大多数投资者在极度兴奋, 怎么看也不是好的投资时机.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17341ab64ba43073fef42ba1.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17341a92dc342e43fd93e88c.png!800.jpg)\n\n然而1999-2000年市场在极度兴奋的氛围中持续了一年多, 现在才三个月. 历史告诉我们在市场极度兴奋时长线投资, 未来12个月的投资回报会很差.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17341acadab425c3fd08cb33.png!800.jpg)\n\n每次发帖都有人问, 我对未来3个月的走势怎么看?\n\n我自己是预测不了大盘走势的，外面能够预测的人不是骗子就是走狗屎运，Zerohedge预测美股崩盘预测了10年，最后只是因为有个傻子吃了蝙蝠，不是所谓的FAANG泡沫，不是央行通胀失控，不是原油危机，也不是川普当选。也没必要过度神化预测，预测准了也不一定能赚钱，2月份不少人跑去买乱世黄金一样亏废了, 我认识不少人就慢慢加仓科技现在也赚了不少。跟着自己的纪律慢慢做就行，保持胜率，控制好止损，自然能赚钱.\n\n如果实在对长线仓位不知道怎么做, 像我早上说的, 现在可以减少到40-50%过二季度财报季, 拿剩下的钱买国债TLT, 等美股每次下跌5-10%就抄底一次[科技龙头](https://xueqiu.com/S/CSI931087?from=status_stock_match)FANGMAN. 我三月份就是这样干的, 每次熔断就定投一部分积蓄. 像现在这种极度兴奋时也可以通过卖call买put来零成本保护创新高正股, 但不适合TSLA, FSLY, ZM 这种每天爆涨的泡沫.\n\n如果未来几个月真的开始疯牛, 你也可以用一部分钱来做短线波段. 现在从技术面看3185刚好就是6月以来的牛旗高点, 一旦突破标普短期就有新高的可能, 当然也有可能是双顶. 所以我说二季度财报十分重要, 真开始疯牛, 如果标普未来一年涨个50%, 纳指翻一倍什么概念?\n\n那将是二十年一遇的机会, 一代人的狂欢.\n\n原文发表在雪球,

总统大选年的季节性走势\n\n稍微对美股季节性有一点了解的投资者都知道, 一般5月(Sell in May)和9月从历史数据上看都是走弱的, 而大选年 [#美国大选将于11月3日举行#](http://xueqiu.com/k?q=%23%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E5%A4%A7%E9%80%89%E5%B0%86%E4%BA%8E11%E6%9C%883%E6%97%A5%E4%B8%BE%E8%A1%8C%23)  往往会导致9-10月美股波动增加, 大盘下跌的概率比其他月份要大. 我之前在两周前也说过, 美银还好心专门发了一个note.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466201885124803fe52977.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17411a1d8a19bb03fcdd72d5.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174661f1039124713fe7007b.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 苹果特斯拉拆股大涨\n\n7月30日盘后苹果宣布分股, 到8月31日分股结束, 累计上涨34%.\n\n8月11日盘后[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)宣布分股, 到8月31日分股结束, 累计上涨81%.\n\n稍微有点金融常识的人都知道, 分股其实对公司基本面没有任何影响. 但理性分析抵不住人性的贪婪, 各大新闻媒体借机大肆宣传分股后股票就便宜了,再加上苹果分股的前车之鉴, 用\"事实\"来吸引散户大规模进场买入. 就像我之前[从特斯拉一周暴涨近30%谈谈泡沫和疯牛 ](https://xueqiu.com/1679375089/153756881)一文中提到的, 市场疯起来是不讲道理的, 可以涨到最坚定的多头怀疑人生.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466301017125313fda19eb.png!800.jpg)\n\n我反复说过疯牛的时候少做空, 既然机构散户都在疯狂拉高特斯拉, 那最好的方法当然是加入他们啊. [特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)从我$1530开始做多, 一路涨到了拆股前的$2315, 接近50%的涨幅.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174663849971248f3fee77d3.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466ed25e412b643fd52d3b.png!800.jpg)\n\n既然分股前大涨, 那分股后做空就在意料之中了. 我9月1号做空了[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match), 2号做空了苹果, 感觉棒棒哒.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746644e57b122c83fee198b.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746642165f122a83fed3919.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 半导体也疯狂\n\n科技股里面一般是云服务和软件股比较喜欢疯涨, 但今年半导体一反常态地强势, 让人不禁想起1999-2000互联网泡沫. 我早在4月就发过, 半导体是3月股灾以来反弹最快的板块, 苹果的店铺关门和手机发货量剧减对上游半导体企业的影响完全不在投资者的考虑之中, [英伟达](https://xueqiu.com/S/NVDA?from=status_stock_match)和AMD涨到了20-30倍市净率, 上百市盈率. 从三月底部上来, 英伟达涨了227%, AMD涨了171%. 相比2月历史高点, 基本上又涨了快一倍.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174664adc4e126ae3fe41731.png!800.jpg)\n\n我在8月中有做多[英特尔](https://xueqiu.com/S/INTC?from=status_stock_match), 因为比起另外两个实在太低估了. 做多英特尔一个月收益差不多有10%, 做空[英伟达](https://xueqiu.com/S/NVDA?from=status_stock_match)和AMD那次大跌后迅速反弹也就被止盈了.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174664915e4126143fd124f6.png!800.jpg)\n\n疯狂的投资者继续挥舞着钞票在百倍以上的市盈率买入, 我六月底在$365左右继续看好[英伟达](https://xueqiu.com/S/NVDA?from=status_stock_match), 但财报前$495真下不去手. 还有朋友问我英伟达财报那么亮眼, 盘后怎么没涨. 我当时的回答是\"机构也不知道这个价位是该买还是卖, 70倍的EV/EBITDA, 60倍的自由现金流折现率对于一个三千亿市值的公司基本上是难以想象的.\"\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174665842b5126d43fd148d6.png!800.jpg)\n\n而过去一周的周线图是一个上影线和下影线都很长的candle, 也是预示着投资者也不知道该如何去估值这两个半导体巨头.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174665b23c0125fc3fea0211.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174665f32c8127523fee0769.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 妖股财报前预跑, 财报后大跌\n\n今年二季度财报不少妖股都是财报公布前大涨10-20%, 财报后又跌回原样, 让做预跑的人大赚一笔, 割了赌财报波动的韭菜. 这个跟炒分股差不多, 财报再好也price in了, 手慢很容易就高位接盘了.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746667d2ad126923feb03a3.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466c01a1b12d833fbb3d76.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 史诗般的榨空\n\n截止9月1号, 高盛跟踪的做空占比最高的股票指数从3月底部上涨了116%. 我之前讲过的电商妖股Wayfair半年不到从$20涨到了接近$350. 今年疫情第一股ZM, 从年初的$68涨到了上周高点$478. 当然今年空头损失最多的股票非[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)莫属, 3月低点的$70涨到上周的$500, 空头去年9月到今年2月这波榨空还没缓过来, 又被马斯克开着18轮大卡碾了一遍.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746692ca73129b33fdf510a.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746678b8eb12af43fe7b29b.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746690077b128bd3fc549f7.png!800.jpg)\n\n中概股里面的明星股也是涨到国内投资者天天高潮不断, 宇宙第一网校[跟谁学](https://xueqiu.com/S/GSX?from=status_stock_match)(+422%), 地表最强电商[拼多多](https://xueqiu.com/S/PDD?from=status_stock_match)(+228%), 还有中国版\"[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)\"蔚来汽车(+897%). 如果你看着几百倍市盈率跑去做空, 那真的是底裤输光的交易(Widow-maker trade).\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466b1068812ae63fe9486b.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466b5e032129943fe84c67.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 高管卖票\n\n如果你还记得, 3月见底的一个很准的信号是公司内部高管的大幅买入. 7月美股迎来了高管的大幅卖出. 卖出往往没有买入那么准, 因为高管卖出股票的因素有很多, 但大幅卖出也是值得注意的. 很多前期明星股和榨空股也是被高管在历史新高或者30-40倍市销的估值套现.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174667c5ee6128af3fd2c127.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746696862512be13fdfb9af.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466a926e412c933fe607b2.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466a2ddc712caf3faa9395.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466a9b0cc129a53fcade89.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 上市潮和增发潮\n\n另一个和1999-2000年互联网泡沫相似的是聪明的公司利用天天新高的资本市场来发股筹钱, 为可能会到来的金融危机做准备.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466d43b8812e053fed17f0.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466cf9b06129743fdf7f1d.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466dbce8512d993fc1843c.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466db44cf1287a3fd7a4c8.png!800.jpg)\n\n当然, 借着零利率大举发债的公司更多. 没收入要破产的公司发债续命, 满手现金的公司发债回购股票推高股价.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466e6bb41129e93fe91fb8.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466e236c1129de3fe0c63b.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466e2aef312e503fd9a99a.png!800.jpg)\n\n还有空头毁灭者[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)的骚操作:\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466e9e42512c2b3fd670e2.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 大队长反买, 别墅靠海\n\n早期关注我的朋友都知道, 大队长今年做[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)反指到了幸运女神都要惊讶的程度. 2月份的880止损做空, 940开始做多; 4月份的500-600再次开始做空, 700以上不断做空然后被强平, 跟他反着做简直就是印钞票.\n\n8月底两次做空再次被强平止损.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466f8e5ef12b943feb0992.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466fb804512ee73fdfacd4.png!800.jpg)\n\n之前说的输掉底裤的做空对象, 是的, 大队长像集邮一样有好几个: ZM PDD TSLA AMD\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466fcddfd12a643fef83de.png!800.jpg)\n\n更搞笑的是, 这次大队长全雪球闻名的3千块悬赏, 和6月份抱怨做空太难的悬赏一样, 悬赏时间还没过大盘就开始瀑布了.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466ffbd0d12e9e3fd670c9.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17466fa38e912ca63fcfef4d.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 期权大鳄vs期权韭菜\n\n先说一下Robinhood上面后浪们炒末日期权, 其实之前讲过几次, Wallstreetbets 上面也有一群勇士拿着自己一辈子的积蓄梭哈, 仅仅为了几天甚至是几个小时的刺激. 这些短期期权交易量的上升, 导致做市商去买入股票来对冲gamma风险, 被动地推高股价, 这些在几个[科技龙头](https://xueqiu.com/S/CSI931087?from=status_stock_match)的走势上面都可以看见. 最具代表的例子就是去年12月到今年2月[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)这波疯涨, 就是去年12月份有人买入远期600, 800的看涨期权. 记得有个做市商买对冲仓都买成了5%的股东了.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17467174a9a12b103fcc893d.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746736adfe12eff3fb6fbc1.png!800.jpg)\n\n与之相对的是软银为代表的机构大鳄, 一般机构很少重仓期权的, 但现在疯牛的大环境下, 机构拿出了一小部分资金, 配置期权这种高风险高回报的投资工具并不令人惊讶. 机构买期权一般是3-6个月以外的, 要么是深度价内, 要么是ATM call spread. 8月数笔千万级别的期权单子集中在3天, 现在被怀疑是软银一家机构买入的. 我当时在雪球上也有发布.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746725aa7412ba33fb3bd32.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746725f6ba12fb73fee41dc.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746726a48312cee3fe301aa.png!800.jpg)\n\n期权大单每天都有, 几十万到几百万规模的很多. 但一天之内数笔几千万级别的期权单子十分罕见, 所以很有可能就是一家机构布局的, 在资本市场上这种铁头娃非孙正义的软银莫属. 然而, 这种规模的看涨期权, 对市场的影响是很大的, 最直观的影响就是[科技龙头](https://xueqiu.com/S/CSI931087?from=status_stock_match)FANGMAN在8月的Melt up, 三倍科技龙头ETF (FNGU) 创下上市以来最大月涨幅一个月上涨了73.5%, 比4月份的历史性反弹还长得多(59.8%). 与此同时, 这些大单对投资者的信心也是一针强心剂, 大佬在3月上来股价翻倍的情况下依然敢大仓买入, 你还不快点抄作业?\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746729d3cf12fd63fe12af5.png!800.jpg)\n\n至于那些阴谋论唱衰软银的柠檬精们, 看着美股连跌了两天就觉得孙正义被花街吊打了, 孙正义的期权投资(豪赌)现在还在水上, 而且就从未平仓数来看也许他还没卖, 这不代表他不能在高位做空正股进行锁利. 软银买的也不是末日期权, 你看看我上面发的, 很多都是大选之后或者明年初的期权, 之前还有不少SPX QQQ明年12月的call spread, 别人的时间还很长.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174672eabb812ffe3fe1642d.png!800.jpg)\n\n像我疯牛那篇文章所说的, 谁也不知道疯牛会涨到哪里, 说不定标普3500只是一个起点, 你以为1999-2000年只有几个月的疯牛, 殊不知前无古人的互联网泡沫从96年就开始了. 孙正义单独拿一部分钱来做期权, 就是和那些炒比特币的基金一样, 要么赚到撑死, 要么全部亏完. 如果FANGMAN这些巨头都像[英伟达](https://xueqiu.com/S/NVDA?from=status_stock_match)那样20-30的市销率来估值, 那现在的新高依然有很大的上升空间, 当然这个操作最后会怎么样, 还有待时间来证明.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746734ef9812e293fce1576.png!800.jpg)\n\n更加疯狂的是从8/21开始, 机构不断地买入上千万的看涨期权, 而不是相对保守的call spread. 股价基本上也是买入就暴涨. 从CRM到ZM, 基本上撑死胆大的, 饿死胆小的.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746744a4a112f413feb030d.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746744cbe512b5f3fe87fd2.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746744ec4412fbb3fe02858.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17467461af212fc73fdfa6c1.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746748390c12e493fe65e63.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746a0ebf51143df3fe9bcdb.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 机构对冲大选风险\n\n另一方面, 也有人能在狂欢的众人中保持清醒. 老巴的名言: 别人贪婪我恐慌.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746a0f1938ee03fca1a0c83.png!800.jpg)\n\n我们早在8/26就开始布局VXX来对冲下行风险.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174674cb7031313f3fc29968.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174674d8b0b131463fc59d24.png!800.jpg)\n\n之后几天, 很多机构也开始买对冲的看跌期权, 导致大盘和VIX同时上涨.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17467519a2412d633fd48f61.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174675d3d3e12eae3fe71c05.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174675d5d2912f6a3fcf7c64.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174675d7b14132743fa3f985.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174675d9639130e93fe0651d.png!800.jpg)\n\n####

最后的疯狂 - ZOOM\n\n这周ZM财报后大涨40%, 市值两天涨了500亿美金, 属于最后的疯狂. 再次惊讶于人性的贪婪和疯牛的不讲道理. 有机构周一花350万买入了1千张明年三月的380看涨期权, 一天获利一千万美金. 有趣的是, 这周ZM刚好在100倍市销率见顶.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17468fef7d0bd33fdc80991e.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/174690f40ac13da13fed31a6.png!800.jpg)\n\n受其影响, 另一个疫情利好股DOCU, 财报前就预跑33%, 有人更是以$10的价格卖出了末日$400的看涨期权(超最高价价外40%, 超上周收盘价86%) 财报后的暴跌也在预料之中, 加上大盘的下跌, 周线收了一个尚方宝剑, 誓要斩死贪婪的人.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1746903bdc313ea83fd53b03.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 成功的交易\n\n除了分股后做空[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)和苹果以及提前做多波动率, 追空妖股的收益也不错.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17468fa19b2bac3fe8198ba0.png!800.jpg)\n\n####

"十二月比特币终于突破了2018年高点, 引起了越来越多人的注意, 刚好圣诞节涨了30%心情不错, 在这里聊一聊普通人为啥应该配一些比特币.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/176a14c62d4163333fd646d7.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 目标价\n\n7月底比特币破万的时候, 我发过一个三角突破图形(别人画的), 我也是从那个时候开始密切关注比特币. 当时图上的两个目标现在已经达到了, 这几天我又加了两个新的目标价:\n\n1\\.$15600. (2020/11/5达到).\n\n2\\.$23773. (2020/12/17达到).\n\n3\\.$33000.\n\n4\\.$40000.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/176a1e9ccf9165c13fec943b.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 免责声明\n\n我不是啥币圈大佬, 4-5年前第一次了解比特币是从李笑来老师的公众号(当时刚刚上千美金), 觉得他定投一个一万块钱的东西有点大胆. 后来比特币冲到3千, 我尝试去买但加拿大很难买, 而且也不太安全, 当时听说paypal上面很多骗子. 后来2017年的大牛市, 信息再闭塞的人也知道比特币, 区块链了. 当时啥白皮书黑皮书区块链ICO啥都读了, 最后还是没下决心参与那场狂欢. 后来比特币一发行期货就开始雪崩, 基本上也算是投资者情绪最高潮了. 我也没有在最低点大幅买入, 只是今年夏天开始关注和渐渐买入的.\n\n说这么多不是要炫耀啥或者反省啥, 就是我不是那种砸锅卖铁满仓梭哈的死多头, 就一个普通投资者, 围观比特币潮起潮落的投资者. 所有的看法不是投资建议, 只是我个人的见解.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/176a1ed7e9f163e43fd1cb50.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 比特币为啥涨\n\n我个人比较喜欢简单直接(第一原理), 比特币概念/原理可以吹几天几夜, 其实很简单, 你把他当黄金或者钻石就行.\n\n黄金为啥涨? 通胀预期, 稀有资源. 不然一个屎黄色的石头为啥那么贵. 黄金是没有基本面的, 为啥老巴几十年说黄金就是一个石头, 因为你无法研究基本面, 没有收入和盈利. (老巴不投资黄金并不是错误, 他投资公司和伟大公司一起成长, 就跟绝大多数投资者不投资古董, 油画一样, 不是同一个种类资产类别Asset class). 没有基本面不代表不能涨, 既然有涨就有跌.\n\n你如果能理解投资黄金, 那比特币也很好理解, 相当于高科技版本的黄金. 各国央行放水堪比2012电影里的大洪水, 黄金更稳涨得更慢, 比特币年轻人多, 投资时间长, 有的是时间来折腾(装死).\n\n钻石为啥贵? 人(商人)赋予它了一个意义: 永恒. 人类简史里面说过: 社会上大多数东西都是人造的, 大家共同认可并赋予的意义, 东西就有意义了. 现在比特币有啥意义: 虚拟货币.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/176a19fce38164fe3fe26529.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 虚拟货币\n\n我觉得虚拟货币很多人一听就觉得不靠谱, 电子货币听起来舒服一点. 传统货币(买菜用的钱)为啥有价值, 就是政府背书, 中国美国强, 那人民币美元就有人要, 非洲中东战乱国家政府自己都保不住, 那他们发行的只能拿来当草纸. 传统货币为啥值钱, 因为大多数人认可它的价值, 交易时愿意接受同等价值的货币来替代以物易物.\n\n这是我看多比特币的一个理由:\n\n从比特币2018年泡沫破裂后, 价格从19666跌到3122(-85%), 它并没有成为历史, 也就是说在世界上某个地方有人愿意买入比特币, 认可它的价值. 我想未来这一点依然会成立.\n\n#### 区块链\n\n各个国家各个金融机构都在研究区块链技术, 很多科技大佬说这是互联 网之后的下一个大的浪嘲. 那比特币作为区块链最早期最广泛的运用, 是不是最保险, 至少比那些乱七八糟的币靠谱吧, 作为一个普通人, 配置一些虚拟货币, 首选就是比特币, 就跟买龙头一个道理.\n\n至于区块链未来会怎么样, 我也不知道, 不管发展快与慢, 有人愿意拿纸币换比特币就行.\n\n#### 比特币会被封吗\n\n很多人担心ZF或者哪个公司/金融机构把比特币给搞没了, 还是回到第一个类比: 有谁能禁止黄金吗? 能禁止钻石吗? 我觉得比特币反而会更贵.\n\n风投大佬Naval Ravikant的原话:\n\n*The real argument for Bitcoin:A scarce, digital, trustless, stateless, universal, divisible, durable, verifiable, portable, unseizable, and programmable store of value.*\n\n你如果理解比特币的本质, 就不会担心.\n\n#### 人性和信仰\n\n回顾一下比特币的历史, 它是08-09年金融危机后的产物. 因为越来越多的人对金融机构开始失去信心, 金融机构很多是私人的, 它会犯错也会坑爹.\n\n人都是自私的, 质疑也是基因的一部分, 欺骗更是一个超脱时间的主题. 几年前读过的一句话: I am bullish on bitcoin because distrusting establishments is in human nature.\n\n怀疑的另一面是信仰, 圣经只是一本书吗? [特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)只是一辆车吗? 市面上有很多电子货币, 为啥比特币最贵? 我觉得因为它是一种信仰, 一种没有地域限制, 没有语言限制的信仰. 你不需要去信谁, 没有谁是救世主, 它最底层是科技, 简单又美丽.\n\n很多人拜金, 金钱至上, 比特币只要能换成钱, 换成车子房子, 和传统货币又有多少区别呢?\n\n#### 比特币处于哪个阶段\n\n当李笑来老师开始拿工资买币的时候, 那时候还有人可以挖矿, 当不受压迫的淘金人. 2017年的大牛市之后, 挖矿基本上不可能做无本买卖, 预期收益也普普通通. 我也不懂别人在挖啥, 我的投资理念是建立在市场上流通的比特币上面, 其他的东西不是硬核粉丝我也搞不懂. 你买黄金会关心哪个公司挖出来的吗? 比特币也是一样, 还没有纯度产地的问题, 一个币在中国和美国代表的价值是一样的, 也许不同交易所有溢价, 但本质上是同一个东西.\n\n不管是投资比特币还是投资黄金, 都是另一种资产, 投资矿机公司或者金矿企业是投资公司. 公司就要看业绩基本面(壳公司除外). 像NVDA AMD 我直接看公司的业绩增长, 没必要加上比特币的光环.\n\n#### 大佬背书\n\n如果说2017年只有死忠粉, 科技潮人, 阴谋论者在买比特币, 2020年就是传统投资大鳄开始正视这个诞生仅仅十年的新物种. Paul Tudor Jones (PTJ) 稍微对金融史有了解的都知道这位大佬, 成功预测87年股灾一天赚了索罗斯十亿美金(1987年的十亿哦). 在大宗 商品交易方面, 他自称第二, 没人敢称第一. Druckenmiller 就不用多说了, 索罗斯的首席操盘手, 最近十年老爷子投资科技股回报也不比老虎俱乐部的小年轻们差.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/176a186036c166533fdec343.png!800.jpg)\n\nBill Miller是做Mutual Fund的大佬, 太低调了我之前都不知道, 今年3月19号喊底之后让我发现了这位大牛. 他在11月(比特币到我第一目标)时也看好比特币. 而且Mutual fund和Hedge fund区别很大的: MF 属于传统投资, HF属于另类投资(Alternative). 传统投资大佬发话, 那比特币也不是高风险对冲基金的宝贝了, 大家都能买.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/176a18aaea2163793fe4bab3.png!800.jpg)\n\n说比特币不得不提GBTC, 还有那肥得流油的溢价(Premium). 前两年又不少花街资金做空GBTC做多比特币想做个无风险套利, 但最后发现比特币最低的时候GBTC的溢价依然存在. 在我来看, 这主要是因为美国养老金401K可以直接投资GBTC, 而不能买电子货币. 而且作为有资产的前浪们, 直接买币有很多不确定因素和技术门槛 (大妈们能照相能用微信已经很厉害了).\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/176a1eac1b71665f3fdf0d76.png!800.jpg)\n\n最近不少公司在买币, Square 把公司的现金$100M转换成了比特币, 上个季度财报的出了小惊喜. MSTR 这是个僵尸公司, 本来准备把现金转成比特币布局一下新科技, 结果发现比特币上的收益比公司主业还赚的多, 现在在向GBTC一样的持币壳公司方向发展.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/176a1992e4e163223fd31068.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 资产配置(Asset Allocation)\n\n前面有提到, 比特币不是一个公司, 他是一种货币, 也许你不认可, 或者某些机构不认可, 但只要有人愿意拿人民币美金等传统货币跟我交易, 他就是一种货币. 作为一个普通投资者, 也许很难去买一个搞不懂基本面商业模式的东西, 但从资产配置的角度完全可以说得通. 一个20多岁的年轻人跟朋友说他有几个比特币和一个40多岁的中年人和朋友炫耀自己有收藏青花瓷或者和田玉是一个道理.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/176a1eb1dc7166603fe39cd9.png!800.jpg)\n\n如果你不会买比特币, 买GBTC MSTR 这种壳公司也行, 或者买SQ PYPL 这种新一代电子支付龙头, 喜欢刺激炒炒比特币垃圾股RIOT MARA也行. 当然女股神的 ARKW 也有GBTC.\n\n#### 新的可能\n\n最近马斯克在twitter上展现了他对比特币的兴趣, 几年前Martin Shkreli 也说过有钱但不知道哪里可以一次性买比特币. MSTR 的CEO非常\"好心\"的帮忙了.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/176a1b186951669c3fda2e25.png!800.jpg)\n\n在现在负利率的大环境下, 科技 龙头们账户上几百亿的现金, 基本上在money market吃土. 如果, 他们愿意拿一小部分的钱转换成比特币, 会是一种什么景象? 尤其是想做支付的FB, AMZN, 或者小一点的SHOP, SE. 作为科技 龙头的长线股东, 我并不反对. 苹果都想造车蹭头条, 买个比特币有啥问题?\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/176a1b704a9167003fe30cfc.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 价值的储藏 (Store of Value)\n\n最后在聊一聊比特币的高波动性, 很多空头天天看跌美股看多黄金, 对比特币却望而止步, 每天只知道酸溜溜地喊泡沫. 黄金是泡沫吗? 肯定啊, 有小行星上黄金储量是全球的几十倍, 黄金只是宇宙中一种普通的金属元素而已, 只是地球上比较少, 还不是靠人炒起来的. 炒的时间久了, 大家就觉得靠谱了. 对于10后来说, 黄金和比特币又有多大区别, 都是他们出生之前的产物.\n\n很多人觉得比特币一会儿三四千, 一会儿两三万, 波动太大, 不能作为价值的储藏. 我反而觉得高波动好, 给普通人很多机会可以抄底. 比特币跌得厉害, 涨得也厉害啊. 黄金是稳定, 但13年后六年熊市也很惨啊. 至于哪个更有价值, 我也不知道, 都是人赋予的价值, 我觉得跟着科技的潮流走, 问题不大. 至于你是高买低卖还是低买高卖, 那亏钱只能怪自己了. 彼得林奇的基金十三年年化29%, 依然有投资者亏钱了. 最近大火的ARK基金也是一个道理, 很多人看到高回报买入在低回报的时候卖出, 最后并没有吃到基金的红利.\n\n最后说一下女股神的50万目标价, 我不知道会不会达到, 这一波能到我的第四目标我就很满足了, 长线配置肯定不会动的, 希望能像\"古董\"一样留给下一代, 也许到时候他们觉得比特币确实是\"古董\"呢.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/176a1ee1109165723fb150cc.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/176a1c70541165693fae1598.png!800.jpg)\n\n写于2020圣诞, 比特币$26.8K.\n\n持仓披露: 本人持有比特币和SQ AMZN FB SE股票.\n\n原文发表在雪球,

"过去一周可以说是资本市场自去年3月连续熔断以来最精彩的一周, 作为一个直接参与者, 不和大家吹吹牛好像都对不起这么大一个瓜. 我写的东西很杂, 都是一些个人观点, 非投资建议, 如果你对我个人这周的操作感兴趣, 请直接跳到最后一部分.\n\n#### 背景介绍\n\n1/14注意到GME轧空, 1/15我发过一个看多GME的帖子, 里面也包括了12/31做空比122%,更早的有详细分析Michael Burry 去年一季度加仓GME:\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17757364c69554cf3fb12d94.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/1775736ee5754f003fde730f.png!800.jpg)\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17757384e0a552c13f7ff4e1.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 散户大战机构? 图样图森破\n\n媒体最喜欢, 最吸引人眼球的故事, 不是势均力敌的高手对决, 而是屌丝逆袭打败高富帅迎娶白富美走上人生巅峰的故事. 在资本市场里面, 没钱只能看热闹, 有钱才能砸个响.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17755648d6a54bb43fe73e95.png!800.jpg)\n\n吃瓜看戏, 先搞清楚两边都是什么人, 不然你也看不懂.\n\n先说多头(对股价影响力逐步降低):\n\n5%以上的大股东(12/31) 包括传统基金FMR, Blackrock, Vanguard.\n\n新董事Ryan Cohen (RC Ventures), 对冲基金Scion Capital (Michael Burry), Permit Capital, Senvest Capital.\n\nCEO George Sherman 3.4%, 亿万富翁Donald Foss 5%.\n\nSusquehanna International Group 这个是量化交易的做市商, 由于卖出太多call, 只能买入正股来对冲风险, 实现Delta neutral (不做多也不做空). PS 2019年12月到2020年2月[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)的那次Gamma squeeze最顶峰这个公司也\"被动\"成为特斯拉超过5%的大股东.\n\n最近几周进场的不明势力, 就是我上面截图那些大单买Call, 准备行权来逼空的机构.\n\nWallStreetBets(WSB)上面暴富的散户DFV Keith Gill 以及他的信徒.\n\n再说空头:\n\n几十家Equity Long/Short的对冲基金, 代表性的Melvin Capital, Point 72, Citadel, D1 Capital, Viking. 他们是这波轧空亏损最大的, 因为做空成本在$8-15, 很多都持有空仓好几年了.\n\n新空头, 就是最近两周才进场的, 因为我看截止周四做空比依然高达113%, 如果很多机构止损了, 那肯定有新机构进场做空, 为啥要区分一下, 因为新空头现在300-500是不会止损的, 不像老空头们已经亏废了要么止损, 要么关门.\n\n(Chamath和Citron仓位很小, 忽略不计, 只是和Musk, Cuban一样有名人效应)\n\n从上面可以看出, 最近两周大涨有两个变量: Ryan Cohen在1月11日拿到三个董事席位, 不明机构多次购买千万级深度价内看涨期权. DFV和Burry其实和空头已经战斗1-2年了, 他们最近并没有改变策略, 属于[#价值投资#](http://xueqiu.com/k?q=%23%E4%BB%B7%E5%80%BC%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84%23)  躺赢. 而WSB新进场的散户, 只能算运气好搭上了RC还有做多机构的顺风车. 而本来就做空的对冲基金, 属于人在家里坐, 祸从天上来的苦主.\n\n这里说一下Long/Short strategy, 是股票对冲基金最常见的策略: 130%仓位做多, 30%做空 (1.6倍杠杆). 这也是为啥去年3月底对冲基金大幅减仓做空仓位, 有钱加仓抄底的原因. 另外一种常见的策略是Long only, 也就是100%做多, 比如Abdiel, 红杉, Ark这种. 做多股票多种多样, 但做空的股票其实就那几个夕阳板块, 零售, 油企, 或者极度泡沫股 (之前[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)就是花街最喜欢做空的\"汽车股\"). 做空标很少, 一直都很拥挤, 所以一般这种被股票20-30% float short很常见, 但L/S必须要保持做空仓位, 所以即使最大利润只有那么几块钱也只能拿着空仓. 而机构无法第一时间止损的原因, 是因为止损只有一种方法, 同时减少做多仓位和做空仓位, 这也是周三大盘下跌的一个因素, 俗称降杠杆.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17756be4d6c54d373fdbbe2d.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### Robinhood到底扮演什么角色\n\n先说一下交易股票的流程, 美股大多数是T+2, 也就是说如果我买了一只股票, 今天下单买入, 要两个工作日才真正到我的名下 (Settlement). 今天下单卖出, 要两个工作日后才拿到现金. 具体流程: 买方 => 券商 => 结算所(NSCC/DTCC) => 券商 => 卖方. 因为转钱/股票有T+2, 这里买方有可能出现拿不出钱的情况, 所以券商对买方有所谓的保证金要求 (Margin Requirement), 如果账户里面钱不够, 就会收到催命连环margin call, 若是没按时转钱进去就会被强平仓位, 如果这个交易损失太多, 账户里面其他投资产品也有可能被平仓拿来补钱.\n\n在交易当天, NSCC也要求券商交一个交易押金, 因为NSCC是不能亏钱的, 所以如果客户出不了钱, 券商最后就得自己掏腰包. 押金计算很复杂, 包括VaR, Gap risk, MTM计算, 简单来说就是波动越大的股票要求押金越高.\n\n至于为啥券商会不够结算金, 是因为有客户无法偿还欠款, 也就是借券商的钱来交易(margin trading). 这里面最惨的就是裸卖Call和直接做空股票, 他们是多头的对手盘, 多头赚了多少钱, 空头就赔了多少钱. 如果遇到没有及时止损, 客户有可能直接爆仓宣布破产, 因为做空的风险是无限的, 券商只能自己掏钱补上缺口. 08年贝尔斯登和[雷曼兄弟](https://xueqiu.com/S/LEHMQ?from=status_stock_match)就是杠杆太高无法偿还结算金直接宣布破产的. 下面这位苦主就是一千万港币眨眼间灰飞烟灭.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17755a33dfb549063fdb8ab7.png!800.jpg)\n\n作为美股散户最多的券商Robinhood周四禁止交易 GME等短期波动巨大的股票其实并不算太出格, 其他几个券商当天也出台了相似的规定. 为啥要禁止交易, 最大的可能就是NSCC提高了押金要求, 正常股票(APPL)押金应该在5-10%左右, 我估计GME由于gap risk大幅增加波动剧烈导致押金上升到了30-40%. 但周四NSCC很有可能把GME的押金要求直接提高到了100%, 因为他们担心一旦交易量太大, 券商无法支付结算金, 而产生流动性危机, 这也是为啥Robinhood当天筹资10亿美金来确保充足的流动性可以支付押金和结算金. 押金被提到100%, 相当于券商自己要帮客户提前两天支付交易费用. GME周四以前的要求是20-30%押金是可以直接从客户账户里面当天转走, 剩下的如果有margin, 客户两天内补上就行. 但现在券商作为一个盈利公司不会干这种高风险没回报的事, 尤其是在很多客户有可能面临无法支付的情况下, 只能先一刀断臂, 阻止更大的风险.\n\n至于Citadel是Robindhood最大的金主, 这其中也许有影响, 但Robindhood作为风险最大的券商(散户最多还在不断有新账号开通), 不管Citadel有没有影响都会停止交易, 提高margin requirement来保护自己. 个人觉得要说Citadel能影响IB, TD等多个跨国券商, 不太可能, 所以大概率是NSCC的要求在周四发生了改变. 当然有些券商可能比较聪明, 继续保持交易, 这样相当于免费广告, 吸引客户, 如果最后亏一点钱就当广告费用了, 交易GME也只是一小部分. 但Robinhood不能这样做, 因为他已经身上绑满炸药包了. 至于RH周四有传言限制其他股票交易甚至在保证金足够的情况下强制平仓, 如果属实肯定会有法律后果的.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17756c5dcdc553443fe1786e.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 谁在违法? SEC到底该抓谁?\n\n现在主流观点是SEC应该抓WSB里面的人, 罪名是恶意操纵股价(Market Manipulation), 但问题是WSB现在有700万用户,你不可能都抓啊? 谁是带头人, DFV也许是最高调赚钱最多的人首当其冲, 但他的帖子并没有让人去买买买, 从来都是详细说明自己为啥看好还有秀自己的账户, 并没有故意操纵股价. WSB上面让人买买买的人数不胜数, SEC不可能都抓. 当然我觉得DFV不应该公布真实身份, 而是应该把钱转到海外, 人也尽快离开美国. 因为到了这种程度, 他最后肯定会被罚款甚至判罪. Burry也觉得现在WSB抱团轧空GME已经不是正常的市场行为了, 而且和08年一样, 他知道见好就收, 落袋为安才是王道.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17755ceedd35534f3fe1db71.png!800.jpg)\n\n我觉得Market Manipulation确实存在, 但并不是DFV这种普通人, WSB里面肯定有新多头(最近几周进场的神秘势力) 请的水军或者自己的马甲在里面带节奏, 这种事情他们经常干, 最后SEC没有证据也抓不到人, 美剧Billions里面也演过. 其他很多Reddit用户只能算跟风, 可以算受蛊惑的群众, 炫耀一下自己赚的钱也算不上操纵股价.\n\n而周四收盘前最后2分钟买五千万看涨期权恶意榨空, 这个机构如果不知道Robinhood盘后会宣布周五取消交易禁令, 我是不信的.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17755d48ceb553553fd45d94.png!800.jpg)\n\n当然在媒体的大幅宣传下, 一个交易已经上升到民粹主义, 个人vs机构, 资本家压迫百姓上面, 最后谁输谁赢, 很难说. 我觉得最有可能WSB里面比较高调的人被罚款, 比如DFV. 苦主们(L/S对冲基金们) 则会因为业绩表现不好, 被投资者赎回, 甚至名声太臭也有可能关门, 他们也活该, 太贪婪了不做好风控, 市场先生妥妥教你做人. 而券商Robinhood自己先要坚持到流动性危机过去, 然后被客户大面积起诉, 最后还要经受客户用脚投票. 说实话, 这些所谓的\"反派\"其实并没有犯法, 所以SEC也不会找他们. 至于Musk, Chamath, Cuban这些名人, 受言论自由保护, 也算不上Market Manipulation.\n\n#### 美国资本市场的进化\n\n就像社会在不断进步一样, 美国资本市场也在慢慢进化. 上一次进化是08年金融危机之后, Dodd-Frank的推出对资本市场进行了很多限制, 比特币的诞生让不信任机构和政府的人有了其他选择, 美联储连续推出四轮QE为之后十年的牛市保驾护航.\n\n这次又会怎么样呢?\n\n首先做空机制肯定会被调整. 这次轧空最大的原因是超过100%的做空比, 因为一股多卖, 股东A把他的股票借给B卖空, 股东C买到了, 她还可以继续借给D卖空, 相当于凭空制造了更多的流通股, 像这次GME这种极端情况下做空比超过流通股总数. 这也不是啥新问题, 资本市场一直都知道这个漏洞, 而一股多卖也算不上Naked short-sell (这个是非法的). 现在区块链技术Distributed Ledger就可以完美地解决这个问题, 也许券商在未来会使用.\n\n然后是券商的保证金要求会被提高, 这次事件充分体现了当散户多了之后, 各种奇葩作死行为对整个系统流动性的影响, 如果一群散户YOLO着把券商差点弄破产, 那保证金要求和风控标准会大幅提高. 2020年的大波动, 期货交易所已经增加了保证金的要求. 还有就是卖期权以后有可能会受到限制, 这次那么多人爆仓就是因为股价波动发生了黑天鹅, 这次GME AMC的股价变化都超出了20个标准差. 当然这也和2020年大量散户进场买股票买期权有关, 像Gmma squeeze这种现象未来可能会越来越频繁.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/177568ae4e454a8b3fd75bd7.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### Cathie and Chamath的影响\n\nArk的Cathie Wood和Chamath Palihapitiya, 在我看来他们正在彻底改变金融行业的玩法, 这是很激动人心的.\n\nArk旗下几个基金也完爆整条华尔街, 过去任何指标都大幅跑赢大盘. 其实Ark成功主要原因就是她们投资只看前景不看估值, 投资都是Disruiptive Innovation, 用的是Price-to-TAM(Total Addressable Market), 用风投VC的思考模式进行投资. 最成功的案例就是[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)分股前200-300的时候给出4000的目标价, 世人笑我太疯癫, 我笑世人看不穿. 很多散户也是马斯克的信徒, 所以这一波二十倍涨幅也是赚得盆满钵满, 相反华尔街和CNBC由于偏见普遍错过了这只大牛股. 导致现在Ark的一举一动都会造成股价的波动. 不看估值这个也有利有弊, 牛市的时候大赚, 而泡沫破裂的时候就完蛋, 因为讲故事简单做实事很难, 所以最后还是要靠仓控和止损. 像老孙2000年互联网泡沫成了世界首富, 没有及时出场最后全砸手里了.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17756d102cc5516b3fd31b6a.png!800.jpg)\n\nChamath本来就是风投, 他致力于推行SPAC借壳上市, 这个在A股很普遍的操作其实在美股市场并不常见, 因为公司上市基本上得通过投行路演, 就是在华尔街拜一下山头. 而最近的Direct listing和SPAC上市就是绕过华尔街投行直接上市, 既简单又便宜, 当然这动了很多人的蛋糕, 所以华尔街对Chamath的普遍印象就是吹牛逼的骗子(Stock Pumper).\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17756d1a01254b5e3fd62439.png!800.jpg)\n\n他们俩在做的事情就是打破旧规则, 这对散户投资者其实是一个好事, 大多数散户投资者基本上无法参与美股打新, 很多新股出来就暴跌(LYFT), 要不就是估值高到离谱(SNOW). 也许SPAC上市成功股价大涨, 但相比IPO上市的暴涨已经很厚道了. 而ARK经常去抄底暴跌股或者low float股票, 其实也是给这些公司更多的曝光率以及提供流动性, 杜绝原来几个对冲基金控盘逼死好公司的情况再次发生.\n\n#### De-Finance 去中心化金融\n\n大家都知道美国股市散户占比很少, 整个资本市场都是由机构垄断, 90%的交易量都是电脑程序操作, 疫情发生以后越来越多散户跑步进场, 美国股市以后也许不会像A股那样散户和机构扳手腕, 但可以预见散户的参与度会越来越高, 现在Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, Reddit, Tik tok各种社交网络平台上炒股博主如雨后春笋般涌现. 这个原因还是因为老一代财经新闻媒体太垃圾, 新一代投资者需要更好的信息渠道. CNBC基本上就是华尔街的传话筒, 天天就各种Pump, Mad Money, Fast Money, 一听就不是正经人. 能活这么久还是因为华尔街对资本市场的高度控制, 散户参与度极低, 只有发生大跌了才看看财经新闻. (我觉得这和美国人数学水平普遍不如亚洲人有关)\n\n现在人人都是Influencer这个时代, 加上疫情被关在家, 最有意思的\"游戏\"就是金融赌场 - 股市了. 在这里你的对手有可能是从业30年的资本大佬, 也有可能是拿零花钱炒股的中学生, 大学生. 屌丝也有逆袭的可能, 乱拳有时也能打死老师傅, 加上不用听上司唧唧歪歪, 所以WSB经常自嘲是深度自闭症患者 (Autist).\n\n从比特币到[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match), 散户渐渐有了自己的投资逻辑, 不再只听信华尔街分析师或者基金经理, 对巴菲特这些OG大佬也只有尊敬没有盲目崇拜. 而对于香橼浑水这种做空机构还有Zerohedge死空头更是过街老鼠, 人人喊打.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17756da018854cfc3fe90291.png!800.jpg)\n\n当然, 如果你以为散户能和机构扳手腕就太天真了. 不管是2020年下半年比特币大涨, 还是[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)股价一年半上涨20倍, 又或是GME史诗级榨空, 背后都是机构的推手. 散户的力量太弱小了, 以前算是蚂蚁, 现在也只能是个小孩, 只能跟着大人们后面喝汤. 中国在股市散户普及化上面比美国起码领先好几年 (也不知道是好是坏), 很简单一个问题, 美国有牛散吗? 美国人大多数年轻人甚至中年人还在为还清学生贷款, 早日当上房奴而奋斗.\n\n#### GME终局\n\n我最近看到很多人在猜GME最后会怎么样, 其实没多大意义:\n\n第一, 现在股价早已脱离投资的范围, 就是投机赌博, 大家都知道他不值这个价, 一年后肯定不是这个价, 大概率从哪里来回哪里去.\n\n第二, 最容易的钱已经被赚了, 一只股票9个月翻了100倍做到家喻户晓, 那之后再翻10倍的可能性很低了. 政府监察机构也不会对这种乱象视而不见的.\n\n第三, 散户本来就是跟着机构喝汤的, 做多机构已经盆满钵满, 做空机构已经坟草已高, 再多的散户也难以影响大局, 加上各大券商已经限制散户买入.\n\n第四, 现在打破僵局只有管理层增发股票, 政府/SEC有可能当中间人, 因为这一波空头已经亏废了, 也得到教训了. 现在有新空头, 但多头有可能会逐渐离场了, 风险收益比已经变差了.\n\n至于什么时候增发, 谁也不知道, 但逼急了SEC可以直接让公司停牌, 随便给个理由扰乱金融市场啥的. 我也不知道下周会发生啥, 这本来就是小概率极端事件, 就像去彩票里面找规律一样, 没有任何意义. 也能赚钱, 本质上就是Follow the money.\n\n而期权超高的IV更是割韭菜, 赚钱只能靠高买低卖. 周五走势很无聊基本上就被做市商Market Maker(MM)控盘挡在了$320以下, 尾盘也没有很多人预计的gamma squeeze, 因为做市商MM早就计划好了, $320刚好是周三期权最高的strike (这是散户能买到的最高strike, 也是买的 OI 最多的), 我记得周三时 $200C (周二最高strike) 最高也就$120-130, 所以这个控盘杀期权是杀的很猛的, 一刀下去韭菜死了不知道多少. 当然, 如果你不相信MM控盘这个理论, 那还是买股票吧, 只有涨跌, 没有其他因素.\n\n要知道, 美股市场这个游戏规则本来就是华尔街制订的, 机构是既得利益者, 散户赢钱的概率是很低的, 只有一种情况可以改变: 长期投资. 像我去年3月中旬的长文[论抄底 ， 心态 ， 散户优势](https://xueqiu.com/1679375089/143854315)里面说的, 散户可以删软件几年不看, 基金经理每个月每个季度都要看业绩. 当然, 如果有机构读到了我7月的长文[从特斯拉一周暴涨近30%谈谈泡沫和疯牛](https://xueqiu.com/1679375089/153756881)就不会做空疯牛了.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/177573bb3d154f133fea334c.png!800.jpg)\n\n#### 简单复盘\n\n第一笔, 周二突破$90做多GME call, 尾盘大部分获利, 剩了两张200C彩票到周三早上出掉.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17756f7b834550643fdb40ef.png!800.jpg)\n\n第二笔, 周四IB不能交易, 用XRT call替代, 130-240, 230-275.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17756fb784954bd93fe18a4d.png!800.jpg)\n\n第三笔, 运气很好, 周五下午买入正股做gamma squeeze, 250-300/325.\n\n![](https://xqimg.imedao.com/17756fe0a99553fd3fe7b00f.png!800.jpg)\n\n总的来说, 第一笔赚钱最多, 也是趋势最明显的, 第二笔风险最大, 但由于交易工具的限制, 其实XRT波动要小很多, 也没赚多少, 第三笔周五下午拉了不少, 但没有达到我的预期360-400, 后来收盘前也就走了.\n\n这周反复强调, GME就是一个投机, 高收益也有高风险, 小仓玩玩可以或者用利润玩, 我也是抱着参与历史的心态玩的, 最后运气不错. 这种小概率事件不能和投资混为一谈, 投资寻找的是确定性, 用长线的眼光, [慢慢变富](https://xueqiu.com/S/CSI2031?from=status_stock_match).\n\n####

It is Roblox's ability to build, change and expand that makes it so popular. In official Roblox parlance, a game cannot be called a game, but an Experience. By the end of 2020, Roblox users had created more than 20 million experiences, 1,300 of which had been visited and explored by the wider community. These experiences are created by the user, not the company. \n\nUsers spend 2.6 hours per day using Roblox and explore about 20 experiences per month. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Roblox had 37.1 million average daily live users. More than half of those users are under the age of 12. Children aged 9 to 12 accounted for the largest share, at 29 percent. Only 15 percent were over 25 years old.\n\n在手机、和VR耳机上，创建一个的用户世界可以获取，然后访问虚拟游戏机用户在手机、虚拟游戏机（Robux）来，2020年，Roblox拥有49 万付费用户。\n\nRoblox 是这样简单的：玩家购买 Robux，之后消费 Robux，开发者和创作者投资构建 ux 游戏可以使用 Robux，这些 Roblox 到游戏中、再投资或兑换成现实世界的货币可以。当用户购买物品再或服装时，支付给该物品的 Robux，Roblox，只收了少量的 Robux。但开发者开发人员的 10 个 Robux 有资格加入“人员交流”计划，该计划将 Robux 转换为美元。 2020 1月至9月，用户累计充值12亿美元，消费5.9亿美元。201年，公司总充值为20亿至21亿美元，消费金额为15亿美元。2020年，Roblox了9.24亿美元。的收入，证明创造了80.39%。\n\nRoblox 增长迅速，但没有盈利。Roblox 在 2020 年亏损了 2.6 亿美元。亏损是由于 Roblox 对平台和社区的维护，这将奖励创作者和开发者的一部分收入。这已超过基础设施和安全成本，成为总成本的最大份额。\n\n成本结构也反映了 Roblox 创造的飞轮效应。随着越来越多的开发者创造更好的内容，该平台吸引了更多的用户。反过来，平台聚集的用户越多，它鼓励越多的开发人员通过 Roblox 接触其不断增长的用户群。\n\nRoblox 现已在 180 个国家/地区上市，该公司希望通过投资翻译辅助技术来打入其他市场。该公司还通过与游戏和科技巨头腾讯的合资企业来探索中国市场的巨大潜力。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RUkN_cuSY6ag1c36rIueL.jpg?height=600&width=788)\n\n", "timestamp": 1636773204, "digest": "9e-ImhWrImU9A-qnHNucEqX3yjLE0apf249ScabKa3c", "contributor": "0xc24BdaB6ECd6202716FA621CeD06Fe39658C3ED0"}

不到4周超过37万阅读.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J6N95eCyPSn03HnRlDlU_.png?height=142&width=722)\n\n写在最前面:\n\n1\\.NFT是一个新玩意儿, 下面写的都是根据我的经历和调研后的个人观点, 非投资建议. \n\n2\\.NFT/加密货币从去年以来已经涨了5-100倍不等, 了解其风险. \n\n3\\.和我之前写的比特币长文一样, 也许只有1/10的人看懂了, 1%的人认可了, 我只是给大家扫个盲, 如果你觉得比特币是庞氏骗局, 那我也不指望你能看懂NFT, 就当了解一下年轻人败家的新项目吧.\n\n#### 前言\n\n2021年是一个新的开始, 我们见证了华尔街认可后一年10倍的比特币, 又见证了打遍天下无敌手的Ark Investment, 也见证了被18轮大卡碾死的GME空头, 还见证了世界首富马斯克带货一年150倍的狗狗币. 大多数人都在寻找下一个\"比特币\", 这个时候NFT一词火了。 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ORx-Nloa1cFR0_-tzhIbE.png?height=450&width=800)\n\n#### NFT是什么?\n\nNFT全名是 Non-Fungible Token, Funglible 是替代的意思,也就是说NFT是不可替代的凭证. 生活中很多东西都可以替代, 你在北京和上海买的iPhone 12就是可替代的, 你在美国和英国买的比特币也是可替代的，你今天买的茅台股票和我昨天买的茅台股票是可替代的。 \n\n那什么是不可替代的呢? 科比亲笔签名的篮球, 巴黎卢浮宫里面的[蒙娜丽莎](https://xueqiu.com/S/SZ002918?from=status_stock_match)的微笑, 美国华盛顿特区的白宫的地产凭证，推特创始人Jack Dorsey的第一条推文。  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d7F8sF5jCQMfeABAs0LYN.png?height=179&width=643)\n\nNFT是一个缤纷多彩的世界, 我在过去2-3个月的调研可能仅仅了解到了一些皮毛, 接下来的三篇长文会尽可能介绍几个比较有代表性的NFT, 试图解释一下为啥有人会花钱买张照片, 为啥NFT可能成为区块链在商业上最成功的应用。 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RB1sEegkpYt0cruoiYkVO.png?height=727&width=761)\n\n#### 球星卡能卖钱吗?\n\n相信大多数人听说过球星卡, 有的人小时候可能还收集过. 球星卡有可能是干脆面送的, 也有可能是[麦当劳](https://xueqiu.com/S/MCD?from=status_stock_match)家庭套餐送的. 哪个同学能如果拿到一张乔丹在班里是大家的崇拜对象，说不定班花都要另眼相看. 随着年龄的增长, 儿时的球星卡也许已经遗失或者破损了, 大多数人也不会想到有人愿意花几万甚至几十万买一张完好的球星卡, 一个儿时的回忆。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/41Qn8cLtHY0kq8rPd2huZ.png?height=387&width=800)\n\n有可能很多人小时候不喜欢看篮球, 那神奇宝贝卡 (宝可梦) 小时候总玩过吧. 小时候在地上随便乱扔的神奇宝贝卡现在已经可以称之为“古董”了。1999年版的喷火龙卡在3年前卖5万美金, 现在已经涨到了20万美金以上。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xUmSroCUrDPBu5tjhyaNo.png?height=372&width=800)\n\n如果还是不懂为啥一张卡能卖那么多钱, 想想邮票吧. 相信很多中产家庭都有每年买邮票的习惯, 每年发行的邮票既是对这一年发生重大事件的记录, 也有一个对未来升值的预期. 过去十年有人还用过邮票吗？那为啥大家每年照样在买。  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Nwg37ZGUl0ZrMpySJs2u9.png?height=638&width=637)\n\n老一辈人集邮, 新一代人集卡. 而NBA Top Shot 则是新时代的集卡平台。 \n\n#### NBA Top Shot\n\n作为NBA的周边商品, 球星卡在最近几年销售低迷, 年轻人玩的的东西五花八门, 购买球星卡的人越来越少. 一家叫Dapper Labs的公司突发奇想, 既然球星卡在Ebay上面炒到了天价, 为何不把所有的球星卡电子化, 货币化, 唯一化。就这样, Dapper Labs拿到了NBA的授权, 并和NBA一起推出NBA Top Shot, 世界上第一个区块链上的球星卡交易平台. 现在NBA Top Shot已经成为了一个接近10亿市值的市场, 日均交易额达到两百万美金, 拥有球星卡的用户数从年初的4,796增长到了46万人。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y0kx606lrDNfi6yeFSBtY.png?height=450&width=800)\n\n和传统的球星卡不同的是, 这种球星卡只能在网上观看, 并不是可以用手摸到的实体卡片. 很多人可能无法理解, 连卡都没有还买啥. 我先说一下这种新球星卡的优点:\n\n无法造假, 每一张卡都在区块链上面, 没人可以复制仿造;不会遗失或者损坏, 很多老卡为啥珍贵就是因为发行量稀少, 保存到现在完好无损的更少;新卡是动图, 老卡只是一个球星, 新卡代表了一个球星的一次华丽进球或者助攻;新卡在互联网上连接了全世界的NBA球迷, 包括我这种伪球迷也因为收集卡开始看比赛了. 球星卡的主要获取方式是开限量卡包, 到现在为止开卡包基本上是稳赚不赔的. 因为最便宜的卡都要卖$5, 最便宜的普通卡包只要$9, 里面有三张卡。由于这个原因, 每次空投几万卡包（Drops) 都有20-30万人排队, 可谓是一包难求. 最近几次稀有卡包($99)和传奇卡包($999) 都开始对账户还有交易金额增加限制, 因为很多人开小号或者用[机器人](https://xueqiu.com/S/CSIH30590?from=status_stock_match)作弊抢包。 \n\n普通卡包, 稀有卡包, 传奇卡包对应的就是普通卡, 稀有卡, 和传奇卡，稀有卡包里面保底有一张稀有卡，传奇卡包也有一张传奇卡，普通卡也能开传奇但概率很小。每次空投的时候, 提前进入等候室, 然后电脑随机抽签, 抽中前面号码的人就有资格在15分钟内买卡包. 普通卡包空投5-10万不等. 稀有卡包只有1-3万, 传奇卡包只有2-3千. 购买卡包需要通过Dapper Labs, 要么用信用卡支付(5%手续费), 要么用Coinbase转入比特币或者以太币支付。  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KkcQAManNBPMZRuZAjD2e.png?height=564&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O0TzS9slFapEZH8BioZFD.png?height=392&width=800)\n\n#### 球星卡能赚钱吗?\n\n能, 但2-3月的十倍大牛市已经过了. NBA Top Shot进入很多人的视野是在3月初, WSJ报道了一个全仓17万的老兄半年时间赚了2千万。那个时候也是NFT最热的时期。 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ifpGykJkmRRy7ACgPezna.png?height=548&width=682)\n\nMichael Levy现在依然是Top shot上面最大的个人账户, 他的账户从3月最高点已经跌到了1千2百万, 跌辐超过40%, 但 ROI依然高达23,643%。这也是区块链球星卡的另一个优点, 任何一个人随时可以看见他的\"持仓\", 因为所有交易都是透明的, 唯一的。 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EcCjY4qL3V49Dc23m7BxG.png?height=190&width=800)\n\n另外一位早期参与NBA Top Shot的NFT大佬Pranksy回报也是很不错, 去年底很多人嘲笑他是接盘侠, 2-3月这一波也是赚得飞起。 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rnypTkGa6468OMfyV5hIa.png?height=190&width=800)\n\n但大多数和我一样3月才进场的人并没有享受到球星卡的升值红利, 只有时不时的空投卡包能赚个饭钱. 下面Leonard的Series 1普通卡的走势很典型, 很明显可以看见1月下旬有一个涨幅(Series 2推出), 然后2月底到3月初的FOMO(15K的卡成为限量般，NBA球星开始集卡，电视/网络/新闻铺天盖地), 3月之后球星卡进入了40-50%的熊市, 同时也是\"NFT冬天\"。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YsPxcYU3LZcNcvd4toNbP.png?height=275&width=800)\n\n#### 为啥球星卡跌了这么多?\n\n这就和我之前说的\"稳赚不赔\"的空投卡包有关了, 因为抢到卡包的人大多数是炒家, 而不是球星卡收藏家(愿意长期持有球星卡的人). 炒家们用小号, [机器人](https://xueqiu.com/S/CSIH30590?from=status_stock_match)增加每次抢到卡包的概率, 一开包就在市场上卖出. 这些人增加的Supply多了, 球星卡的价格就下跌了. 而球星卡的价格在市场上是以最低卖价决定的(Floor Price), 炒家们互相竞争以更低的价格出货变现, 买家们也不断观望等待未来更低的价格。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uxMUi6LCtknVfKGCPx984.png?height=391&width=800)\n\n拿上面詹姆斯的15K张的普通卡举例, 最低价现在是$439, 这张卡的市值是$439x15000=6.58M。但这样算其实是不对的, 因为每张球星卡都是不同的. NFT为啥是不可替代, 是因为  [#1/15K和#](http://xueqiu.com/k?q=%231%2F15K%E5%92%8C%23)  5000/15K两张卡是不同的, 虽然是同一个进球, 买家是不可能用同样的价格买到这两张卡的. 从下面交易历史可以看见有一张卡能卖到7万美金是因为他是#23/15K, 刚好是詹姆斯的在湖人队的号码, $9抽到这张卡的是真欧皇. 而低序列的卡(前1%）也普遍比高序列的卡卖得贵。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZswdegqtaH-tIIj9gr25i.png?height=381&width=800)\n\n再深一步, 现在市场上只有1532张挂着卖, 意思是另外90%的卡持有者并不准备卖出. 而市场上挂卖的卡也不都是挂$439, 从下面可以看见如果你一口气准备买10张, 你可以把Floor price推到$455, 相当于用4千多美金让詹姆斯的这张卡的市值涨了24万. 所以2月底为啥很多卡能几天涨10倍, 就是因为低价挂单的卡都被新用户买光了, 供不应求。  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_mfKhtkO3wh1EauyZGXUd.png?height=716&width=800)\n\n和股票不同的是, NFT的所有交易都是在区块链上的. 也就是说, 任何人都可以看见这张球星卡的所有交易历史, 包括卖家的成本是多少. 从历史上看是用户direct_msg开$9卡包得到的, 以$445的价格卖给了3inthekey, 3inthekey两小时后又以$559的价格卖给了现在的持有者Noslen, 25%的回报. 而Noslen现在准备以$439的价格割肉了, 预计亏损22%。  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rmN23d_Qi5FpnPAKU8F7e.png?height=278&width=800)\n\n像3inthekey这种炒家有很多, 因为NFT的数量少, 流通性很差, 有些时候能割一些FOMO的韭菜, 我也认识$5扫货的朋友, 扫到就挂$8出, 蚊子再小也是肉, 但肯定比不上开卡包那种稳赚不赔. 随着新卡包的不断推出, 开卡包后的炒家们的甩卖, 球星卡的价格就不断下降, 收藏家们的账户价值也不断的缩水。\n\n#### 展望未来\n\nNBA球星卡没戏了吗？ 我并不觉得, 全世界有4个亿篮球迷, 1%的人收集球星卡也是400万用户，现在Top shot才46万持卡用户(还包括了小号)。我觉得稀有卡和传奇卡肯定是有长期收藏价值的, 像下面这个詹姆斯的传奇卡最近还创了新高, 接近39万美金卖出, 这个传奇卡是詹姆斯纪念科比的灌篮, 全世界只有59张, 现在市场上也只有一张挂着卖。 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FxxVb80uLf-ppswqqOzKh.png?height=214&width=700)\n\n总的来说，NBA Top Shot有三种方法赚钱：\n\n排队等空投，赚钱靠老天。\n\n以最低价买入大量垃圾卡, 等待下一个大牛市。\n\n以合适的价格买入巨星的限量卡（稀有或者传奇更好）, 长期收藏价值。\n\n当然还有很多种方法, 球迷们可以自己去发现: 包括晚上低买早上高卖, 买入低估的年轻小将, 买入马上要退役的球星, 买入新秀球员Rookie of the Year, 买入赛季MVP, 收集整个Collection来达成challenge获得免费限量卡(我看最近的Luka challenge风险收益比还不错)。\n\n其实官方也知道很多炒家在吃免费的午餐，所以最近也开始实行空投的买入限制，未来卡包赚钱的概率会慢慢和亏钱的概率持平，也就是Expected Value等于卡包的价格。平台刚开始为了吸引用户，有这种免费午餐很正常，用户达到一定基数之后市场就逐渐成熟了。而作为新平台很多系统问题，取钱问题，在未来都会逐步解决，这个新一代球星卡是不可逆的，以后的球迷只会慢慢熟悉他的存在，愿意集卡的人就上Top Shot。\n\n我会在未来继续低价买入一些我看好球星的普通卡或者稀有卡，如果侥幸遇到下一波大牛市，说不定能赚一个詹姆斯或者库里的传奇卡, 如果没有大牛市就当收藏品了。\n\n而上周新上线的MLB Topps棒球卡, 炒家们又有新的午餐了。我个人本来就不看棒球，还有棒球卡不是动图，就没有亲身参与了，有兴趣的棒球迷可以看看。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0j1ktxcxAGdoswui7QhpL.png?height=367&width=800)\n\n我最期待的还是FIFA在未来推出足球的球星卡，足球是全世界最受欢迎的运动，明年世界杯如果同时推出区块链上的足球球星卡，不怕没销量。可惜的是，很多和我们一起长大的传奇现在已经接近退役了。 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OqZB-12X9IrXe7CNO1hh3.png?height=552&width=800)\n\n看球集卡一直是球迷的习惯，NBA Top Shot利用新时代的区块链技术把传统球星卡革新了，也造福了全世界的篮球迷，我相信篮球只是第一个，未来还会有更多运动或者其他活动推出区块链上的周边，演唱会门票，电影首映式门票，甚至是旅游景点打卡

\n \n\n#### 前言\n\n上一篇讲了NBA Top Shot推出的区块链球星卡, 即使你不是球迷, 应该也能理解为啥有些人愿意花钱去买虚拟的球星卡. NFT的项目多种多样, 有些我能看见价值, 有些感觉就是传销骗局或者消费粉丝经济, 但也有可能是我目光短浅, 毕竟直到现在还有人说比特币是庞氏骗局.\n\nNFT 是存在于区块链上不可替代的唯一凭证, 在区块链上加东西是以太坊ETH的创新 - 智能合约（Smart contract), 今天就讲一讲世界上第一个NFT项目, 以太坊上的 CryptoPunks. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IeklRuQcaqqRaJM4CNJsp.png?height=312&width=624)\n\n(2021.3月迈阿密的公告牌)\n\n \n \n\n#### Cryptopunk是什么？\n\n在2017年的夏天，一家名叫Larva Labs的软件公司写了一个电脑自动生成头像的程序, 这个程序一共生成了一万个不同的24x24像素的艺术头像, 每一个头像都是利用人工智能算法随机生成然后再人为筛选的, 比如有些是戴墨镜, 有些是抽电子烟, 有些是双马尾, 有些是莫西干, 作画的风格是受70年代赛博朋克(CyberPunk) 影响.\n\n2017年是比特币的大牛市, 那一年涨了18倍, 但位居第二的以太币在上半年就涨了50倍. Larva Labs的两位创始人一琢磨, 与其做一个市面上差不多的社交应用或者手游去和Facebook, 腾讯去竞争, 还不如做一个全新的东西. 于是他们决定把这一万个朋克头像和区块链结合起来, 但是当时连以太坊的ERC-721标准都还没建立, Larva Labs仅仅把朋克头像的哈希值(可以理解为解锁每一个头像的密匙)上传到了以太坊区块链上, Cryptopunks就此诞生.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IgoqrilxIXZC6xlVItyG5.png?height=498&width=764)\n\n（以上截取一小部分，所有punk在[Larva Labs官网](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)都能看见）\n\nCryptopunks刚诞生的时候并没有多少人注意到，恰逢以太币泡沫刚刚破裂，短短两个月价格从每枚$420跌到了$130. 很多投资者损失惨重，估计这辈子也不想再听到以太坊和智能合约了. 于是, Larva Labs的两位创始人决定留下1000个头像作为项目酬劳, 剩下的头像全部免费发放给以太坊社区, 只需要在官网填写你的以太钱包地址并支付几毛钱的运输费(Gas Fee)就能领取. \n\n有趣的是, 免费的也没有人领, 上线后两周只有小几百个被领走. Larva Labs去找Mashable博主写了一篇[推广软文](https://mashable.com/2017/06/16/cryptopunks-ethereum-art-collectibles/), 才成功把剩下的全部发放完毕. 而这9000个一共也就发给了几百个人, 最多的一个人认领了上千个, 认领了超过300个的人也有好几个. 当时币圈的大多数人都看不懂 Cryptopunk的价值, 一个随时能复制粘贴下载的头像为啥还需要认领/购买. 但正如软文博主最后说的一样, \"也许有一天, 拥有一个Punk是一种身份的象征, 一张证明你是币圈OG投资者的凭证, 也有可能仅仅是一张普通的图片\". \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zBL-XxEQDVpA-G-vx-fuN.png?height=189&width=657)\n\n(Mashable: This ethereum-based project could change how we think about digital art)\n\n

Cryptopunk的现状\n\n在Larva Labs[官网](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)上面可以看到, 交易额前十个Punk交易额总计2500万美金(折合人民币1.6亿元), 从Dapp一季度行业报告也能看出Cryptopunk在NFT圈家喻户晓的影响力. 而且下面很多交易都发生在今年1,2月, 最近行情火热你已经买不到几个月前那个价了, 比如3天前交易的#3011创造了人类Punk的新高, 这周最低价格的朋克(Floor Punk) 也已经成功超过了1个比特币的价格($55K) 直逼6万美金. 而下个月即将在[佳士得拍卖](https://www.christies.com/lot/lot--6316969/)的九个Punk估计会创造更多记录, 官方的估拍价是9百万, 但我觉得这个价可能连#635的外星人都不一定能买到.      \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AcSnoj1Kh9k1GONmMxysF.png?height=358&width=660)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dqScbQuJl5IoYD5P9R22J.png?height=1073&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rUC4ZPu5CoRZqHgBK6PkQ.png?height=1249&width=800)\n\n下面说说朋克头像是怎么分布(相对估值)的. 首先是人种分布, 一共有9个外星人, 24个猩猩, 88个丧尸, 剩下9879个人类 (其中3840个女头像, 6039个男头像). 由于非人类头像很稀少(仅占1.1%), 他们霸榜前十交易额也就不足为奇了. 外星人到现在就卖过两个, 都是以4200ETH($7.6M)的价格交易的, 而现在以太币已经上了$2700, 也就是说同样的4.2K ETH要$11M了. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KRxjTIdqL9E6ciBdazM_P.png?height=319&width=800)\n\n人类Punk有很多, 大多是通过独特性来区分/估值, 比如有多少种特征(Attributes), 5个以上特征, 单一特征, 和没有特征(也叫起源Punk)的最贵. 只有2-4个特征的就是最普通的Punk了. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jRzmC62nignugplZGDOMm.png?height=458&width=800)\n\n除了特征数量以外, 特征的美丑和稀有度也很重要. 小毡帽(Beanie)是最稀有的也是最贵的特征, 而项圈(choker)虽然也稀少但价值却没有王冠(Tiara)或者橘发(Orange Side)高, 因为项圈和朋克精神相悖. 3D眼镜虽然数量很多, 但由于看起来很酷, 价值反而很高. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L_6Agq_I3MQrXEllKS_bY.png?height=449&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ptbfQui1NRf1Hx4VFmxaX.png?height=275&width=800)\n\n现在大家对Cryptopunk有了一个大概了解, 虽然不懂为啥这么贵, 但至少能理解为啥有些Punk卖700万, 有些只能卖5万. NBA球星卡的价值来源于球星本身的技术水平和球星卡的稀有程度, 而Cryptopunks自己本身就是一种收藏品. \n\n**CryptoPunks的价值**\n\nCryptopunks是以太坊智能合约的一次全新的应用.是开创NFT先河项目, 一万个Punk头像是纯粹的虚拟收藏物件, 不存在任何版权. 任何人在任何地方联网都可以观看. 项目制作方Larva Labs对Cryptopunk也没有任何后续影响, 现在这一万个Punk是存在于以太坊上面唯一的, 自由交易的, 去中心化的物件(其实只有9999个了, 有一个不小心被销毁了). \n\n过去的6-9个月, 加密货币迎来了2017年以后又一次大牛市, 在比特币以太币被更多人接受和使用的大环境下, 无数的投资者前赴后继地涌入币圈. 如何来证明自己是币圈大佬(whale)成为很多OG投资者的一大难题. 除了新闻媒体上面活跃的币圈名人(像李笑来, Pomp), 最简单的方法就是买一个Punk作为Twitter和Discord的头像, 20ETH的价格差不多劝退了币圈萌新, 能拿出5-10万美金买一个虚拟头像也从侧面说明这个人已经财富自由了, 或者早在几年前就在币圈混了, 要么早早领到了Punk, 要么持有大量ETH. \n\n2021年是NFT大火的一年, Cryptopunk是一个人的匿名名片, 只需要贴出以太钱包, 大家自然会respect你, 因为很简单就能查到你持有啥NFT还有什么时候买的Punk. 在Twitter上面随便一看, 讨论NFT的人大多都是Punk头像, 已经逐渐成为一个新潮流或者信仰(cult). \n\n和早期的比特币一样, 拥有比特币和没有比特币的人是无法交流的, 拥有Punk的人也不会在意没有Punk的人的观点. 现在有人嘲笑花几万美金买Punk头像的人, 就像几年前有人嘲笑卖房卖车炒比特币的人一模一样. 但没人知道NFT或者Punk会不会是下一个\"比特币\", 因为有未知才会有定价错误 (mispricing).   \n\n还有另外一个有意思的现象, 那就是稀有Punk逐渐成为币圈明星, 他们的Twitter关注量成指数型增长, 每一个Punk都在网上展示自己的人设, 发表自己的观点, 经营自己的粉丝, 和其他\"Punk明星\"互动, 有些人甚至开始给自己的Punk撰写背景故事(未来还准备发行漫画).  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DX4MZAO9OkbsIDymLXmpV.png?height=784&width=583)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rASHXn3VRGq7WnteallcN.png?height=659&width=534)\n\nPunk圈里面最有名的是#4156猩猩, 其推特账户仅注册了2个月就有上万粉丝. 不仅引起NFT第一画家Beeple的注意, 专门为他作了一幅画, 他还把4月15日自定义为\"4156日\", 当天收到了上千份受#4156 猩猩Punk启发的画作. 是的, 没人知道他是谁, 但这并不重要.    \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Mosb0DXGrK9JTxmSbFXIm.png?height=840&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FraBmp_tIP135q6b6X6b1.png?height=870&width=597)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P5eFrUc2yfhZeHzBsenml.png?height=804&width=800)\n\n另外一个默默无闻的NBA球星卡收集者, 3月份在一次抽奖的活动中获得了一个最普通的三毛Punk #447, 在那之后他的Twitter阅读量出现了指数般的增长. 几天前他花了22万美金买下一个较为稀有的Punk #5974 (VR, 牛仔) 作为自己的头像, 未来的影响力也会越来越大. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k0xB905zz7IBwVqI-h-uj.png?height=255&width=735)\n\n( [@topshotfund](http://xueqiu.com/n/topshotfund))   \n\n拥有一个Punk既是币圈OG身份的象征, 更是一张高端投资者的通行证. 无数艺术家, 画家, 潮人, 有钱人, 投资者愿意和你做朋友, 了解你的看法. 购买Punk就像在美国淘金潮的大西部开了一家客栈, 为前来寻找机会的淘金人指点一下注意事项, 交流一下信息, 你有可能带人发现下一个金矿, 也有可能靠卖牛仔裤和铲子致富. 当然, 如果你刚花了750万买了一个外星人, 你的观点即使不会被写在历史书上, 也会被媒体或博主记录下来传播给更多的人, 你钱包的一举一动也被世界各地无数人所关注着.   \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uMYUBl7CVKP0OfAaNkmF5.png?height=590&width=594)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HLYmZcZ96-17wsrIATvlh.png?height=756&width=592)\n\n \n \n\n#### NFT百货商场\n\n在这里先介绍一下[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), NFT最大的交易平台. 你可以在上面交易绝大多数以太链上的NFT. 首先注册一个Metamask Wallet 小狐狸钱包 (浏览器插件), 从Coinbase/币安等交易所把以太币转入钱包就可以开始交易了, 交易使用ETH, 买方支付gas fee; 竞价(bidding)使用WETH, 接受竞价卖方支付gas. OpenSea上面可以看见各种各样的NFT项目, 也可以自己创建项目. OpenSea上面所有标价单位都是ETH, 交易NFT就是把以太币当作流通货币来使用了.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3k22il77BVHYbkel6JxMd.png?height=384&width=800)\n\n拿长期霸榜的Cryptopunks举例, 他的OpenSea[主页](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks)上面写着一共有10000个Punk, 2200个不同拥有者(钱包), 历史平均交易价格13.53 ETH, 总交易额153.5K ETH (约4亿美金). 主页上也有官网, Twitter, Discord链接. 但由于Cryptopunk比较老, 不在ERC-721上面, 所以交易一般直接发生在Larva Labs[官网](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks),或者Wrapped Cryptopunk的OpenSea页面(打包Cryptopunk才能在ERC-721上面交易).  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cN72qiGX1Nuki4UghI2Pb.png?height=475&width=799)\n\n**收藏品NFT**\n\n在Cryptopunk出现之后, 还有三个比较有名交易量上规模的OG收藏品NFT. \n\n**CryptoKitties**是区块链上第一个电子宠物, 和Cryptopunks一样通过不同特征来区分, 还增加了配种功能, 两个第一代猫咪可以生出第二代, 配种之后稀有的特征有一定概率传给下一代. 现在已经有200万个不同的猫咪, 最贵的十个猫咪成交价共计2600ETH (约7百万美金). 代数(Generation) 越低, 稀有特征越多, 越贵(成功率低). 猫咪总数没有限制, 完全看\"质量\". 很多NFT圈大佬的第一桶金就是靠撸猫配种得来的.     \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ga8cnVSmnzck4ac9SPTGS.png?height=426&width=780)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UBkmMB3IAXmDcadZroWBn.png?height=435&width=800)\n\n**Hashmasks**是另外一个OG收藏品NFT, 其艺术风格比Cryptopunk更独特, 更有观赏性, 由全世界70多位画家制作, 一共只有16,384个. 和Cryptopunk不同的是, 每一个Hashmask自带艺术及商用版权, 如果需要使用, 需要获得拥有者的允许. Hashmasks也使用了大多数NFT项目所使用的曲线定价, 越早参与项目(早期买家)价格越便宜. Hashmasks通过不同物种, 肤色, 眼睛, 物件和面具来区别, 最贵的Hashmask在二级市场也卖出了420ETH的天价. 最近恰逢3-4月份的NFT熊市, 很多Hashmasks都在被贱卖, Floor price也从1.5ETH跌倒了0.7ETH. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vScwkRqwWD7ziqe_jHXzD.png?height=506&width=622)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/loGAaTf3b3Wl1-w01Cal1.png?height=502&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d1_c3UJkLrC5Lpl-A-5Hp.png?height=442&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9fDxjcdUpeOkzJtniBnqw.png?height=1067&width=800)\n\n(2021.4月纽约时代广场纳斯达克交易所外面的公告牌展示\"小丑\"面具的Hashmasks)\n\n**Axie Infinity** 是以太坊上面规模最大的游戏类项目, 这个项目在电子宠物的基础上建立了一个完全虚拟的游戏世界, 主要有三种玩法: 宠物用来和别人战斗, 通过配种孵化后代(和猫咪类似), 买土地建房种田. 全世界超过4万玩家, 总交易额超过27.5ETH (7400万美金).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jn3ruZjKBzSufvLPpmz3U.png?height=505&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PgP4s_u4CeW0xkM84nfuc.png?height=450&width=800)\n\n \n \n\n#### Punk衍生NFT\n\nCryptopunk的成功导致了很多朋克衍生NFT的诞生, 基本上和OG punk类似模型(限量, 稀有), 很多人买不起Cryptopunk(OG Punk), 就买卖便宜的衍生Punk, 下面按交易量举例. \n\n**Bastard Punk**, 还在发行中的Punk, 花一些ETH来挖掘(Mine)新的Punk, 彩色动图. 基本上就是模仿Cryptopunks, 开始时间比较早, 但最近已经没啥人气了, 后面挖掘成本太高, 成交量骤减也没有人愿意挖新的Punk.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eLeV7-nWWAyNLo5607UBR.png?height=543&width=800)\n\n**PicassoPunk** (毕加索Punk), 最成功的Punk衍生NFT项目, 电脑根据毕加索作画风格为1000个Cryptopunk重新绘画. 我是看见他价格起飞的, 本来前几百个都只卖0.2ETH, 突然有一个大佬(whale) 或者就是初创团队一口气买了20多个, 以1ETH价格成交, 直接冲上了OpenSea的7日交易量排行榜, 然后就火了, 每个持有者都保持默契不在1ETH以下卖出 (Hold the line), 每一个Punk的价格就水涨船高. 很多人(包括OG Punk拥有者和电竞明星)也参与了进来, 买下几个打印出来挂家里也是一种很好的装饰. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0MHotT-hwT7clRn5Tc1pF.png?height=459&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Cf4SB63QLK-pWAphIE0fZ.png?height=1233&width=800)\n\n**3D Punk** 是另外一个OG Punk持有者比较认可的项目, 颜值比较高, 价格相比Cryptopunk也还能接受, 可惜数量只有100个, 项目现在已经结束了. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oydOmQ3XCEGlAY-IgsJAI.png?height=433&width=800)\n\n**Fine Art Punk** 也是比较早期的Punk衍生项目, 就是一位女画家给一万个Cryptopunk作画, 完全首创, 靠个人硬核的画技来为Punk增加艺术价值. 可惜没怎么宣传, 到现在也没有被Opensea官方认可(verified). 她是最早用艺术的方式重新理解Punk的, 连晚几周上线的Picasso Punk都是仿照她的 (第一个Punk几乎一模一样, 有抄袭的嫌疑). 后来啥梵高Punk, 达芬奇Punk, 莫奈Punk就更是跟风之流, 基本上就是一个滤镜加在Punk上面然后捞钱. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lsqBI5t14xlqhppM0G2G2.png?height=473&width=800)\n\n最后是上周末突然爆火的**Cryptobaby Punk**, 不知道什么原因OG punk持有者就开始抢baby punk, 感觉就跟领养儿子女儿一样, 上周末两天交易了160ETH (43万美金).   \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Apf5sE01ElPMRh5GWKbP.png?height=615&width=800)\n\n其他收藏品NFT也有衍生, 衍生收藏品NFT在收藏品类要占一定份额. 现在毕加索Punk比Hashmasks的floor更高, 也从侧面证明了衍生收藏品不一定比原创收藏品差. 具体哪个项目长期能保值, 谁也不知道, 但Cryptopunk无疑是收藏品NFT以及所有NFT项目的王者, 长期最有投资价值.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kyNlTW1Ki3hkJ9CygZ3ep.png?height=430&width=800)\n\n \n \n\n#### Autoglyphs\n\nLarva Labs在Cryptopunks项目结束以后, 在2019年4月又推出了第二个项目: Autoglyphs. 这是世界上第一个完全存在于以太链上的衍生艺术(on chain). CryptoPunks由于原文件太大, 只有其哈希值在链上自由交易, 所以不算完全on chain. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eoXK3nzpEs2cB_2O1Aemt.png?height=437&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cO4-cLCV5Z7Ag7hPV_47d.png?height=427&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iA8H_OzdjR4sIupmX-Uey.png?height=800&width=800)\n\n(Autoglyph #233 最高卖出价155ETH 42万美金)\n\n艺术这东西很难估值, 更不要说是计算机算法作画. 但前十个销售总额还是接近1200ETH(325万美金). 要知道项目开始的时候, 每一副画作只要0.2ETH就能认领, 到现在市场平均价比成本价翻了上百倍, 还不算从2019年到现在ETH本身的涨幅 ($160 到 $2700).  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UVN5fsP6AQx2dc8eOQSfh.png?height=202&width=800)\n\n**Larva Labs出品, 必出精品, 一直被模仿, 从未被超越.** 最近有传言说Larva Labs 准备推出第三个NFT项目, 有兴趣的朋友可以先准备好ETH.  \n \n\n#### 结语\n\n花几百万美金买一张2D头像图片, 有可能是这一轮比特币泡沫破灭前最典型的\"见顶时刻\"和\"败家案例\", 但的的确确买下了以太坊区块链上最稀有最有价值的收藏品. 如果你过去几年在以太坊上赚了不少钱, 也继续看好以太坊智能合约的未来, 拥有一个\"传奇\"头像才能配得上你币圈大佬(Whale)的身份吧, 即使只是个小牛也能买个普通Punk头像当作高端名片来证明自己OG的身份. \n\n现在大多数人都同意以太坊有广泛的应用前景, 尤其是二代以太币(Layer 2) 即将把gas fee大幅降低, 以太坊上世界首个NFT是可以长期保值和升值的, 独一无二的特性和极度稀缺导致其价值很难估量. 如果未来以太币暴跌了, 我也不介意抄底个Punk作为收藏.\n\n

前言\n\n从佳士得上面9个Cryptopunk拍卖了一千七百万美金, 到DKNG大股东在[苏富比](https://xueqiu.com/S/BID?from=status_stock_match)上面以一千两百万拍下\"新冠\" Cryptopunk然后穿着Cryptopunk头像去纳斯达克敲钟, NFT的淘金热潮在外面人看傻子的眼光中继续进行的如火如荼.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rHVY5VwpB-qKEZlb30r-C.png?height=816&width=527)\n\n前有Larva Labs推出元宇宙3D人物Meebit 猛割韭菜七千五百万, 后有黑马无聊猴(Bored Ape Yacht Club) 以平民化价格上市后一个月升值30倍, 圈粉NBA新秀球星, 俱乐部经理人, 甚至明星Gary V, 柯震东, 余文乐, 黄立成. NFT圈第一大V Pranksy 在上面大赚超过1000ETH.  \n\nNBA Top Shot球星卡平台用户超过一百万, Noora Health推出的 \"拯救上千人\" 慈善NFT被人以1337ETH的价格拍下. 美国第二大电商平台Ebay也准备推出NFT交易平台.   \n\n啥是改变人生? 一个月前默默无闻的华裔艺术家公羊新发行的十二星座系列在一分钟内卖出180ETH, 其NFT项目Ghxst上线一个月总交易量超过800ETH(艺术家有10%提成) 一路冲进Opensea(OS)前十. 18岁艺术家FEWOCiOUS从一年前高中辍学到本月底即将登上佳士得拍卖行, 他的NFT画作在过去的一年内卖了上百万美金.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SbHCT_FMsG92qvMa8kwOh.png?height=872&width=670)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NYxe6MoqbHk_S4dlXM42c.png?height=831&width=505)\n\n国内对NFT的关注度也慢慢起来了, 上海举行了首届NFT加密数字艺术展, 数字[文艺复兴](https://xueqiu.com/S/RLRN?from=status_stock_match)基金会的曹寅经常带队在CV元宇宙探险, B站的国家建筑师下周即将推出清明上河图NFT. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NC4ZjVu5YRZmJVmFRMA4d.png?height=536&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z-P_ZymDYrHL7jI47qyRW.png?height=517&width=800)\n\n上面这些仅仅只是最近一个月发生的重大事件, 作为三部曲的收官之作, 今天我就讲一讲区块链在NFT上面的各种应用, 信息量比较大, 很多都是对未来假设和幻想, 也许只是做白日梦, 但投资本来就是一个对未来的预期和概率的游戏. \n\n \n \n\n#### 电商的下一次革命\n\n[阿里巴巴](https://xueqiu.com/S/09988?from=status_stock_match)的淘宝和支付宝, Ebay和Paypal的藕断丝连, [亚马逊](https://xueqiu.com/S/AMZN?from=status_stock_match)的一键下单, 这些都是过去十多年电商如何逆袭线下购物的成功因素. 电商刚开始的时候为啥不被人看好, 主要因为无法和陌生人交易, 假货太多, 即使有评分系统, 也有刷分刷好评的系统. Ebay宣布第一个进军NFT市场, 估计还是因为限量版球星卡卖多了, 管理层知道商品的真实性和唯一性有多么重要. NFT在区块链上面诞生和交易, 是真是假一目了然. \n\n[Opensea](https://tinyurl.com/yds45phv) (OS)作为NFT最大的交易平台, 同样是一张8像素头像, 官方认证的Cryptopunk一个能卖15ETH (4-5万美金), 我上传到以太坊的图片就一文不值. 区块链上面作假的成本十分高, 高到远超过预期回报, NFT对假货有无与伦比的先天优势, 以太坊NFT或许会成为未来人们购物的常态. 过几年, 说不定你买的LV包包上面带有一个小二维码, 我AR眼镜一扫就知道是不是LV官方发行的商品, 一共发行了多少个, 也知道你是多少钱买的, 是不是二手货.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PRnR6rXSVLSWatYH0mjW3.png?height=737&width=613)\n\nNFT链上交易是及时的, 没啥3-5天银行到账, 没啥不同汇率转换, 我可以跟世界上任何一个人在以太坊上进行交易, 以太坊上面支持的加密货币都可以使用. 这个交易也是完全公开的, 所有人都能看见 (潜在顾客, 公司同事, 税务局, 执法机关). 房地产公司Propy已在以太坊完成上千处房屋所有权转让, 交易额累计超过十亿美元, 最近正在尝试把所有房屋凭证做成NFT. 或许未来买房就像买菜一样简单, 房产中介律师统统不需要, 一键买房, 三分钟到账.\n\n电子支付区块链化是不可避免的科技发展, 所以Square, Paypal, 腾讯阿里研究区块链一点也不奇怪, 以后所有的平台, 系统都会在链上面上, 也许有不同的链但肯定会上链(on-chain).区块链就像互联网一样, 你开个火锅店都得刷个大众点评, 现在多少人过年只用微信红包?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s9ljVwk2cfh-e7cuuGgKn.png?height=626&width=659)\n\n#### 虚拟土地也能炒? \n\n如果说未来十年最被人看好的游戏, 那非元宇宙(Metaverse)概念莫属, 2018年的电影《头号玩家》（ Ready Player One）把元宇宙概念首次搬上大荧幕, 在不远的将来, 人们会在虚拟宇宙中过着第二人生. 当时大多数人觉得这个未来还很远, 哪能想到2020年所有人被动开始\"第二人生\": 网上买菜, 远程工作, 除了吃饭睡觉, 一天16小时联网. [微软](https://xueqiu.com/S/MSFT?from=status_stock_match)的沙盒游戏《我的世界》（Minecraft）连续两年月活用户突破上亿, 今年3月更是达到1.4亿, .\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xoe1UagxAVZsPbK5JjRLU.png?height=599&width=718)\n\n元宇宙第一股 Roblox (RBLX) 更是把币圈DeFi那一套直接玩到游戏里面, 游戏公司发游戏币, 在游戏里面劳动可以挣钱, 也可以直接充钱买游戏商品, 游戏币也可按官方汇率转换回美金, 小孩子在游戏里面也可以\"挣钱\", 啥经济学, 市场学, 货币论从小接触. 以前的游戏厂商也有游戏币, 但RBLX应该是第一个官方以法币赎回游戏币的公司. 社交巨头Facebook (FB) 也已推出 VR 社交平台Facebook Horizon的测试版, 剑指元宇宙. \n\n以上三个公司都是中心化元宇宙, 而创新者们早早就开始做去中心化的元宇宙了. \n\n上一篇讲过几个NFT链上游戏, 游戏可以算是NFT发展的原动力: 早期的孵蛋游戏Cryptokitties, 战斗升级游戏Axie Infinity, MyCryptoHeroes, 卡牌类游戏Gods Unchained, 虚拟足球Sorare, 今年爆火的虚拟赛马游戏ZED run, 这些游戏每个平均有2万ETH交易量(5千万美金). \n\n而NFT占据垄断地位的游戏分类还是元宇宙: OS交易量排名第三的Decentraland (DCL), 排名十三和十四的Cryptovoxels (CV) 和The Sandbox. 三个交易量加起来超过11.5万ETH (折合三亿美金, 二十亿人民币). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZKWNosSEo4CtUlJ5XSh37.png?height=572&width=800)\n\nDCL ([官网](https://decentraland.org/)) 目前是NFT最成功的链上游戏, OS交易量仅次于CryptoPunks和Rarible, Punk上一篇已经讲过了世界上第一个NFT, 而Rarible是第三大的NFT交易平台(前两个是OS和NBA Top Shot), 是的, DCL作为一个游戏即将超越NFT第二大平台. 在DCL里面, 可以跟人社交 , 一起看球赛, 开演唱会, 举办画展 (前不久[苏富比](https://xueqiu.com/S/BID?from=status_stock_match)在DCL里面成立了元宇宙展示馆), 时装秀, 德扑大赛, 创业大赛, 甚至有加密币基金在里面搞线上招聘会. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qsH_cpmqyHXacQ6EkE9bM.png?height=445&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lT9cHxb90ywK6ZS0qzksZ.png?height=443&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M83L7v4w4QJ2rPSDoGwO3.png?height=495&width=800)\n\n这只是社交的功能, 其游戏功能和 Roblox类似, 挖矿做任务获取游戏币MANA (用时间换金钱), MANA可以用来购买游戏里面的一切商品, 也可以用来换成其他加密币/法币. MANA现在是排名第84名的加密币, 市值达到8.4亿美金, 在Coinbase, Gemini 等多交易所都可以直接交易. GBTC的母公司也在2月底发行了DCL的投资基金, 现在AUM规模达到1200万美金.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z8v4HrzucEE75AvzrJlku.png?height=586&width=414)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4nBkcIN821mX8Nk0Yjy9h.png?height=548&width=800)\n\n除了直接买MANA加密币来布局元宇宙以外, 更多人是直接买地. 下面几个是OS上面售价最高的交易, 其中有几个是今年交易的, 也就是说有些土地卖到了上百万美金. 第二个截图是最近的几个交易, 普通一块地也就2-3ETH (几千美金). 元宇宙炒地和现实生活中炒房是一样的, 先看城市(现在有42个城市/街区), 再看面积大小, 最后看地段 (靠近公园/运动场/著名景点). 有人买地为了建房子, 有人买地就为了炒(flip), 虽然现在还没有金融机构进驻搞房贷, 但DCL的土地已经可以在某些平台通过抵押来借贷加密币.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C35-rHBkUhqQJPc4dU1JA.png?height=458&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PADucXvKy8Nmr-wytfnXt.png?height=400&width=800)\n\n(DCL里面Dragon City 龙城举办的春节活动)\n\n如果说DCL强调社交属性, 那Sandbox基本上就是去中心化的Minecraft. 游戏的可玩性更高, 还有各种奇幻元素(龙, 恶魔, 动物). Sanbox里面用SAND购买物品/土地/汽车/时装.SAND在很多交易所也可以和其他加密币自由转换, 每次Sandbox卖地以前SAND都会小涨一波.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hZeD5GKM5VdE3dTgx84ls.png?height=249&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IHE8tqbwOG_OTVSyIPdt9.png?height=558&width=800)\n\n当然, 成年人玩游戏的少, 主要还是炒地. 下图是5月底的新土地销售, 由于Sandbox这次宣布与BAYC无聊猴合作(中间那个黑骷髅就是官方地), 猴子大军1分钟内把地抢光, 不管是普通土地 ($900)还是紧挨着合作伙伴的高级土地($3500), 连几个大的也被猴子NFT大佬拍卖拿下. 这些新土地一卖完, 就有人花2倍甚至3倍的价格在二级市场上买地, 不可谓不疯狂. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yURFmVUkbvrc80dvlkjyM.png?height=665&width=800)\n\n最后再简单提一下Cryptovoxel(CV), 数字[文艺复兴](https://xueqiu.com/S/RLRN?from=status_stock_match)基金会的曹寅经常带队在CV元宇宙探险, 这个元宇宙比较新, 里面都是用三维像素Voxel搭建的, 暂时没有游戏属性, 主要以社交聚会/展示画作为主, 好像3D建模更方便, 但具体我不太了解. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4G1BEO38ppKPSBHtJiqwr.png?height=607&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rDw-WDe5iidIH-ZMxOWCA.png?height=399&width=800)\n\n当然虚拟土地和很多代币ICO一样, 其总量没有限制, 未来也不断有新的元宇宙(游戏)诞生. 如何确保新土地既能满足新用户的需求又不会贬低老土地的价值是元宇宙项目的难题. Sanbox和CV的崛起让老大哥DCL也产生了危机, 而压力带来成长, 竞争使人进步, 对于整个NFT圈是一件好事. 在[微软](https://xueqiu.com/S/MSFT?from=status_stock_match)/腾讯可能只是个007程序员, 在Sandbox说不定能成为顶级开发者.\n\n如果说上一篇的Cryptopunk是区块链名片, 那元宇宙的土地就是90年代深圳的房子, 也许20年后\"深圳\"还是小渔村, 也许成为下一个深圳甚至是纽约. 大多数人高估自己一年能做到的事, 而低估五年十年能做到的事.\n\n \n \n\n#### 去中心化元宇宙的价值\n\n电影头号玩家之所以能成为一部家喻户晓的电影, 是因为导演斯皮尔伯格充分了解大众的喜好, 缤纷多彩的元宇宙加上俗套却有用的屌丝逆袭的故事, 让一部评分只有7.4的电影在全球拿下接近6亿美金的票房, 刨开成本1.5亿之后ROI高达300%. 电影里的大反派的人设非常合理, 平台权力过大是所有中心化元宇宙绕不开的缺点, 看看最近今年麻烦不断的社交媒体就知道了, 现在Minecraft是全球最火的开放式沙盒游戏, 但以后如果所有人的第二人生都在一个游戏中, 你还会信任一家以盈利为首要任务的公司吗?\n\n去中心化元宇宙就解决了这个问题, 整个元宇宙是社区所有人决定的, 这也是区块链带来的一个伟大创新, 去中心化自动组织 Decentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO). 虽然群体很多时候是愚蠢的, 但人类的发展史从来不是个别聪明人决定的, 创新要得到群众的认可社会才能进步. 不说太哲学的, 就看NFT社区一个项目每个人有参与的话能走的更远, 大多数NFT项目发售结束后(Minting)就死了或者创造团队拿到钱后消失了, 但有少数NFT项目却因为社区建设的好, 即使发售结束后二级市场(Secondary sales)依然长青.\n\n去中心化元宇宙还有一个巨大优势, 以区块链为底层技术的元宇宙在诞生之初就比中心化元宇宙高级. 区块链的唯一性, 拥有权的真实性, 非信任性, 互通性, 基本上就是科幻小说里面的理想AI统治社会. 现在市面上大多数App可以用微信登陆, Google登录, 但你其实还是信任腾讯和谷歌不会监守自盗, 而我可以用我的以太钱包(上一篇介绍的小狐狸钱包) 登录任何一个以太链上的NFT项目, 这未尝不是一张全球通用的身份证. 我在OS上面买卖NFT, 我不需要知道我是在跟世界哪个角落的人在做生意, 但我知道他/她给我的以太币就是以太币, 在世界各地都可以自由换汇的第二大加密币. 淘宝和[亚马逊](https://xueqiu.com/S/AMZN?from=status_stock_match)也许永远都需要两个账户, 但在以太链上面我只需要一个钱包, 连接无数购物网站, 买房, 买车, 买菜, 甚至能买股票?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yf-b9Bshsv6HE_QB4JSP9.png?height=342&width=620)\n\n#### 屌丝逆袭的无聊猴\n\n过去一个多月NFT圈最火的莫属Bored Ape Yacht Club (无聊猴游艇俱乐部), 四个年轻人做了1万只猴子, 以0.08ETH每只的价格上市发售, 地板价在一个半月后从0.08涨到了今天的3ETH, 在币圈吸粉无数. NFT的大佬Pranksy在上面赚了上千以太, 上市的时候他以96ETH的成本买了1200只猴子, 后续慢慢卖出均价超过1 ETH, 他现在已经卖掉超过90%, 也算是\"卖飞了\". 平民化的无聊猴和Larva Labs上线的3D人物Meebit形成了鲜明的对比, Larva Labs给每个Cryptopunk持有者免费空投一个Meebit, 但给公众的发行价高达2.5ETH (当时接近$9000), 一波韭菜割下去名声很不好. 而无聊猴的地板价在两周前超过了Meebit地板价0.7ETH, 现在达到3ETH的地板价更是让Meebit望尘莫及, 这是NFT圈一个完美的逆袭.    \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hgjoxFV0zwXxz3hLBJJ7O.png?height=465&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PjyPTNAjcaGvnX16ku57x.png?height=529&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cvxr-brK51fIUNzk08LF9.png?height=437&width=800)\n\n上一篇长文我还在为错过Larva Labs免费发放Cryptopunk而可惜, 结果几天之后无聊猴上线一个多月超过三十倍的利润, 比起GME, AMC, 狗狗币的疯狂也不输一筹. 上图是至今成交额最高的稀有猴, 第一名的持有者在以接近13万美金的价格卖掉后都哭了, 真可谓是改变人生. \n\n无聊猴为啥能成功, 和其用户分散化的社区是分不开的. 现在1万只猴子有超过4300个拥有者, 相比cryptopunk仅仅只有2400个拥有者, 拥有者多了社区也更加活跃. 现在Twitter上面, 只要使用无聊猴当头像几天就有超过500个粉丝, 猴子互粉基本上已成为加入俱乐部的铁律.而人多了, 各种周边商品也随之出现, 猴子T恤, 猴子咖啡, 猴子面膜, 猴子衍生NFT, 甚至有人想去以猴子竞选纽约市长, 大家互相支持, 互相帮助.   \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jjBty1yBJfv3mSQIpNoQD.png?height=997&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cTDHLI7QCVWdcobq-fqHY.png?height=745&width=785)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XrcCVGduFXtDpkWs4O3ZG.png?height=1002&width=800)\n\n更好玩的是现在猴子们已经成为NFT风向标, 就像温州炒房团一样, 哪个项目被猴子们看上, 那一定会成功售罄(sold out), 初创团队800-1000ETH拿到手. 猴子们活跃在各个NFT项目的discord聊天室, 像我之前提到的Sandbox上线猴子们去抢地, 很多人都不知道Sandbox是什么, 反正看见大家都在抢, 冲就是了. 猴子们有交流炒股的. 交流炒币的, 交流炒房的. 上一篇我介绍Cryptopunk的社交属性, 在猴子这里更加成功, 或许大家身在天南地北, 但猴子们都是同一个俱乐部, 大家都是兄弟姐妹, 同甘共苦, 一起FOMO, 一起HODL, 一起发财.\n\n \n \n\n#### NFT的价值\n\nNFT的价值可以分成3大块: 内在价值 + 使用价值 + 社区溢价.\n\n内在价值(Intrinsic value), 基本上就是上市价(mint price), 这是初创团队/艺术家赚的, 比如无聊猴1万个猴子一共卖了800ETH (0.08一个), NBA球星卡一个卡包$9, Beeple或者Pak的画作一万美金发布, 上千人去抢几十张一模一样的edition (只有编号不同). \n\n使用价值(utility value), 门票NFT可以去参加演唱会/球赛, Gary V发行的NFT有几率跟他吃顿饭或者一对一视频15分钟, 持有Cryptopunk的人可以免费领取一个Meebit (Public sale一个2.5ETH), 无聊猴持有者免费领一只狗狗 (Bored Ape Kennel Club). 现在utility NFT最多的是域名, 比如 tencent.eth 这个域名我不知道腾讯是不是持有, 或者 china.eth, 又或者xueqiu.eth. 网站域名全部在链上交易, 很区块链.   \n\n社区溢价(community premium), 为啥詹姆斯的球星卡一张几千上万美金, 为啥cryptopunk一个卖15-20ETH, 这些都是二级市场由于其稀有性给的社区溢价. 而整个社区也有地板价, 像无聊猴一个月地板价从0.08发行价涨到3ETH, 就是因为猴子社区越来越受欢迎, 先反超了Meebit, 现在开始追赶Cryptopunk, 过去一周有几个稀有的金猴和彩猴成交价甚至超过了十万美金, 这在美国很多小城市能买套房了. 而Meebit社区无人问津, Cryptopunk的持有者们还是专注于经营Punk社区, 导致Meebit的地板价从上市价2.5ETH一路跌到0.7ETH. NFT社区既能FOMO上天也可能无人问津, NFT能上头条新闻也能变成一张废纸.  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0tn732NhQorWD5a_WWOM0.png?height=599&width=800)\n\n(The Last Stand of the Nation State by Slime Sunday 发行量415, 发行价$40, 地板价$3998) \n\nNFT的内在价值给了很多数字画家Digital artist一个新的收入来源, 和传统画家可以买卖实体画不同, 数字画家的画很容易被人抄袭盗用. 这其实跟几年前免费听歌一样, 是对创作者的不尊重以及剥削其劳动成果. 而现在数字画家可以把自己的作品上传到区块链上面, 既保证其唯一性, 原创性, 艺术爱好者和收藏家也能放心购买其加密艺术品 (crypto art). \n\n二级市场上的社区溢价往往导致炒家的诞生(flipper), 我本人就不止一次卖飞了NFT, 之前0.3ETH抄底了三只Top 10%猴, 1.2ETH卖了觉得自己牛逼, 现在一看类似猴子都6ETH了. 还有0.5ETH上线的Cryptocities, 0.75就卖掉了, 现在地板都是4-5ETH. NFT社区也有聪明人写竞价程序去捡漏被低估的NFT, 每五分钟自动list永远保持在项目首页, 用博弈论心理学和卖家私信砍价, 写自动买入程序去第一时间抢空投, 写程序炒股那套用在炒NFT上面无往不利. \n\n如果你对币圈有些了解, 一定听说过De-Fi (Decentralized Finance), 也许因为平台风险和P2P跑路名声不太好, 但几个大平台给USDC的年利息高达3-5%, 完爆传统银行. Staking加密币更是跟很多不想卖(HODL)的人被动分红收入, 甚至人人都可以当做市商(Market Marker)给市场提供流通性. De-Fi对于很多普通人来说很枯燥无聊, 而NFT的趣味性和游戏性大大改善了这个方面, 每天盯着K线图肯定没有看着艺术品或者猴子涨价有意思, 玩游戏挣钱也比天天关注央行加息或者马斯克踩比特币有意思, NFT的低流动性也未尝不是被动锁仓.   \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dldMRfGzNHH8-LjAcFMi-.png?height=629&width=765)\n\n(TO THE MOON by Lushsux 发行量113, 发行价$999, 地板价$3750) \n\n \n \n\n#### 展望未来\n\nNFT虽然现在只在艺术收藏和游戏上面崭露头角, 但在很多领域都有很大的潜力. \n\n如果我告诉你每一首歌可以上市, 你会不会觉得我疯了? 打个比方, 黄老板Ed Sheeran给新歌发一个NFT, 一共1000份. 每个NFT发行价1ETH, 黄老板提现200多万, 而未来25年这首歌的版权费每个月平分给这1000个NFT(类似于分红), 也可以对半分, 50%版权费. 这个NFT就像股票一样24/365都可以交易, 这个操作是不是很野? 想想[腾讯音乐](https://xueqiu.com/S/TME?from=status_stock_match), Spotify, 唱片公司未来会怎么区块链化? 加密币对传统银行发起挑战, NFT则可能抢所有中间商的饭碗. \n\nNBA今年新秀Lamelo Ball也发行了自己的NFT, 持有NFT的人有机会获得签名球鞋, 签名T恤, 甚至作为VIP去看他的比赛, 这未尝不是一种新型周边. 赌球的人不在少数, 以后会不会出现平民投资球星, 球星未来的收入一部分分红给投资者. 现在起点中文网上面读者可以投资新书赚起点币, 那以后各种明星都可以像股票一样被投资, 而最好的载体就是NFT. \n\n发行基金我不太懂, 但我知道国外NFT社区有人不久前搞了一个猴基金, 上百人众筹了一百多ETH去买无聊猴, 现在收益十倍起步了, 虽然他们的成功很难复制, 但以后华尔街对冲基金经理是否也可以用NFT来筹钱, 每个季度给持有者钱包空投季报, 你不看好这个基金也可以把NFT在OS上面卖掉, 基金做的好可以每年发一期, 做的不好或者经理不想做了, 可以清算后把钱平分了. Michael Burry博士想做空[特斯拉](https://xueqiu.com/S/TSLA?from=status_stock_match)搞一个马斯克去死的NFT, 说不定还能拉出来一个TSLAQ基金. 当然, 和陌生人合作有风险, 你去买不知名的对冲基金也有风险, 最后还是看有没有做好功课(DD), 之前ICO热潮也是各种湾区大V站台, 结果熊市一来全部跑路.\n\nNFT圈子里面不缺尔虞我诈, 项目方跑路更是司空见惯, 有光明就有黑暗, 有钱的地方小偷骗子少不了. 我个人也没投几个项目, 就遇到了好几个失联跑路的. 而大明星在币圈带货垃圾币, 发售低质量NFT割粉丝韭菜也并不罕见, 一个愿打, 一个愿挨. NFT现阶段基本上还是以收藏为主, 投资只能当作风投, 十个里面有1-2个翻几倍就行了. 我主要对于NFT对区块链应用的未来比较看好, 媒体吹区块链也吹好几年了, 啥影子都没看到, 但OS上面每天都有新项目, 有新玩法, 就像阿里腾讯从硅谷偷师学艺一样, 或许某个幸运儿在大学寝室看见OS上面一个项目复制到中国, 成为下一个巨头, You never know. \n\n之前也讲过, NFT在三月后其实就进入了熊市 (球星卡上WSJ见光死), 但熊市中依然有猴子这种项目成功, 回想我五月初0.3ETH抄底猴子, 感觉就像5年前买比特币一样, 以后也许还有机会. 和任何金钱游戏一样, 有人的地方就有泡沫, 就有恐慌, 别人的垃圾也许是你改变命运的黄金. 当然, NFT属于另类投资中的风投, 我这里也就是介绍一下, 不作为任何投资建议.   \n\n现在币圈依然有很多人看不懂NFT, 觉得能右键保存的东西为啥要付费, 是啊, 我在网上找的[蒙娜丽莎](https://xueqiu.com/S/SZ002918?from=status_stock_match)高清图片为啥不能卖个几个亿? 而依然觉得比特币是骗局的人, 那我也不指望他们能理解NFT, 只能说一句: 格局太小, 有空去读一下人类简史吧.  \n\n

The game will have all the features that traditional platforms have, but it will be gathered all in one place. DeFi Land gamifies decentralized finance by turning investment activities into games.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*bVQZ1N-ziZEdzrtn)\n\nThis article will cover the two parts of an AcceleRaytor launch: 1) the Public Raise and 2) the IDO on Raydium.\n\n## 1. DFL AcceleRaytor Public Raise details:\n\nTotal tokens for the raise: 70,000,000 DFL (0.7% of total DFL supply), unlocked\n\nToken fixed price: 0.005 USDC for 1 DFL\n\nTotal raise: 350,000 USDC\n\nModel: Lottery for allocation\n\nAllocation for winning ticket: 70 USDC (14,000 DFL)\n\nTotal number of winning tickets: 5,000\n\nPool opens: November 24, 12:00 UTC\n\nPool closes: November 25, 00:00 UTC\n\nOpen period of the pools: 12 hours\n\n## Eligibility and pool details:\n\nThere will be one RAY pool available for the DFL raise.\n\n*   Allocation will be determined by a lottery system.\n*   Allocation for one winning lottery ticket: 70 USDC\n*   There will be two snapshot deadlines to determine ticket allotment.\n\n**7-day deadline**:\n\n*   Eligibility: At least 100 RAY staked in[ RAY single-sided staking](https://raydium.io/staking/) prior to the 7-day staking deadline below and successful USDC deposit once the pool opens. RAY must remain staked until the pool opens.\n*   Lottery tickets: 1 ticket for every 100 RAY staked — up to a maximum of 5 tickets. Staking more than 500 RAY will still receive 5 tickets maximum.\n*   7-day staking deadline: November 17, 12:00 UTC\n\n**30-day deadline**:\n\n*   To reward longer-term Raydium holders, users that are eligible for the 30-day deadline will **receive additional tickets** on top of any received for the 7-day deadline.\n*   Eligibility: At least 50 RAY staked 30 days prior to the 30-day staking deadline below and successful USDC deposit once the pool opens. RAY must remain staked until the pool opens.\n*   Lottery tickets: 1 ticket for every 50 RAY staked — up to a maximum of 5 tickets, and 1 additional ticket for every 1,000 RAY staked.\n*   *Example: Alice has had 2,500 RAY staked before the 30-day deadline. She will receive 12 tickets — 5 for the 7-day deadline 100 RAY max allotment, 5 for the 30-day deadline 50 RAY max allotment, and 2 additional for each 1,000 RAY staked.*\n*   30-day staking deadline: October 25, 12:00 UTC (snapshot already taken)\n\n## How does it work?\n\n**Tickets**: Users receive tickets according to the ticket allotments above. However, for a ticket to be counted in the lottery, users must** **deposit USDC for each ticket they wish to have entered.\n\n*   *Example: Alice has 12 tickets as the above example. Bob staked 300 RAY before the 7-day deadline and will receive 3 tickets.*\n\n**Deposit**: When the pool opens, **users will need to deposit 70 USDC for each ticket in order for it to be counted in the lottery**. Users can choose to deposit less than their total ticket allocation, however, tickets without a matching deposit will not be entered in the lottery. Deposits must be in multiples of 70 USDC.\n\n*   *Alice deposits 840 USDC, her maximum, to ensure that all 12 of her tickets are entered in the lottery. Bob deposits 140 USDC even though he has 3 tickets because he needs the extra 70 USDC to buy Alice a cool NFT that is dropping that day. In Bob’s case, only 2 of his tickets will be entered in the lottery.*\n\n**Lottery**: Once the pool closes, the lottery will take place and winning tickets will receive a 70 USDC allocation for DFL. Results of the lottery will be shown very shortly after the pool closes.\n\n*   *Example: Alice has 1 winning ticket and will receive a 70 USDC allocation. Bob does not have any winning tickets, better luck next time, Bob.*\n\n**Claim**: Once the lottery is complete users will be able to remove their USDC for any tickets that did not win. Claims for DFL from winning tickets will open once trading begins for the DFL IDO (details below).\n\n*   *Example: Alice claims her 770 USDC and Bob claims his 140 USDC after the lottery concludes. Alice must wait for the DFL IDO to claim her DFL.*\n\n***Lottery Transparency***\n\n*The lottery will be done on-chain, with lottery numbers assigned to tickets in the order that users deposit in the pool. After the pool closes, winning numbers will be determined by hashing a block, multiplying it by the timestamp, and matching the last 2 digits of that number with user ticket numbers. Any ticket number with the last 2 digits matching is designated a winning ticket. This process will be repeated until all the winners are determined.*\n\n## 2. DFL IDO on Raydium:\n\nToken starting price: 0.005 USDC for 1 DFL\n\nIDO Launch time: November 25, 12:00 UTC\n\n## How does it work?\n\n*   Raydium will launch a DFL-USDC liquidity pool (LP), after which trading will be live on the Raydium Swap interface.

DeFi Land gamifies decentralized finance by turning investment activities into games.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*bVQZ1N-ziZEdzrtn)\n\nThis article will cover the two parts of an AcceleRaytor launch: 1) the Public Raise and 2) the IDO on Raydium.\n\n## 1. DFL AcceleRaytor Public Raise details:\n\nTotal tokens for the raise: 70,000,000 DFL (0.7% of total DFL supply), unlocked\n\nToken fixed price: 0.005 USDC for 1 DFL\n\nTotal raise: 350,000 USDC\n\nModel: Lottery for allocation\n\nAllocation for winning ticket: 70 USDC (14,000 DFL)\n\nTotal number of winning tickets: 5,000\n\nPool opens: November 24, 12:00 UTC\n\nPool closes: November 25, 00:00 UTC\n\nOpen period of the pools: 12 hours\n\n## Eligibility and pool details:\n\nThere will be one RAY pool available for the DFL raise.\n\n*   Allocation will be determined by a lottery system.\n*   Allocation for one winning lottery ticket: 70 USDC\n*   There will be two snapshot deadlines to determine ticket allotment.\n\n**7-day deadline**:\n\n*   Eligibility: At least 100 RAY staked in[ RAY single-sided staking](https://raydium.io/staking/) prior to the 7-day staking deadline below and successful USDC deposit once the pool opens. RAY must remain staked until the pool opens.\n*   Lottery tickets: 1 ticket for every 100 RAY staked — up to a maximum of 5 tickets. Staking more than 500 RAY will still receive 5 tickets maximum.\n*   7-day staking deadline: November 17, 12:00 UTC\n\n**30-day deadline**:\n\n*   To reward longer-term Raydium holders, users that are eligible for the 30-day deadline will **receive additional tickets** on top of any received for the 7-day deadline.\n*   Eligibility: At least 50 RAY staked 30 days prior to the 30-day staking deadline below and successful USDC deposit once the pool opens. RAY must remain staked until the pool opens.\n*   Lottery tickets: 1 ticket for every 50 RAY staked — up to a maximum of 5 tickets, and 1 additional ticket for every 1,000 RAY staked.\n*   *Example: Alice has had 2,500 RAY staked before the 30-day deadline. She will receive 12 tickets — 5 for the 7-day deadline 100 RAY max allotment, 5 for the 30-day deadline 50 RAY max allotment, and 2 additional for each 1,000 RAY staked.*\n*   30-day staking deadline: October 25, 12:00 UTC (snapshot already taken)\n\n## How does it work?\n\n**Tickets**: Users receive tickets according to the ticket allotments above. However, for a ticket to be counted in the lottery, users must** **deposit USDC for each ticket they wish to have entered.\n\n*   *Example: Alice has 12 tickets as the above example. Bob staked 300 RAY before the 7-day deadline and will receive 3 tickets.*\n\n**Deposit**: When the pool opens, **users will need to deposit 70 USDC for each ticket in order for it to be counted in the lottery**. Users can choose to deposit less than their total ticket allocation, however, tickets without a matching deposit will not be entered in the lottery. Deposits must be in multiples of 70 USDC.\n\n*   *Alice deposits 840 USDC, her maximum, to ensure that all 12 of her tickets are entered in the lottery. Bob deposits 140 USDC even though he has 3 tickets because he needs the extra 70 USDC to buy Alice a cool NFT that is dropping that day. In Bob’s case, only 2 of his tickets will be entered in the lottery.*\n\n**Lottery**: Once the pool closes, the lottery will take place and winning tickets will receive a 70 USDC allocation for DFL. Results of the lottery will be shown very shortly after the pool closes.\n\n*   *Example: Alice has 1 winning ticket and will receive a 70 USDC allocation. Bob does not have any winning tickets, better luck next time, Bob.*\n\n**Claim**: Once the lottery is complete users will be able to remove their USDC for any tickets that did not win. Claims for DFL from winning tickets will open once trading begins for the DFL IDO (details below).\n\n*   *Example: Alice claims her 770 USDC and Bob claims his 140 USDC after the lottery concludes. Alice must wait for the DFL IDO to claim her DFL.*\n\n***Lottery Transparency***\n\n*The lottery will be done on-chain, with lottery numbers assigned to tickets in the order that users deposit in the pool. After the pool closes, winning numbers will be determined by hashing a block, multiplying it by the timestamp, and matching the last 2 digits of that number with user ticket numbers. Any ticket number with the last 2 digits matching is designated a winning ticket. This process will be repeated until all the winners are determined.*\n\n## 2. DFL IDO on Raydium:\n\nToken starting price: 0.005 USDC for 1 DFL\n\nIDO Launch time: November 25, 12:00 UTC\n\n## How does it work?\n\n*   Raydium will launch a DFL-USDC liquidity pool (LP), after which trading will be live on the Raydium Swap interface. The AMM will begin placing orders on Serum a short time after the LP launch.\n*   Participants with winning tickets for the AcceleRaytor raise pool will also be able to claim their tokens at approximately the same time that the DFL-USDC LP launches.\n\n**Fusion Pool — Provide liquidity to earn DFL rewards**\n\n*   Users will also be able to add liquidity to DFL-USDC LP and then stake LP tokens to earn yield on the[ Fusion Pools page](https://raydium.io/fusion/). Rewards will be in DFL tokens.\n*   Reward emissions on the Fusion pool will begin shortly after the LP launches, to give users time to add liquidity and stake in the Fusion pool for yield farming.\n\n## What is DeFi Land?\n\nDeFi Land is a multi-chain agriculture simulation web game created to gamify decentralized finance.
