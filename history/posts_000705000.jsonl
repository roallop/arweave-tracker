Collect this NFT at the end of this story!*\n\n---\n\nFor the umpteenth time, the line to Anchor City disappeared in front of Alan Bloom into the horizon. He straightened himself and let a deep sigh float from his simulated lungs into the throng of fellow uploaded minds alongside him. Despite countless denials, he believed that this time, he would make it back to reality.\n\nThat’s what all of the uploaded minds in this endless line wanted. To move on from their infinite simulated lives. To anchor themselves again in a real city. One last life, truly lived. New challenges, unforgettable memories, and a chance to be alive again. However, the *Uploaded Minds and Human Coexistence Pact* determined the fates of uploaded minds like Alan. At the end of the line, before the gates to Anchor City, were the agents.\n\nAlongside a large stack of required documents, each uploaded mind had to have a reason to move on. For most of the minds, the answer was the same: they’ve become bored of all of their lives. To live a final life of limitations meant feeling human again for one last time. For many uploaded minds this was true, and that’s the reason that Alan’s lawyers recommended he present.\n\nBut, Alan had his own reason to move on towards the city that allowed him to have a real body again. An infinite amount of lives weren’t enough to shake a woman he once met on a promenade in Kinshasa. That distant evening, the city of Brazzaville on the opposite bank illuminated a simulated cloud that had just burst its numerous waters into the Congo River. Even now, the fresh smell of petrichor rising from the soaked earth would take him back to that night when she introduced herself. \n\n“Hi,” she said from a gentle smile. \n\nEnsuing discussions about soil and rain led them to an agreement to leave the rest of the uploaded minds in the public overworld simulation behind and disappear into their own instance: a common act where uploaded minds forked the simulation into less computationally intensive copies for their own, private use. It was the start of a budding relationship that grew over countless simulations until the long river of time washed them apart. She moved on.\n\nAfter another infinite lives since, Alan could no longer resist the pull of her gravity from where she used to be. She was the reason. However, afraid to get denied, he kept with his lawyer’s recommendations and used the same reason she also said goodbye with: “I want feel human again. To be real again.” Many made it through the line and into Anchor City, but many were also, unfortunately, frequently denied: Alan Bloom, included. He never knew why. Frustrating, like a pregnant cloud that would not release its life-giving rain.\n\nAs he practised the rehearsed reason in his head, the line shuffled forward like a wave, minds rippling down it from the agents up ahead to somewhere distant behind him.\n\nComing into view was Cappy’s Hotel. \n\nWith the line ever present and many millions undertaking it every day, it had formed its own city. Bars, hotels, police, housing authorities, and all the usual abundant bureaucracy you’d find in any metropolis. With many uploaded minds living an infinite amount of lives, it wasn’t that absurd that a city had grown from a queue.\n\n“Alan? Is that you? So nice to see you again! Staying for the night?” Cappy announced, shouting through his unkempt beard.\n\nAlan smiled at his old friend. “Of course. How could I not? A nice rest, defrag the old loose ends, and enjoy some amazing curries. How have you been, man? Still not moving on?”\n\nCappy stroked his beard in thought. *That was new. Was he going to join the line?* “Frankly Alan. If I see you one more time coming past here, I think I might follow you along,” Cappy said, throwing out a laugh and a slap onto Alan’s back. “Come! Take your papers to storage and then join us for a beer and some hot curry!”\n\nAlan dragged his papers to the back of the hotel and tugged on the storage locker. It didn’t budge. Not wanting to make a scene, he tugged a bit harder and then stopped before the handle might break. A hotel employee putting out some trash, spotted him and hurried over. One loud bang on the door later and it popped open. Alan nodded a thank you, avoiding the worker’s eyes and found a corner for his documents. Despite the warm glow from the hotel in the line behind him, butterflies were flapping about in his stomach. Forgetting a document meant you were denied without appeal. So, even though his papers were in order for the past hundred times he’s walked the line, Alan, paged through it all again.\n\n*Documentation of All Lives Lived.\nNegative Tests for Common Memetic Pathogens.\nProof-of-Updates to Core Logic Units.\nProof-of-Funds to Anchor.\nInitial Upload Certificates.*\n\n...\n\nSitting alone in the penumbra, paging through piles of papers, it reminded him of his pointless pre-upload life. Even though his past was hazy, he had not forgotten why he chose to exit and upload his mind. Infinite lives as a simulated mind was his opportunity to get rid of his social anxiety. It would allow him to not be so afraid. To not be that 40-something weirdo in the office without a family.\n\nIn time, it did help. Yet, like a river coursing over the earth and etching a canyon, the more he lived, the harder it became to change course. Alan became more Alan: a reserved man that truly felt free when he first uploaded, only to settle back in his ways. In his most free and flourishing lives, he spent it with her.\n\nAfter what felt like an hour, he came to what was supposed to be the penultimate document: *The Attestation*. If the agents discovered he lied or forged any documents, the attestation gave them the right to delist him from Anchor City, freeing up space for another mind. Real death. Except, the document wasn’t there. His eyes darted around the storage locker, only finding the neatly stored documents from the other patrons. Nothing! Alan hurriedly got up and retraced his steps right into Cappy’s bearded silhouette entering the locker.\n\n“You look like a feedback loop gone awry!” Cappy said through a slurred smile. “Your curry is getting cold, you nincompoop. Come!” Alan was still frozen, but Cappy grabbed his arm. \n\nAlan shrugged him away. “Wait. My attestation! I lost it.”\n\n“Alan, you’ve done this so many times now. It’s in there. Relax buddy,” Cappy said, tacking on a laugh. Alan still wasn’t sure, but Cappy was right. His curry was getting cold.\n\nFloating in thought through sounds of patrons clinking their glasses and sauces being slurped from bowls, Alan found their table already adorned with a few empty beers. As he took a bite of the now somewhat cold curry, he could feel Cappy’s eyes dissect his clouded mind.\n\n“Yo, mate, relax! The attestation is in there. Push comes to shove, you can always get back in the line!”\n\nDespite the cold curry, the chilli pushed simulated sweat to Alan’s forehead. That, or he was actually bristled by Cappy’s comment alongside his attestation anxiety. “Fuck that, Cappy. I’m done, man. I can’t come back here.” Alan straightened himself before he boiled over. “In fact, last time I checked, you’ve never even faced the line! So, rich coming from you!”\n\nCappy was unperturbed by Alan’s outburst, still nursing a beer and staring into the distance: perhaps even peering into the lines of code that made up their simulation. A deep breath rose in Cappy’s chest and he exhaled himself into an upright position. Despite not ageing, Alan could see the years on his face. They’ve done a lot together. From living an instance of becoming writers, to an instance of becoming cooks. Alan’s shoulders slouched. He felt bad. It was Cappy that first persuaded Alan to try and move on. It wasn’t due to some philosophical or existential reason. Cappy just became fed up with him endlessly talking about her.\n\n“Alan,” Cappy started, swallowing more than the sip of his beer. “You’re right…”\n\n“I'm sorry. Dude…”\n\n“No, you're right…” Cappy said with an escaping chuckle that turned into a sigh. “Can I level with you?”\n\nThat's a line Cappy never seemed to cross. Never got serious. A happy go lucky man, living each life like he was watching himself in a film: detached with a metaphorical box of popcorn by his side. Alan nodded. \n\n“I lied… I just can’t handle the rejection. You know me, man. Never afraid. Remember that time we took up base jumping? But. For some reason, I have this mental block when it comes to the line, and I think I know why.” Cappy looked up as Alan nodded back without judgement. Cappy continued, his eyes mapping out his reasons on the table amongst the empty beers. “It’s fucking stupid. My dad, you see. I was a chubby kid. He kept saying how fat I was, and so no matter how much I tried, I always feared that people would reject me for that. And somehow it feels like my father is one of the agents, and going to judge me for...”\n\n“No! Hey,” Alan interjected.\n\n“It’s so stupid. So many lives to unlearn it and… Listen, sorry,” Cappy said, pulling himself straight.\n\n“No. Look. It’s normal. We all share some of the scars of our pre-upload selves…”\n\nCappy slouched back into his beer. “I’m just so tired. I’m so bored. I can’t do this anymore. Life upon life, upon life. I’ve been everywhere. Even made it out of this simulated solar system. I’ve loved everyone. I’ve created so many things… Do you want to know the real reason I started this hotel in the line?”\n\nAlan always thought that Cappy just wanted something different. No doubt that Alan also felt that tinge of emptiness from all his own lives, but he hadn’t hit rock bottom yet: that deep abyss where some minds even spent lives just lying on their back, just to see what that would feel like.\n\n“I started this hotel, because I was in the line, ready to leave. To move on. To anchor. But, I couldn’t face the rejection. It’s so silly. So, I stopped. To help others instead.”\n\nNo doubt that Cappy’s helped many minds move on. Millions of them came through the hotel: some for the last time, and some, again and again. Like Alan.\n\n“You’ve helped many a wary mind in this line, Cappy. Cheers to that,” Alan said, lifting his beer. Cappy just drunkenly slapped Alan’s mug, mimicking a cheers.  “Thanks for sharing!”\n\n“It’s stupid. Whatever…” Cappy said, seemingly waving away his vulnerable self.\n\nAlan leaned into the moment to console his friend, changing the topic to what Cappy did best. “Want to help me?”\n\nCappy smiled. “What you got, brother?”\n\n“I trained as an actor. Helps me sell my reason. Wanna hear?”\n\n“Oh yeah? Go for it.”\n\nThis was Alan’s trump card that would get him to move on. He straightened himself and rested into a swagger and confidence that covered up his usual anxious self. He projected the words he had said so many times over: “I want to live a life with limitations. To anchor myself to the blockchain. To exist outside of all these infinite simulations. To be real. To live among the humans again. I am tired. I am bored. I want out of this prison of the mind.”\n\nRaptured by Alan’s new talent, the rest of the lounge fell silent for a moment.\n\n“Damn,” was all that Cappy could muster as the clientele resumed their clinking drinks and hearty meals. It was hard to tell if it was due to Cappy being sincerely flabbergasted or whether the alcohol was talking for him. “I’ve had many actors come past here, and that, I’m not lying, is fucking good.”\n\nRegardless, Alan’s heart warmed. He knew why. Maybe he could finally get to see her again.\n\nThe rest of evening was spent over more beers and stores about some strange lives that they’ve lived. When Alan retreated to bed, he gave himself permission again to wonder why she mattered so much. He’s lived countless lives with many people. *Why her?* He tried to recall his first life. The one before the upload. If Cappy’s fear came from his pre-upload life, maybe she mattered because of a memory he had once lost.\n\n*Pre-upload life.* Such a strange feeling and concept. A distant memory, much like the inability to place the source of a faint smell. And yet, to become anchored into a nanobody would be a final rebirth back to reality: anchored to the same hyperreal blockchain database that the humans use. Equals again in a way that a simulation could never be. The risk of death would be ever present, only hindered by accidents and the maintenance of the city that kept them running. No restart. That’s how the humans ordained it.\n\nLife would slow down, their simulated mental cycles reduced and limited by the pace of the chain itself. A reasonable trade-off. *Limited by the pace…* That’s where the memories of his first life sprouted again. She reminded him of the girl he grew up with on the farm next door. After all these lives, he never made the connection. As kids they roamed the farms between, playing at myriads of fantasies. On the cusp of becoming a teenager, with all its hormones and confusion, she left. Never to be seen again. Is that why he missed the woman he spent so many lives with as an uploaded mind? Both had the same messy, dark hair and slim face. And both moved on. \n\nNow, more than ever, he hoped they would let him give up this fake, simulated life. To be alive and walk through Anchor City, to find her. He let go and his head sank into the pillow with dreams of the promised city.\n\nTo humans, they wouldn’t notice Anchor City, unless they knew it existed. It was entirely white, the size of a bus and located in Antarctica. If you peered behind its unassuming veneer you’d see a mass of densely packed circuitry and cooling systems: the digital backbone that powered the uploaded minds. Once anchored, a mind gained a tiny body, fit to size for its computational power. Despite being limited by the pace of the chain, the newly anchored minds still ran 500x times faster than humans. Thus, in that white, bus-sized city were millions of minds creating an abundance of new, final memories and experiencing what it’s like again to live in the real world. \n\nAnchored minds were allowed to venture away from Anchor City, but they rarely did. Nowhere else on Earth was the bandwidth as fast and the computational power as dense. To venture away from Anchor City as a nanobot was the same as a human venturing into the vast nothingness of most of the universe. Moving on, however, didn't mean giving up on living. All the anchored minds just wanted to feel alive again. To feel like death was possible. Thus, even though it looked like snow, Anchor City had many layers of computation, augmented reality filters through immense streets, and stories of millions of lives. It was as if a human walked into a multi-layered city that combined a server farm with pieces of New York, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Johannesburg, Lagos, Cairo, Mumbai, and Jakarta combined. Within all of that, she was there. Or, Alan hoped she was.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next morning he got up early, fetched his cart of documents, and joined the line for the final stretch. Cappy, somehow, not hungover said goodbye with a joke and nothing about his heart that he spilled over the beers the previous evening. “I hope I don’t see you again!” Old habits, even after infinite lives, die hard.\n\nAlan laughed and wanted to reply with a similar joke related to Cappy’s anxiety about rejection, but couldn’t find something to say.\n\nAs Alan got closer his palms started sweating. It never did. He watched as the minds in front of him went through the gauntlet. Denied. Denied. Accepted. Denied. Accepted. Accepted. Minds sent back to live many more lives, or minds given the opportunity to live one final one. To anchor back into the reality. *Should I do it?* A question that always faced him when he came close to the answer. But, this time, it was clear. His time had come. A deep anxious sigh left his body, rattling every simulated bone he had in himself.\n\n“Who are you?” Came the faceless agent behind the transparent window.\n\n“My pre-upload self was Alan Bloom. My simulated id is 0xbe6d59ff.”\n\n“What is your reason?”\n\nAlan straightened himself into the strut he had practiced for a lifetime. “I want to live a life with limitations. To anchor myself to the blockchain. To exist outside of all these infinite simulations. To be real. To live among the humans again. I am tired. I am bored. I want out of this prison of the mind.” Flawless, he felt.\n\nUnmoved by his magnum opus, the agent continued. *“Documentation of All Lives Lived.”*\n\n*Anti-climax…* Alan nodded and gave it to the agent.\n\n*“Negative Tests for Common Memetic Pathogens.”*\n\nThe laboratory reports were extensive, but it all passed the required checks. The documentation checking continued for a few hours until it came to the Attestation. Alan’s stomach lurched at the sight of the missing document. It usually rested neatly in between *“Signatures To Delist”* and the final document: *“Receipt of Payment To Pre-Pay Delisting Fee.”* His eyes widened, with bright dread rushing in. *No. No. Please. No.* It really was missing!\n\n“Alan Bloom, please present your *Attestation*.”\n\nHis world started turning, shock and heat coursing through his simulated veins. *I can’t. I really can’t…* His body took control, words bursting from the banks of his subconscious.\n“Please… Please! I can’t keep doing this,” Alan shouted, simulated spit splashing into the glass divider. His palms launched from his sides, trying to slam his desired reality into place. “I want to see her again. Please. I miss her! PLEASE!”\n\n“Guards,” the agent said, with the calmest voice that only caused Alan to lose control of his legs. He fell to the floor. As it dawned on him, he noticed the line fidgeting and pulsating, as if it were about to vomit out something it tried to keep down. As the guards drew closer, a few seconds later, the line belched up Cappy, holding Alan’s *Attestation.*\n\n“It… It was…” Cappy started, catching his breath. “It was outside the hotel!”\n\n“Holy shit. Cappy, get up,” Alan said, hoisting his friend up from the floor. He looked around at the guards, making sure they knew what was going on. Alan took the Attestation and presented it to the agent.\n\n*“Receipt of Payment To Pre-Pay Delisting Fee.”*\n\nAlan moved to hand over the last document and paused. The adrenaline had given him newfound clarity. “I need to revise my reason.”\n\n“What’s your reason?”\n\nAlan glanced at Cappy that was still catching his breath through his beard. His friend, spilling his guts over the beers at the hotel, held the true reason. They were the same. If Alan gave up all his simulated lives for one last one in Anchor City, he had no proof that she would still even be alive, or that she would even care about him. He never knew the real reason that made him want to move on. Until now. “I want to see her again. But. I also want to stop being afraid. By moving on I can also let go. I need to.”\n\nCappy’s eyes widened alongside a smile.\n\n“Reason revised. Please present your final document. *Receipt of Payment To Pre-Pay Delisting Fee.*”\n\nA blackhole of anxiety formed in Alan’s stomach. This was it.\n\nThe agent’s blank face rose up from his computer. “Thank you Alan Bloom. Given analysis of all the documents, your reason is legitimate. You are cleared to anchor.”\n\n...and suddenly, the black hole in his stomach became like the end of a wormhole, spewing out all the emotions he had collected over his many lifetimes. *Is that all it was? You had to merely speak your truth?*\n\n“Here’s your anchor certificate. Keep it safe. If you die, you will be delisted along with the certificate. Proceed to the transaction pool. A miner will anchor you.”\n\nAlan faced Cappy. Stunned, they launched into a deep hug, one that tried to come as close as possible to share what they were feeling. Cappy unwrapped, speechless.\n \nAlan reciprocated what Cappy had offered to so many before him. “I’ll have a room for you in the city. Please. When you are ready. Come! Just speak your truth!” \n\nCappy, still frozen, only eked out a nod.\n\nThe line didn’t wait. Alan was ushered along and slowly moved forward to the transaction pool. A miner took his anchor certificate, stamped it with some computational gas and turned towards Alan.\n\n“This is your final chance to turn back. From here on out, you will give up the opportunity to live a further infinite lives, in exchange for one final one in the real world. Do you want to proceed?”\n\nAll Alan could see was the visions of Anchor City, her face, and his final opportunity to let go. Tears streamed down as if all his infinite lives in all the simulations came to say goodbye. He had lived so much. He had seen so much. He took a deep breath and let the last tears fall where they belonged. Here, at the end of the line, in this infinite simulation.\n\n“I’m ready to anchor.” \n\n---\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nBid on the cover image by [@MadMaraca](https://twitter.com/MadMaraca). 100% of proceeds go to her:\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/25290)\n\nNFT memorabilia from this story in the form of Anchor Certificates will be able to be minted soon!

{"id": "ovQ3YXdae69xPy2dgJ9jKZ5Cmsw9W6fKlq7t2Zxi1No", "title": "Measuring the Success of Mirror Crowdfunding", "body": "Four months ago, our team [launched Mirror Crowdfunding](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ)*.* We have had a number of successful campaigns - attracting a median participation of 52 backers per project, and raising a total of over 118 ETH ($300,000 at time of writing) for books, essays, software, newsletters, and public goods. \n\nWe should be critical in how we measure success. With regards to metrics, some crypto projects focus on simple numbers such as the amount of ETH held in their contracts, or the trading volume. Often, these measures depend on a small number of contributors who hold a large amount of ETH, and thereby obfuscate (intentionally or not) the reality of thin adoption. \n\nThe total amount raised via Mirror's crowdfunding feature is a small part of the story. For these few months, we artificially limited the contribution amounts per backer, as well as the total funding amount per campaign. We did this to learn in a very controlled way about the possible mechanisms, intentions, and aspirations our community has for this new tool. In fact, almost every crowdfund has worked slightly differently, as we've continued to tweak the underlying logic.\n\nUntil we make this feature fully accessible, the most useful metrics to judge our success may be indirect, and stem from questions such as:\n\n1. How many unique backers, on average, does each each project attract?\n2. How quickly are these backers able to fully fulfill the campaign's goal?\n3. How diverse are projects being funded?\n4. What is the longevity of a project that is funded on Mirror, vs other funding platforms?\n5. How does crowdfunding contribute to the general enthusiasm around Mirror - e.g. to the popularity of the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race)?\n\nMany of these questions can be answered by reviewing public blockchain data. Here, I will reveal some general insights into the crowdfunding campaigns so far, and speculate on the reasons why people contribute to them, and where I see this phenomenon going in the future.\n\n# **What is a Mirror Crowdfund?**\n\nA crowdfund on Mirror is a simple way for someone to describe an idea, and receive support in the form of Ethereum token contributions (ETH) to work on it.\n\nWhen a backer contributes to the crowdfund, they receive ERC20 tokens (these tokens are unique to the project being funded), in proportion to the magnitude of their contribution. This token allocation creates an on-chain association between the backers and the project - uniting them an on-chain collective, bound by the crowdfund contract (and empowered by its embedded and embeddable functionality). Backers are able to \"burn\" their tokens at any time, in exchange for any underlying ETH in the contract.\n\n## How does a Mirror Crowdfund Differ from a \"Web2\" Crowdfund?\n\nMirror's crowdfunding tool is built on Ethereum, which makes it different from web2 problems (such as Kickstarter) across multiple paradigms. For example: \n\n1. **Lower friction:** Users don't need to create an account on Mirror (or even enter a credit card) to back a crowdfund. Backers use their own Ethereum account that controls their funds, and they contribute from that account. As long as someone is already an Ethereum user, this lowers the friction of contributing to a crowdfund substantially.\n2. **Global:** Anyone from around the world can participate in the crowdfund within a minute of its launch.\n3. **Equity, community, voice:** Users become associated through the crowdfund through the ERC20 token they receive in response to their contribution. Once the ERC20 token has been minted, they can use it like any other standard Ethereum token; they can transfer it to other accounts, trade it on Uniswap, use it for on-chain governance, etc.\n4. **Transparent:** All contributions are publicly auditable on the blockchain. Crowdfund details are displayed in Mirror's embeddable \"economic blocks\" that live-update with each contribution, displaying the backer's Twitter profile and the amount they contributed. This creates a lasting record of the community that formed around the crowdfund.\n5. **Integrative and Permissionless:** The crowdfund contract itself can be connected bidirectionally with other protocols on Ethereum, such as an NFT contract (by setting the NFT contract's funding recipient to be the crowdfund), or a [Split](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw). The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\n\n# Crowdfund Results\n\nThe total amount raised is over 118 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $309,000.\n\nThe majority of funds have been raised for writers; for essays, books, and newsletters. The bias towards writing is probably because Mirror has brand awareness with crypto-adjacent publishers (our homepage and Twitter account market the application as a publishing platform). Writers have raised over 80 ETH ($215,000) on Mirror so far for these writing-related projects.\n\nSoftware projects have also drawn a considerable amount; 32 ETH has been raised. We've also had one non-digital public goods funding campaign so far, for a non-profit related to outdoor conservation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/92e78f28-6c2a-4e43-9313-5a92569e2b4a.jpeg?height=946&width=1682)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eadc5624-88e0-4a57-8a2a-a9bc1c763c9c.jpeg?height=1144&width=1846)\n\nMany of these campaigns were fulfilled in minutes or hours of their launch. For example, if we look at the public logs for the PartyDAO crowdfund, we see that it raised $90,000 (value at the time) within hours:\n\n![About 4 hours from contract creation to the ultimate transfer of the 25 ETH. I'm aware that some of that time was spent finding a suitable wallet in which to store the funds!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11d80bcd-34e7-4cf8-8f4b-f1c0b2660a82.jpeg?height=400&width=1968)\n\n$ESSAY is another clear example, where the logs indicate that funding was opened and closed with an hour:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dd1490a-6186-4e50-a02b-5fc5d13d50d0.jpeg?height=106&width=1674)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b73fc04d-5e6b-4c50-91fd-38495df6ad93.jpeg?height=108&width=1108)\n\n## Future Measurements\n\nIt will be critical for us to track the longevity of these projects, and to understand barriers to these communities succeeding once the project has been funded.

Here, I will reveal some general insights into the crowdfunding campaigns so far, and speculate on the reasons why people contribute to them, and where I see this phenomenon going in the future.\n\n# **What is a Mirror Crowdfund?**\n\nA crowdfund on Mirror is a simple way for someone to describe an idea, and receive support in the form of Ethereum token contributions (ETH) to work on it.\n\nWhen a backer contributes to the crowdfund, they receive ERC20 tokens (these tokens are unique to the project being funded), in proportion to the magnitude of their contribution. This token allocation creates an on-chain association between the backers and the project - uniting them an on-chain collective, bound by the crowdfund contract (and empowered by its embedded and embeddable functionality). Backers are able to \"burn\" their tokens at any time, in exchange for any underlying ETH in the contract.\n\n## How does a Mirror Crowdfund Differ from a \"Web2\" Crowdfund?\n\nMirror's crowdfunding tool is built on Ethereum, which makes it different from web2 problems (such as Kickstarter) across multiple paradigms. For example: \n\n1. **Lower friction:** Users don't need to create an account on Mirror (or even enter a credit card) to back a crowdfund. Backers use their own Ethereum account that controls their funds, and they contribute from that account. As long as someone is already an Ethereum user, this lowers the friction of contributing to a crowdfund substantially.\n2. **Global:** Anyone from around the world can participate in the crowdfund within a minute of its launch.\n3. **Equity, community, voice:** Users become associated through the crowdfund through the ERC20 token they receive in response to their contribution. Once the ERC20 token has been minted, they can use it like any other standard Ethereum token; they can transfer it to other accounts, trade it on Uniswap, use it for on-chain governance, etc.\n4. **Transparent:** All contributions are publicly auditable on the blockchain. Crowdfund details are displayed in Mirror's embeddable \"economic blocks\" that live-update with each contribution, displaying the backer's Twitter profile and the amount they contributed. This creates a lasting record of the community that formed around the crowdfund.\n5. **Integrative and Permissionless:** The crowdfund contract itself can be connected bidirectionally with other protocols on Ethereum, such as an NFT contract (by setting the NFT contract's funding recipient to be the crowdfund), or a [Split](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw). The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\n\n# Crowdfund Results\n\nThe total amount raised is over 118 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $309,000.\n\nThe majority of funds have been raised for writers; for essays, books, and newsletters. The bias towards writing is probably because Mirror has brand awareness with crypto-adjacent publishers (our homepage and Twitter account market the application as a publishing platform). Writers have raised over 80 ETH ($215,000) on Mirror so far for these writing-related projects.\n\nSoftware projects have also drawn a considerable amount; 32 ETH has been raised. We've also had one non-digital public goods funding campaign so far, for a non-profit related to outdoor conservation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/92e78f28-6c2a-4e43-9313-5a92569e2b4a.jpeg?height=946&width=1682)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eadc5624-88e0-4a57-8a2a-a9bc1c763c9c.jpeg?height=1144&width=1846)\n\nMany of these campaigns were fulfilled in minutes or hours of their launch.

The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\n\n# Crowdfund Results\n\nThe total amount raised is over 118 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $309,000.\n\nThe majority of funds have been raised for writers; for essays, books, and newsletters. The bias towards writing is probably because Mirror has brand awareness with crypto-adjacent publishers (our homepage and Twitter account market the application as a publishing platform).

With regards to metrics, some crypto projects focus on simple numbers such as the amount of ETH held in their contracts, or the trading volume. Often, these measures depend on a small number of contributors who hold a large amount of ETH, and thereby obfuscate (intentionally or not) the reality of thin adoption. \n\nThe total amount raised via Mirror's crowdfunding feature is a small part of the story. For these few months, we artificially limited the contribution amounts per backer, as well as the total funding amount per campaign. We did this to learn in a very controlled way about the possible mechanisms, intentions, and aspirations our community has for this new tool. In fact, almost every crowdfund has worked slightly differently, as we've tweaked the underlying logic to learn more.\n\nUntil we make this feature fully accessible, the most useful metrics to judge our success may be indirect, and stem from questions such as:\n\n1. How many unique backers, on average, does each each project attract?\n2. How quickly are these backers able to fully fulfill the campaign's goal?\n3. How diverse are the projects being funded?\n4. What is the longevity of a project that is funded on Mirror, vs other funding platforms?\n5. How does crowdfunding contribute to the general enthusiasm around Mirror - e.g. to the popularity of the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race)?\n\nMany of these questions can be answered by reviewing public blockchain data. Here, I will reveal some general insights into the crowdfunding campaigns so far, and speculate on the reasons why people contribute to them, and where I see this phenomenon going in the future.\n\n# **What is a Mirror Crowdfund?**\n\nA crowdfund on Mirror is a simple way for someone to describe an idea, and receive support in the form of Ethereum token contributions (ETH) to work on it.\n\nWhen a backer contributes to the crowdfund, they also receive ERC20 tokens (these tokens are unique to the project being funded), in proportion to the magnitude of their contribution. \n\nThis token allocation creates an on-chain association between the backers and the project - uniting them an on-chain collective, bound by the crowdfund contract (and empowered by its embedded and embeddable functionality). Backers are able to \"burn\" their tokens at any time, in exchange for any underlying ETH in the contract.\n\n## How does a Mirror Crowdfund Differ from a \"Web2\" Crowdfund?\n\nMirror's crowdfunding tool is built on Ethereum, which makes it different from web2 problems (such as Kickstarter) across multiple paradigms. For example: \n\n1. **Lower friction:** Users don't need to create an account on Mirror (or even enter a credit card) to back a crowdfund. Backers use their own Ethereum account that controls their funds, and they contribute from that account. As long as someone is already an Ethereum user, this lowers the friction of contributing to a crowdfund substantially.\n2. **Global:** Anyone from around the world can participate in the crowdfund within a minute of its launch.\n3. **Equity, community, voice:** Users become associated through the crowdfund through the ERC20 token they receive in response to their contribution. Once the ERC20 token has been minted, they can use it like any other standard Ethereum token; they can transfer it to other accounts, trade it on Uniswap, use it for on-chain governance, etc.\n4. **Transparent:** All contributions are publicly auditable on the blockchain. Crowdfund details are displayed in Mirror's embeddable \"economic blocks\" that live-update with each contribution, displaying the backer's Twitter profile and the amount they contributed. This creates a lasting record of the community that formed around the crowdfund.\n5. **Integrative and Permissionless:** The crowdfund contract itself can be connected bidirectionally with other protocols on Ethereum, such as an NFT contract (by setting the NFT contract's funding recipient to be the crowdfund), or a [Split](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw). The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\n\n# Crowdfund Results\n\nThe total amount raised is over 118 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $309,000.\n\nThe majority of funds have been raised for writers; for essays, books, and newsletters. The bias towards writing is probably because Mirror has brand awareness with crypto-adjacent publishers (our homepage and Twitter account market the application as a publishing platform). Writers have raised over 80 ETH ($215,000) on Mirror so far for these writing-related projects.\n\nSoftware projects have also drawn a considerable amount; 32 ETH has been raised. We've also had one non-digital public goods funding campaign so far, for a non-profit related to outdoor conservation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/92e78f28-6c2a-4e43-9313-5a92569e2b4a.jpeg?height=946&width=1682)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eadc5624-88e0-4a57-8a2a-a9bc1c763c9c.jpeg?height=1144&width=1846)\n\nMany of these campaigns were fulfilled in minutes or hours of their launch. For example, if we look at the public logs for the PartyDAO crowdfund, we see that it raised $90,000 (value at the time) within hours:\n\n![About 4 hours from contract creation to the ultimate transfer of the 25 ETH. I'm aware that some of that time was spent finding a suitable wallet in which to store the funds!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11d80bcd-34e7-4cf8-8f4b-f1c0b2660a82.jpeg?height=400&width=1968)\n\n$ESSAY is another clear example, where the logs indicate that funding was opened and closed with an hour:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dd1490a-6186-4e50-a02b-5fc5d13d50d0.jpeg?height=106&width=1674)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b73fc04d-5e6b-4c50-91fd-38495df6ad93.jpeg?height=108&width=1108)\n\n## Future Measurements\n\nIt will be critical for us to track the longevity of these projects, and to understand barriers to these communities succeeding once the project has been funded. The success of the community to fulfill its goal is, after all, the purpose of the crowdfund. I haven't included this in the current report, since we're still so early in this process.\n\n\n# **Why do people contribute?**\n\n### Generalized and Productive Exchange\n\nThere are two models I've used for thinking about why people contribute. They relate to *Generalized* and *Productive* exchange, and are models that I find useful to reflect on with many of the mechanisms being built on Ethereum.\n\n![From Generalized Generosity: How the Norm of Generalized Reciprocity Bridges Collective Forms of Social Exchange](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e57a7431-418a-4e7d-8a51-83a2eb5ae5cf.jpeg?height=906&width=1374)\n\nAs we can see in the above diagrams ([Whitham, 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450)), *Generalized Exchange* is when people back campaigns because they are aware that they are part of a community that has trust and reciprocity norms. I think this explains why many people buy NFTs and participate in grants; they know that they're part of an exchange network that will end up moving funds around, and it'll come back to them (including token airdrops). There are many conversations on Twitter that give evidence for this.\n\n*Productive Exchange* happens when a contributor wants to become part of a community that is actually interdependent. The research linked above shows that this has powerful implications for trust and community building.\n\nI view [PartyDAO](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) as evidence for the productive exchange explanation. It turned out that many of the contributors themselves were artists, programmers, and writers, and contributed to the campaign *in order* to become formally associated with the project and with others who were involved (such as [John Palmer](https://j.mirror.xyz/), [Anish Agnihotri](http://anish.mirror.xyz/), [Denis](https://d.mirror.xyz/), [Jesse Walden](http://variant.mirror.xyz/), and [Li Jin](https://li.mirror.xyz/)) Once PartyDAO was fully funded, someone created a Discord for the group. Everybody introduced themselves, and started finding ways to contribute more to the project. In this sense, the crowdfund became the center of productive exchange.\n\n### **Patronage+**\n\nJesse Walden has [given a name](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo) to this new kind of interdependent funding model:\n\n> With regard to supporting creators, I've called this “[Patronage+](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1355165547441303554)” where the “plus” is the possibility of earning value alongside the creators you support.\n\nEven though it's not explicitly promised, a norm of interdependence is beginning to form among crowdfunds.\n\n### Formal Mechanisms for Reciprocity\nThe crowdfunding contract includes a mechanism where members can \"burn\" their crowdfund tokens by sending them back to the contract. In doing so, they receive an amount of ETH *back* equal to the percentage of the totally supply they burned, multiplied by the amount of ETH in the contract. Therefore, if the amount of ETH in the contract has increased more than the initial crowdfunding goal, members can burn their tokens to receive more ETH than contributed in the first place.\n\n# Future Directions\n\nEach time we have deployed a crowdfund, we have experimented with a new model. We're currently experimenting with combining ERC20 token reciprocation with NFT token minting as well (contributors will receive ERC20s as well as NFTs).\n\nWe're also thinking of doing more to serve the communities that form out of crowdfunding campaigns - to help them better coordinate and organize their resources.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nWe're seeing many unprecedented phenomena in Ethereum, enabled by embedded communities that can socially control capital and digital goods with minimal friction. \n\nSpecifically, this enables a unique combination of *generalized exchange* (grants, airdrops, crowdfunding) with *productive exchange* (e.g. interdependent, community-governed software projects like PartyDAO that has formal reciprocity mechanisms). There is [research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450) to suggest that this will impact trust and community-building.\n\nWe're learning something new each time we deploy a new Crowdfund, and the models are improving.

Here, I will reveal some general insights into the crowdfunding campaigns so far, and speculate on the reasons why people contribute to them, and where I see this phenomenon going in the future.\n\n# **What is a Mirror Crowdfund?**\n\nA crowdfund on Mirror is a simple way for someone to describe an idea, and receive support in the form of Ethereum token contributions (ETH) to work on it.\n\nWhen a backer contributes to the crowdfund, they also receive ERC20 tokens (these tokens are unique to the project being funded), in proportion to the magnitude of their contribution. \n\nThis token allocation creates an on-chain association between the backers and the project - uniting them an on-chain collective, bound by the crowdfund contract (and empowered by its embedded and embeddable functionality). Backers are able to \"burn\" their tokens at any time, in exchange for any underlying ETH in the contract.\n\n## How does a Mirror Crowdfund Differ from a \"Web2\" Crowdfund?\n\nMirror's crowdfunding tool is built on Ethereum, which makes it different from web2 problems (such as Kickstarter) across multiple paradigms. For example: \n\n1. **Lower friction:** Users don't need to create an account on Mirror (or even enter a credit card) to back a crowdfund. Backers use their own Ethereum account that controls their funds, and they contribute from that account. As long as someone is already an Ethereum user, this lowers the friction of contributing to a crowdfund substantially.\n2. **Global:** Anyone from around the world can participate in the crowdfund within a minute of its launch.\n3. **Equity, community, voice:** Users become associated through the crowdfund through the ERC20 token they receive in response to their contribution. Once the ERC20 token has been minted, they can use it like any other standard Ethereum token; they can transfer it to other accounts, trade it on Uniswap, use it for on-chain governance, etc.\n4. **Transparent:** All contributions are publicly auditable on the blockchain. Crowdfund details are displayed in Mirror's embeddable \"economic blocks\" that live-update with each contribution, displaying the backer's Twitter profile and the amount they contributed. This creates a lasting record of the community that formed around the crowdfund.\n5. **Integrative and Permissionless:** The crowdfund contract itself can be connected bidirectionally with other protocols on Ethereum, such as an NFT contract (by setting the NFT contract's funding recipient to be the crowdfund), or a [Split](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw). The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\n\n# Crowdfund Results\n\nThe total amount raised is over 118 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $309,000.\n\nAll campaigns so far have been artificially capped, so that we can maximize learning with limited risk. In includes total contribution amounts, as well as for individual contributions.\n\nThe majority of funds have been raised for writers; for essays, books, and newsletters. The bias towards writing is probably because Mirror has brand awareness with crypto-adjacent publishers (our homepage and Twitter account market the application as a publishing platform). Writers have raised over 80 ETH ($215,000) on Mirror so far for these writing-related projects.\n\nSoftware projects have also drawn a considerable amount; 32 ETH has been raised. We've also had one non-digital public goods funding campaign so far, for a non-profit related to outdoor conservation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/92e78f28-6c2a-4e43-9313-5a92569e2b4a.jpeg?height=946&width=1682)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eadc5624-88e0-4a57-8a2a-a9bc1c763c9c.jpeg?height=1144&width=1846)\n\nMany of these campaigns were fulfilled in minutes or hours of their launch. For example, if we look at the public logs for the PartyDAO crowdfund, we see that it raised $90,000 (value at the time) within hours:\n\n![About 4 hours from contract creation to the ultimate transfer of the 25 ETH. I'm aware that some of that time was spent finding a suitable wallet in which to store the funds!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11d80bcd-34e7-4cf8-8f4b-f1c0b2660a82.jpeg?height=400&width=1968)\n\n$ESSAY is another clear example, where the logs indicate that funding was opened and closed with an hour:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dd1490a-6186-4e50-a02b-5fc5d13d50d0.jpeg?height=106&width=1674)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b73fc04d-5e6b-4c50-91fd-38495df6ad93.jpeg?height=108&width=1108)\n\n## Future Measurements\n\nIt will be critical for us to track the longevity of these projects, and to understand barriers to these communities succeeding once the project has been funded. The success of the community to fulfill its goal is, after all, the purpose of the crowdfund. I haven't included this in the current report, since we're still so early in this process.\n\n\n# **Why do people contribute?**\n\n### Generalized and Productive Exchange\n\nThere are two models I've used for thinking about why people contribute. They relate to *Generalized* and *Productive* exchange, and are models that I find useful to reflect on with many of the mechanisms being built on Ethereum.\n\n![From Generalized Generosity: How the Norm of Generalized Reciprocity Bridges Collective Forms of Social Exchange](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e57a7431-418a-4e7d-8a51-83a2eb5ae5cf.jpeg?height=906&width=1374)\n\nAs we can see in the above diagrams ([Whitham, 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450)), *Generalized Exchange* is when people back campaigns because they are aware that they are part of a community that has trust and reciprocity norms. I think this explains why many people buy NFTs and participate in grants; they know that they're part of an exchange network that will end up moving funds around, and it'll come back to them (including token airdrops). There are many conversations on Twitter that give evidence for this.\n\n*Productive Exchange* happens when a contributor wants to become part of a community that is actually interdependent.

As long as someone is already an Ethereum user, this lowers the friction of contributing to a crowdfund substantially.\n2. **Global:** Anyone from around the world can participate in the crowdfund within a minute of its launch.\n3. **Equity, community, voice:** Users become associated through the crowdfund through the ERC20 token they receive in response to their contribution. Once the ERC20 token has been minted, they can use it like any other standard Ethereum token; they can transfer it to other accounts, trade it on Uniswap, use it for on-chain governance, etc.\n4. **Transparent:** All contributions are publicly auditable on the blockchain. Crowdfund details are displayed in Mirror's embeddable \"economic blocks\" that live-update with each contribution, displaying the backer's Twitter profile and the amount they contributed. This creates a lasting record of the community that formed around the crowdfund.\n5. **Integrative and Permissionless:** The crowdfund contract itself can be connected bidirectionally with other protocols on Ethereum, such as an NFT contract (by setting the NFT contract's funding recipient to be the crowdfund), or a [Split](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw). The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\n\n# Crowdfund Results\n\nThe total amount raised is over 118 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $309,000.\n\nAll campaigns so far have been artificially capped, so that we can maximize learning with limited risk.

The bias towards writing is probably because Mirror has brand awareness with crypto-adjacent publishers (our homepage and Twitter account market the application as a publishing platform). Writers have raised over 80 ETH ($215,000) on Mirror so far for these writing-related projects.\n\nSoftware projects have also drawn a considerable amount; 32 ETH has been raised. We've also had one non-digital public goods funding campaign so far, for a non-profit related to outdoor conservation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/92e78f28-6c2a-4e43-9313-5a92569e2b4a.jpeg?height=946&width=1682)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/53904fb5-cf76-4099-83ef-5d4d33165839.jpeg?height=1148&width=1860)\n\nMany of these campaigns were fulfilled in minutes or hours of their launch.

The success of the community to fulfill its goal is, after all, the purpose of the crowdfund. I haven't included this in the current report, since we're still so early in this process.\n\n\n# **Why do people contribute?**\n\n### Generalized and Productive Exchange\n\nThere are two models I've used for thinking about why people contribute. They relate to *Generalized* and *Productive* exchange, and are models that I find useful to reflect on with many of the mechanisms being built on Ethereum.\n\n![From Generalized Generosity: How the Norm of Generalized Reciprocity Bridges Collective Forms of Social Exchange](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e57a7431-418a-4e7d-8a51-83a2eb5ae5cf.jpeg?height=906&width=1374)\n\nAs we can see in the above diagrams ([Whitham, 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450)), *Generalized Exchange* is when people back campaigns because they are aware that they are part of a community that has trust and reciprocity norms. I think this explains why many people buy NFTs and participate in grants; they know that they're part of an exchange network that will end up moving funds around, and it'll come back to them (including token airdrops). There are many conversations on Twitter that give evidence for this.\n\n*Productive Exchange* happens when a contributor wants to become part of a community that is actually interdependent. The research linked above shows that this has powerful implications for trust and community building.\n\nI view [PartyDAO](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) as evidence for the productive exchange explanation. It turned out that many of the contributors themselves were artists, programmers, and writers, and contributed to the campaign *in order* to become formally associated with the project and with others who were involved (such as [John Palmer](https://j.mirror.xyz/), [Anish Agnihotri](http://anish.mirror.xyz/), [Denis](https://d.mirror.xyz/), [Jesse Walden](http://variant.mirror.xyz/), and [Li Jin](https://li.mirror.xyz/)) Once PartyDAO was fully funded, someone created a Discord chat for the group. Everybody introduced themselves, and started finding ways to contribute more to the project. In this sense, the crowdfund became the center of productive exchange.\n\n### **Patronage+**\n\nJesse Walden has [given a name](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo) to this new kind of interdependent funding model:\n\n> With regard to supporting creators, I've called this “[Patronage+](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1355165547441303554)” where the “plus” is the possibility of earning value alongside the creators you support.\n\nEven though it's not explicitly promised, a norm of interdependence might begin to form among these campaigns - leading to the formation of DAOs in the process.\n\n### Formal Mechanisms for Reciprocity\nThe crowdfunding contract includes a mechanism where members can \"burn\" their crowdfund tokens by sending them back to the contract. In doing so, they receive an amount of ETH *back* equal to the percentage of the totally supply they burned, multiplied by the amount of ETH in the contract. Therefore, if the amount of ETH in the contract has increased more than the initial crowdfunding goal, members can burn their tokens to receive more ETH than contributed in the first place.\n\nThis is likely to be the method by which DAOs increase the value of their crowdfunded project.\n\n# Future Directions\n\nEach time we have deployed a crowdfund, we have experimented with a new model. We're currently experimenting with combining ERC20 token reciprocation with NFT token minting as well (contributors will receive ERC20s as well as NFTs).\n\nWe're also thinking of doing more to serve the communities that form out of crowdfunding campaigns - to help them better coordinate and organize their resources.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nWe're seeing many unprecedented phenomena in Ethereum, enabled by embedded communities that can socially control capital and digital goods with minimal friction. \n\nSpecifically, this enables a unique combination of *generalized exchange* (grants, airdrops, crowdfunding) with *productive exchange* (e.g. interdependent, community-governed software projects like PartyDAO that has formal reciprocity mechanisms). There is [research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450) to suggest that this will impact trust and community-building.\n\nWe're learning something new each time we deploy a new Crowdfund, and the models are improving. It's an exciting journey, and the road ahead might involve funding amazing new types of goods and products, and creating digital communities that fit a new paradigm.", "timestamp": 1623466813, "digest": "GBj7emzIN5NBNFPLV6FGfN1c7GjSaZ_wEkjm5KQy2UE", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

Some crypto projects focus on simple metrics such as the amount of ETH held in their contracts, or the trading volume. Often, these measures depend on a small number of contributors who hold a large amount of ETH, and thereby obfuscate (intentionally or not) the reality of thin adoption. \n\nThe total amount raised via Mirror's crowdfunding feature is a small part of the story. For these few months, we artificially limited the contribution amounts per backer, as well as the total funding amount per campaign. We did this to learn in a very controlled way about the possible mechanisms, intentions, and aspirations our community has for this new tool. In fact, almost every crowdfund has worked slightly differently, as we've tweaked the underlying logic to learn more.\n\nUntil we make this feature fully accessible, the most useful metrics to judge our success may be indirect, and stem from questions such as:\n\n1. How many unique backers, on average, does each each project attract?\n2. How quickly are these backers able to fully fulfill the campaign's goal?\n3. How diverse are the projects being funded?\n4. What is the longevity of a project that is funded on Mirror, vs other funding platforms?\n5. How does crowdfunding contribute to the general enthusiasm around Mirror - e.g. to the popularity of the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race)?\n\nMany of these questions can be answered by reviewing public blockchain data. Here, I will reveal some general insights into the crowdfunding campaigns so far, and speculate on the reasons why people contribute to them, and where I see this phenomenon going in the future.\n\n# **What is a Mirror Crowdfund?**\n\nA crowdfund on Mirror is a simple way for someone to describe an idea, and receive support in the form of Ethereum token contributions (ETH) to work on it.\n\nWhen a backer contributes to the crowdfund, they also receive ERC20 tokens (these tokens are unique to the project being funded), in proportion to the magnitude of their contribution. \n\nThis token allocation creates an on-chain association between the backers and the project - uniting them an on-chain collective, bound by the crowdfund contract (and empowered by its embedded and embeddable functionality). Backers are able to \"burn\" their tokens at any time, in exchange for any underlying ETH in the contract.\n\n## How does a Mirror Crowdfund Differ from a \"Web2\" Crowdfund?\n\nMirror's crowdfunding tool is built on Ethereum, which makes it different from web2 problems (such as Kickstarter) across multiple paradigms. For example: \n\n1. **Lower friction:** Users don't need to create an account on Mirror (or even enter a credit card) to back a crowdfund. Backers use their own Ethereum account that controls their funds, and they contribute from that account. As long as someone is already an Ethereum user, this lowers the friction of contributing to a crowdfund substantially.\n2. **Global:** Anyone from around the world can participate in the crowdfund within a minute of its launch.\n3. **Equity, community, voice:** Users become associated through the crowdfund through the ERC20 token they receive in response to their contribution. Once the ERC20 token has been minted, they can use it like any other standard Ethereum token; they can transfer it to other accounts, trade it on Uniswap, use it for on-chain governance, etc.\n4. **Transparent:** All contributions are publicly auditable on the blockchain. Crowdfund details are displayed in Mirror's embeddable \"economic blocks\" that live-update with each contribution, displaying the backer's Twitter profile and the amount they contributed. This creates a lasting record of the community that formed around the crowdfund.\n5. **Integrative and Permissionless:** The crowdfund contract itself can be connected bidirectionally with other protocols on Ethereum, such as an NFT contract (by setting the NFT contract's funding recipient to be the crowdfund), or a [Split](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw). The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\n\n# Crowdfund Results\n\nThe total amount raised is over 118 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $309,000.\n\nAll campaigns so far have been artificially capped, so that we can maximize learning with limited risk.

What is the longevity of a project that is funded on Mirror, vs other funding platforms?\n5. How does crowdfunding contribute to the general enthusiasm around Mirror - e.g. to the popularity of the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race)?\n\nMany of these questions can be answered by reviewing public blockchain data. Here, I will reveal some general insights into the crowdfunding campaigns so far, and speculate on the reasons why people contribute to them, and where I see this phenomenon going in the future.\n\n# **What is a Mirror Crowdfund?**\n\nA crowdfund on Mirror is a simple way for someone to describe an idea, and receive support in the form of Ethereum token contributions (ETH) to work on it.\n\nWhen a backer contributes to the crowdfund, they also receive ERC20 tokens (these tokens are unique to the project being funded), in proportion to the magnitude of their contribution. \n\nThis token allocation creates an on-chain association between the backers and the project - uniting them an on-chain collective, bound by the crowdfund contract (and empowered by its embedded and embeddable functionality). Backers are able to \"burn\" their tokens at any time, in exchange for any underlying ETH in the contract.\n\n## How does a Mirror Crowdfund Differ from a \"Web2\" Crowdfund?\n\nMirror's crowdfunding tool is built on Ethereum, which makes it different from web2 problems (such as Kickstarter) across multiple paradigms. For example: \n\n1. **Lower friction:** Users don't need to create an account on Mirror (or even enter a credit card) to back a crowdfund. Backers use their own Ethereum account that controls their funds, and they contribute from that account. As long as someone is already an Ethereum user, this lowers the friction of contributing to a crowdfund substantially.\n2. **Global:** Anyone from around the world can participate in the crowdfund within a minute of its launch.\n3. **Equity, community, voice:** Users become associated through the crowdfund through the ERC20 token they receive in response to their contribution. Once the ERC20 token has been minted, they can use it like any other standard Ethereum token; they can transfer it to other accounts, trade it on Uniswap, use it for on-chain governance, etc.\n4. **Transparent:** All contributions are publicly auditable on the blockchain. Crowdfund details are displayed in Mirror's embeddable \"economic blocks\" that live-update with each contribution, displaying the backer's Twitter profile and the amount they contributed. This creates a lasting record of the community that formed around the crowdfund.\n5. **Integrative and Permissionless:** The crowdfund contract itself can be connected bidirectionally with other protocols on Ethereum, such as an NFT contract (by setting the NFT contract's funding recipient to be the crowdfund), or a [Split](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw). The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\n\n# Crowdfund Results\n\nThe total amount raised is over 118 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $309,000.\n\nAll campaigns so far have been artificially capped, so that we can maximize learning with limited risk. In includes total contribution amounts, as well as for individual contributions.\n\nThe majority of funds have been raised for writers; for essays, books, and newsletters. The bias towards writing is probably because Mirror has brand awareness with crypto-adjacent publishers (our homepage and Twitter account market the application as a publishing platform). Writers have raised over 80 ETH ($215,000) on Mirror so far for these writing-related projects.\n\nSoftware projects have also drawn a considerable amount; 32 ETH has been raised. We've also had one non-digital public goods funding campaign so far, for a non-profit related to outdoor conservation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/92e78f28-6c2a-4e43-9313-5a92569e2b4a.jpeg?height=946&width=1682)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/53904fb5-cf76-4099-83ef-5d4d33165839.jpeg?height=1148&width=1860)\n\nMany of these campaigns were fulfilled in minutes or hours of their launch. For example, if we look at the public logs for the PartyDAO crowdfund, we see that it raised $90,000 (value at the time) within hours:\n\n![About 4 hours from contract creation to the ultimate transfer of the 25 ETH. I'm aware that some of that time was spent finding a suitable wallet in which to store the funds!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11d80bcd-34e7-4cf8-8f4b-f1c0b2660a82.jpeg?height=400&width=1968)\n\n$ESSAY is another clear example, where the logs indicate that funding was opened and closed with an hour:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dd1490a-6186-4e50-a02b-5fc5d13d50d0.jpeg?height=106&width=1674)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b73fc04d-5e6b-4c50-91fd-38495df6ad93.jpeg?height=108&width=1108)\n\n## Future Measurements\n\nIt will be critical for us to track the longevity of these projects, and to understand barriers to these communities succeeding once the project has been funded. The success of the community to fulfill its goal is, after all, the purpose of the crowdfund. I haven't included this in the current report, since we're still so early in this process.\n\n\n# **Why do people contribute?**\n\n### Generalized and Productive Exchange\n\nThere are two models I've used for thinking about why people contribute. They relate to *Generalized* and *Productive* exchange, and are models that I find useful to reflect on with many of the mechanisms being built on Ethereum.\n\n![From Generalized Generosity: How the Norm of Generalized Reciprocity Bridges Collective Forms of Social Exchange](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e57a7431-418a-4e7d-8a51-83a2eb5ae5cf.jpeg?height=906&width=1374)\n\nAs we can see in the above diagrams ([Whitham, 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450)), *Generalized Exchange* is when people back campaigns because they are aware that they are part of a community that has trust and reciprocity norms. I think this explains why many people buy NFTs and participate in grants; they know that they're part of an exchange network that will end up moving funds around, and it'll come back to them (including token airdrops). There are many conversations on Twitter that give evidence for this.\n\n*Productive Exchange* happens when a contributor wants to become part of a community that is actually interdependent. The research linked above shows that this has powerful implications for trust and community building.\n\nI view [PartyDAO](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) as evidence for the productive exchange explanation. It turned out that many of the contributors themselves were artists, programmers, and writers, and contributed to the campaign *in order* to become formally associated with the project and with others who were involved (such as [John Palmer](https://j.mirror.xyz/), [Anish Agnihotri](http://anish.mirror.xyz/), [Denis](https://d.mirror.xyz/), [Jesse Walden](http://variant.mirror.xyz/), and [Li Jin](https://li.mirror.xyz/)) Once PartyDAO was fully funded, someone created a Discord chat for the group. Everybody introduced themselves, and started finding ways to contribute more to the project. In this sense, the crowdfund became the center of productive exchange.\n\n### **Patronage+**\n\nJesse Walden has [given a name](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo) to this new kind of interdependent funding model:\n\n> With regard to supporting creators, I've called this “[Patronage+](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1355165547441303554)” where the “plus” is the possibility of earning value alongside the creators you support.\n\nEven though it's not explicitly promised, a norm of interdependence might begin to form among these campaigns - leading to the formation of DAOs in the process.\n\n### Formal Mechanisms for Reciprocity\nThe crowdfunding contract includes a mechanism where members can \"burn\" their crowdfund tokens by sending them back to the contract. In doing so, they receive an amount of ETH *back* equal to the percentage of the totally supply they burned, multiplied by the amount of ETH in the contract. Therefore, if the amount of ETH in the contract has increased more than the initial crowdfunding goal, members can burn their tokens to receive more ETH than contributed in the first place.\n\nThis is likely to be the method by which DAOs increase the value of their crowdfunded project.\n\n# Future Directions\n\nEach time we have deployed a crowdfund, we have experimented with a new model. We're currently experimenting with combining ERC20 token reciprocation with NFT token minting as well (contributors will receive ERC20s as well as NFTs).\n\nWe're also thinking of doing more to serve the communities that form out of crowdfunding campaigns - to help them better coordinate and organize their resources.\n\nAs mentioned previously, it's likely that we will see more DAOs form out of this model. In this case, it might be important to focus on supporting those DAOs in their missions - by providing them with tools necessary to coordinate and socially manage their capital and digital goods.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nWe're seeing many unprecedented phenomena in Ethereum, enabled by embedded communities that can socially control capital and digital goods with minimal friction. \n\nSpecifically, this enables a unique combination of *generalized exchange* (grants, airdrops, crowdfunding) with *productive exchange* (e.g. interdependent, community-governed software projects like PartyDAO that has formal reciprocity mechanisms).

As long as someone is already an Ethereum user, this lowers the friction of contributing to a crowdfund substantially.\n2. **Global:** Anyone from around the world can participate in the crowdfund within a minute of its launch.\n3. **Equity, community, voice:** Users become associated through the crowdfund through the ERC20 token they receive in response to their contribution. Once the ERC20 token has been minted, they can use it like any other standard Ethereum token; they can transfer it to other accounts, trade it on Uniswap, use it for on-chain governance, etc.\n4. **Transparent:** All contributions are publicly auditable on the blockchain. Crowdfund details are displayed in Mirror's embeddable \"economic blocks\" that live-update with each contribution, displaying the backer's Twitter profile and the amount they contributed. This creates a lasting record of the community that formed around the crowdfund.\n5. **Integrative and Permissionless:** The crowdfund contract itself can be connected bidirectionally with other protocols on Ethereum, such as an NFT contract (by setting the NFT contract's funding recipient to be the crowdfund), or a [Split](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw). The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\n\n# Crowdfund Results\n\nThe total amount raised is over 134 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $351,400.\n\nAll campaigns so far have been artificially capped, so that we can maximize learning with limited risk. In includes total contribution amounts, as well as for individual contributions.\n\nThe majority of funds have been raised for writers; for essays, books, and newsletters. The bias towards writing is probably because Mirror has brand awareness with crypto-adjacent publishers (our homepage and Twitter account market the application as a publishing platform). Writers have raised over 80 ETH ($215,000) on Mirror so far for these writing-related projects.\n\nSoftware projects have also drawn a considerable amount; 32 ETH has been raised. We've also had one non-digital public goods funding campaign so far, for a non-profit related to outdoor conservation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a2a8a54-4703-4cc0-b336-52bcbdb88f7c.jpeg?height=736&width=1198)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/03d8eb10-b4a6-40a7-a0ae-6cb07cb5049d.jpeg?height=1114&width=1670)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a233152-3b5c-4b93-b172-1b52f8f62b44.jpeg?height=734&width=1196)\n\nMany of these campaigns were fulfilled in minutes or hours of their launch.

The success of the community to fulfill its goal is, after all, the purpose of the crowdfund. I haven't included this in the current report, since we're still so early in this process.\n\n\n# **Why do people contribute?**\n\n### Generalized and Productive Exchange\n\nThere are two models I've used for thinking about why people contribute. They relate to *Generalized* and *Productive* exchange, and are models that I find useful to reflect on with many of the mechanisms being built on Ethereum.\n\n![From Generalized Generosity: How the Norm of Generalized Reciprocity Bridges Collective Forms of Social Exchange](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e57a7431-418a-4e7d-8a51-83a2eb5ae5cf.jpeg?height=906&width=1374)\n\nAs we can see in the above diagrams ([Whitham, 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450)), *Generalized Exchange* is when people back campaigns because they are aware that they are part of a community that has trust and reciprocity norms. I think this explains why many people buy NFTs and participate in grants; they know that they're part of an exchange network that will end up moving funds around, and it'll come back to them (including token airdrops). There are many conversations on Twitter that give evidence for this.\n\n*Productive Exchange* happens when a contributor wants to become part of a community that is actually interdependent. The research linked above shows that this has powerful implications for trust and community building.\n\nI view [PartyDAO](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) as evidence for the productive exchange explanation. It turned out that many of the contributors themselves were artists, programmers, and writers, and contributed to the campaign *in order* to become formally associated with the project and with others who were involved (such as [John Palmer](https://j.mirror.xyz/), [Anish Agnihotri](http://anish.mirror.xyz/), [Denis](https://d.mirror.xyz/), [Jesse Walden](http://variant.mirror.xyz/), and [Li Jin](https://li.mirror.xyz/)) Once PartyDAO was fully funded, someone created a Discord for the group. Everybody introduced themselves, and started finding ways to contribute more to the project. In this sense, the crowdfund became the center of productive exchange.\n\n### **Patronage+**\n\nJesse Walden has [given a name](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo) to this new kind of interdependent funding model:\n\n> With regard to supporting creators, I've called this “[Patronage+](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1355165547441303554)” where the “plus” is the possibility of earning value alongside the creators you support.\n\nEven though it's not explicitly promised, a norm of interdependence is beginning to form among crowdfunds.\n\n### Formal Mechanisms for Reciprocity\nThe crowdfunding contract includes a mechanism where members can \"burn\" their crowdfund tokens by sending them back to the contract. In doing so, they receive an amount of ETH *back* equal to the percentage of the totally supply they burned, multiplied by the amount of ETH in the contract. Therefore, if the amount of ETH in the contract has increased more than the initial crowdfunding goal, members can burn their tokens to receive more ETH than contributed in the first place.\n\n# Future Directions\n\nEach time we have deployed a crowdfund, we have experimented with a new model. We're currently experimenting with combining ERC20 token reciprocation with NFT token minting as well (contributors will receive ERC20s as well as NFTs).\n\nWe're also thinking of doing more to serve the communities that form out of crowdfunding campaigns - to help them better coordinate and organize their resources.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nWe're seeing many unprecedented phenomena in Ethereum, enabled by embedded communities that can socially control capital and digital goods with minimal friction. \n\nSpecifically, this enables a unique combination of *generalized exchange* (grants, airdrops, crowdfunding) with *productive exchange* (e.g. interdependent, community-governed software projects like PartyDAO that has formal reciprocity mechanisms). There is [research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450) to suggest that this will impact trust and community-building.\n\nWe're learning something new each time we deploy a new Crowdfund, and the models are improving. It's an exciting journey, and the road ahead might involve funding amazing new types of goods and products, and creating digital communities that fit a new paradigm.", "timestamp": 1623467537, "digest": "GBj7emzIN5NBNFPLV6FGfN1c7GjSaZ_wEkjm5KQy2UE", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}
{"id": "6USHj9yuhRBdBQRmDpEB9JhjurBPHs8TI8ONiQ5hWPM", "title": "Measuring the Success of Mirror Crowdfunding", "body": "Four months ago, our team [launched Mirror Crowdfunding](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ)*.* We have had a number of successful campaigns - attracting a median participation of 52 backers per project, and raising a total of over 118 ETH ($300,000 at time of writing) for books, essays, software, newsletters, and public goods.\n\n# **What is a Mirror Crowdfund?**\n\nA crowdfund on Mirror is a simple way for someone to describe an idea, and receive support in the form of Ethereum token contributions (ETH) to work on it.\n\nWhen a backer contributes to the crowdfund, they also receive ERC20 tokens (these tokens are unique to the project being funded), in proportion to the magnitude of their contribution. \n\nThis token allocation creates an on-chain association between the backers and the project - uniting them an on-chain collective, bound by the crowdfund contract (and empowered by its embedded and embeddable functionality). Backers are able to \"burn\" their tokens at any time, in exchange for any underlying ETH in the contract.\n\n## How does a Mirror Crowdfund Differ from a \"Web2\" Crowdfund?\n\nMirror's crowdfunding tool is built on Ethereum, which makes it different from web2 problems (such as Kickstarter) across multiple paradigms. For example: \n\n1. **Lower friction:** Users don't need to create an account on Mirror (or even enter a credit card) to back a crowdfund. Backers use their own Ethereum account that controls their funds, and they contribute from that account. As long as someone is already an Ethereum user, this lowers the friction of contributing to a crowdfund substantially.\n2. **Global:** Anyone from around the world can participate in the crowdfund within a minute of its launch.\n3. **Equity, community, voice:** Users become associated through the crowdfund through the ERC20 token they receive in response to their contribution. Once the ERC20 token has been minted, they can use it like any other standard Ethereum token; they can transfer it to other accounts, trade it on Uniswap, use it for on-chain governance, etc.\n4. **Transparent:** All contributions are publicly auditable on the blockchain. Crowdfund details are displayed in Mirror's embeddable \"economic blocks\" that live-update with each contribution, displaying the backer's Twitter profile and the amount they contributed.

The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\n\n## How should we measure success?\nWe should be critical in how we measure success. Some crypto projects focus on simple metrics such as the amount of ETH held in their contracts, or the trading volume. Often, these measures depend on a small number of contributors who hold a large amount of ETH, and thereby obfuscate (intentionally or not) the reality of thin adoption. \n\nThe total amount raised via Mirror's crowdfunding feature is a small part of the story. For these few months, we artificially limited the contribution amounts per backer, as well as the total funding amount per campaign. We did this to learn in a very controlled way about the possible mechanisms, intentions, and aspirations our community has for this new tool. In fact, almost every crowdfund has worked slightly differently, as we've tweaked the underlying logic to learn more.\n\nUntil we make this feature fully accessible, the most useful metrics to judge our success may be indirect, and stem from questions such as:\n\n1. How many unique backers, on average, does each each project attract?\n2. How quickly are these backers able to fulfill the campaign's goal?\n3. How diverse are the projects being funded?\n4. What is the longevity of a project that is funded on Mirror, vs other funding platforms?\n5. How does crowdfunding contribute to the general enthusiasm around Mirror - e.g. to the popularity of the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race)?\n\nMany of these questions can be answered by reviewing public blockchain data. Here, I will reveal some general insights into the crowdfunding campaigns so far, and speculate on the reasons why people contribute to them, and where I see this phenomenon going in the future.\n\n# Crowdfund Results\n\nThe total amount raised is over 118 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $309,000.\n\nAll campaigns so far have been artificially capped, so that we can maximize learning with limited risk. In includes total contribution amounts, as well as for individual contributions.\n\nThe majority of funds have been raised for writers; for essays, books, and newsletters.

It turned out that many of the contributors themselves were artists, programmers, and writers, and contributed to the campaign *in order* to become formally associated with the project and with others who were involved (such as [John Palmer](https://j.mirror.xyz/), [Anish Agnihotri](http://anish.mirror.xyz/), [Denis](https://d.mirror.xyz/), [Jesse Walden](http://variant.mirror.xyz/), and [Li Jin](https://li.mirror.xyz/)) Once PartyDAO was fully funded, someone created a Discord chat for the group. Everybody introduced themselves, and started finding ways to contribute more to the project. In this sense, the crowdfund became the center of productive exchange.\n\n### **Patronage+**\n\nJesse Walden has [given a name](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo) to this new kind of interdependent funding model:\n\n> With regard to supporting creators, I've called this “[Patronage+](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1355165547441303554)” where the “plus” is the possibility of earning value alongside the creators you support.\n\nEven though it's not explicitly promised, a norm of interdependence might begin to form among these campaigns - leading to the formation of DAOs in the process.\n\n### Formal Mechanisms for Reciprocity\nThe crowdfunding contract includes a mechanism where members can \"burn\" their crowdfund tokens by sending them back to the contract. In doing so, they receive an amount of ETH *back* equal to the percentage of the totally supply they burned, multiplied by the amount of ETH in the contract. Therefore, if the amount of ETH in the contract has increased more than the initial crowdfunding goal, members can burn their tokens to receive more ETH than contributed in the first place.\n\nThis is likely to be the method by which DAOs increase the value of their crowdfunded project.\n\n# Future Directions\n\nEach time we have deployed a crowdfund, we have experimented with a new model. We're currently experimenting with combining ERC20 token reciprocation with NFT token minting as well (contributors will receive ERC20s as well as NFTs).\n\nWe're also thinking of doing more to serve the communities that form out of crowdfunding campaigns - to help them better coordinate and organize their resources.\n\nAs mentioned previously, it's likely that we will see more DAOs form out of this model.

{"id": "Nj7VqClovm0j0_muXqQA2pDdJpitU28G_QSeqTumzhs", "title": "Measuring the Success of Mirror Crowdfunding", "body": "Four months ago, our team [launched Mirror Crowdfunding](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ)*.* We have had a number of successful campaigns - attracting a median participation of 54 backers per project, and raising a total of over 134 ETH ($351,400 at time of writing) for books, essays, software, newsletters, and public goods.\n\n# **What is a Mirror Crowdfund?**\n\nA crowdfund on Mirror is a simple way for someone to describe an idea, and receive support in the form of Ethereum token contributions (ETH) to work on it.\n\nWhen a backer contributes to the crowdfund, they also receive ERC20 tokens (these tokens are unique to the project being funded), in proportion to the magnitude of their contribution. \n\nThis token allocation creates an on-chain association between the backers and the project - uniting them an on-chain collective, bound by the crowdfund contract (and empowered by its embedded and embeddable functionality). Backers are able to \"burn\" their tokens at any time, in exchange for any underlying ETH in the contract.\n\n## How does a Mirror Crowdfund Differ from a \"Web2\" Crowdfund?\n\nMirror's crowdfunding tool is built on Ethereum, which makes it different from web2 problems (such as Kickstarter) across multiple paradigms. For example: \n\n1. **Lower friction:** Users don't need to create an account on Mirror (or even enter a credit card) to back a crowdfund. Backers use their own Ethereum account that controls their funds, and they contribute from that account. As long as someone is already an Ethereum user, this lowers the friction of contributing to a crowdfund substantially.\n2. **Global:** Anyone from around the world can participate in the crowdfund within a minute of its launch.\n3. **Equity, community, voice:** Users become associated through the crowdfund through the ERC20 token they receive in response to their contribution. Once the ERC20 token has been minted, they can use it like any other standard Ethereum token; they can transfer it to other accounts, trade it on Uniswap, use it for on-chain governance, etc.\n4. **Transparent:** All contributions are publicly auditable on the blockchain. Crowdfund details are displayed in Mirror's embeddable \"economic blocks\" that live-update with each contribution, displaying the backer's Twitter profile and the amount they contributed. This creates a lasting record of the community that formed around the crowdfund.\n5. **Integrative and Permissionless:** The crowdfund contract itself can be connected bidirectionally with other protocols on Ethereum, such as an NFT contract (by setting the NFT contract's funding recipient to be the crowdfund), or a [Split](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw). The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\n\n## How should we measure success?\nWe should be critical in how we measure success. Some crypto projects focus on simple metrics such as the amount of ETH held in their contracts, or the trading volume. Often, these measures depend on a small number of contributors who hold a large amount of ETH, and thereby obfuscate (intentionally or not) the reality of thin adoption. \n\nThe total amount raised via Mirror's crowdfunding feature is a small part of the story. For these few months, we artificially limited the contribution amounts per backer, as well as the total funding amount per campaign. We did this to learn in a very controlled way about the possible mechanisms, intentions, and aspirations our community has for this new tool. In fact, almost every crowdfund has worked slightly differently, as we've tweaked the underlying logic to learn more.\n\nUntil we make this feature fully accessible, the most useful metrics to judge our success may be indirect, and stem from questions such as:\n\n1. How many unique backers, on average, does each each project attract?\n2. How quickly are these backers able to fulfill the campaign's goal?\n3. How diverse are the projects being funded?\n4. What is the longevity of a project that is funded on Mirror, vs other funding platforms?\n5. How does crowdfunding contribute to the general enthusiasm around Mirror - e.g. to the popularity of the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race)?\n\nMany of these questions can be answered by reviewing public blockchain data. Here, I will reveal some general insights into the crowdfunding campaigns so far, and speculate on the reasons why people contribute to them, and where I see this phenomenon going in the future.\n\n# Crowdfund Results\n\nThe total amount raised is over 134 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $351,400.\n\nAll campaigns so far have been artificially capped, so that we can maximize learning with limited risk. In includes total contribution amounts, as well as for individual contributions.\n\nThe majority of funds have been raised for writers; for essays, books, and newsletters. The bias towards writing is probably because Mirror has brand awareness with crypto-adjacent publishers (our homepage and Twitter account market the application as a publishing platform). Writers have raised over 80 ETH ($215,000) on Mirror so far for these writing-related projects.\n\nSoftware projects have also drawn a considerable amount; 32 ETH has been raised. We've also had one non-digital public goods funding campaign so far, for a non-profit related to outdoor conservation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/50ef13ca-d202-4d40-9f91-818b6e2b39f8.jpeg?height=736&width=1198)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7c997d31-669f-4be8-b0a2-71386fa098c7.jpeg?height=1108&width=1680)\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a9bb080a-ca58-4fea-8474-c02a10635685.jpeg?height=734&width=1196)\n\n\nMany of these campaigns were fulfilled in minutes or hours of their launch. For example, if we look at the public logs for the PartyDAO crowdfund, we see that it raised $90,000 (value at the time) within hours:\n\n![About 4 hours from contract creation to the ultimate transfer of the 25 ETH. I'm aware that some of that time was spent finding a suitable wallet in which to store the funds!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11d80bcd-34e7-4cf8-8f4b-f1c0b2660a82.jpeg?height=400&width=1968)\n\n$ESSAY is another clear example, where the logs indicate that funding was opened and closed with an hour:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dd1490a-6186-4e50-a02b-5fc5d13d50d0.jpeg?height=106&width=1674)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b73fc04d-5e6b-4c50-91fd-38495df6ad93.jpeg?height=108&width=1108)\n\n## Future Measurements\n\nIt will be critical for us to track the longevity of these projects, and to understand barriers to these communities succeeding once the project has been funded. The success of the community to fulfill its goal is, after all, the purpose of the crowdfund. I haven't included this in the current report, since we're still so early in this process.\n\n\n# **Why do people contribute?**\n\n### Generalized and Productive Exchange\n\nThere are two models I've used for thinking about why people contribute. They relate to *Generalized* and *Productive* exchange, and are models that I find useful to reflect on with many of the mechanisms being built on Ethereum.\n\n![From Generalized Generosity: How the Norm of Generalized Reciprocity Bridges Collective Forms of Social Exchange](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e57a7431-418a-4e7d-8a51-83a2eb5ae5cf.jpeg?height=906&width=1374)\n\nAs we can see in the above diagrams ([Whitham, 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450)), *Generalized Exchange* is when people back campaigns because they are aware that they are part of a community that has trust and reciprocity norms. I think this explains why many people buy NFTs and participate in grants; they know that they're part of an exchange network that will end up moving funds around, and it'll come back to them (including token airdrops). There are many conversations on Twitter that give evidence for this.\n\n*Productive Exchange* happens when a contributor wants to become part of a community that is actually interdependent. The research linked above shows that this has powerful implications for trust and community building.\n\nI view [PartyDAO](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) as evidence for the productive exchange explanation.

As long as someone is already an Ethereum user, this lowers the friction of contributing to a crowdfund substantially.\n2. **Global:** Anyone from around the world can participate in the crowdfund within a minute of its launch.\n3. **Equity, community, voice:** Users become associated through the crowdfund through the ERC20 token they receive in response to their contribution. Once the ERC20 token has been minted, they can use it like any other standard Ethereum token; they can transfer it to other accounts, trade it on Uniswap, use it for on-chain governance, etc.\n4. **Transparent:** All contributions are publicly auditable on the blockchain. Crowdfund details are displayed in Mirror's embeddable \"economic blocks\" that live-update with each contribution, displaying the backer's Twitter profile and the amount they contributed. This creates a lasting record of the community that formed around the crowdfund.\n5. **Integrative and Permissionless:** The crowdfund contract itself can be connected bidirectionally with other protocols on Ethereum, such as an NFT contract (by setting the NFT contract's funding recipient to be the crowdfund), or a [Split](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw). The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\n\n## How should we measure success?\nWe should be critical in how we measure success. Some crypto projects focus on simple metrics such as the amount of ETH held in their contracts, or the trading volume. Often, these measures depend on a small number of contributors who hold a large amount of ETH, and thereby obfuscate (intentionally or not) the reality of thin adoption. \n\nThe total amount raised via Mirror's crowdfunding feature is a small part of the story. For these few months, we artificially limited the contribution amounts per backer, as well as the total funding amount per campaign. We did this to learn in a very controlled way about the possible mechanisms, intentions, and aspirations our community has for this new tool. In fact, almost every crowdfund has worked slightly differently, as we've tweaked the underlying logic to learn more.\n\nUntil we make this feature fully accessible, the most useful metrics to judge our success may be indirect, and stem from questions such as:\n\n1. How many unique backers, on average, does each each project attract?\n2. How quickly are these backers able to fulfill the campaign's goal?\n3. How diverse are the projects being funded?\n4. What is the longevity of a project that is funded on Mirror, vs other funding platforms?\n5. How does crowdfunding contribute to the general enthusiasm around Mirror - e.g. to the popularity of the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race)?\n\nMany of these questions can be answered by reviewing public blockchain data. Here, I will reveal some general insights into the crowdfunding campaigns so far, and speculate on the reasons why people contribute to them, and where I see this phenomenon going in the future.\n\n# Crowdfund Results\n\nThe total amount raised is over 134 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $351,400.\n\nAll campaigns so far have been artificially capped, so that we can maximize learning with limited risk. In includes total contribution amounts, as well as for individual contributions.\n\nThe majority of funds have been raised for writers; for essays, books, and newsletters. The bias towards writing is probably because Mirror has brand awareness with crypto-adjacent publishers (our homepage and Twitter account market the application as a publishing platform). Writers have raised over 80 ETH ($215,000) on Mirror so far for these writing-related projects.\n\nSoftware projects have also drawn a considerable amount; 32 ETH has been raised. We've also had one non-digital public goods funding campaign so far, for a non-profit related to outdoor conservation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/50ef13ca-d202-4d40-9f91-818b6e2b39f8.jpeg?height=736&width=1198)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7c997d31-669f-4be8-b0a2-71386fa098c7.jpeg?height=1108&width=1680)\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a9bb080a-ca58-4fea-8474-c02a10635685.jpeg?height=734&width=1196)\n\n\nMany of these campaigns were fulfilled in minutes or hours of their launch. For example, if we look at the public logs for the PartyDAO crowdfund, we see that it raised $90,000 (value at the time) within hours:\n\n![About 4 hours from contract creation to the ultimate transfer of the 25 ETH. I'm aware that some of that time was spent finding a suitable wallet in which to store the funds!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11d80bcd-34e7-4cf8-8f4b-f1c0b2660a82.jpeg?height=400&width=1968)\n\n$ESSAY is another clear example, where the logs indicate that funding was opened and closed with an hour:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dd1490a-6186-4e50-a02b-5fc5d13d50d0.jpeg?height=106&width=1674)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b73fc04d-5e6b-4c50-91fd-38495df6ad93.jpeg?height=108&width=1108)\n\n## Future Measurements\n\nIt will be critical for us to track the longevity of these projects, and to understand barriers to these communities succeeding once the project has been funded. The success of the community to fulfill its goal is, after all, the purpose of the crowdfund. I haven't included this in the current report, since we're still so early in this process.\n\n\n# **Why do people contribute?**\n\n### Generalized and Productive Exchange\n\nThere are two models I've used for thinking about why people contribute. They relate to *Generalized* and *Productive* exchange, and are models that I find useful to reflect on with many of the mechanisms being built on Ethereum.\n\n![From Generalized Generosity: How the Norm of Generalized Reciprocity Bridges Collective Forms of Social Exchange](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e57a7431-418a-4e7d-8a51-83a2eb5ae5cf.jpeg?height=906&width=1374)\n\nAs we can see in the above diagrams ([Whitham, 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450)), *Generalized Exchange* is when people back campaigns because they are aware that they are part of a community that has trust and reciprocity norms. I think this explains why many people buy NFTs and participate in grants; they know that they're part of an exchange network that will end up moving funds around, and it'll come back to them (including token airdrops). There are many conversations on Twitter that give evidence for this.\n\n*Productive Exchange* happens when a contributor wants to become part of a community that is actually interdependent. The research linked above shows that this has powerful implications for trust and community building.\n\nI view [PartyDAO](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) as evidence for the productive exchange explanation. It turned out that many of the contributors themselves were artists, programmers, and writers, and contributed to the campaign *in order* to become formally associated with the project and with others who were involved (such as [John Palmer](https://j.mirror.xyz/), [Anish Agnihotri](http://anish.mirror.xyz/), [Denis](https://d.mirror.xyz/), [Jesse Walden](http://variant.mirror.xyz/), and [Li Jin](https://li.mirror.xyz/)) Once PartyDAO was fully funded, someone created a Discord chat for the group. Everybody introduced themselves, and started finding ways to contribute more to the project. In this sense, the crowdfund became the center of productive exchange.\n\n### **Patronage+**\n\nJesse Walden has [given a name](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo) to this new kind of interdependent funding model:\n\n> With regard to supporting creators, I've called this “[Patronage+](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1355165547441303554)” where the “plus” is the possibility of earning value alongside the creators you support.\n\nEven though it's not explicitly promised, a norm of interdependence might begin to form among these campaigns - leading to the formation of DAOs in the process.\n\n### Formal Mechanisms for Reciprocity\nThe crowdfunding contract includes a mechanism where members can \"burn\" their crowdfund tokens by sending them back to the contract. In doing so, they receive an amount of ETH *back* equal to the percentage of the totally supply they burned, multiplied by the amount of ETH in the contract. Therefore, if the amount of ETH in the contract has increased more than the initial crowdfunding goal, members can burn their tokens to receive more ETH than contributed in the first place.\n\nThis is likely to be the method by which DAOs increase the value of their crowdfunded project.\n\n# Future Directions\n\nEach time we have deployed a crowdfund, we have experimented with a new model. We're currently experimenting with combining ERC20 token reciprocation with NFT token minting as well (contributors will receive ERC20s as well as NFTs).\n\nWe're also thinking of doing more to serve the communities that form out of crowdfunding campaigns - to help them better coordinate and organize their resources.\n\nAs mentioned previously, it's likely that we will see more DAOs form out of this model. In this case, it might be important to focus on supporting those DAOs in their missions - by providing them with tools necessary to coordinate and socially manage their capital and digital goods.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nWe're seeing many unprecedented phenomena in Ethereum, enabled by embedded communities that can socially control capital and digital goods with minimal friction. \n\nSpecifically, this enables a unique combination of *generalized exchange* (grants, airdrops, crowdfunding) with *productive exchange* (e.g. interdependent, community-governed software projects like PartyDAO that has formal reciprocity mechanisms). There is [research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450) to suggest that this will impact trust and community-building.\n\nWe're learning more each time we deploy a Crowdfund, and our theoretical models are becoming richer. It's an exciting journey, and the road ahead might involve funding amazing new types of goods and products, and creating digital communities that fit a new paradigm.", "timestamp": 1623473554, "digest": "GBj7emzIN5NBNFPLV6FGfN1c7GjSaZ_wEkjm5KQy2UE", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}

I'm aware that some of that time was spent finding a suitable wallet in which to store the funds!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11d80bcd-34e7-4cf8-8f4b-f1c0b2660a82.jpeg?height=400&width=1968)\n\n$ESSAY is another clear example, where the logs indicate that funding was opened and closed with an hour:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dd1490a-6186-4e50-a02b-5fc5d13d50d0.jpeg?height=106&width=1674)\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b73fc04d-5e6b-4c50-91fd-38495df6ad93.jpeg?height=108&width=1108)\n\n## Future Measurements\n\nIt will be critical for us to track the longevity of these projects, and to understand barriers to these communities succeeding once the project has been funded. The success of the community to fulfill its goal is, after all, the purpose of the crowdfund. I haven't included this in the current report, since we're still so early in this process.\n\nUpdate: As [@M0zrat](https://twitter.com/M0zrat) mentioned: It will also be important to track the distribution of repeat backers vs those who come to Mirror to crowdfund a specific project.\n\n\n# **Why do people contribute?**\n\n### Generalized and Productive Exchange\n\nThere are two models I've used for thinking about why people contribute. They relate to *Generalized* and *Productive* exchange, and are models that I find useful to reflect on with many of the mechanisms being built on Ethereum.\n\n![From Generalized Generosity: How the Norm of Generalized Reciprocity Bridges Collective Forms of Social Exchange](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e57a7431-418a-4e7d-8a51-83a2eb5ae5cf.jpeg?height=906&width=1374)\n\nAs we can see in the above diagrams ([Whitham, 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450)), *Generalized Exchange* is when people back campaigns because they are aware that they are part of a community that has trust and reciprocity norms. I think this explains why many people buy NFTs and participate in grants; they know that they're part of an exchange network that will end up moving funds around, and it'll come back to them (including token airdrops). There are many conversations on Twitter that give evidence for this.\n\n*Productive Exchange* happens when a contributor wants to become part of a community that is actually interdependent. The research linked above shows that this has powerful implications for trust and community building.\n\nI view [PartyDAO](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) as evidence for the productive exchange explanation. It turned out that many of the contributors themselves were artists, programmers, and writers, and contributed to the campaign *in order* to become formally associated with the project and with others who were involved (such as [John Palmer](https://j.mirror.xyz/), [Anish Agnihotri](http://anish.mirror.xyz/), [Denis](https://d.mirror.xyz/), [Jesse Walden](http://variant.mirror.xyz/), and [Li Jin](https://li.mirror.xyz/)) Once PartyDAO was fully funded, someone created a Discord chat for the group. Everybody introduced themselves, and started finding ways to contribute more to the project. In this sense, the crowdfund became the center of productive exchange.\n\n### **Patronage+**\n\nJesse Walden has [given a name](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo) to this new kind of interdependent funding model:\n\n> With regard to supporting creators, I've called this “[Patronage+](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1355165547441303554)” where the “plus” is the possibility of earning value alongside the creators you support.\n\nEven though it's not explicitly promised, a norm of interdependence might begin to form among these campaigns - leading to the formation of DAOs in the process.\n\n### Formal Mechanisms for Reciprocity\nThe crowdfunding contract includes a mechanism where members can \"burn\" their crowdfund tokens by sending them back to the contract. In doing so, they receive an amount of ETH *back* equal to the percentage of the totally supply they burned, multiplied by the amount of ETH in the contract. Therefore, if the amount of ETH in the contract has increased more than the initial crowdfunding goal, members can burn their tokens to receive more ETH than contributed in the first place.\n\nThis is likely to be the method by which DAOs increase the value of their crowdfunded project.\n\n# Future Directions\n\nEach time we have deployed a crowdfund, we have experimented with a new model. We're currently experimenting with combining ERC20 token reciprocation with NFT token minting as well (contributors will receive ERC20s as well as NFTs).\n\nWe're also thinking of doing more to serve the communities that form out of crowdfunding campaigns - to help them better coordinate and organize their resources.\n\nAs mentioned previously, it's likely that we will see more DAOs form out of this model. In this case, it might be important to focus on supporting those DAOs in their missions - by providing them with tools necessary to coordinate and socially manage their capital and digital goods.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nWe're seeing many unprecedented phenomena in Ethereum, enabled by embedded communities that can socially control capital and digital goods with minimal friction. \n\nSpecifically, this enables a unique combination of *generalized exchange* (grants, airdrops, crowdfunding) with *productive exchange* (e.g. interdependent, community-governed software projects like PartyDAO that has formal reciprocity mechanisms). There is [research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450) to suggest that this will impact trust and community-building.\n\nWe're learning more each time we deploy a Crowdfund, and our theoretical models are becoming richer. It's an exciting journey, and the road ahead might involve funding amazing new types of goods and products, and creating digital communities that fit a new paradigm.", "timestamp": 1623517977, "digest": "GBj7emzIN5NBNFPLV6FGfN1c7GjSaZ_wEkjm5KQy2UE", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}
{"id": "l4BsO47-DuLod-KPBlxG5VF2vLJeKgIHGu5DkYNYyGM", "title": "Measuring the Success of Mirror Crowdfunding", "body": "Four months ago, our team [launched Mirror Crowdfunding](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ)*.* We have had a number of successful campaigns - attracting a median participation of 54 backers per project, and raising a total of over 134 ETH ($351,400 at time of writing) for books, essays, software, newsletters, and public goods.\n\nThis essay is a critical exploration of the success of Mirror Crowdfunding so far. I also argue that a rare combination social exchange underlie these campaigns - generalized and productive exchange.\n\n# **What is a Mirror Crowdfund?**\n\nA crowdfund on Mirror is a simple way for someone to describe an idea, and receive support in the form of Ethereum token contributions (ETH) to work on it.\n\nWhen a backer contributes to the crowdfund, they also receive ERC20 tokens (these tokens are unique to the project being funded), in proportion to the magnitude of their contribution. \n\nThis token allocation creates an on-chain association between the backers and the project - uniting them in an on-chain collective, bound by the crowdfund contract (and empowered by its functionality). Backers are able to \"burn\" their tokens at any time, in exchange for any underlying ETH in the contract.\n\n## How does a Mirror Crowdfund Differ from a \"Web2\" Crowdfund?\n\nMirror's crowdfunding tool is built on Ethereum, which makes it different from web2 problems (such as Kickstarter) across multiple paradigms. For example: \n\n1. **Lower friction:** Users don't need to create an account on Mirror (or even enter a credit card) to back a crowdfund. Backers use their own Ethereum account that controls their funds, and they contribute from that account. As long as someone is already an Ethereum user, this lowers the friction of contributing to a crowdfund substantially.\n2. **Global:** Anyone from around the world can participate in the crowdfund within a minute of its launch.\n3. **Equity, community, voice:** Users become associated through the crowdfund through the ERC20 token they receive in response to their contribution. Once the ERC20 token has been minted, they can use it like any other standard Ethereum token; they can transfer it to other accounts, trade it on Uniswap, use it for on-chain governance, etc.\n4. **Transparent:** All contributions are publicly auditable on the blockchain. Crowdfund details are displayed in Mirror's embeddable \"economic blocks\" that live-update with each contribution, displaying the backer's Twitter profile and the amount they contributed. This creates a lasting record of the community that formed around the crowdfund.\n5. **Integrative and Permissionless:** The crowdfund contract itself can be connected bidirectionally with other protocols on Ethereum, such as an NFT contract (by setting the NFT contract's funding recipient to be the crowdfund), or a [Split](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw). The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\n\n## How should we measure success?\nWe should be critical in how we measure success. Some crypto projects focus on simple metrics such as the amount of ETH held in their contracts, or the trading volume. Often, these measures depend on a small number of contributors who hold a large amount of ETH, and thereby obfuscate (intentionally or not) the reality of thin adoption. \n\nThe total amount raised via Mirror's crowdfunding feature is a small part of the story. For these few months, we artificially limited the contribution amounts per backer, as well as the total funding amount per campaign. We did this to learn in a very controlled way about the possible mechanisms, intentions, and aspirations our community has for this new tool. In fact, almost every crowdfund has worked slightly differently, as we've tweaked the underlying logic to learn more.\n\nUntil we make this feature fully accessible, the most useful metrics to judge our success may be indirect, and stem from questions such as:\n\n1. How many unique backers, on average, does each each project attract?\n2. How quickly are these backers able to fulfill the campaign's goal?\n3. How diverse are the projects being funded?\n4. What is the longevity of a project that is funded on Mirror, vs other funding platforms?\n5. How does crowdfunding contribute to the general enthusiasm around Mirror - e.g. to the popularity of the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race)?\n\nMany of these questions can be answered by reviewing public blockchain data. Here, I will reveal some general insights into the crowdfunding campaigns so far, and speculate on the reasons why people contribute to them, and where I see this phenomenon going in the future.\n\n# Crowdfund Results\n\nThe total amount raised is over 134 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $351,400.\n\nAll campaigns so far have been artificially capped, so that we can maximize learning with limited risk. In includes total contribution amounts, as well as for individual contributions.\n\nThe majority of funds have been raised for writers; for essays, books, and newsletters. The bias towards writing is probably because Mirror has brand awareness with crypto-adjacent publishers (our homepage and Twitter account market the application as a publishing platform). Writers have raised over 80 ETH ($215,000) on Mirror so far for these writing-related projects.\n\nSoftware projects have also drawn a considerable amount; 32 ETH has been raised. We've also had one non-digital public goods funding campaign so far, for a non-profit related to outdoor conservation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/50ef13ca-d202-4d40-9f91-818b6e2b39f8.jpeg?height=736&width=1198)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7c997d31-669f-4be8-b0a2-71386fa098c7.jpeg?height=1108&width=1680)\n\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a9bb080a-ca58-4fea-8474-c02a10635685.jpeg?height=734&width=1196)\n\n\nMany of these campaigns were fulfilled in minutes or hours of their launch.

In this sense, the crowdfund became the center of productive exchange.\n\n### **Patronage+**\n\nJesse Walden has [given a name](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo) to this new kind of interdependent funding model:\n\n> With regard to supporting creators, I've called this “[Patronage+](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1355165547441303554)” where the “plus” is the possibility of earning value alongside the creators you support.\n\nEven though it's not explicitly promised, a norm of interdependence might begin to form among these campaigns - leading to the formation of DAOs in the process.\n\n### Formal Mechanisms for Reciprocity\nThe crowdfunding contract includes a mechanism where members can \"burn\" their crowdfund tokens by sending them back to the contract. In doing so, they receive an amount of ETH *back* equal to the percentage of the totally supply they burned, multiplied by the amount of ETH in the contract. Therefore, if the amount of ETH in the contract has increased more than the initial crowdfunding goal, members can burn their tokens to receive more ETH than contributed in the first place.\n\nThis is likely to be the method by which DAOs increase the value of their crowdfunded project.\n\n# Future Directions\n\nEach time we have deployed a crowdfund, we have experimented with a new model. We're currently experimenting with combining ERC20 token reciprocation with NFT token minting as well (contributors will receive ERC20s as well as NFTs).\n\nWe're also thinking of doing more to serve the communities that form out of crowdfunding campaigns - to help them better coordinate and organize their resources.\n\nAs mentioned previously, it's likely that we will see more DAOs form out of this model. In this case, it might be important to focus on supporting those DAOs in their missions - by providing them with tools necessary to coordinate and socially manage their capital and digital goods.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nWe're seeing many unprecedented phenomena in Ethereum, enabled by embedded communities that can socially control capital and digital goods with minimal friction. \n\nSpecifically, this enables a unique combination of *generalized exchange* (grants, airdrops, crowdfunding) with *productive exchange* (e.g. interdependent, community-governed software projects like PartyDAO that has formal reciprocity mechanisms). There is [research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450) to suggest that this will impact trust and community-building.\n\nWe're learning more each time we deploy a Crowdfund, and our theoretical models are becoming richer. It's an exciting journey, and the road ahead might involve funding amazing new types of goods and products, and creating digital communities that fit a new paradigm.", "timestamp": 1623518590, "digest": "GBj7emzIN5NBNFPLV6FGfN1c7GjSaZ_wEkjm5KQy2UE", "contributor": "0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026"}
