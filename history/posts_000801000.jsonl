But still, there was no sign of PR, nothing changed for all the KOLs and the impression continued to be fed to everyone that the Meka draw was not fair. This is a major PR failure.

Regarding the 3D model, the team can make a very nice model, or a very big one, as a marketing tool, but never try to tie it to NFT. Because NFT is a digital asset, its value and his meaning are recursive: its meaning comes from its high price, and its high price is related to its meaning. Once it is given an entity, then its value immediately loses this recursion and becomes tied to the physical price. And the act of giving away 3D models goes far against the spirit of the blockchain: anonymity and decentralisation. 3D models should be used as a marketing tool or a personal hobby of the creator, not as a core pursuit of the project. It should be even less of a major object for the team at the moment.\n3. Regarding airdrops, learn more from the practices of other projects and link them to raising the floor price, boosting community activity, and raising everyone's holdings from time to time: for example, randomly dropping rare airdrops, this bot can be combined with the original NFT to bring a huge increase in value to the original NFT (similar to BYAC's mutation potion).\n4.

Regarding airdrops, learn more from the practices of other projects and link them to raising the floor price, boosting community activity, and raising everyone's holdings from time to time: for example, randomly dropping rare airdrops, this bot can be combined with the original NFT to bring a huge increase in value to the original NFT (similar to BYAC's mutation potion).\n4. The remaining 300 could be gifted to some Twitter celebrities, and sports personalities, etc., but this should be part of the PR, and would require a lot of article placement first to address the impression of Meka as a previous fraud. Secondly work with celebrities to bring in new exposure. Regarding the raffle, don't give it away pointlessly to strangers who resell it, or there will be a bunch of bots flooding the discord. it can be given to those who contribute the most to the community;boost community activity; give it to celebrities; or give it away in a raffle within people who have been delist for more than XX days,the more delist the more chance you will have. All airdrops and raffles must be designed to: increase community activity, expand reach, delist, increase potential revenue for holders, and promote buy-in; anything else that simply re-posts the raffle is a pointless waste of time.\n\nThey would like to send one or two representatives to have a short video exchange (5-10 minutes) with the founding team to ask some questions about the development of the team and to offer some possible collaboration plans.

The main challenges they faced were in adding music using the iTunes software and using some of the Settings functionalities such as date- and time-changing.\n\n## Behind the iPod\n\nThe iPod was a device that attempted to correct the mistakes of its predecessors. The team behind its design, Steve Jobs, Sir Jonathan Ive, Jon Rubinstein, and Michael Dhuey, sought to create a “better MP3 player”. It was made possible by technological advancements in hard drives, as well as a will to create an accompanying music store to facilitate the music transfer process. Up until now, other flash players were mostly drag-and-drop and storage capacity for portable players was limited.\n\nThe competitive landscape was fragmented amongst many electronic companies.\n\n![The MPMan, released in 1998 by SaeHan, had a 32MB and a 64MB version](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JpFprHO5lLBJM4f20Kf3I.png?height=1067&width=800)\n\n![The Rio PMP300, released in 1998, the first commercially successful portable audio media player, with 32MB of storage and a slot for additional memory](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l8DMVXaXzjr-nV1CGuCP6.png?height=550&width=800)\n\nThis table from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_portable_media_players) shows some of the specs of the different media players and a better overview of the market Apple was entering in.\n\n![Comparison of portable media players](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n_xfkfsdgw1BK9tu6VLur.png?height=697&width=1238)\n\nEach media player had a set of features it inherited from previous media-playing technologies, such as cassette players and CD players. A player should allow users to “Play”, “Pause”, “Stop”, “Go to Next Track”, “Go to Previous Track”, “Raise Volume” and “Lower Volume”.\n\nAlthough the goal was to create a device with the above features as well as improved memory and a computer interface for music transfer, the team at Apple sought to differentiate the product not only technically but also aesthetically. While the design of other media players borrowed from futuristic aesthetics with bright colors and advanced plastics, Apple’s design team borrowed from the past to create a product that was as beautiful as functional. Namely, they drew inspiration from Western European designs such as Dieter Rams’ work at Braun and the luxury home technology products of Bang & Olufsen.\n\n![The Braun T3 Transistor by Dieter Rams (1958) next to the iPod (2001)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/weL2I7acDJ_TJp0BhSgPC.png?height=319&width=501)\n\n![The BeoCom 6000 by Bang & Olufsen, the inspiration for the wheel](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZFh75EYg1rmpnd30Jm-AN.png?height=386&width=596)\n\n## The STEM player\n\nAfter this long preamble presenting the iPod, I introduced the STEM Player. Here are some videos of the playtest.\n\n[https://youtu.be/x5TFaGJGcnw](https://youtu.be/x5TFaGJGcnw)\n\n[https://youtu.be/NxIlMmvXMTw](https://youtu.be/NxIlMmvXMTw)\n\n[https://youtu.be/45V2qWCvAaY](https://youtu.be/45V2qWCvAaY)\n\n### First Impressions\n\nHere are some of the tester’s first impressions following the experience:\n\n* In comparison to the iPod, they felt in much less familiar territory\n* The product has no language which makes comprehension more difficult (language-free)\n* It took about 4 minutes for the users to figure the basic features and commands of the STEM player\n* The sound was subpar\n* Users felt guided by the haptic feedback in the player\n* Its toy-like design made it more approachable than the iPod\n* Even after providing them with the user guide, the testers felt like the drawn instructions were insufficient to completely figure out the product\n\n![Users comparing the instructions for the iPod and the STEM player](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tcQdfJRh2Wt5sW9zulVTR.JPG?height=4032&width=3024)\n\n### Design comparison\n\nNear the end of the seminar, I invited the class to compare both products\n\n* Aesthetic\n  * The iPod has a Western European aesthetic inherited from Braun and Bang & Olufsen. Its shape is geometric and the edges slightly rounded.\n  * The STEM player veers towards natural design, both in terms of colour, the player is sand-coloured, and shape, it is shaped like a pebble. (We were having a harder time finding the inspirations here…)\n* Materials\n  * iPod: Glass and aluminium\n  * STEM: silicon\n* Design Associations (what words does the product bring to mind?)\n  * iPod: House technology, fragile, luxury, style\n  * STEM: Toy, bouncy, hard-to-break, soft, safe for children\n* Emotions (how does the product make you feel?)\n  * iPod: Satisfied (it helps me achieve my goals in a straight-forward fashion with little fuss)\n  * STEM: Curious (it puts me in a more exploratory mood, it feels ludic and open)\n\n## What do both of these objects say about their users?\n\nThe iPod user is a tech-savvy individual who utilizes the product’s simple design and UX to achieve their goal in a defined and concise manner. The iPod user is a *consumer* but a discerning one, one who buys into the Apple brand for its promise of beautiful albeit closed objects. They live in a set of boundaries that are hard to break. The tool does not really allow the user to break free from the product’s designed walls.\n\nIn 2017, I presented a talk at the University of Quebec in Montreal, where I spoke about fan-based shitposting groups and their artistic practices. Specifically, I presented a “Manifesto for Shitposting” that adduced the idea that the members of these groups were a new type of audience, they were no longer passive, their practice was heavily participatory.\n\nI quote from the *Manifesto for Shitposting* (2017)\n\n> Nothing stands in the way of the consumer-become-creator\n> Nothing stands in the way of your hollowing out the peach's pit and turning it into an apple\n> We are no longer passive\n> We are the new creators\n> There are sequels to variations\n> and variations on these variations\n> Sequels to these sequels\n> We have created a franchise outside of the franchise\n> We have created a universe outside of the copyrighted universe\n> There is no author\n> the author is dead\n> there is no author\n> only participants\n> there is no author\n> only creators\n> only hollow words\n> only hollow images\n> waiting to be filled\n> with new meaning\n>\n> the franchises of the future are our franchises\n\nYou may see where I’m going with this but these two products differ in how they conceive of their users. The STEM player represents a new paradigm for audio media players in that it treats its audience not as listeners but as producers. It allows them to create the strongest connection one can have with a piece of music, making it your own. I have no idea if the player is part of a larger corporate strategy or just marketing from Yeezy’s last album. However, I am very excited for this future of music that allows users to directly engage with music in an active manner.\n\nKanye, even after releasing the album, has already changed and tweaked many of the songs on DONDA.

Therefore, Enryakuji Temple is a historically and culturally important place, and it once had possessed far more cultural properties and historical documents than are still in existence.\n\nBut the enormous cultural properties and historical documents of Enryakuji Temple suffered damage from [the Siege of Mount Hiei in 1571](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Mount_Hiei) and much of these were lost. Currently, there are only a few historical documents that can tell us what the precincts of Enryakuji Temple in the past looked like.\n\n*Sanmon-Santō Sakamoto Sōezu* is probably the most detailed pictorial old maps of the precincts of Enryakuji Temple in existence and also shows the halls of temples and shrines that may have existed before [1571](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Mount_Hiei).\\[8\\] Therefore, these maps are valuable historical documents to know about what the precincts in the past looked like.\n\n### Repository\n\nCurrently, these maps are one of the collections in [the National Archives of Japan (NAJ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_of_Japan).

I wonder if / when someone will come and see some of these thoughts?  How does discovery work on Mirror?  I try to tell myself that I am writing here for myself, but if I’m honest with myself, I do hope that I can contribute some original thinking to the Web 3 space.  I don’t know how I’ll focus, but I do know that some of the topics I’d like to explore are (in no particular order): \n\n1. What does it really mean to live between two realities like I am?  I’ve been living in this  alternate reality on Crypto Twitter, where conversations about how Web 3.0 is taking over and what this new world will look like when L1 blockchains are the new nation states to orient yourself around.  All this incredible talk about the future state  of reality and where we are heading is in stark contrast to the business that I recently started - a management company in the facilities maintenance space.  It’s really jarring going from talking in the crypto / Web 3.0 community to the community in my franchise that I am in, where the latter is completely unaware of the coming changes, and still has conversations around needing to be “in the office” to be effective and still struggling to make all their applications cloud-based.  But to be fair, I can’t see how it impacts them too much, at least right now.  But will it?  \n2. How does classic business strategy change, if at all, in the Web 3.0 world?  For example, how does management consulting break into this world?  Does anyone care about Porter’s 5 forces?  How do DAOs change organizational development strategies?\n3. How does crypto bring out the best and worst in people?  I’d like to observe and see the incredible sense of  community over the individual that crypto seems to bring out, but also the greed that seems to get magnified when huge financial gains are on the line.  \n\nI hope that this is a place where I can come by myself to organize my thoughts.

{"id": "jjGyvtc6njdUWtuxZR3QkAVttVJGYtqZhm1CLx0M3Fo", "title": "1SWIPEAWAY", "body": "**I think it hit me at some point during the Uber ride to her house: this could be the most important hook-up in human history. And the scariest. I know it sounds stupid and indulgent to say that, especially coming from another hetero-normative dude in black Christian Diors like me. (Whatever, they were knock-offs.) But given the extraordinary features of this interaction, along with its consequences for how people think of themselves, I really don’t think it’s an exaggeration. All of this is true by the way. I don’t have the time to make any of this up, and frankly I sucked pretty bad in Language Arts. My grade-school teachers will bug out if they read this.**\n\n**My band was doing a show in Salt Lake City–you know, Mormon utopia in the middle of the desert. Our next gig in Boise had been cancelled for reasons we didn’t entirely understand. When you’re on the road you just kind of run with things, I guess. We decided to hang out in Utah for a couple of days. Somebody said we could “backpack in the watercolor meadows of the Uintahs”. Sounded like a good time. We do retrowave electronica stuff, lots of synthy sounds with flashing lights and voice effects. Everyone’s into the eighties again, even the Mormons it turns out.**\n\n**I still don’t think of myself as a hook-up guy, even after all these years on the road. I’m serious. It’s not something I enjoy or even particularly like. I see hook-ups as one of the rites of being a traveling musician, or maybe even a curse. It’s like how prime ministers have to shake hands with people they don’t necessarily like. I’m a reluctant diplomat of the grunge scene. Everything that guys like David Bowie did make total sense to me. They turned their lives upside-down just to try and find something real. I wonder if they ever found it–when I did, it scared the crap out of me.**\n\n**The first Tinder girl I met in Utah was one of those “it’s for a good cause”-type chicks. I’m not trying to offend anybody, it’s just the only way I can think to describe her. What annoys me about those girls is that they all have the same personality. They’re almost breathless to prove how angry they are about all the *right* things. It makes me feel like everything I know is wrong or something. You just sit there and listen and drown in their syndicated outrage. I swiped right for shallow reasons, yes. The messed-up thing is that I anticipated my annoyance as I glanced at her pics. I was shamelessly undeterred.**\n\n**Her peach spaghetti-strap top swallowed most of my attention, even as she soliloquized about non binary love and dying pandas. (OK, I made that last one up.) Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail. It was less a conversation and more a kind of reciting on her part–anyone could’ve been sitting in front of her. I wonder if she would’ve acted differently if she knew who I was. A few hours later, I finished softly somewhere in the bobbing bramble of hair in my lap. It was depressing. She fixed her ponytail in the mirror, checked her phone, then quickly left.**\n\n**I don’t usually let people get to know me too well, not even my bandmates. I mean we drop acid together sometimes, bro-bonding stuff, that kind of thing. That’s about it. Even with girls, I’m a sex-in-the-dark kind of dude. They probably think I’m weird but I never ask. When the peach-top pedant was leaving I gave her one of our albums on cassette tape. It was awkward (“Uh, thanks…?”) but I feel like it’s the best I can do.**\n\n**Somewhere in the discussion of her saintly works, she had mentioned something her uncle had seen in a mall near downtown Salt Lake City. It was like an upright human with amphibian skin or something. Her uncle was a janitor who cleaned floors there late at night. The thing had come out of a basement stairwell, looked at him for a moment, then turned right back around and disappeared. The really crazy thing was that her uncle said he felt some kind of emotion deep in his chest that he never felt before, sort of like how you feel when you lock eyes with a stranger that looks inexplicably familiar. She reported all of this as a joke, rattling it off at blinding speed in her machine-gun dialogue of goodspeak. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, though, even when we started making out.**\n\n**The guys in our band like to joke about the golden thumb–it’s when you start a streak of matching with the city’s hottest women. That’s millennial serendipity at its finest. Isaac had the golden thumb in Topeka and we didn’t see him until Michigan, but in Michigan the algorithms failed him. It works in mysterious ways. When I matched with this Clarissa girl from Provo, I decided Salt Lake City *was* a promised land, or at least my own Topeka. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, nor has that condition of not-knowing changed. But let me back up...**\n\n**Clarissa was one of those one-pic profiles, which is risky. You’re betting that this single picture is so alluring that the opposite swiper needs no further proof of your hotness. In her case, it was a win. She was wearing a black romper striped orange, yellow, green; her hair was blue and cut boyishly short. The obligatory septum piercing made her nose look like a jewelled accessory. Style, attitude, cuteness. Bad-ass but delicate. The interesting part: the picture wasn’t a picture but actually a moving boomerang, one of those images perpetually repeating two seconds of movement.**\n\n**The boomerang showed Clarissa from behind, jogging in-place on a sidewalk with her face looking coyly back into the camera. I don’t need to mention the advantages such an angle affords those of the requisite affinities–but there was something else. Something *else.* There looked to be a kind of independent movement beneath the fabric around her tailbone, like an appendage that was rising and falling as she ran. You could *just* make out the outline. It couldn’t be…**\n\n**I put my phone away and started pumping some beat-mixes to get my mind straight. Things couldn’t be *that* freaky in Utah. My headphones weren’t loud enough to block out the image. The thing that bothered me most was that my attraction to her hadn’t waned; if anything, I felt *more* attracted. Had I been watching too many shapeshifter animes? That was probably the case regardless.**\n\n**Even so, there was no doubt that Clarissa’s festive romper was hiding a full-grown tail–like, none at all.  I watched the boomerang over and over again, turning my phone this way and that. There was no other conclusion. I considered calling my bandmates for brotherly support but in the end opted for privacy. Imagine if they heard I was seeing a girl with a *tail.* Literally a tail dangling down her rear. Her caption read: “Wyoming-raised, Utah-grown. I don’t want to go to Paris or Prague. Take me to a hidden place we can share secrets.” It was just too much.**\n\n**The first time I met Clarissa it was somewhere near State St. It’s hard for me to keep track of the roads because they’re all numbered on a grid based on their proximity to the Mormon temple. Clarissa told me that this system makes it easier to get around and not get lost. She laughed when I disagreed. We ate vegan wraps in one of those generic Salt Lake plazas made of Mexican eateries and Asian stores. Clarissa explained that she ate healthy when it suited her schedule and mood, which made her “a seasonal vegan”. It was summertime in Salt Lake; she wore a dirty-green tank-top and gray denim shorts ripped across the thighs; her hair was bluer than Freddie Mercury’s stage lighting.**\n\n**She was one of those girls who was easy to talk to, but from whom you couldn’t allow your attention to waver. Clarissa was no prolific talker. Instead I got a watchful loner vibe, someone you’d see walking along deserted railroad tracks, someone who considered Bjork their private therapist. I kept imagining how I could bring the topic up without coming across as a total creep. “I didn’t know people in Utah had tails...is that common here?” Gross. Maybe something more personal. “That romper you had on does a lot for your tail.” God, no. I settled on: “Can you show me that running move from your profile?”**\n\n**We were walking along the sidewalks in the glow of the street lamps; night had fallen on the strange city made of numbers. Clarissa’s hand was clasped softly in mine. I kept resisting the temptation to look behind her like an idiot. She was pressing me with questions somewhat absently. When I told her my band’s name was Nineteeneightyfornicate, she lost it and started going through all of our pictures on Instagram. That name was Isaac’s idea, not mine! It did have a nice ring to it.**\n\n**She stopped walking and turned on me suddenly.**\n\n**“You know, don’t you?”**\n\n**“Know–know what?” I stammered lamely.**\n\n**“Oh come off the bullshit, man. You’ve known this whole time.” Staring me frankly in the eyes, she took my hand and ran it along something long, firm, cylindrical on her backside. My heartbeat quickened and a soft moan emitted from my throat. Clarissa giggled and threw my hand away.**\n\n**“Any secrets you’d like to share with me?”**\n\n**I looked at her for a second, processing. “I already told you my dirty band name–”**\n\n**“Right,” she scoffed. “I hope you come up with something better by tomorrow.”**\n\n**She turned and began receding into the jasmine-bordered shadows. I realized that we had been surrounded by cats ever since we started walking. They now trailed her in unison like a row of ducklings down the sidewalk.**\n\n**“I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE A CAT PERSON!” I yelled hopelessly.**\n\n**She laughed and raised a long middle finger into the air without turning around. I sighed and began walking in the other direction back to my hotel. I opened my phone to a new text message from Clarissa. It didn’t say anything; she’d only sent three cat emojis with their tails in the air. I marveled at how little I knew what in the hell was going on. *I just stroked a human tail. That really happened.* And yet, perversely, I couldn’t wait for the next day.**\n\n***....Any secrets you’d like to share with me…***\n\n**I’ll come clean–that night wasn’t the first time I googled “humans with tails”. There had been drunken nights alone that I obsessed over the idea. My thoughts were ransacked by half-humanoids risen from primordial tetrapods, dripping with sea-foam and tails dragging in the sand. I told you I was a weird guy. To this point, the greatest harm all this had done was butcher my online algorithms–I would get ads for kinky Halloween costumes, which routinely raised some eyebrows.**\n\n***She could be a government spy on some troll-job,* I thought to myself. The idea tormented me for several hours. What was worse, I thought, the CIA using search history and store-bought accessories to play with my mind, or the possibility that I had met some kind of hybrid human with a rope of flesh swinging from her backside? The little bit of ganja I had left made my speculations thicker and more confusing. She had to be real. Why would the government waste time mind-fucking a guy from a band named Nineteeneightyfornicate? I went from that to wondering what she ate when she was stoned.**\n\n**Before I knew it, I was stepping out onto the curb in front of her house in my black knock-off Christian Diors. Who was this profane intruder in Provo? An agent *provo*cateur, I grinned to myself. I didn’t know there could be neighborhoods with trees in the desert. Seemed like the Mormons were pretty good landscapers when they weren’t busy granting all their wives eternal life. Who knew! Clarissa lived in a blue house with a quaint little front porch, one of those places that really has the picture-book mailbox with a perfect red lever pointed upwards.**\n\n**“Were you tailing me earlier?”**\n\n**Clarissa’s voice came out of nowhere, disembodied. I looked around me wildly, my unease ratcheting up several notches. A hand rested on my shoulder from behind; I wheeled around.**\n\n**“Chill out, freak,” Clarissa laughed. She looked at the tree next to her, brushing off some twigs. “My nest is up *there*.”**\n\n**“Your–nest?”**\n\n**“It’s a joke, heard of those before?”**\n\n**I suddenly noticed she was wearing a yellow Walkman cassette player. We always BS that if we meet a chick with a portable cassette player, we’ll automatically drop to one knee, no questions asked.**\n\n**“So you’re that much of a dork that you listen to cassette tapes in 2020?!”**\n\n**“And you’re telling me you don’t have one on you right now?”**\n\n**Wordlessly, I raised my band’s cassette tape out of my pocket.**\n\n**“Give me that,” she laughed, snatching it out of my hand. “Maybe we *are* a match!”**\n\n**I followed her inside.**\n\n**“My roommates are out for the weekend”–glancing at the couch–”you can just shove all that shit over, sorry. We have beer, lemonade, soda...or maybe you like the harder stuff?”**\n\n**I settled in and tried to relax, taking in what was around me. Nothing odd really. There was a crystal salt lamp whose warm glow looked afloat in the dim room. I could faintly sniff sage. A white cat met my gaze and darted out of sight, desperate to be forgotten.**\n\n**“You don’t get many visit–”**\n\n**The sentence was robbed from my throat. Clarissa was putting a glass of Jack Daniels on the table, naked beside the burgundy lingerie faintly interrupting her skin. I could see the thing in plain sight–it was moving from side to side in a sort of carefree, feline attitude, *curling* back on itself this way and that, hairless and freckled as it tapered to its tip. It was a magnificent tail, too magnificent to be an accident. I closed my eyes and took a shot of the Jack.**\n\n**“I know what you’re thinking,” Clarissa smiled. She sat down next to me, running her hand along my shoulder. “You’re thinking ‘it’s impossible, this can’t actually be happening.’”**\n\n**“You must be psychic,” I shot back dryly.**\n\n**“You’re thinking,” she pressed on, “that science eliminates the possibility of my existence.”**\n\n**I didn’t say anything.**\n\n**“What’s wrong, rock star, you don’t want to play along? I know that you know it all–how they say a human tail is only an abomination of the coccyx, a *vestige* of the behind that we all left behind...right?”**\n\n**“What are you getting at here, Clarissa?”**\n\n**She took a swig of lemonade and rolled the juice around her mouth, her gaze unbroken.**\n\n**“Nothing you haven’t already thought of ten thousand times, but I’ll humor you. If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”**\n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.**\n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.**\n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”**\n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”**\n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.**\n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”**\n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am. Clarissa hasn’t left my side since; we’re in Cheyenne now. There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think: I’ve never been happier–or more deeply, inconsolably frightened.**", "timestamp": 1635648864, "digest": "56648re9YKSnaRoHNgg2OrkLba9o04K-E3bNS5Hdiqc", "contributor": "0xBbb538b84ED95aBa94585c6cE7C2f8790dBfE53B"}

The digital art was created by a random artist in North America and bought by a South Asian dude. And when America’s longest-running TV show CBS 60 minutes features that [story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kGlepv2C7M), you know what the average Joe is thinking. “How can I create and sell my own NFT?”\n\nAre retailers and consumer brands riding the trend?\n\nRead on for some analysis, business benefits, examples, and 👉 a [1-min demo video](https://dekoupled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MuleComicNFTDemo.mp4) 👈.\n\n## **The non-fungible what?**\n\nFirst, what is a token? A bunch of numbers that uniquely identifies a digital asset. For a good intro, see these posts on [NewStack](https://thenewstack.io/how-non-fungible-tokens-are-disrupting-the-art-world-and-more/) and [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/what-are-nfts-all-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-collectibles.html).\n\nSecond, what is fungible (interchangeable) about these tokens?\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EwcjHp0dmh3MyBgVVm3vUohDr0WZXWQ6YkJVV5GvIaNhAKqGBUgAUAYUDVpaIIA6nHVAHb7IygN2Ldrf0ykrZFxFOaEVt6n1-kcd6d9LozIMR9_lIHzRYlmwhMor7DHZDNR7X5Rr)\n\n*Image courtesy of ArzDigital*\n\n## **Let’s talk business**\n\nNow that you are an NFT expert, let’s see why a Retail or Consumer Goods brand should care.\n\nNFT offers the following useful attributes around marketing and selling:\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9V-PnG2-Qt-hq-4Yl05u7p8holNwhbnO3bO02XifHRu2e-T8a5lxJwdiMm8dOuG4bbhL7QxUkY1zX_gwliNz1bMBaoovDn71NcTeMxUZdtNaRQ3VI_6_fBV8g_SsFAQ8leSecKDl)\n\nTwo attributes stand out — **Marketing currency** and **Programmable**.\n\n### Marketing currency\n\nNFT is without a doubt a new marketing currency. Yes, the hype may fade, but there is a good possibility that the concept of digital ownership will survive.\n\nWhat is fascinating about NFTs is that they could be both a product and a marketing tool.\n\nThe product is a digital asset that encapsulates some form of creativity or a moment in time. The idea of owning digital (bragging) rights to that moment are marketing on its own.\n\nSee the example below before you think I am crazy!\n\n### Programmable\n\nFor techies, this idea of programming via Smart Contracts opens a world of possibilities.\n\nSmart Contracts make NFT dynamic, monetizable, and serendipitous.\n\nFor example, you could tokenize your 1969 Mustang and give driving rights to token owners for a day at random. No, I [didn’t make this up](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-31/want-to-own-a-ferrari-now-you-can-through-a-new-digital-token) on the spot.\n\nAnother good example is [Two Degrees](https://zephyrnet.com/this-nft-self-destructs-if-global-temperatures-rise-2c/) – an NFT that will self-destruct if global temperatures rise 2°C. Ouch, that’s ironic in the context of crypto energy use and global warming.\n\n## **Are brands dropping NFTs?**\n\nYou bet!\n\nToday, you can buy Nike shoes you can’t wear, tacos you can’t eat, and Pringles you can’t bite.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sMHd6ExqklGAjD9ODfPfqB-pL32Pzl_XltrnNkk-WL3YaviihWJ8JyKiz4urfRupjSTrY78mpRHkr-ktY6kkksTof00PNeBNEXMsXL8fn2tcCk8W-8pDT8iHy-QwlORJU7pMx663)\n\nJust Food published an article titled, [Why NFTs can offer marketing opportunities for FMCG brands](https://www.just-food.com/comment/why-nfts-can-offer-marketing-opportunities-for-fmcg-brands) where they discuss ideas on how brands can leverage NFT pheno-mania.\n\n> **NFTs essentially offer three areas of utility for CPG brands: as part of overall long-term brand building (marketing); for short-term promotional use (promotion); and to generate immediate awareness for a company and its brand.**\n>\n> Just Food – Why NFTs can offer marketing opportunities for FMCG brands\n\n## **What does a *good* NFT look like?**\n\nNFT is about creating buzz…I mean creating unique value that resonates with the brand, timed for market events, and that which makes it stand out. Then make it digitally scarce, i.e. mint only limited copies of it. For example, if you sell apple pies, limit it to 314 to make it subtly meaningful, or not.\n\nTo get the immediate attention you have to be a brand, a celebrity, an artist, or an innovator (e.g. solve world hunger, cure cancer).\n\nBrands have an easy start – they have both market awareness and an audience. All they have to do is redirect their marketing prowess to creating digital assets.\n\nTiming is key. One great example is Charmin toilet paper NFtP.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/v5W3babkWU_twRvBOJ3I7p8RF74_Ea7VNED8jS_G6LO5Zc12me7FA7sYTMWDpLxZX11pQW2aPgHT6O6XquGqv58xlis40Uq3EtZDGeWY9xbhEztS6IhoNCphkifZM_24ukjVK3k6)\n\nHere is the excerpt from the [Just Food](https://www.just-food.com/comment/why-nfts-can-offer-marketing-opportunities-for-fmcg-brands) article:\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aQE-JeCgkTlEAFx_Onj9zmdrtaM4Rz3Jw1EmiyZgzop9c8Axs2Tw9R3FqJlteGZb3Iha53xZ4E3mdZGrGA9Yfaf8J4KMomsd8vKHhTiEWRGD8660GzGuNm32hdHHUJeOg4e5-pei)\n\nNow, did you notice the above excerpt starts with, “The NFT must make sense.” Not sure I agree, as it can limit creativity.\n\nAnother good example is CNBC’s [Haines Bottom](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/24/mark-haines-remembering-and-honoring-a-cnbc-icon-with-an-nft-auction.html) that sold for $61,000. It’s a short video clip of Mark Haines calling the market bottom during the 2009 stock market crash.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CWFiUkTl2xO_KxolgcegFbJthzwm4RvG9iNe9Zg_8jsdeWYoLc_Jx8-ZI_L2JpQX_P8nwbrBXpEWJtATQqxNZK3m1JEJQO6Xq3hRMrM3ctXuBPpkPn6kAePbMf87jyCR-RBJCfgv)\n\nThe key attribute of a good NFT is the ability to capture an important message or moment in history.\n\n> **To memorialize moments, mint NFTs!**\n\nI think that is a cute line, can I NFT that? Well, not so fast, I ain’t no celebrity 🙂\n\n## **But what if you are a celebrity?**\n\nWell, then anything goes, mostly. You can literally state a fact like “*Time is irreversible*” or draw a picture and create an NFT out of it.\n\nOn a serious note, one great example is [VeeFriends](https://veefriends.com/) by Gary Vaynerchuk: “the main ambition of this project is to create meaningful intellectual property and create an extraordinary community. All tokens are a three-year admission token to VeeCon, an annual super-conference.”\n\nGary, a social marketing guru said,\n\n> **“I know that NFTs will be here for the rest of my life.”**\n>\n> Gary Vee\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aoCiDG1wNfQ8JWhvqzDWHT9Mc9VmareJGaBHTKIO0QIWuO_QnyxAtvrYA9LaY4JovdkCS3Ge9_0qupxR0Bybt0AZ5DRhbgJ34z6J5Plz5X6clNq3sjT3lzW2MnkXkYVZLErb6oHdrkY)\n\n## **If you are still not bought into NFTs…**\n\nCheck out this $50 painting at Etsy which comes with an NFT to prove authenticity. If you are asking, “What do I do with this NFT,” it is the wrong question.\n\n> **The point is, the market is willing to buy, and now the question is, are you selling it or not?**\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rx5gGYbnaGdcpjWCEB9upuzttzzhaRtFJXGa8vlm7mFgrUvr8pciaVv4B634LqkRgeIgsK1s6-FLRswFZV8UraaXMLcvlLgwbbZEnuhOIIlyFZ82pbkdhSdX9YAeogT_h3N-h-lf)\n\n## So should brands create NFTs?\n\nAbsolutely!\n\n* NFTs are\n  * New marketing currency\n  * Product + marketing medium\n  * Useful to create brand awareness\n  * Important to attract newer demographics (crypto gen…is that thing?)\n  * Inexpensive and no supply constraints\n  * Limited only by the creativity\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Go forth, and mint-away!\n\n## **How about a demo?**\n\nThis [1-min demo video](https://dekoupled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MuleComicNFTDemo.mp4) provides a simple NFT ownership experience.\n\nFor the techies, here is how I implemented it.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UvPGA8z18F1NS5IZuV-4phvO-7yH1EH-I5wrcVnbF90yLoNu1-DR8HHtDaIHn254BYquyV-ZgZoHYrDZ0w-AjJAq9v7KaLg_6rXAnGIHk-6ii2Ef78W_ZcdFjWjIHdRzfEGzr0RG)\n\nIf you’re wondering how to connect your Web 2.0 application to Web 3.0/DApps, MuleSoft can help as we connect anything and change everything.", "timestamp": 1635649499, "digest": "ZgJ3s_e4qXjQ_iAzPHivPPyZQ1aABXBun7gCu8oeN6Q", "contributor": "0x1440f1F7344525b48C3b9A85b18a8Ccf7A0F29bE"}

{"id": "ol3VDCCxTYYf_ByQ3Drh9VxsjspqoxJf3u9y5fhwUm8", "title": "介绍几个值得入手的NFT", "body": "最近，国家对买卖虚拟币出台了严厉的措施，将为用户提供买卖币交易视作违法，搞得几大交易所先后发布公告，有序退出大陆市场。这也使得大陆用户不得不面临选择：继续留下，还是出金走人？想必不少小散选择了后者，毕竟出金愈来愈难了。\n自然，你不急着出金，那就不用担心和着急，可以继续玩。要玩，一些NFT还是值得入手的。判断一个NFT有没有价值，值不值得买，有人给了一个不错的公式：\n**NFT价值 = Intrinsic Value（内在价值）+ Utility Value（使用价值） + Premium （溢价）**\n内在价值就是自身具有的价值，主要是创造它的成本。比如黄金，本身比较少，而开采、提炼的成本也不低，所以获得它的成本就比较高。使用价值，就是看它有没有用，它的应用场景有吗，有多少；可以用它做什么？等等。溢价就是看它的热度、流通性，以及它所带来的的额外的价值。\n目前，许多nft头像的创造成本很低，使用价值除了做头像几乎没有应用场景——游戏中的nft多少还可以用在游戏中，所以溢价就谈不上了。因此大家买的时候不妨用这个公式看看，分析分析，再出手。\n\n[https://rarible.com/token/0x398a5b355658df4a836c9250fce6f0a0fc0c9ea0:116?tab=details](https://rarible.com/token/0x398a5b355658df4a836c9250fce6f0a0fc0c9ea0:116?tab=details)\n\n当然，其中也有不错一点的，这里给大家介绍几个比较好玩的、有些“使用价值”的。 一个就是sed sun，赛马项目，这个边书曾经专门写过一篇文章，大家可以去看看。\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0xECc6e7b3B0F4D40b985c5ba72C05D375baCc129F/BO_bhfR8O7XZ-6OEqCBxNnGEqgJVcFgckzgnRBKcZ4o](https://mirror.xyz/0xECc6e7b3B0F4D40b985c5ba72C05D375baCc129F/BO_bhfR8O7XZ-6OEqCBxNnGEqgJVcFgckzgnRBKcZ4o)\n\n另一个就是PixelBeasts NFT头像。它是用像素绘制生成的各种动物的头像，总数10000个，每一个都独一无二。创作者是中岛洋平（Yohei Nakajima）。\n这个nft头像不同于其他nft头像的地方在于比较好玩。\n首先，是它有几个比较有趣的属性，如：每一个PixelBeasts都有一个对应的最好的朋友和克星，它们都有职业属性（战士、盗贼、法师），也都有对应的栖息地： 沼泽、岛屿、山脉、森林、平原等等。\n\n![我的pixelbeasts](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KWPyfAtdoElKzj8j3OcZj.png?height=480&width=480)\n\n其次是持有者可以每周参加虚拟活动。可以每周三登录虚拟社区beastopia，四处走动遛弯，寻找自己的那个“最好朋友”、“克星”；还可以和其他的“野兽”进行聊天、视频； 可以每周五进入PixelBeast Café，进行联合办公；也可以参加创作者召集的由 VC、创始人、开发人员、艺术家和收藏家组成的讨论活动；还可以进入几个有趣的应用程序……当然，还有待开发的各种有趣的活动，包括游戏。 总之，PixelBeasts头像不同于其他NFT头像，它有应用场景，比较好玩，这在层出不穷的动物头像NFT中显得比较独特，值得拥有。目前它的地板价是0.015eth，不贵，喜欢的可以去撸一个，边书还是比较看好这个项目的。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fb7lfJZX0UrqTX5HwleOX.jpg?height=802&width=1368)\n\n再一个比较好玩的nft项目是Oracle。它是一个翻牌项目，正反两面，正面是文字预测，反面是图片——有的包含中奖信息，如一定数量的以太坊，或新的NFT；每7天翻一次牌，卡越稀有，翻牌中奖的几率越大。当然，中奖的是少数。这有点赌博的性质，不过也是一种创新。\n\n好了，今天就分享到这里。 总之，NFT项目目前热度虽然较前段时间有所冷却，但依然层出不穷，每天都有好些nft头像或游戏冒出来，大家应该慎重对待。尤其想靠这个大赚一把的，还是要擦亮眼睛，冷静选择，不要冲动。如果是为了玩，抱着顺便能赚点这种心态的话更好，一些有趣的、独特的nft项目还是值得关注和入手的。\n\n我是毛边书，分享所见所闻所学所思所悟，这是我的web3主页：欢迎跟随。\n\n[https://rss3.bio/0xECc6e7b3B0F4D40b985c5ba72C05D375baCc129F](https://rss3.bio/0xECc6e7b3B0F4D40b985c5ba72C05D375baCc129F)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635655173, "digest": "7c3_-s8s064Mp5Bs9EQI7_zHHf6e8U7xsxG1kmGFV9Y", "contributor": "0xECc6e7b3B0F4D40b985c5ba72C05D375baCc129F"}

When I finally began writing consistently, sharing ideas, that mythical magnet came alive. \n\nI began to draw new connections, new warmth, new possibilities into my life. An abundant flow of good will. \n\nThe velocity at which things are evolving stuns me, daily, hourly. For good, for ill. \n\nBefore taking the plunge into the Twitter-verse, I read and listened to quite a bit of David Perell, Gary Vaynerchuk, Jack Butcher. Something I heard repeatedly, which I’m sure is tried and true, is the importance of listening. \n\nYou put yourself out there and then you listen. How does stuff land? You look at views, engagement. You lean into what resonates. Simple as that. \n\nOnly, I find, it’s not so simple. \n\nI can look at my analytics on the Youtube channel and see clearly which video got the most views and longest average view duration. I know which article got the most engagement, retweets. And it’s easy for me to understand why. \n\nI totally get the value of sharing concrete strategies around DAOs. If the tables were turned, I would want that, prefer that, myself. But it’s quite rare for me to feel that I have something to offer that is a, air quotes, concrete strategy. \n\nThese days, I have questions. I have things bubbling up that are hard to articulate. I’m feeling my way through the dark. \n\nSo I listened, and there is a path ahead that I could take, that is clearly lit. But I am, for now, going another way.

We have witnessed a lot of historic scenes in this October. Tomorrow, the beginning of November, it will be the the start of the explosive growth of BTC and ETH based on the data.\nDue to the shortage of fund inflow, there are frequent volatilities in the market. And we can find that BTC and ETH have accumulated enough energy, especially ETH. Though we don’t know what is going to happen about ETH, we can see the large amounts of withdrawal from exchanges.

In addition, we can clearly see that the volatility in the middle is much stronger than that on both sides, which we have always said.\n\n![BTC total transfer volume in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/telVr9T3IFLDbtE3nswyd.png?height=1013&width=1800)\n\n![ETH total transfer volume in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1R_thOLvovSELfshjOCtk.png?height=1013&width=1800)\n\n![BTC net transfer volume from/to exchanges in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4X3PT-5ihiUm8qDP1yu6r.png?height=1013&width=1800)\n\n![ETH net transfer volume from/to exchanges in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BO98GEvzsxN9DL2tvxHl0.png?height=1013&width=1800)\n\nFrom the graphs above, we notice that there is barely no volatility of both BTC and ETH transfers on weekends.

{"id": "WnpRfl1Hsw6b56LuMznCjqdhMOO37pFoa42RZQpROm0", "title": "Is DeFi really decentralized?", "body": "In fact, a lot of DeFi is implemented through smart contracts on the blockchain. Take Ethereum, the largest smart contract operation platform, as an example. After the smart contract is developed and deployed on the blockchain, its code cannot be rewritten, but its state can be controlled by an external account.\n\nFor example, we can set one or a group of administrator addresses for the contract, and these administrators can have various preset capabilities to manipulate the contract. For example, the well-known USDT stable currency is an ERC-20 contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Then this contract has a management account that can freeze any amount of USDT funds.\n\nFor most contract developers, it is a very common practice in the industry to retain ultimate control over the contract and reserve some backdoor functions such as emergency suspension and emergency transfer of assets.\n\nOf course, the reason is usually high-sounding and understandable: the contract code is immature. In order to prevent the asset from being locked when a bug occurs, it is necessary to reserve the emergency transfer function. Or for safety reasons, in order to prevent the loss of user assets when abnormal problems occur, we retain the emergency brake function.\n\nThese \"functions\" are actually the \"backdoors\" left to the controller-often developers or project parties.\n\nThe back door is a double-edged sword. Developers can use it to deal with some unknown problems urgently. Hackers can use it to steal assets. The project party can pretend to be hacked, guard and steal, and run away after transferring assets.\n\nThere are more advanced technologies. We can use the proxy call mechanism to implement the so-called upgradeable contract. After we authorize a DApp, we grant control of the wallet assets to the agency contract. The actual execution logic of the proxy contract is another contract behind it. But this logical contract can be replaced.\n\nIn this way, everything is normal for the initial version of the software. We authorized the contract with confidence in the wallet. This authorization is usually an unlimited authorization.\n\nThen the project party upgraded the logical contract and quietly transferred all the assets in your wallet. Or, the hacker stole the authority of the project party, upgraded the contract, and stole all the assets in your wallet. Or, the project team disguised as a hacker, pretending to be stolen by the hacker, and stole all the assets in your wallet.\n\nAlmost all DeFi applications, such as swap, such as the second-tier bridge, require you to perform authorization operations.\n\nEvery authorization opens the door to risk.\n\nAre DeFi projects audited by a so-called security audit company safe? Not really.\n\nThe audit company only ensures that there are no low-level technical loopholes in the contract. However, the audit company will not raise objections to whether the contract has reserved super authority for centralized control and management.\n\nIn a technical way, centralized control is a feature (feature), not a bug (problem).\n\nIf you look at the current DeFi projects on the market with a strict decentralization perspective, nine out of ten DeFi projects are not truly completely decentralized, and most of them retain a certain degree of centralized control.\n\nReal and complete decentralization means that if there are unexpected loopholes in the code, the project party may have nothing to do because he cannot suspend the operation of the contract, or urgently transfer and protect assets, or upgrade the contract to fix the problem.\n\nIncomplete decentralization means the theft of hackers, the combination of inside and outside, theft of guards, the running of the project, and the full spread of centralization risks.\n\nDeFi that retains its centralized characteristics is nothing more than a semantic deception.\n\nFailure to achieve truly and completely decentralized decentralized finance requires supervision of centralization risks by regulatory agencies. This is the underlying logic of the US SEC's proposal to strengthen the supervision of DeFi.", "timestamp": 1635661888, "digest": "UNNM9KtawVm3zjcLuaFh-pN36aV7wFQ58i8w7Xv1lNU", "contributor": "0x1891f370f03403b2b2D7b54dB871ED98F568Fff0"}

In this dream, you can create a clone, all experiences and behaviors of the clone are under your command, and you can deeply experience all the senses of the clone.\n\nSeeing here, some people may have been fantasizing how to build, destroy, escape from reality, and release their nature in the meta-universe. Indeed, once the meta-universe is completed, the relationships, social interactions, and assets of the real society may undergo earth-shaking changes in the meta-universe.\n\nWith the further expansion of the meta universe, this change will be further fed back into the real world. For example, you are a failed person in the real world, but you entered the meta-universe for production and construction at the beginning of its establishment and accumulated a lot of virtual wealth.\n\nAs more and more people enter the meta-universe and the assets in the meta-universe are more and more recognized by people, then your wealth in the virtual world can be mapped to reality, so that you can become rich in reality.\n\nThe recently released movie \"Out of Control Players\" tells the story of bank teller Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who discovers that he is actually a background character in an open world video game, so he decides to become a hero and rewrite his story. Many scenes in the movie are reasonable speculations about the meta-universe world.\n\nOf course, the current level of technology still cannot meet the requirements of the above-mentioned meta-universe concept, and a meta-universe world with extreme sensory immersion cannot be realized. It is limited by the influence of communication technology, artificial intelligence, and computer technology. The implementation is still at the stage of VR and reality augmentation.\n\nIn other words, we are now in the initial stage of the meta universe. The 4D somatosensory games and VR games that we usually play belong to the use of real actions to influence the virtual world, and then experience the meta universe for a short time. The more popular bedroom dinosaurs on Douyin are another embodiment of a simpler virtual world and augmented reality.\n\nSince the perfect meta-universe cannot be realized at present, what is the reason for the hype about the meta-universe?

The current Internet world's common problem is that the pricing power and ownership of virtual items are in the hands of Internet companies, and a series of assets such as props, skins, game tokens, and even game accounts purchased by players in the game. The ownership of the game belongs to the game company, and the player only has the right to use it.\n\nAll assets in the game cannot be arbitrarily exchanged and self-priced. Your Glory of Kings skin cannot be exchanged for LOL skins, and your assets in one game cannot be exchanged for assets of another game. This has created a hindrance to the development of the meta-universe for Internet companies. A centralized meta-universe that does not belong to users is not what most people want to see, and at the same time it does not have the attributes of the meta-universe.\n\nThe decentralized structure of the blockchain is a decentralized account book. In the blockchain meta-universe, all players participate in the management of this account book. The value establishment is jointly managed and recognized by each participant.

Play-to-Earn economic model\n\nBy understanding the real reason for the explosion of the meta-universe, we know that under the power of the blockchain, part of the economic system of the meta-universe is realized by the blockchain as a blockchain game, forming the Gamefi field.\n\nThe core of the Gamefi field is the Play-to-Earn economic model. Unlike the Free to Pay (free game) model in the traditional game industry, players in blockchain games can earn real money through encrypted assets Silver, players who participate in the construction of virtual economy and games earn rewards through their own participation behaviors, and then sell them in the market for revenue.\n\nThe development team of the blockchain game has changed from the traditional game development team's game service provider identity to the company architect, and the players have changed from the player who spends money to play games to the employees who contribute to the company's development and expansion. . This is the biggest contribution made by the Play-to-Earn economic model.\n\nThe change in the identities of the two parties has made it a job for players to spend money to play games, and blockchain gamers can instead ask for rewards from the market through games. Players are more like working, paying time and labor, and earning income for the family.\n\n1. Capital promotes meta universe\n\nThe popularity of the blockchain meta-universe is rapid and fierce. From any point of view, it is not just the reaction of the market through slow accumulation and precipitation. The fact is, as we imagined, that behind the explosion of the meta universe is the result of capital promotion.\n\nIn March 2021, Roblox was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, known as the first stock of Metaverse. The company's products went live in 2008, and it has built a multi-person online 3D creative community that allows users to create content at will by providing editing tools and materials.\n\nIn just a few months after Roblox went public, its valuation soared from US$4 billion to US$50 billion, an increase of more than 10 times in less than half a year.\n\nA valuation increase of more than 45 billion US dollars is definitely not the energy that American retail investors can burst. Combined with the meta-universe platform that Facebook intends to create at the beginning of the article, it is absolutely impossible to believe that there is no capital participation from Wall Street.\n\n1. Anxiety under the global epidemic\n\nWith the promotion of capital, there is also an environment for capital to be used. The global epidemic has caused great changes in people's production, life, and entertainment methods throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021. People find that it is more important to conduct meetings, work, shopping, and entertainment in a non-contact virtual environment.\n\nSome resource-exporting countries (such as Southeast Asia) have caused an economic crisis due to the epidemic in economic globalization, and to pass on this crisis, it is necessary to seek new economic growth points in addition to resource exports. And this new growth point is precisely the economic system mapped by the meta-universe, allowing people to earn a certain amount of income through the virtual world in the reality of high consumption and low income.", "timestamp": 1635662214, "digest": "YXTkb-Ffvf2sKZOLUtkGUx-TtbUMfB1h3_vqdEj1gcE", "contributor": "0x6b0fD4442289d6dBff50b126c9A4Aa9305e1D5e9"}

It became a smart device that reported how many drinks it had and if they were cold or not. 10 years later, \"The Computer of the 21st Century\" was fixated on computing everywhere, right into the real world.  \n  \n The Internet was growing 24/7 more nodes were coming online. \n  \n It began to disrupt and displace real businesses. New layers of the stack began to feed on what were constant parts of the real world and economy. The network's nodes and data were made, taken, and uploaded by humans.  \n  \n Type it in, hit a return key, snap a picture on a digital camera or hit record on a machine, slide barcodes over scanners.  \n  \n The greatest routers were still the two-legged kind. Then, the Network was connected through sensors embedded in everything. Radio Frequency ID (RFID) was part of the key.  \n  \n You get an Internet of Things, a network joined to the real world.  \n  \n Kevin Ashton, P&G alum, and founder of MIT's Auto-ID lab coined the phrase in 1999. Bill Joy imagined \"device-to-device\" in a presentation at WEF at Davos. Cisco said \"IoT\" began 10 years later, when things to people went from 0.8 in 2003 to 1.8+ in 2010.  \n  \n The Internet was no longer just PCs and mainframes.  \n  \n It was in the home, or even its smart phones, it was the home itself, its electrical, mechanical innards, and appliances. It was factories, boats, ships, planes, offices, hospitals, power plants, and schools. It spread beyond civilian life, right back to its defense-related roots.  \n  \n A network's unreal reality melted into every corner of the real world. \n\n \n **2877 Earth, The Necklace, The Promenade, Diplomatic Quarter  \n ** \n \"Okay, let's talk, we'll go the long way round to your Consulate.\"  \n  \n The Chief Inspector called in a floater, at the arrival/departure pad, and we took off for an elevated view of the sights. We were hermetically sealed in a police vehicle. No-one would hear us talk. \n  \n The Chief Inspector took a flask from a compartment and poured two drinks for this tour and talk. \n\n \n \"Just water. I was planning to send you back to the Consulate and then assign people to watch you, as if you were involved with that Coop we've been after but now you’re telling me that fight was not some kind of post-War grudge between Earthers and “Rusties”. \n  \n There's nothing I can do to detain or even stop you from going off-world, and back home. The higher-ups want make sure the Necklace is a business showcase for a new post-war Earth.  \n  \n I see a chance to get me closer to what I want. I want to take down that coop, they’ve been criminals we’ve wanted to arrest for a long time, even back during the War.” \n  \n \"I can tell you share some details about the item but I’m not going to show you the item Chief Inspector.” \n  \n “Commander, I have been after this shadow Co-op for a long time, and I want to know what has them ambitious to try to do this in a public place. They are either desperate, greedy, stupid, or insane. Maybe they are all of that. If you’re playing games...” \n  \n \"Inspector, this item has cutting edge data and research that looked like it was from a top security facility, from the War Effort. Andreea’s family is one of the top dealer co-ops of Mars. The item was stolen from what thought to be a secure hiding place\" but it was some other group, and they used her family to bring it to Earth.

{"id": "4e62_JwuyOjvw1Dib2yZRQFfNC0gamb6ABAFvo53zeA", "title": "What is PARSIQ?", "body": "\"Blockchain technology is a revolutionary technology that is subverting the pattern of many industries. It is changing settlement methods, payment methods, and the way we transfer value in general. However, we need a way to integrate blockchain transactions and blockchain It is a tool that connects other operations,\" said Tom Tirman, CEO and co-founder of PARSIQ.\n\nPARSIQ is an automation platform that acts as the \"glue\" between blockchain applications and real-world applications. It accomplishes this by facilitating the creation of related workflows and notifications between common blockchains and off-chain systems.\n\nSimilar to automated tools such as Zapier, PARSIQ allows users to initiate various workflows or notifications when certain events occur. Currently, the tool can define this logic for the following blockchains:\n• Bitcoin\n• Ethereum\n• Binance Smart Chain (BSC)\n• Dash\n• Algorand\n• Huobi Ecological Chain\n• Celo\n• Solana\n• Polkadot\n\nPARSIQ's platform standardizes all chains related to users into an easy-to-use system-which means that no matter what kind of blockchain, only one platform is needed to manage all the workflows and notifications required by users.\n\nYou can understand it this way. If the technological world is the ocean of the world, then the continent is its centralized system, and the Layer 1 blockchain (Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.) is the island. The PARSIQ team did not build another island, but decided to build a universal bridge between all the islands and the continent across the ocean.\n\nWhy do I need to program any workflow from on-chain to off-chain?\n\nAlthough the adoption and use of blockchain is rapidly increasing, many systems and processes that we rely on in our daily lives still exist in the off-chain world. Think about the applications on your mobile device-how many of them are actually connected to the decentralized world? In the foreseeable future, having a bridge connecting these two spaces will be more important than ever. This will allow users to respond in a timely manner to events that involve their interests on the blockchain.\n\nBlockchain transactions can happen in near real time, and as long as each block is confirmed, such transactions will proceed immediately. However, not all platforms will provide a way to monitor these transactions, especially for offline wallets or wallets managed on platforms that do not provide instant notifications.\n\nAccording to the complexity of your target digital asset, you can use PARSIQ's real-time monitoring function for different purposes.\n\nIf you are just a digital asset holder, there is always the risk of losing funds, so when someone tries to steal your coins, you may need to know that there is an unauthorized transaction attempt on your wallet.\n\nThis is a simple workflow for monitoring your wallet: if my wallet tries to send a transaction, then notify me via Discord. Since real-time monitoring means instant notification, you will receive a reminder when the transaction confirmation starts, so you have time to react in time and prevent corresponding losses.\n\nIf you are a relatively skilled trader, you may be interested in preemptive trading. After understanding this, there is usually a short but obvious lag before the blockchain transaction is confirmed and reflected in the asset price. The monitoring workflow will be automated and improve your search for various opportunities. For large incoming transfers that may result in the confirmation of the sell transaction, it may take at least 20 minutes to complete.\n\nThis is a special feature that is not available in traditional transactions-the openness and transparency of the blockchain makes this feature possible. However, you can also use manual blockchain scrolling scans, or simply use workflows to gain such insights: If this whale wallet wants to transfer more than a certain amount of coins to the \"sales wallet\", then use Telegram Come and notify me.\n\nNow, you are ready to take some trading actions before the currency pair you are interested in is sold in large quantities.\n\nIn countless PARSIQ use cases, everyone can definitely find something useful for themselves or their business. These include: monitoring transactions and user deposits and obtaining funds, compliance and risk management automation, accounting automation, auditing, financial reporting, transaction automation, and automatic notification of user balance changes, etc.\n\nToday, PARSIQ is widely used for various commercial purposes. Here are three basic if-this-then-that (if..., then...) automation processes that corporate customers can run with PARSIQ:\n\n1. If my company receives a deposit on Bitcoin address A, B or C, it will convert the summary of the deposit into data and send it to Google Sheets and send a \"thank you\" email to the customer.\n2. If there is any deposit from a blacklisted or high-risk address, then mark the account for additional screening, and then notify our compliance inspector through the Slack software.\n3. If the total turnover of deposits on the day exceeds a certain amount of U.S. dollars, then the financial report is sent to the accounting program we use.\n\n\"PARSIQ's smart trigger (h is essentially from the blockchain to the off-chain smart contract), can extend the functions of the smart contract to the outside world.\"-PARSIQ's CTO Alan Durnev said.", "timestamp": 1635663140, "digest": "6Yy8P79RXEDnKawFgNAVjq94IYtyslI42Qb7DQu88tE", "contributor": "0x65d37ABA4F8F285C04E5dAca794761740f7Af610"}

画像を入手した経緯\n\nぼくは、正規の手続きに従って、[国立公文書館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%AC%E6%96%87%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8)に対して、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』の第1鋪と第2鋪の２つの古地図のデジタルデータ（画像ファイル）の利用申請を提出し、下記の手数料等を支払って、2021年4月にこれらの２つの古地図の画像ファイルを入手しました。\n\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（中判特殊撮影）の料金 : 4コマ × 543円/コマ ＝ 2,172円\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（高精細特殊撮影）の料金 : 32コマ × 3,300円/コマ ＝ 105,600円\n* 上記撮影データのDVDＲへの書込みの料金 : DVDＲ 2枚 × 543円/枚 ＝ 1,086円\n* 梱包・送料 : 1件 × 520円/件 ＝ 520円\n* 手数料等合計金額 : 109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1鋪と第2鋪の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの古地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の古地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\nぼくは、16枚ずつに分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪と第2鋪の古地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\nぼくは、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、これらの古地図の画像ファイルを、ウィキメディア・コモンズのウェブサイトで、パブリックドメインとして公開しました。\n\n*

It plans to expand the OlympusDao ecosystem into the Kusama/Polkadot ecosystems while experimenting with new bond types and fresh mechanism design.\n\n### What is Kusama/ Polkadot ecosystems?\n\nKusama is a scalable network of specialized blockchains built using Substrate and nearly the same codebase as Polkadot. The network is an experimental development environment for teams who want to move fast and innovate on Kusama, or prepare for deployment on Polkadot.\n\n### What is MoonRiver? What is MVOR?\n\nMoonriver is a canary network of Moonbeam. Other projects will be able to test their code base on Moonriver, and only then deploy to Moonbeam. The Moonriver has already been launched and is being traded, because it has a faster process of obtaining a parachain slot. Moonriver is a full Ethereum-like environment and works with industry-standard Ethereum tools, DApps, and protocols.\n\nMoonriver (MOVR) is the utility token of the Moonriver Network, Moonbeam’s Kusama deployment that serves as a “CanaryNet” to the Moonbeam Network.\n\n### Steps to get ready for RomeDao\n\n1. Set up a Metamask wallet.\n\n   <https://metamask.io/>\n2. Use Chainlist to search and add Moonriver chain information into MetaMask.\n\n   <https://chainlist.org/>\n3. Two ways to prepare the Fund for RomeDao.\n   1. Get MOVR from any exchange and send the fund to your MetaMask address.\n      1. Exchanges support MOVR are: KuCoin, Kraken, Gate.io and BKEX.\n\n         <https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moonriver#markets>\n   2. Bridge Fund from other chains\n      * Go to RomeDao supported DEX Solarbeam.\n\n        <https://app.solarbeam.io/>\n      * Go to Bridge page to bridge your asset from other Chains to Moonriver.\n        1. Supported Chains and Asset Type\n           1. ETH: DAI,ETH,USDC,USDT,WBTC and so on\n           2. BSC: BNB, BUSD, LAIKA,BIFI\n           3. Avalanche: AVAX and others through RelayChain bridge\n           4. Polygon: Matic and others through RelayChain bridge\n           5. Fantom: WFTM, SPELL, MIM through RelayChain bridge\n           6. Polkadot: DOT through RelayChain bridge\n        2. For ETH, BSC, the bridge fee is 0, but user still have to pay the transactions fee in native token. (For BSC, normally it toke around 5-15 mins to complete the bridge). User can check History Tab for bridge status.\n        3. Get the $MVOR faucet for first transactions. Go to Bridge tab => Choose Faucet\n        4. User can go swap page to swap the bridged assets to any RomeDao supported Asset.(FRAX, MIM, MOVR)\n\nNow, everything is ready for the War with the Etruscan League.

{"id": "_topBmvj0GwZVj3xLgnc6Z0dhQfwjsSJHdx5xxYqmvQ", "title": "1SWIPEAWAY", "body": "**I think it hit me at some point during the Uber ride to her house: this could be the most important hook-up in human history. And the scariest. I know it sounds stupid and indulgent to say that, especially coming from another hetero-normative dude in black Christian Diors like me. (Whatever, they were knock-offs.) But given the extraordinary features of this interaction, along with its consequences for how people think of themselves, I really don’t think it’s an exaggeration. All of this is true by the way. I don’t have the time to make any of this up, and frankly I sucked pretty bad in Language Arts. My grade-school teachers will bug out if they read this.**\n\n**My band was doing a show in Salt Lake City–you know, Mormon utopia in the middle of the desert. Our next gig in Boise had been cancelled for reasons we didn’t entirely understand. When you’re on the road you just kind of run with things, I guess. We decided to hang out in Utah for a couple of days. Somebody said we could “backpack in the watercolor meadows of the Uintahs”. Sounded like a good time. We do retrowave electronica stuff, lots of synthy sounds with flashing lights and voice effects. Everyone’s into the eighties again, even the Mormons it turns out.**\n\n**I still don’t think of myself as a hook-up guy, even after all these years on the road. I’m serious. It’s not something I enjoy or even particularly like. I see hook-ups as one of the rites of being a traveling musician, or maybe even a curse. It’s like how prime ministers have to shake hands with people they don’t necessarily like. I’m a reluctant diplomat of the grunge scene. Everything that guys like David Bowie did make total sense to me. They turned their lives upside-down just to try and find something real. I wonder if they ever found it–when I did, it scared the crap out of me.**\n\n**The first Tinder girl I met in Utah was one of those “it’s for a good cause”-type chicks. I’m not trying to offend anybody, it’s just the only way I can think to describe her. What annoys me about those girls is that they all have the same personality. They’re almost breathless to prove how angry they are about all the *right* things. It makes me feel like everything I know is wrong or something. You just sit there and listen and drown in their syndicated outrage. I swiped right for shallow reasons, yes. The messed-up thing is that I anticipated my annoyance as I glanced at her pics. I was shamelessly undeterred.**\n\n**Her peach spaghetti-strap top swallowed most of my attention, even as she soliloquized about non binary love and dying pandas. (OK, I made that last one up.) Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail. It was less a conversation and more a kind of reciting on her part–anyone could’ve been sitting in front of her. I wonder if she would’ve acted differently if she knew who I was. A few hours later, I finished softly somewhere in the bobbing bramble of hair in my lap. It was depressing. She fixed her ponytail in the mirror, checked her phone, then quickly left.**\n\n**I don’t usually let people get to know me too well, not even my bandmates. I mean we drop acid together sometimes, bro-bonding stuff, that kind of thing. That’s about it. Even with girls, I’m a sex-in-the-dark kind of dude. They probably think I’m weird but I never ask. When the peach-top pedant was leaving I gave her one of our albums on cassette tape. It was awkward (“Uh, thanks…?”) but I feel like it’s the best I can do.**\n\n**Somewhere in the discussion of her saintly works, she had mentioned something her uncle had seen in a mall near downtown Salt Lake City. It was like an upright human with amphibian skin or something. Her uncle was a janitor who cleaned floors there late at night. The thing had come out of a basement stairwell, looked at him for a moment, then turned right back around and disappeared. The really crazy thing was that her uncle said he felt some kind of emotion deep in his chest that he never felt before, sort of like how you feel when you lock eyes with a stranger that looks inexplicably familiar. She reported all of this as a joke, rattling it off at blinding speed in her machine-gun dialogue of goodspeak. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, though, even when we started making out.**\n\n**The guys in our band like to joke about the golden thumb–it’s when you start a streak of matching with the city’s hottest women. That’s millennial serendipity at its finest. Isaac had the golden thumb in Topeka and we didn’t see him until Michigan, but in Michigan the algorithms failed him. It works in mysterious ways. When I matched with this Clarissa girl from Provo, I decided Salt Lake City *was* a promised land, or at least my own Topeka. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, nor has that condition of not-knowing changed. But let me back up...**\n\n**Clarissa was one of those one-pic profiles, which is risky. You’re betting that this single picture is so alluring that the opposite swiper needs no further proof of your hotness. In her case, it was a win. She was wearing a black romper striped orange, yellow, green; her hair was blue and cut boyishly short. The obligatory septum piercing made her nose look like a jewelled accessory. Style, attitude, cuteness. Bad-ass but delicate. The interesting part: the picture wasn’t a picture but actually a moving boomerang, one of those images perpetually repeating two seconds of movement.**\n\n**The boomerang showed Clarissa from behind, jogging in-place on a sidewalk with her face looking coyly back into the camera. I don’t need to mention the advantages such an angle affords those of the requisite affinities–but there was something else. Something *else.* There looked to be a kind of independent movement beneath the fabric around her tailbone, like an appendage that was rising and falling as she ran. You could *just* make out the outline. It couldn’t be…**\n\n**I put my phone away and started pumping some beat-mixes to get my mind straight. Things couldn’t be *that* freaky in Utah. My headphones weren’t loud enough to block out the image. The thing that bothered me most was that my attraction to her hadn’t waned; if anything, I felt *more* attracted. Had I been watching too many shapeshifter animes? That was probably the case regardless.**\n\n**Even so, there was no doubt that Clarissa’s festive romper was hiding a full-grown tail–like, none at all.  I watched the boomerang over and over again, turning my phone this way and that. There was no other conclusion. I considered calling my bandmates for brotherly support but in the end opted for privacy. Imagine if they heard I was seeing a girl with a *tail.* Literally a tail dangling down her rear. Her caption read: “Wyoming-raised, Utah-grown. I don’t want to go to Paris or Prague. Take me to a hidden place we can share secrets.” It was just too much.**\n\n**The first time I met Clarissa it was somewhere near State St. It’s hard for me to keep track of the roads because they’re all numbered on a grid based on their proximity to the Mormon temple. Clarissa told me that this system makes it easier to get around and not get lost. She laughed when I disagreed. We ate vegan wraps in one of those generic Salt Lake plazas made of Mexican eateries and Asian stores. Clarissa explained that she ate healthy when it suited her schedule and mood, which made her “a seasonal vegan”. It was summertime in Salt Lake; she wore a dirty-green tank-top and gray denim shorts ripped across the thighs; her hair was bluer than Freddie Mercury’s stage lighting.**\n\n**She was one of those girls who was easy to talk to, but from whom you couldn’t allow your attention to waver. Clarissa was no prolific talker. Instead I got a watchful loner vibe, someone you’d see walking along deserted railroad tracks, someone who considered Bjork their private therapist. I kept imagining how I could bring the topic up without coming across as a total creep. “I didn’t know people in Utah had tails...is that common here?” Gross. Maybe something more personal. “That romper you had on does a lot for your tail.” God, no. I settled on: “Can you show me that running move from your profile?”**\n\n**We were walking along the sidewalks in the glow of the street lamps; night had fallen on the strange city made of numbers. Clarissa’s hand was clasped softly in mine. I kept resisting the temptation to look behind her like an idiot. She was pressing me with questions somewhat absently. When I told her my band’s name was Nineteeneightyfornicate, she lost it and started going through all of our pictures on Instagram. That name was Isaac’s idea, not mine! It did have a nice ring to it.**\n\n**She stopped walking and turned on me suddenly.**\n\n**“You know, don’t you?”**\n\n**“Know–know what?” I stammered lamely.**\n\n**“Oh come off the bullshit, man. You’ve known this whole time.” Staring me frankly in the eyes, she took my hand and ran it along something long, firm, cylindrical on her backside. My heartbeat quickened and a soft moan emitted from my throat. Clarissa giggled and threw my hand away.**\n\n**“Any secrets you’d like to share with me?”**\n\n**I looked at her for a second, processing. “I already told you my dirty band name–”**\n\n**“Right,” she scoffed. “I hope you come up with something better by tomorrow.”**\n\n**She turned and began receding into the jasmine-bordered shadows. I realized that we had been surrounded by cats ever since we started walking. They now trailed her in unison like a row of ducklings down the sidewalk.**\n\n**“I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE A CAT PERSON!” I yelled hopelessly.**\n\n**She laughed and raised a long middle finger into the air without turning around. I sighed and began walking in the other direction back to my hotel. I opened my phone to a new text message from Clarissa. It didn’t say anything; she’d only sent three cat emojis with their tails in the air. I marveled at how little I knew what in the hell was going on. *I just stroked a human tail. That really happened.* And yet, perversely, I couldn’t wait for the next day.**\n\n***....Any secrets you’d like to share with me…***\n\n**I’ll come clean–that night wasn’t the first time I googled “humans with tails”. There had been drunken nights alone that I obsessed over the idea. My thoughts were ransacked by half-humanoids risen from primordial tetrapods, dripping with sea-foam and tails dragging in the sand. I told you I was a weird guy. To this point, the greatest harm all this had done was butcher my online algorithms–I would get ads for kinky Halloween costumes, which routinely raised some eyebrows.**\n\n***She could be a government spy on some troll-job,* I thought to myself. The idea tormented me for several hours. What was worse, I thought, the CIA using search history and store-bought accessories to play with my mind, or the possibility that I had met some kind of hybrid human with a rope of flesh swinging from her backside? The little bit of ganja I had left made my speculations thicker and more confusing. She had to be real. Why would the government waste time mind-fucking a guy from a band named Nineteeneightyfornicate? I went from that to wondering what she ate when she was stoned.**\n\n**Before I knew it, I was stepping out onto the curb in front of her house in my black knock-off Christian Diors. Who was this profane intruder in Provo? An agent *provo*cateur, I grinned to myself. I didn’t know there could be neighborhoods with trees in the desert. Seemed like the Mormons were pretty good landscapers when they weren’t busy granting all their wives eternal life. Who knew! Clarissa lived in a blue house with a quaint little front porch, one of those places that really has the picture-book mailbox with a perfect red lever pointed upwards.**\n\n**“Were you tailing me earlier?”**\n\n**Clarissa’s voice came out of nowhere, disembodied. I looked around me wildly, my unease ratcheting up several notches. A hand rested on my shoulder from behind; I wheeled around.**\n\n**“Chill out, freak,” Clarissa laughed. She looked at the tree next to her, brushing off some twigs. “My nest is up *there*.”**\n\n**“Your–nest?”**\n\n**“It’s a joke, heard of those before?”**\n\n**I suddenly noticed she was wearing a yellow Walkman cassette player. We always BS that if we meet a chick with a portable cassette player, we’ll automatically drop to one knee, no questions asked.**\n\n**“So you’re that much of a dork that you listen to cassette tapes in 2020?!”**\n\n**“And you’re telling me you don’t have one on you right now?”**\n\n**Wordlessly, I raised my band’s cassette tape out of my pocket.**\n\n**“Give me that,” she laughed, snatching it out of my hand. “Maybe we *are* a match!”**\n\n**I followed her inside.**\n\n**“My roommates are out for the weekend”–glancing at the couch–”you can just shove all that shit over, sorry. We have beer, lemonade, soda...or maybe you like the harder stuff?”**\n\n**I settled in and tried to relax, taking in what was around me. Nothing odd really. There was a crystal salt lamp whose warm glow looked afloat in the dim room. I could faintly sniff sage. A white cat met my gaze and darted out of sight, desperate to be forgotten.**\n\n**“You don’t get many visit–”**\n\n**The sentence was robbed from my throat. Clarissa was putting a glass of Jack Daniels on the table, naked beside the burgundy lingerie faintly interrupting her skin. I could see the thing in plain sight–it was moving from side to side in a sort of carefree, feline attitude, *curling* back on itself this way and that, hairless and freckled as it tapered to its tip. It was a magnificent tail, too magnificent to be an accident. I closed my eyes and took a shot of the Jack.**\n\n**“I know what you’re thinking,” Clarissa smiled. She sat down next to me, running her hand along my shoulder. “You’re thinking ‘it’s impossible, this can’t actually be happening.’”**\n\n**“You must be psychic,” I shot back dryly.**\n\n**“You’re thinking,” she pressed on, “that science eliminates the possibility of my existence.”**\n\n**I didn’t say anything.**\n\n**“What’s wrong, rock star, you don’t want to play along? I know that you know it all–how they say a human tail is only an abomination of the coccyx, a *vestige* of the behind that we all left behind...right?”**\n\n**“What are you getting at here, Clarissa?”**\n\n**She took a swig of lemonade and rolled the juice around her mouth, her gaze unbroken.**\n\n**“Nothing you haven’t already thought of ten thousand times, but I’ll humor you. If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”**\n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.**\n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.**\n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”**\n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”**\n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.**\n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”**\n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am. Clarissa hasn’t left my side since; we’re in Cheyenne now. There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think: I’ve never been happier–or more deeply, inconsolably frightened.**", "timestamp": 1635668366, "digest": "56648re9YKSnaRoHNgg2OrkLba9o04K-E3bNS5Hdiqc", "contributor": "0xBbb538b84ED95aBa94585c6cE7C2f8790dBfE53B"}

And now I am doing the same with [Neofy](https://neofy.cloud/) & [UNOBank ](https://unobank.asia/)by weaving in intelligent chatbot experiences deep within the banks mobile apps.\n\nWhile chatbots as an idea is not new, it’s real adoption has suffered given the lack of conversational quality because of use of basic AI. As reliability, usability, and sophistication increase, chatbots and intelligent Assistants are attracting growing interest.\n\nTo understand how voice and intelligent assistants are shaping the future of financial services, we undertook the task of interviewing technology vendors, experts, innovation leaders, and benchmarking existing services across the financial services sector. The research highlights a big potential for chatbots and intelligent assistants as platforms to increase customer understanding and personalization. So, how are these cognitive assistants shaping financial services?\n\n## **Chatbots and intelligent assistants: The new voice of banking**\n\nChatbots and intelligent assistants are offering a game changing opportunity to financial services to maintain customer service levels whilst reducing operational costs. With these, financial institutions can transform the way they engage their clients across all touch points in their financial interactions. Emerging channels of communication made possible by social media messaging platforms, mobile devices, and voice activated assistants have created exciting and new possibilities that are centered on conversations. Powered by Artificial intelligence and machine learning, automated customer interactions make it possible for fluid conversations and human-like chats.\n\nTo the customer, Chatbots and intelligent assistants bring more convenience, lower friction, and increased accessibility to their banking needs and preferences. For banks and other financial institutions, it ushers in a novel wave of novelty centered on customer interaction and conversations. With this technology, banks and other financial providers have a voice and can deliver their services and products in more expedient and automated ways across multiple communication channels and touch points.\n\n## Building a hybrid workforce\n\nChatbots and intelligent assistants have a two fold capability when it comes to driving innovation in the financial services sector. First and foremost, they can be employed in back-office operations such as HR and finance. Secondly, they can enhance and supplement customer service centers. Building a hybrid workforce of virtual assistants and employees can boost staff productivity and drive enormous cost efficiencies. In simple terms, employees under administrative roles get relieved from repetitive tasks by handing them over to digital assistants. This creates more time to focus on creative tasks that require soft skills while customer care departments can hand over standard requests to AI-based assistants giving them more time to focus on complex customer queries.\n\n## Ubiquitous customer services\n\nPerhaps, the most attractive thing with AI-powered customer service for financial institutions is its ubiquity. With a virtual customer care center operating 24/7 and through various channels such as email, social media, telephone, and messages, it is a win-win situation for both customers and staff. From a client’s perspective, minor requests such as international transactions enablement and resetting passwords can be done instantly and there is no need to visit the bank or spend hours on the telephone speaking with a customer care representative.\n\n## **24/7 banking support**\n\nUnlike customer care agents, digital virtual assistants can work 24/7 with no breaks or tiring. For modern customers, more so millennials, who prefer managing their finances at any time of the day, integrating chatbots and intelligent assistants will soon become the norm for most financial service providers. Banks that don’t scale this technology might find themselves at a severe competitive advantage\n\n## **Going beyond simple Chatbots**\n\nUse cases are rapidly expanding. Customers can now communicate through voice or text to get answers. Voice-enabled AI assistants can handle credit card activations, transfers, and payments freeing up time to focus on complex customer inquiries. As time goes on, conversational AI will become more and more widely accepted as financial institutions gear to harness the technology to drive operational efficiencies and customer engagement.\n\n## **Delivering better insights and improved security**\n\nUnlocking essential business insights should also be a key driver that should motivate financial institutions to invest in chatbots. With these sophisticated systems, it is easy to recognize and identify patterns from sheer amounts of data. With these, financial institutions can seamlessly identify the most common transactions by a client of a particular demographic and then retarget them for personalized sales or marketing campaigns. These real-time insights can make it possible for administrators to make concrete and informed decisions.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nFrom the early days of telephones and print media to the advent of the internet and online banking, banks and other financial providers have engaged their clients in a wide array of ways. In this era, conversational AI characterizes one of the biggest shifts in user interfaces since the emergence of Automated Teller Machines 40 years ago.\n\n> **To meet the needs of the new emerging market of millennials, financial institutions need to up the wager of trust, personalization and convenience by applying the latest tech to gain and retain this budding customer segment.**\n\n*CREDITS: Author is acclaimed CTO and deep-tech innovator with 80 US patents to his credit.

Yes, i know that is the definition of an experiment. Can we move on? The below is repurposed from the newsletter [Salmon Theory](https://robistyping.substack.com/), by a marketing guy who’s getting into web3 though broadly trying to stay afloat while his mind gets blown every other day with the possibilities.\n\nIf you like this sort of stuff, consider subscribing either on [Substack](https://robistyping.substack.com/) or below.\n\n\n---\n\n## I. Knowledge\n\nI’ve had this clunky saying for a while now about two types of knowing. The knowing in your head, and the knowing in your heart. But i like this old proverb better:\n\n> *“Knowledge is only a rumour until it lives in the bones.”*\n\nIt’s so powerful in so many ways. At work, it helps explain that classic dynamic of you-tell-someone-something-and-they-nod-and-agree-but-then-do-nothing-about-it. It explain why we’re better at giving advice than following advice. And it creates a feeling of compassion (at least in me, towards myself *and* others) that a lot of the wisest things we can think, feel, say and do are a product of repeat exposure.\n\nI guess this is also why people are a fan of re-reading certain books. Which i never really got (surely the variety is the point?) but now i kinda do more. The things you read today will feel fundamentally different ten years from now, and would have felt different ten years ago. The words haven’t changed… but the way you frame them has.\n\nThere must be a lesson about planning in here somewhere too. Maybe it’s something about how you get a much richer understanding of the problem to solve when you actually speak to customers, or prospects, and get some good knowledge from the horse’s mouth. Why does this matter? Because without this, it’s all a process of second hand information and ‘my opinion vs your opinion’. But when you can quote what a real person told you about a product and use that to frame a problem? I’ve seen very few episodes where people countered it with ‘but i don’t agree’. And your level of confidence – of really knowing something in your bones – goes up, which makes you more at ease with arguing your case and not doubt yourself so much.\n\nFirst hand knowledge can become strategy on steroids.\n\nThough don’t inject that stuff in your body, that’s just weird.\n\n\n---\n\n## II. Self\n\nThere’s an interesting undercurrent i am exploring in therapy about new selves vs old selves. The working hypothesis is that the work i’ve been doing, and the results i’ve been getting through a combination of therapy, meditation, exercise and medication are not creating anything new in me. I’m not a *new* person, though i certainly feel very different from how i did two or three months ago. If anything, i’m back to the *old* me.\n\nI’ve always been against medication because i thought it changed you, and i was too arrogant to think i needed external help – surely it’s all within my own power? Alas, there’s a lesson in humility in here. Someone recently told me the best thing about medication is that you feel *more like yourself*, and now i see what they meant. I don’t feel i am a new person, i feel i am going back to the person i was before i started experiencing a range of traumatic episodes in my life, which shaped who i had to become in order to cope with them and effectively feel i could survive them.\n\nBut once some of those traumas get acknowledge and resolved… you don’t necessarily get a revelation, you just get an unveiling of all the fog that was getting in the way of who, deep down, you really are. I know this might be a bit much for a monday morning, but have come to 100% believe what Brian Cox (the actor, not the science dude) says about “who you are as a child is your real self, the rest is propaganda”. This is probably paraphrased because i’m too much in a flow (whether good or not, time will tell) to open a new tab and look up the actual quote. Let’s just keep going. Or pause for a bit and think about this. But i’ll keep going, so see you in a second.\n\n\n---\n\n## III. 4D chess\n\nIt’s probably a cliche to compare the process of planning (as in brand / comms planning, not so much life planning, though there are similarities) to chess. So in an attempt to be a bit distinct and feel a bit cleverer, i don’t compare the entire process to a game of chess. However, i like to compare a particular moment of the process to none other than 4D chess.\n\nWhat is 4D chess? Well, it’s surely something above 3D chess, which is already pretty difficult. It’s not meant to be a literal thing. And it’s not meant to necessarily denote that the person in the process is particularly smart or ten steps above everyone else. It’s just that if you think chess is complex, and 3D chess even more, then 4D chess is my euphemism for the process of total panic before simplicity starts sinking in.\n\nYou see, the thing about simplicity is that you don’t get it on step 1 of the process (though that can happen with experience), you get it in step 10. But until you get to step 10, the laws of the universe dictate you probably need to go through the chaos of steps 2 to 9, with the 4D chess phase probably happening around steps 6 or 7, where you feel stuck in a black hole, time and space are bent beyond all recognition, and quite frankly you wish you could time travel at this point. That’s a lot of cosmos references, but see above regarding just going with where my brain is going.\n\nOf course, the point of the 4D chess stage is not to give up, but to appreciate that any good project has it, and that the only way out is through. With a lot of patience, resilience, understanding (first and foremost towards yourself) and possibly some camomile tea or another cup of coffee – your mileage may vary.\n\nSo next time you think you’re freaking out with a project, perhaps consider an exercise in labelling. You’re not freaking out, you’re playing 4D chess. Just sounds so much better on your timesheets too.\n\n\n---\n\n## IV. Habits\n\nRepeat after me:\n\n✅ Too much of a positive habit can turn into a prison.\n\n✅ Too much of a positive habit can turn into a prison.\n\n✅ Too much of a positive habit can turn into a prison.\n\n✅ Too much of a positive habit can turn into a prison.\n\n✅ Too much of a positive habit can turn into a prison.\n\nWhat does it mean? Only your soul can tell. \n\nBut it certainly feels true to me, and my inner child.\n\nSorry bud. We’ll work more together from now on.\n\nLove ya.\n\n\n---\n\n## V. Anger\n\nYou know how most people advise you write a gratitude journal? For some it works, for others it doesn’t – you do what works for you. I find i have phases with it. Sometimes i like to expressly practice gratitude, other times it feels contrived to have to do it when i can just bake it into everyday moments, as opposed to creating it as its own thing. In that sense, i’m probably more often on the camp of ‘meh’ than ‘yeah’.\n\nHowever, i was recently advised to try something else instead. Not a gratitude journal, but an anger journal. Not a place to reflect on all the good that has happened, but rather to acknowledge all the bad i never had a chance to process for whatever reason. It’s an interesting idea, though incredibly hard for me, because the most significant chapters of my life have programmed me to bury my own emotional needs so i can put those of others ahead of them. Which is fine and all that, but the body keeps the score and sooner or later the tax man comes to collect. Or as Gabor Mate says:\n\n> *“I’ve always said that I’m not worried my kids will be angry with me, I’m worried they won’t be angry enough.”*\n\nOr even more aptly:\n\n> *“Sometimes the biggest impetus to healing can come from jump-starting the immune system with a burst of long-suppressed anger.”*\n\nSo i’m exploring ways into this. It could be through writing. It could be through a [rage room](https://www.rageroomevents.co.uk/) (which i’d love to do). But also… could it be through memes? After all, at their best memes can express feelings we otherwise can’t quite put into words, and effectively act as what i very wankily described the other day as ‘snackable feelings’. \n\nSo if there’s such a thing as art therapy, could there be a thing around meme therapy? Does it already exist? I don’t know but i’m gonna toy around with the concept.\n\n“Meme”: actually, an acronym for “mighty emotions manifested exquisitely”.\n\nSorry.\n\n\n---\n\nIf you like this sort of stuff, there’s plenty more on Substack. Or just subscribe directly on Mirror and i’ll republish new content here too. Literally a copy/paste. No biggie.\n\nAnd thanks for reading. Whoever you are.

Or as Gabor Mate says:\n\n> *“I’ve always said that I’m not worried my kids will be angry with me, I’m worried they won’t be angry enough.”*\n\nOr even more aptly:\n\n> *“Sometimes the biggest impetus to healing can come from jump-starting the immune system with a burst of long-suppressed anger.”*\n\nSo i’m exploring ways into this. It could be through writing. It could be through a [rage room](https://www.rageroomevents.co.uk/) (which i’d love to do). But also… could it be through memes? After all, at their best memes can express feelings we otherwise can’t quite put into words, and effectively act as what i very wankily described the other day as ‘snackable feelings’.\n\nSo if there’s such a thing as art therapy, could there be a thing around meme therapy? Does it already exist? I don’t know but i’m gonna toy around with the concept.\n\n“Meme”: actually, an acronym for “mighty emotions manifested exquisitely”.\n\nSorry.\n\n\n---\n\nIf you like this sort of stuff, there’s plenty more on [Substack](https://robistyping.substack.com/).\n\nAnd thanks for reading.

{"id": "lp_0fVrGpNQFzcFSMoZe_vpcOF0_Xf4Y4-_0xpGCuPo", "title": "1SWIPEAWAY", "body": "**I think it hit me at some point during the Uber ride to her house: this could be the most important hook-up in human history. And the scariest. I know it sounds stupid and indulgent to say that, especially coming from another hetero-normative dude in black Christian Diors like me. (Whatever, they were knock-offs.) But given the extraordinary features of this interaction, along with its consequences for how people think of themselves, I really don’t think it’s an exaggeration. All of this is true by the way. I don’t have the time to make any of this up, and frankly I sucked pretty bad in Language Arts. My grade-school teachers will bug out if they read this.**\n\n**My band was doing a show in Salt Lake City–you know, Mormon utopia in the middle of the desert. Our next gig in Boise had been cancelled for reasons we didn’t entirely understand. When you’re on the road you just kind of run with things, I guess. We decided to hang out in Utah for a couple of days. Somebody said we could “backpack in the watercolor meadows of the Uintahs”. Sounded like a good time. We do retrowave electronica stuff, lots of synthy sounds with flashing lights and voice effects. Everyone’s into the eighties again, even the Mormons it turns out.**\n\n**I still don’t think of myself as a hook-up guy, even after all these years on the road. I’m serious. It’s not something I enjoy or even particularly like. I see hook-ups as one of the rites of being a traveling musician, or maybe even a curse. It’s like how prime ministers have to shake hands with people they don’t necessarily like. I’m a reluctant diplomat of the grunge scene. Everything that guys like David Bowie did make total sense to me. They turned their lives upside-down just to try and find something real. I wonder if they ever found it–when I did, it scared the crap out of me.**\n\n**The first Tinder girl I met in Utah was one of those “it’s for a good cause”-type chicks. I’m not trying to offend anybody, it’s just the only way I can think to describe her. What annoys me about those girls is that they all have the same personality. They’re almost breathless to prove how angry they are about all the *right* things. It makes me feel like everything I know is wrong or something. You just sit there and listen and drown in their syndicated outrage. I swiped right for shallow reasons, yes. The messed-up thing is that I anticipated my annoyance as I glanced at her pics. I was shamelessly undeterred.**\n\n**Her peach spaghetti-strap top swallowed most of my attention, even as she soliloquized about non binary love and dying pandas. (OK, I made that last one up.) Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail. It was less a conversation and more a kind of reciting on her part–anyone could’ve been sitting in front of her. I wonder if she would’ve acted differently if she knew who I was. A few hours later, I finished softly somewhere in the bobbing bramble of hair in my lap. It was depressing. She fixed her ponytail in the mirror, checked her phone, then quickly left.**\n\n**I don’t usually let people get to know me too well, not even my bandmates. I mean we drop acid together sometimes, bro-bonding stuff, that kind of thing. That’s about it. Even with girls, I’m a sex-in-the-dark kind of dude. They probably think I’m weird but I never ask. When the peach-top pedant was leaving I gave her one of our albums on cassette tape. It was awkward (“Uh, thanks…?”) but I feel like it’s the best I can do.**\n\n**Somewhere in the discussion of her saintly works, she had mentioned something her uncle had seen in a mall near downtown Salt Lake City. It was like an upright human with amphibian skin or something. Her uncle was a janitor who cleaned floors there late at night. The thing had come out of a basement stairwell, looked at him for a moment, then turned right back around and disappeared. The really crazy thing was that her uncle said he felt some kind of emotion deep in his chest that he never felt before, sort of like how you feel when you lock eyes with a stranger that looks inexplicably familiar. She reported all of this as a joke, rattling it off at blinding speed in her machine-gun dialogue of goodspeak. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, though, even when we started making out.**\n\n**The guys in our band like to joke about the golden thumb–it’s when you start a streak of matching with the city’s hottest women. That’s millennial serendipity at its finest. Isaac had the golden thumb in Topeka and we didn’t see him until Michigan, but in Michigan the algorithms failed him. It works in mysterious ways. When I matched with this Clarissa girl from Provo, I decided Salt Lake City *was* a promised land, or at least my own Topeka. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, nor has that condition of not-knowing changed. But let me back up...**\n\n**Clarissa was one of those one-pic profiles, which is risky. You’re betting that this single picture is so alluring that the opposite swiper needs no further proof of your hotness. In her case, it was a win. She was wearing a black romper striped orange, yellow, green; her hair was blue and cut boyishly short. The obligatory septum piercing made her nose look like a jewelled accessory. Style, attitude, cuteness. Bad-ass but delicate. The interesting part: the picture wasn’t a picture but actually a moving boomerang, one of those images perpetually repeating two seconds of movement.**\n\n**The boomerang showed Clarissa from behind, jogging in-place on a sidewalk with her face looking coyly back into the camera. I don’t need to mention the advantages such an angle affords those of the requisite affinities–but there was something else. Something *else.* There looked to be a kind of independent movement beneath the fabric around her tailbone, like an appendage that was rising and falling as she ran. You could *just* make out the outline. It couldn’t be…**\n\n**I put my phone away and started pumping some beat-mixes to get my mind straight. Things couldn’t be *that* freaky in Utah. My headphones weren’t loud enough to block out the image. The thing that bothered me most was that my attraction to her hadn’t waned; if anything, I felt *more* attracted. Had I been watching too many shapeshifter animes? That was probably the case regardless.**\n\n**Even so, there was no doubt that Clarissa’s festive romper was hiding a full-grown tail–like, none at all.  I watched the boomerang over and over again, turning my phone this way and that. There was no other conclusion. I considered calling my bandmates for brotherly support but in the end opted for privacy. Imagine if they heard I was seeing a girl with a *tail.* Literally a tail dangling down her rear. Her caption read: “Wyoming-raised, Utah-grown. I don’t want to go to Paris or Prague. Take me to a hidden place we can share secrets.” It was just too much.**\n\n**The first time I met Clarissa it was somewhere near State St. It’s hard for me to keep track of the roads because they’re all numbered on a grid based on their proximity to the Mormon temple. Clarissa told me that this system makes it easier to get around and not get lost. She laughed when I disagreed. We ate vegan wraps in one of those generic Salt Lake plazas made of Mexican eateries and Asian stores. Clarissa explained that she ate healthy when it suited her schedule and mood, which made her “a seasonal vegan”. It was summertime in Salt Lake; she wore a dirty-green tank-top and gray denim shorts ripped across the thighs; her hair was bluer than Freddie Mercury’s stage lighting.**\n\n**She was one of those girls who was easy to talk to, but from whom you couldn’t allow your attention to waver. Clarissa was no prolific talker. Instead I got a watchful loner vibe, someone you’d see walking along deserted railroad tracks, someone who considered Bjork their private therapist. I kept imagining how I could bring the topic up without coming across as a total creep. “I didn’t know people in Utah had tails...is that common here?” Gross. Maybe something more personal. “That romper you had on does a lot for your tail.” God, no. I settled on: “Can you show me that running move from your profile?”**\n\n**We were walking along the sidewalks in the glow of the street lamps; night had fallen on the strange city made of numbers. Clarissa’s hand was clasped softly in mine. I kept resisting the temptation to look behind her like an idiot. She was pressing me with questions somewhat absently. When I told her my band’s name was Nineteeneightyfornicate, she lost it and started going through all of our pictures on Instagram. That name was Isaac’s idea, not mine! It did have a nice ring to it.**\n\n**She stopped walking and turned on me suddenly.**\n\n**“You know, don’t you?”**\n\n**“Know–know what?” I stammered lamely.**\n\n**“Oh come off the bullshit, man. You’ve known this whole time.” Staring me frankly in the eyes, she took my hand and ran it along something long, firm, cylindrical on her backside. My heartbeat quickened and a soft moan emitted from my throat. Clarissa giggled and threw my hand away.**\n\n**“Any secrets you’d like to share with me?”**\n\n**I looked at her for a second, processing. “I already told you my dirty band name–”**\n\n**“Right,” she scoffed. “I hope you come up with something better by tomorrow.”**\n\n**She turned and began receding into the jasmine-bordered shadows. I realized that we had been surrounded by cats ever since we started walking. They now trailed her in unison like a row of ducklings down the sidewalk.**\n\n**“I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE A CAT PERSON!” I yelled hopelessly.**\n\n**She laughed and raised a long middle finger into the air without turning around. I sighed and began walking in the other direction back to my hotel. I opened my phone to a new text message from Clarissa. It didn’t say anything; she’d only sent three cat emojis with their tails in the air. I marveled at how little I knew what in the hell was going on. *I just stroked a human tail. That really happened.* And yet, perversely, I couldn’t wait for the next day.**\n\n***....Any secrets you’d like to share with me…***\n\n**I’ll come clean–that night wasn’t the first time I googled “humans with tails”. There had been drunken nights alone that I obsessed over the idea. My thoughts were ransacked by half-humanoids risen from primordial tetrapods, dripping with sea-foam and tails dragging in the sand. I told you I was a weird guy. To this point, the greatest harm all this had done was butcher my online algorithms–I would get ads for kinky Halloween costumes, which routinely raised some eyebrows.**\n\n***She could be a government spy on some troll-job,* I thought to myself. The idea tormented me for several hours. What was worse, I thought, the CIA using search history and store-bought accessories to play with my mind, or the possibility that I had met some kind of hybrid human with a rope of flesh swinging from her backside? The little bit of ganja I had left made my speculations thicker and more confusing. She had to be real. Why would the government waste time mind-fucking a guy from a band named Nineteeneightyfornicate? I went from that to wondering what she ate when she was stoned.**\n\n**Before I knew it, I was stepping out onto the curb in front of her house in my black knock-off Christian Diors. Who was this profane intruder in Provo? An agent *provo*cateur, I grinned to myself. I didn’t know there could be neighborhoods with trees in the desert. Seemed like the Mormons were pretty good landscapers when they weren’t busy granting all their wives eternal life. Who knew! Clarissa lived in a blue house with a quaint little front porch, one of those places that really has the picture-book mailbox with a perfect red lever pointed upwards.**\n\n**“Were you tailing me earlier?”**\n\n**Clarissa’s voice came out of nowhere, disembodied. I looked around me wildly, my unease ratcheting up several notches. A hand rested on my shoulder from behind; I wheeled around.**\n\n**“Chill out, freak,” Clarissa laughed. She looked at the tree next to her, brushing off some twigs. “My nest is up *there*.”**\n\n**“Your–nest?”**\n\n**“It’s a joke, heard of those before?”**\n\n**I suddenly noticed she was wearing a yellow Walkman cassette player. We always BS that if we meet a chick with a portable cassette player, we’ll automatically drop to one knee, no questions asked.**\n\n**“So you’re that much of a dork that you listen to cassette tapes in 2020?!”**\n\n**“And you’re telling me you don’t have one on you right now?”**\n\n**Wordlessly, I raised my band’s cassette tape out of my pocket.**\n\n**“Give me that,” she laughed, snatching it out of my hand. “Maybe we *are* a match!”**\n\n**I followed her inside.**\n\n**“My roommates are out for the weekend”–glancing at the couch–”you can just shove all that shit over, sorry. We have beer, lemonade, soda...or maybe you like the harder stuff?”**\n\n**I settled in and tried to relax, taking in what was around me. Nothing odd really. There was a crystal salt lamp whose warm glow looked afloat in the dim room. I could faintly sniff sage. A white cat met my gaze and darted out of sight, desperate to be forgotten.**\n\n**“You don’t get many visit–”**\n\n**The sentence was robbed from my throat. Clarissa was putting a glass of Jack Daniels on the table, naked beside the burgundy lingerie faintly interrupting her skin. I could see the thing in plain sight–it was moving from side to side in a sort of carefree, feline attitude, *curling* back on itself this way and that, hairless and freckled as it tapered to its tip. It was a magnificent tail, too magnificent to be an accident. I closed my eyes and took a shot of the Jack.**\n\n**“I know what you’re thinking,” Clarissa smiled. She sat down next to me, running her hand along my shoulder. “You’re thinking ‘it’s impossible, this can’t actually be happening.’”**\n\n**“You must be psychic,” I shot back dryly.**\n\n**“You’re thinking,” she pressed on, “that science eliminates the possibility of my existence.”**\n\n**I didn’t say anything.**\n\n**“What’s wrong, rock star, you don’t want to play along? I know that you know it all–how they say a human tail is only an abomination of the coccyx, a *vestige* of the behind that we all left behind...right?”**\n\n**“What are you getting at here, Clarissa?”**\n\n**She took a swig of lemonade and rolled the juice around her mouth, her gaze unbroken.**\n\n**“Nothing you haven’t already thought of ten thousand times, but I’ll humor you. If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”**\n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.**\n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.**\n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”**\n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”**\n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.**\n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”**\n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am.

{"id": "3ZKvlFa7Gup2AjXYB-HjHLcNbA9-A5hSG0-fNRB0EDQ", "title": "Welcome to Through Technology", "body": "If you're here you should be wondering what's [tech.mirror.xyz](http://tech.mirror.xyz) about? Let's see.\n\n## What's Through Technology?\n\nThrough Technology is a publication for understanding and discovering Technology. But not only that, there will be also reflections about its impact.\n\nThrough Technology was born with the idea of talking about all technologies, but let's be honest, right now the main focus will be crypto and web3 which are in my opinion the strongest changing force pushing the world. Nevertheless, expect also articles covering technologies not related to crypto.\n\nThe articles are generally targeted towards anyone that wants to learn but there will be also some more advanced articles related to code and development. Many non-developers are starting to get interested in understanding code even though they're not going to code. Similar to how people should understand legal documents without being lawyers. Smart contracts are powering this desire to better understand software and we will cover that gap here.\n\n## Why Through Technology?\n\nAs Technology gets bigger and bigger it has more impact on our lives and society than ever. Nonetheless, people know very little about how these technologies work or how do they affect their lives. And even less reflect on the long-term or second-order effects. I'm not a fortune teller, but by talking about possible outcomes and impact we can be better prepared for the future that comes.\n\nThe goal of this publication is to spread knowledge about technologies that power the world and discover the new ones that are going to power it soon. But not everything should have a purpose. I write about Technology because I just love it, and that would be enough reason to do so.\n\n## What's been achieved already?\n\nThrough Technology is the way I got deeper into crypto. By dissecting key concepts and analyzing why they matter and their impact, I learned and internalized core concepts to be able to go deeper into the never-ending rabbit hole.\n\nWhen you understand a concept or even just the surface, knowledge gaps appear and new questions arise. This is the flywheel to keep posting.\n\n*[You can check previous publications here](https://cortesja.com/tag/through-technology/).*\n\n## Why join Mirror?\n\nI think Mirror is one of the key crypto startups related to media and culture. Their ideas always feel ahead of the space and it's **the** web3 publication platform.\n\nThrough Technology has been around for some time and now it's the time to merge into Mirror. By merging into Mirror we will be able to mint key articles, contribute to the expanding community, and use the Mirror toolbox.\n\nI believe that learning by doing is the best way to learn and I couldn't miss being on Mirror to experiment with their platform and contribute to the web3 expansion.\n\n**If you're interested in learning about technology and reflecting on them, this is your place.**\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n*I'm very grateful to all the people that helped me join Mirror.

And, to their credit, many \"Adjective Animal Association\" PFPs will probably go to zero.\n\n**But non-fungible tokens aren't image ownership technology.** The point isn't even to \"own\" a file.\n\nNFTs are digital ownership certificates with property rights enforced by a blockchain. These tokens point to something—which *can* be a JPEG. But pictures are just the first thing we certified ownership of. You could attach an NFT to any file type—or no file at all.\n\nThat might give right-click-savers a headache. They called NFTs *with* JPEGs worthless. Wait until they hear about NFTs *without* image files.\n\nBut they bring up a valid question:\n\n## What do NFTs do?\n\nNFTs are pointers to digital assets of any type. Whatever they point to shows up in your wallet. We don’t know most of the use cases of these yet. Digital art ownership is only the first part.\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1451896453065023493](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1451896453065023493)\n\nThat’s because non-fungibles are a new paradigm and will spawn a cambrian explosion of business models. But one thing NFTs enable is community-driven, -owned and -run organizations.\n\n**The direction of web3 businesses won’t be decided only by its employees.**\n\nBecause what NFTs uniquely accomplish is turning customers into participants. They take you from the bleachers and invite you onto the playing field.\n\nThat might sound confusing. So let's use a non-crypto example to illustrate the point. You can plot financial investments on a line: **The higher the potential rewards, the more you have to be involved, the more risk you take.**\n\n![(Purposely simplified: You could plot treasury bonds to the left of ETFs, options trading to the right of VC and a bunch of things in between)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qWXytgN1j9fhyahG7sJww.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nConventional financial wisdom advises to buy into an index fund every month and let it compound at 8-10% per year. This is solid advice. As long as you don't panic-sell, you'll be fine.\n\nBut index funds are a spectator sport: Anyone can buy them. You cheer when it goes up and cry when it goes down. But you have zero influence. You're watching from the bleachers.\n\nThe opposite in traditional finance is venture capital:\n\nLike professional sports, it's hard to become a VC and even harder to be a good one. As an angel investor, you directly influence portfolio companies (and therefore the outcomes of your investments). You're still watching, but you're the coach, standing on the same grass as the players.\n\nIn sports, the athletes on the field are most involved, the TV audience on the couch the least. But what if you could get up from the couch, go to the stadium, buy a jersey and start playing with your favorite team?\n\nThat’s what NFTs do. It's like a founder selling you a jersey and inviting you to play for their team.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uybQnzG8oJkZt4UnbHn7U.png?height=1305&width=2449)\n\nBy owning tokens, you're part of the team. You participate in the upside (when your token appreciates) and the downside (if it tanks). That dynamic exists in VC too. But NFTs are not investment vehicles, you don’t own part of the company and the creator doesn’t ask you for advice. So what *are* you as an NFT holder? That’s what we’ll explore in this article.\n\nSo let's assume you watched people get rich from NFTs, purchase a token, put on that jersey and you're now a player.\n\n### How do you play?\n\nSales, marketing, business development and others are important tasks in any organization. Community members in NFT projects take those on when they:\n\n* Create derivative art\n* Share the project on social media\n* Tell others about the project\n* Are active in the community\n* Make memes\n* etc.\n\nThat's why NFT projects don't run ads. You didn't hear about CryptoPunks from Larva Labs. Or about BAYC from Yuga Labs.\n\n**Ownership and tradability turn community members into sales reps and marketers.**\n\nSome impressive communities even develop software together. You don't sell, design and develop when you're a customer. That's what you do when you're on the team.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JdlBNDBh83k3G247IKLKw.png?height=1688&width=3001)\n\nAs a founder, that sounds amazing:\n\nYou make NFTs, people buy and the community does all the work, right? No. You have to *build* that community first. And that's hard.\n\nHere's why:\n\n## Wen Marketing?\n\nOwnership and tradability incentivize community contribution that grows the overall project. But **contributing to a community is work.**\n\nAnd some people don't like extra work. They want to flip an NFT for multiple times their money ASAP.\n\nIf you want to find them, cmd+f in Discord for these two words: *Wen marketing?*\n\nThat question is *really* asking when others will do the work so they can make money.\n\n**They have the index fund mindset, but want VC returns.**\n\nThere are BAYC minters who never shared the project. And yet they profited from the same explosion in value as BAYC's best evangelists.\n\nIt's the free rider problem:\n\n> *\"A free rider is a person who benefits from something without expending effort or paying for it.\"* \n\n(source: corporatefinanceinstitute.com)\n\nThe worst free riders contribute nothing. They don't create. Their only Discord activity is complaining about the floor price. They don't care about the community or the art.\n\nAnd the worst part: You can't fix this completely and permanently.\n\n**Some free riders are inevitable. But when they take over, projects crumble.**\n\nThat's because participants want to get the most out of their work. And NFT communities can help with that. Creating for a community means you don't have to build from scratch:\n\n* If you're an artist, you've got an early audience and a format to start with.\n* If you're a developer, you can build on top of the contract.\n* If you're there for the vibes, you don't have to find thousands of cool people—they're already there.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QwijPuLa1qrsZLnd40sYD.png?height=1080&width=2035)\n\nNow, nobody is 100% altruistic. By contributing to the community, you want *something* in return.\n\nMaybe that's token value, status in the community, attracting freelance clients, networking with smart people, whatever.\n\n**You want your contributions to benefit you and the community.**\n\nBut contributing to a free rider communty is like multiplying by zero. No meme you make, bot you code or art you draw benefits anyone if nobody else cares.\n\nSo when you see a community of free riders, you contribute elsewhere. But the opposite is also true:\n\nIf the community around you is building together, that motivates you to contribute and create more value for everyone.\n\n![In the right community, you know where you fit in.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NFE-5onfrC8nl4SQyexxy.png?height=1081&width=2126)\n\nIt's the same in sports: It doesn't matter how many people you can hand a jersey if none of them leave the bleachers and walk onto the field.\n\nWith NFTs, you *get* to play. But you also *have* to play. Because if nobody contributes, the project dies and your (and everyone else's) NFT is worthless.\n\nThis is why crypto people talk about aligning incentives: Both creators and token holders want to keep the project from collapsing and watch it flourish instead.\n\nBut that leaves us with a paradox: **If creators and token holders have the same incentives, why do so few projects have engaged communities?**\n\nIf I had a universal answer to that, I'd probably win a nobel prize in economics.\n\nSo instead of doing that, I'll share practical principles (hehe) for fostering an active community that creates long term value.\n\n## How to build a community that creates, builds and ships together\n\n### Stop the giveaways!\n\nThere's an arms race of giveaways in the NFT world: It started with .1 ETH giveaways, now you can win brand-new Teslas for minting a cartoon profile picture.\n\nAnd if your only goal is to sell out a few thousand Fiverr illustrations, having the biggest giveaway attracts the necessary attention. But *whose* attention?\n\nDoes that attract short-term profit seekers (free riders) or long-term thinking builders?\n\nJim Collins has the concept of \"[First Who, Then What?](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/first-who-then-what.html)\" (bolding mine):\n\n> Those who build great organizations make sure they have the right people on the bus and the right people in the key seats before they figure out where to drive the bus. They always think first about who and then about what. When facing chaos and uncertainty, and you cannot possibly predict what's coming around the corner, **your best \"strategy\" is to have a busload of people who can adapt to and perform brilliantly no matter what comes next. Great vision without great people is irrelevant.**\n\n(source: jimcollins.com/concepts/first-who-then-what.html)\n\nThe same is true for NFT communities. You can have amazing art, a great vision and talented team members; if your roadmaps attracts *\"wen marketing?\"* free riders, you'll struggle to keep your project relevant and valuable.\n\nExcessive giveaways incentivize free rider behavior: They only require sitting on your butt and waiting for rewards.\n\nTo attract participants, artists and builders, let your roadmap reflect that you care about those people. Give them something they want. \n\nLet’s take an example: I’m involved in the Pixelbeasts Discord. While most Discords are full of memes, shilling and complaining, this community is building an investment DAO, a podcast, a newsletter, a video game and I’m probably forgetting half of it. \n\nWhy? Look at the roadmap for Pixelbeasts:\n\n![No giveaways, all about creating together.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bryEuIQUvWyA6y-5uqOk_.jpg?height=1426&width=2466)\n\nShow potential token owners what you want builders and creators to ship things with. The way to do that is by building infrastructure.\n\n### Build infrastructure, not sculptures\n\nMost projects build from the top down. They announce an NFT-based video game, comic book, cartoon, etc. and leave the community waiting until it's done.\n\nMaybe the community occasionally votes on something, but that’s it. But you can do all of that by fundraising on Kickstarter. \n\nThe NFT communities I'm bullish on do the opposite: **They enable the community to create.**\n\nIn the [Pixelbeasts](https://www.pixelbeasts.xyz/) Discord server, community members are building a video game. I haven't seen community-driven game development in any other project.\n\nWhy does it work in Pixelbeasts?\n\nThe creator Yohei has baked gaming mechanics into the Beasts' metadata (The traits highlighted below don't influence visual appearance). Making a game is easier that way, because *some* infrastructure is already there.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1uKl-HNqmZXpUnyUfr7SB.jpg?height=906&width=1012)\n\nInfrastructure doesn’t have to be on-chain or even technical. Pixelbeasts members are also writing a rich backstory for Beastopia, the world the beasts inhabit. That backstory will make it easier to tell the story of each PFP because you can build on top of an existing narrative instead of building everything from scratch.\n\nAnother example of infrastructure is the Punkscapes Scape Builder: \n\n[https://twitter.com/PunkScape/status/1453525168035348485](https://twitter.com/PunkScape/status/1453525168035348485)\n\nThis lets everyone add their pixel PFPs onto a given scape. This makes it easy for the community to make memes, tell stories or put your PFP on a fun backdrop. \n\nIt incentivizes sharing the scapes—and that will get more people interested in buying a scape themselves and joining the community.\n\nIf you want an active community, make it easy for participants to build. \n\n### Create incentives\n\nWriting, coding, designing and other things costs time. For skilled people, time is money. Why make derivative NFT art when you could take on a freelance design client?\n\n**To attract people who contribute good work, you have to incentivize them.**\n\nAn example I love is the [Punkscapes](https://punkscape.xyz/) Art-a-thon: Artists compete for a prize fund by making derivative art of the Punkscapes.\n\nI even submitted my own piece:\n\n[https://twitter.com/practicalprncpl/status/1449346654088405005](https://twitter.com/practicalprncpl/status/1449346654088405005)\n\nThis attracted new artists into the community and even spawned [derivative Opensea collections](https://opensea.io/collection/michoscapes).\n\nIt grew the Scapes community, attracted artists and spread the word. All community-led growth, incentivized by the team. That’s what brings in the right people.\n\nBottom-up, community-driven building is the future of most successful NFT projects. But bottom-up initiatives can have unexpected results. What do you do about that?\n\n### Let go of control\n\nNFT projects aren't regular businesses: If you have an active community, it builds and profits without permission. And that could include things you haven't thought about.\n\nThe artist and main dev from Punkscapes never thought about organic diptychs and triptychs, which are highly desired in the community:\n\n[https://twitter.com/PunkScape/status/1450870985356451848](https://twitter.com/PunkScape/status/1450870985356451848)\n\nHe loves it. But not all creators love when their project unfolds a different way than they envisioned it.\n\nIf you want to tightly control every output with a 3-year plan, better launch a \"regular\" startup. On the blockchain, culture and software are composable. And people *will* compose with your creations.\n\n## Wrapping up: Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down\n\nOwning an NFT turns somebody from a buyer into a participant. That has advantages: Everybody participates in the upside, incentives are aligned.\n\nBut it also challenges NFT creators: Building a community that self-organizes, builds and ships without your instruction is hard.\n\nA bottom-up environment enables community-driven initiatives. The more you enable and incentivize bottom-up creation, the more your project is gmi.\n\nP.S.: If you enjoyed this article, please retweet the tweet below to tell more people about it.\n\nP.P.S.: If you'd like to leave a small tip, my wallet address is   0xD785f783e24f71F7FA49dc2933C17bb20954548d", "timestamp": 1635674378, "digest": "HsLnkJd-fPydTRdBOqRM1LpbHqZ9C3rW5awufcZs8-Q", "contributor": "0xD785f783e24f71F7FA49dc2933C17bb20954548d"}

Digital art ownership is only the first part.\n\n[https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1451896453065023493](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1451896453065023493)\n\nThat’s because non-fungibles are a new paradigm and will spawn a cambrian explosion of business models. But one thing NFTs enable is community-driven, -owned and -run organizations.\n\n**The direction of web3 businesses won’t be decided only by its employees.**\n\nBecause what NFTs uniquely accomplish is turning customers into participants. They take you from the bleachers and invite you onto the playing field.\n\nThat might sound confusing. So let's use a non-crypto example to illustrate the point. You can plot financial investments on a line: **The higher the potential rewards, the more you have to be involved, the more risk you take.**\n\n![(Purposely simplified: You could plot treasury bonds to the left of ETFs, options trading to the right of VC and a bunch of things in between)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qWXytgN1j9fhyahG7sJww.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nConventional financial wisdom advises to buy into an index fund every month and let it compound at 8-10% per year. This is solid advice. As long as you don't panic-sell, you'll be fine.\n\nBut index funds are a spectator sport: Anyone can buy them. You cheer when it goes up and cry when it goes down. But you have zero influence. You're watching from the bleachers.\n\nThe opposite in traditional finance is venture capital:\n\nLike professional sports, it's hard to become a VC and even harder to be a good one. As an angel investor, you directly influence portfolio companies (and therefore the outcomes of your investments). You're still watching, but you're the coach, standing on the same grass as the players.\n\nIn sports, the athletes on the field are most involved, the TV audience on the couch the least. But what if you could get up from the couch, go to the stadium, buy a jersey and start playing with your favorite team?\n\nThat’s what NFTs do. It's like a founder selling you a jersey and inviting you to play for their team.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uybQnzG8oJkZt4UnbHn7U.png?height=1305&width=2449)\n\nBy owning tokens, you're part of the team. You participate in the upside (when your token appreciates) and the downside (if it tanks). That dynamic exists in VC too. But NFTs are not investment vehicles, you don’t own part of the company and the creator doesn’t ask you for advice. So what *are* you as an NFT holder? That’s what we’ll explore in this article.\n\nSo let's assume you watched people get rich from NFTs, purchase a token, put on that jersey and you're now a player.\n\n### How do you play?\n\nSales, marketing, business development and others are important tasks in any organization. Community members in NFT projects take those on when they:\n\n* Create derivative art\n* Share the project on social media\n* Tell others about the project\n* Are active in the community\n* Make memes\n* etc.\n\nThat's why NFT projects don't run ads. You didn't hear about CryptoPunks from Larva Labs. Or about BAYC from Yuga Labs.\n\n**Ownership and tradability turn community members into sales reps and marketers.**\n\nSome impressive communities even develop software together. You don't sell, design and develop when you're a customer. That's what you do when you're on the team.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JdlBNDBh83k3G247IKLKw.png?height=1688&width=3001)\n\nAs a founder, that sounds amazing:\n\nYou make NFTs, people buy and the community does all the work, right? No. You have to *build* that community first. And that's hard.\n\nHere's why:\n\n## Wen Marketing?\n\nOwnership and tradability incentivize community contribution that grows the overall project. But **contributing to a community is work.**\n\nAnd some people don't like extra work. They want to flip an NFT for multiple times their money ASAP.\n\nIf you want to find them, cmd+f in Discord for these two words: *Wen marketing?*\n\nThat question is *really* asking when others will do the work so they can make money.\n\n**They have the index fund mindset, but want VC returns.**\n\nThere are BAYC minters who never shared the project. And yet they profited from the same explosion in value as BAYC's best evangelists.\n\nIt's the free rider problem:\n\n> *\"A free rider is a person who benefits from something without expending effort or paying for it.\"*\n\n(source: corporatefinanceinstitute.com)\n\nThe worst free riders contribute nothing. They don't create. Their only Discord activity is complaining about the floor price. They don't care about the community or the art.\n\nAnd the worst part: You can't fix this completely and permanently.\n\n**Some free riders are inevitable. But when they take over, projects crumble.**\n\nThat's because participants want to get the most out of their work. And NFT communities can help with that. Creating for a community means you don't have to build from scratch:\n\n* If you're an artist, you've got an early audience and a format to start with.\n* If you're a developer, you can build on top of the contract.\n* If you're there for the vibes, you don't have to find thousands of cool people—they're already there.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QwijPuLa1qrsZLnd40sYD.png?height=1080&width=2035)\n\nNow, nobody is 100% altruistic. By contributing to the community, you want *something* in return.\n\nMaybe that's token value, status in the community, attracting freelance clients, networking with smart people, whatever.\n\n**You want your contributions to benefit you and the community.**\n\nBut contributing to a free rider communty is like multiplying by zero. No meme you make, bot you code or art you draw benefits anyone if nobody else cares.\n\nSo when you see a community of free riders, you contribute elsewhere. But the opposite is also true:\n\nIf the community around you is building together, that motivates you to contribute and create more value for everyone.\n\n![In the right community, you know where you fit in.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NFE-5onfrC8nl4SQyexxy.png?height=1081&width=2126)\n\nIt's the same in sports: It doesn't matter how many people you can hand a jersey if none of them leave the bleachers and walk onto the field.\n\nWith NFTs, you *get* to play. But you also *have* to play. Because if nobody contributes, the project dies and your (and everyone else's) NFT is worthless.\n\nThis is why crypto people talk about aligning incentives: Both creators and token holders want to keep the project from collapsing and watch it flourish instead.\n\nBut that leaves us with a paradox: **If creators and token holders have the same incentives, why do so few projects have engaged communities?**\n\nIf I had a universal answer to that, I'd probably win a nobel prize in economics.\n\nSo instead of doing that, I'll share practical principles (hehe) for fostering an active community that creates long term value.\n\n## How to build a community that creates, builds and ships together\n\n### Stop the giveaways!\n\nThere's an arms race of giveaways in the NFT world: It started with .1 ETH giveaways, now you can win brand-new Teslas for minting a cartoon profile picture.\n\nAnd if your only goal is to sell out a few thousand Fiverr illustrations, having the biggest giveaway attracts the necessary attention. But *whose* attention?\n\nDoes that attract short-term profit seekers (free riders) or long-term thinking builders?\n\nJim Collins has the concept of \"[First Who, Then What?](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/first-who-then-what.html)\" (bolding mine):\n\n> Those who build great organizations make sure they have the right people on the bus and the right people in the key seats before they figure out where to drive the bus. They always think first about who and then about what. When facing chaos and uncertainty, and you cannot possibly predict what's coming around the corner, **your best \"strategy\" is to have a busload of people who can adapt to and perform brilliantly no matter what comes next. Great vision without great people is irrelevant.**\n\n(source: jimcollins.com/concepts/first-who-then-what.html)\n\nThe same is true for NFT communities. You can have amazing art, a great vision and talented team members; if your roadmaps attracts *\"wen marketing?\"* free riders, you'll struggle to keep your project relevant and valuable.\n\nExcessive giveaways incentivize free rider behavior: They only require sitting on your butt and waiting for rewards.\n\nTo attract participants, artists and builders, let your roadmap reflect that you care about those people. Give them something they want.\n\nLet’s take an example: I’m involved in the Pixelbeasts Discord. While most Discords are full of memes, shilling and complaining, this community is building an investment DAO, a podcast, a newsletter, a video game and I’m probably forgetting half of it.\n\nWhy? Look at the roadmap for Pixelbeasts:\n\n![No giveaways, all about creating together.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bryEuIQUvWyA6y-5uqOk_.jpg?height=1426&width=2466)\n\nShow potential token owners what you want builders and creators to ship things with. The way to do that is by building infrastructure.\n\n### Build infrastructure, not sculptures\n\nMost projects build from the top down. They announce an NFT-based video game, comic book, cartoon, etc. and leave the community waiting until it's done.\n\nMaybe the community occasionally votes on something, but that’s it. But you can do all of that by fundraising on Kickstarter.\n\nThe NFT communities I'm bullish on do the opposite: **They enable the community to create.**\n\nIn the [Pixelbeasts](https://www.pixelbeasts.xyz/) Discord server, community members are building a video game. I haven't seen community-driven game development in any other project.\n\nWhy does it work in Pixelbeasts?\n\nThe creator Yohei has baked gaming mechanics into the Beasts' metadata (The traits highlighted below don't influence visual appearance). Making a game is easier that way, because *some* infrastructure is already there.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1uKl-HNqmZXpUnyUfr7SB.jpg?height=906&width=1012)\n\nInfrastructure doesn’t have to be on-chain or even technical. Pixelbeasts members are also writing a rich backstory for Beastopia, the world the beasts inhabit. That backstory will make it easier to tell the story of each PFP because you can build on top of an existing narrative instead of building everything from scratch.\n\nAnother example of infrastructure is the Punkscapes Scape Builder:\n\n[https://twitter.com/PunkScape/status/1453525168035348485](https://twitter.com/PunkScape/status/1453525168035348485)\n\nThis lets everyone add their pixel PFPs onto a given scape. This makes it easy for the community to make memes, tell stories or put your PFP on a fun backdrop.\n\nIt incentivizes sharing the scapes—and that will get more people interested in buying a scape themselves and joining the community.\n\nIf you want an active community, make it easy for participants to build.\n\n### Create incentives\n\nWriting, coding, designing and other things costs time. For skilled people, time is money. Why make derivative NFT art when you could take on a freelance design client?\n\n**To attract people who contribute good work, you have to incentivize them.**\n\nAn example I love is the [Punkscapes](https://punkscape.xyz/) Art-a-thon: Artists compete for a prize fund by making derivative art of the Punkscapes.\n\nI even submitted my own piece:\n\n[https://twitter.com/practicalprncpl/status/1449346654088405005](https://twitter.com/practicalprncpl/status/1449346654088405005)\n\nThis attracted new artists into the community and even spawned [derivative Opensea collections](https://opensea.io/collection/michoscapes).\n\nIt grew the Scapes community, attracted artists and spread the word. All community-led growth, incentivized by the team. That’s what brings in the right people.\n\nBottom-up, community-driven building is the future of most successful NFT projects. But bottom-up initiatives can have unexpected results. What do you do about that?\n\n### Let go of control\n\nNFT projects aren't regular businesses: If you have an active community, it builds and profits without permission. And that could include things you haven't thought about.\n\nThe artist and main dev from Punkscapes never thought about organic diptychs and triptychs, which are highly desired in the community:\n\n[https://twitter.com/PunkScape/status/1450870985356451848](https://twitter.com/PunkScape/status/1450870985356451848)\n\nHe loves it. But not all creators love when their project unfolds a different way than they envisioned it.\n\nIf you want to tightly control every output with a 3-year plan, better launch a \"regular\" startup. On the blockchain, culture and software are composable. And people *will* compose with your creations.\n\n## Wrapping up: Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down\n\nOwning an NFT turns somebody from a buyer into a participant. That has advantages: Everybody participates in the upside, incentives are aligned.\n\nBut it also challenges NFT creators: Building a community that self-organizes, builds and ships without your instruction is hard.\n\nA bottom-up environment enables community-driven initiatives. The more you enable and incentivize bottom-up creation, the more your project is gmi.\n\nP.S.: If you enjoyed this article, please retweet the tweet below (or send it to someone who’ll love it) to tell more people about it: \n\n[https://twitter.com/practicalprncpl/status/1454751549201264640](https://twitter.com/practicalprncpl/status/1454751549201264640)\n\nP.P.S.: If you'd like to leave a small tip, my wallet address is   0xD785f783e24f71F7FA49dc2933C17bb20954548d", "timestamp": 1635674901, "digest": "HsLnkJd-fPydTRdBOqRM1LpbHqZ9C3rW5awufcZs8-Q", "contributor": "0xD785f783e24f71F7FA49dc2933C17bb20954548d"}

{"id": "IEFTfWNV32qtFybsZluinUrZKENCkUMoawFvwLtsKqk", "title": "   夜色下的上海滩     ", "body": "##             （一）\n\n庄建海在他的面包车前座上换了个姿势，懒洋洋地抬头看着街道上的天空。夜上海的天空是灰亮的，在街旁霓虹灯的映照下不断闪烁着五彩斑斓的色彩。 \n  \n 　　远处最耀眼的自然是那直指夜空的东方明珠电视塔，被灯光镶成的轮廓在上海几乎每个地方都能看到，是上海人最骄傲的标志性建筑。 \n  \n 　　他左前方的辉煌的门庭上紫红色的“海市豪”三个字被一串快速闪烁着的彩灯围绕着，在夜空中格外醒目。优雅的慢三的旋律从里面飘出来，使得大街上也充满浪漫的气息。这是一家中等规模的夜总会，也就是目下在上海最常见到的带有许多三陪小姐的歌舞厅。 \n  \n 　　庄建海的妻子赵岚正在里面做三陪女。他刚刚目送她那婀娜的身影在暮色中消失在舞厅门里。 \n  \n 　　天色刚刚暗下来，里面的客人还不多。不知她现在是在台前等候客人的挑选，还是已经被某个客人搂在舞厅里随着慢四的节奏摇晃，还是……八成她还坐在台前的长椅上。毕竟她已不很年轻，论身材论姿色都比不上外地来的“打工妹”。 \n  \n 　　庄建海不再往下想。这样想没有什么好处，这是他早就知道的，只是他还是常常会忍不住去猜想妻子在里面陪客的情景，特别是最近这两周，他的思路更是不自觉得往这方面想。 \n  \n 　　赵岚在“海市豪”做三陪已有两年多了，庄建海早已走过了那种一想到妻子在别人怀中卖笑就发酸的心里历程。“绿帽情结”，这是他总结出的词汇，是刚出道的新手才会有的。他为自己能很快就能潇洒对待这事而骄傲。这也是一种成熟，一种人生的境界。 \n  \n 　　他能坦然面对妻子卖笑不卖身，陪客人聊天喝酒跳舞。但是，他如何能真正面对她即将跨出的最后一步——卖淫？ \n  \n 　　他自己也说不清楚自己会是个什么感受。既然他们已经决定要走这一步，也许今晚赵岚就可能……他真不愿再去想这些。他们没有选择——赵岚是这么说的，他心里也是这么想的。 \n  \n 　　上海是个“笑贫不笑娼”的地方。这种事越来越司空见惯。其实不光是上海，全国各地又有哪个地方不如此？ \n  \n 　　他认识的十几个开面包车的，有一小半的妻子都在歌舞厅里做三陪。不做的老婆不是太老就是太丑，可以说能做的几乎都在做了。有什么丢脸的？不都是这样吗？真有钱的也不开这种车了。他们还不就是为了挣钱？谁还在乎面子？ \n  \n 　　不过真正卖身的他只知道两个。毕竟陪客人过夜和陪客人跳舞的差别太大了。按他们的说法，在舞厅里三陪只是让人得些手脚便宜，但要是全卖了，就便宜全被人占了。这个便宜能挣得回来吗？ \n  \n 　　对于三陪他以前是很看得开的。老婆被人搂着跳舞后身子也不损失什么。早年他追上她之前她在学校的舞场里还不是被许多人搂过？为此他没少劝过和他一同下岗的小吴。小吴每天等老婆时总是唉声叹气，埋怨自己没用，只能让老婆干这三陪。 \n  \n 　　“侬哪能格么想勿通？勿就是挣钞票吗？有啥想勿通的？宁家占侬老婆格些么手头便宜，侬占伊皮夹子里钞票便宜，啥宁赚啥宁呀？侬看宁家段沪生，老婆拉客人出来都是上伊开的车，赚两份子钞票，那个叫精呃。” \n  \n 　　干这行就得这么想，阿Q 就阿Q 吧，现在还有什么地方能挣到钱呢？他们可都是太缺钱了。下岗津贴区区可数，糊口也可以马虎对付。但厂里搞住房改革，现在他们住的房子必须要从厂里买下来，虽说只是四万元优惠价，这对他们来说可是一笔巨大的开销。又加上去年为了让儿子上教学质量最好的实验初中要交三万元，他们将家里全部的血汗存款全部花完，还借了很大的债才能凑够。 \n  \n 　　想到儿子，他心中油然升起一股骄傲。他儿子没有辜负他的期望，学习成绩一路直上，下学期肯定要升入重点班：重点中学的重点班，这怎能不让他感到骄傲？ \n  \n 　　当然，进重点班还要交八千块，现在这个社会到处都要钱，学校当然也不例外。但是，他们夫妻双双下岗，这八千又是一笔太大的数字，再加上未还完的债，他还想赞钱买一辆桑塔那跑出租。这面包车是租来的，每天付近乎一半以上的收入作租金实在是太亏了，而且上面政策时紧时松，谁知道什么时候这种面包车就会全面取缔。他们这么开也是不怎么合法。但这钱，唉…… \n  \n 　　正像赵岚说的，他们没有选择。虽然这几年生活质量是好了不少，不愁吃不愁穿的，但真要过好日子，没有钱哪成？而且现在他们也都不年轻了，还能这么没日没夜地挣几年？ \n  \n 　　这时又有一拨男人进去，都是西装革履人模人样，但其实都不是好东西。庄在心里暗骂几句操你们娘的，以换点心里平衡。不过骂归骂，庄建海还是希望舞厅生意兴隆，而且也希望赵岚被男人选中。坐冷板凳等待的滋味肯定不好受，她们没有小费就赚不到什么钱。 \n  \n 　　他们中会不会有哪个人会挑中赵岚？他对这群人多看了几眼，立刻有点心虚地转过头，向远处的东方明珠电视塔望去。灯火辉煌的电视塔在夜空中直指云霄，背后映忖着浦东美丽的夜景，组成一副艳丽的上海夜色。 \n  \n 　　这是他为之骄傲的上海。一想到这几年浦东的快速发展的巨大成就他就会无比自豪和骄傲。若不是赶上上海这几年的大发展，他们的生意也不会做到今天。 \n  \n 　　他了口气，启动了车子，向淮海路慢慢开去。 \n  \n 　　“海市豪”里的赵岚并未被那群新进来的男人们挑中。她闇然无语，心中无限惆怅。坐在椅子上的姐妹们其实都在互相较着劲，每当客人进来时都用自己最迷人最媚力的眼光去挑痳他们。能被先选中就像是证明自己的姿色胜过别的女人的一项奖状。 \n  \n 　　几个被挑中的小姐挽着各自客人的胳膊娇媚地伏在他们身上进入内间的舞厅，身后留下一片莺声笑语在屋里回荡。 \n  \n 　　赵岚的姿色已经比不过年轻的外来妹和大三大四的在校大学生了，成群结队来的客人都不喜欢挑她。而这种结队来的客人往往是最慷慨的，因为一般他们都是被招待来玩的，而且很可能会用公款付帐，给小费时眼都不眨一下。 \n  \n 　　这时又进来一个单身的客人。赵岚打起精神，温柔地微笑着，现出非常端庄淑女和体贴温柔的样子。 \n  \n 　　赵岚不像那些年轻的小姐，她们要么打扮得花枝招展，浓妆艳抹，用轻佻诱惑的形象来吸引客人，要么就故意淡妆，做出天真清纯的青春女学生模样，用娇情羞涩的可爱形象来招徕客人。赵岚走的是另一路子，她既不故意骚情，也不故作清纯，而是选择正派成熟女人的形象。这也是没有办法的选择，她实在没有多少青春的资本。 \n  \n 　　但她还是比较成功的，在“海市豪”里算是有些固定客户的。不少中年男人就喜欢专门挑选她这样体贴温馨的成熟妇人，按他们的话来讲，就是受不了那帮骚货的俗气，也不喜欢娇柔造作的假纯情。 \n  \n 　　在又过了几批客人后来了一位中年男子，看上去还算正派，在长椅上的小姐们脸上和身上扫过一遍后终于用手指向了赵岚。 \n  \n 　　一阵暗喜，赵岚满脸微笑着迎接住客人，很老练地挽住他的胳膊，像是招待熟人一样将他拉向里面的舞厅。她温柔地笑着，将胸部小心地贴到他的胳膊上，一面走一面柔声地问候奉承着他。 \n  \n 　　在舞厅一角的双人沙发上并排坐定，赵岚用柔和的语调招待他，开始缠绵地和他套近乎，并主动将他的手拉到自己肩上让他搂住她的颈子。 \n  \n 　　搂着她的中年男人一上来就不客气地用手隔着她的衣服在她的乳房上捏了几下。她心下一边叹息又遇到一个色场老手，一边媚笑着扭开身子和他应承。现在生意是越来越难作了，男人们个个都圆滑无比，不让他们占许多便宜是不可能的了。 \n  \n 　　唉，可怜自己的丈夫还不知道现在的三陪女可不是像以前那样简单地陪客人聊天喝酒跳舞。因为三陪女的数量越来越多，客人们在她们身上也就越来越放肆，现在身上什么地方都可以摸了。供过于求，就成了买方市场，色情业也不例外。你不愿作还有许多人求之不得呢。 \n  \n 　　舞厅周围都是成双成对的男女们，几乎没有例外地，男人们对着各自的女人调戏挑痳，而小姐们都是强颜欢笑曲意奉承。在这里能得到男人的欢心是挣小费的唯一手段，以前那种清高的姿态再也行不通了，她已很久没有遇到过那种只是坐着聊天的拘谨客人。 \n  \n 　　赵岚身旁的男人一手揽在她的脖子上，另一手就摸着她裙下的大腿。她用手护住大腿上部，尽量延阻着男人的进犯，一边举着酒杯不停的哄着这个男人喝酒，希望将他弄得醉一点好容易周旋。 \n  \n 　　这个男人对赵岚的调情不是很感兴趣，他更多的兴趣就是在她身上乱摸乱捏。这样的男人最难对付。 \n  \n 　　舞曲起来，他们搂到舞厅的中央开始跳舞。 \n  \n 　　其实这根本不叫跳舞，而是站在那里，女人两手搂住男人的脖子，被男人搂着随意地晃动。女人的手因无法再用来阻挡男人的侵犯，女人的身体成了男人们随意品玩的对象。跳这种姿势的舞成了男人占女人便宜的最佳方式。 \n  \n 　　赵岚搂着的男人开始在她的身上用力抚摸着，像是要透过她的裙子摸透她的肌肤。他带有烟味和酒味的嘴追她的嘴唇，身子紧紧地贴在她的胸部。她有意娇笑着摇着头躲避着他的嘴，似娇似嗔地挑痳着他的情欲，不时地故意让他得逞，容许他的嘴在她双唇边上占些便宜。 \n  \n 　　这是她长时间总结出来的技巧。不能让男人一次吻个够，而是一点点地让他得些便宜，这样可以最大地挑痳起男人对她的情欲，而且又能让男人长时间的保持对她的兴趣。 \n  \n 　　她的耳边被男人粗重的喘息弄得稣痒无比，耳环也被他用舌头挑起。她嘤笑着转过头，脸蛋划过他的舌尖，令她恶心的口水在她精心化装的脸上留下一道湿痕。她将脸埋进他的胸膛。这是最有效地躲避男人嘴巴的骚扰而又不会太激怒客人的方式。 \n  \n 　　男人的双手移到她的前胸，手伸进她的吊带裙在她的乳罩上用手指旋转着捏揉她的乳尖。虽然他的动作还算温柔体贴，她身体还是做出了强烈的反应。这里是她最敏感的部位。 \n  \n 　　她忍耐着任他轻薄，心中想起在开着面包车的丈夫，还一直坚持要她不陪客人做出格的事——就是只卖笑不卖淫。 \n  \n 　　其实什么是出格什么是不出格？被男人伸进衣服摸乳房算不算？摸阴部呢？连手指都插进去呢？还不算越过了底线出了格？若从脱衣服来看，客人有时会将她的内裤从裙子里扒下来。这算不算出格？若以射不射精为界线，那她用手帮客人手淫射精，还算不算出格呢？这些已经是三陪的基本格式了，根本不是她能左右得了的。 \n  \n 　　她在舞厅里能坚持的最后的底线，就是不让客人插入体内交媾。其他怎么互相摸都可以。有一回客人甚至将龟头放到了她阴唇上摩擦着往里拱，同时让她帮他手淫。虽说未让他最后进入，但这和交媾差别又有多少？ \n  \n 　　她一直不让丈夫知道这种事。她不知道他要是知道了她们三陪的实际情形会怎么反应。 \n  \n 　　赵岚曾试探性地对庄建海说，她们这些上了三十几的三陪女，如果还坚持在舞厅只是清陪，是非常难再混下去了。客人给的坐台费越来越少，都要求来点真的。她举出了好几个姐妹，都开始陪客人在包厢里做全陪挣更多的钱，或干脆就和客人出去。 \n  \n 　　他的反应不是非常排斥。但他还是坚持她要保持自己的尊严和纯洁。他说，“侬是晓得的，我是勿在意格种事情，勿就格么回事？但侬跟各种客人做我实在不放心。啥宁晓得他们有没有传泄病？” \n  \n 　　她也实在无言以对。她相信安全问题决不是他最关注的，他反对的原因根本上还是他“在意”那事。但他们都不愿深究这一点，都留在心底心照不宣。她其实很感激他对她的这种态度。 \n  \n 　　但是，昨夜他们夫妻又作了一次长谈。出乎她的意料，他竟然同意了她可以陪客做那事，也就是同意了自己可以卖淫，只要客人给钱给的还可以，她可以自己看着办。 \n  \n 　　这可是赤裸裸的卖淫啊。这样她的三陪的性质可就彻底变了。虽说她也很想挣那个钱，但毕竟从未让客人真的干过，心中一想到那事就非常紧张。真要让那些个大大小小的硬家伙插入体内啊。这跟和自己丈夫做那事总会不一样吧？ \n  \n 　　搂着她的男人将她贴紧到他的身上，两手玩弄起她的臀部，隔着她的裙子和内裤慢慢揉捏着。她能感到他的阳具已经膨胀起来，隔着衣服顶在了她的下体附近。 \n  \n 　　这人会不会要求做那事？看他对她的身体这么感兴趣，也许会的。 \n  \n 　　想到这赵岚心中一阵慌张发毛。 \n  \n 　　庄建海一边慢慢开着车，一边盯着街道上的每一对男女，寻找潜在的客户。 \n  \n 　　他开的面包车不是一般的出租车，不是简单的那种拉客人从一个地方到另一个地方的交通工具。他的面包车后厢，是一个经过改装的别致的床铺，他真正的生意，其实就是拉妓女和嫖客在车后厢里干那事。 \n  \n 　　许多嫖客其实就只需要一个隐蔽的地方和妓女搞，到旅店开个按小时算的房间要比在歌舞厅开包厢便宜。但更便宜的，还是租这种面包车，既可以按小时算，也可以一边开一边搞，搞到好就停车按里程算。而且还可以让车开到客人想要去的地方，路上的时间可以用来玩女人，既经济，又实惠。一些客人会让他停在隐蔽处，搞完了再走。但更多的客人发现在摇晃的车中做爱非常浪漫。 \n  \n 　　这主意不是他最先想出来的。但他是最快加入这种生意的人之一。在上海头脑不活洛可不行。 \n  \n 　　在不远的街口庄建海接到了一笔生意。一个大学生模样的青年搭上了一个妖冶流莺，上了他的车。 \n  \n 　　他心中轻松起来。至少今晚不会白耗油了。随着开这种面包车的人数的增多，他的生意越来越不如以前，常常出现整晚放空车的情形。 \n  \n 　　他将后视镜扭开，这是在向客人表明他不会偷看。其实他的后视镜还是会有一个拐角将后面全部反射到，他只要稍稍抬抬头就可看到后面的春光。 \n  \n 　　男人的好奇心总是很大的，特别是这样的西洋景。不过庄建海也不是每次都偷看。毕竟看得多了也就没什么意思了，几乎总是千篇一律，按他的话来说，不就是两团肉在车上晃来晃去吗？ \n  \n 　　这个青年好像经验不多，一上车就急猴猴的将女的裙子脱掉搂住乱摸，然后自己脱光后很快又将她的内裤扒掉，开始趴上去就嗯嗯呀呀干起来。 \n  \n 　　庄建海知道如何在车子每一次经过路灯下时恰到好处地扫两眼后视镜。但今天他没有多大的兴趣，只是瞄了一两眼。后面两个裸露的肉体纠缠在一起，在霓虹灯下蠕动着，对他来说都是些老镜头，了无新意。 \n  \n 　　他将车子开在最省油的一个慢速度，无聊地将眼光投向远处的江边夜景。现在他正沿着外滩向南悠悠地驶着，黄浦江对岸的夜景不断在障碍物间闪现。 \n  \n 　　赵岚今晚也会被人这样搞吗？他的思路又飞到妻子身上，脑海里映出赵岚雪白的肉体被陌生男人搂着的幻觉。一想到此他的心就非常乱。赵岚刚去作三陪时他也是这种心情。但他很快就克服了那种情绪。他相信这次也会如此。 \n  \n 　　不就是插来插去吗？在舞厅赵岚的身子可不是早就被摸透了？ \n  \n 　　他知道他不该这么去想。但两周前他平生第一次有机会泡小姐，才惊讶地发现他以前对三陪的了解是多么落后。 \n  \n 　　老实本份的他虽然一直在各个夜总会门口拉客，但还从未进过舞厅叫过小姐，居然不清楚里面三陪现在到底陪到什么程度了，也不知道舞厅里的小包厢里到底是怎么一回事，还以为那里只是唱卡拉OK的地方。 \n  \n 　　他为自己一直如此天真而感到可笑。 \n  \n 　　那是两个星期前从美国纽约回来探亲的老同学路过上海时来看他，他为了显示自己的好客带着老同学逛了一次舞厅。 \n  \n 　　从纽约来的同学老王至今还未娶上媳妇，庄建海不禁暗暗生出一丝优越感。 \n  \n 　　当年自己实在不是考托考G 的料，未能赶上出国的热潮。不过，老王这么多年在国外，混的也不过如此。在庄看来，他从骨子里透的都是土气。要是不知道他的底细，谁见了都会以为他是刚从哪个县城来的。 \n  \n 　　上海人最瞧不起的就是土气。 \n  \n 　　庄建海那天特地歇业不开车了，带老王到上海的南京路外滩转转。老王有十来年没回上海看看了，这回可是大开眼界。那一栋栋新建的摩天大楼，那高架人行桥跨江大桥江底隧道，无不让老王看得眼化缭乱。他不断地感慨上海的变化太大了。 \n  \n 　　庄建海为此非常自豪。是的，上海这几年的建设让全世界都为之震惊。 \n  \n 　　夜色下的上海更是让老王大开眼界。上海这个花花世界比之纽约这样的世界大城市可以说是毫不逊色。这是老王打心眼里承认的。 \n  \n 　　他请老王到城皇庙去吃各种小吃。这是最省钱的办法，稍稍像样点的餐厅都是死贵。 \n  \n 　　果然老王对小吃街上的众多的食物大赞不已。早就听说外国人的吃是很差劲的，哪能和中国的饮食文化相比。这里吃的不仅花样繁多，而且极其便宜，都是下岗工人开的小本生意，却让老王这样从纽约来的人留连忘返。 \n  \n 　　这让庄建海非常开心。花钱少办事好，是上海人最精明的地方。 \n  \n 　　吃过晚饭后庄准备带老王见识见识上海的夜总会。他从老王每次路过夜总会闪烁的霓虹灯时看到外面美女的招牌的眼神里，就知道老王心里在想什么。干他这行察言观色是他的吃饭本领。他很能理解老王。毕竟这么大年纪了，还没有过女人。在美国那地方，爱滋病泛滥，估计他那种老实巴交的人，也不敢乱找妓女。 \n  \n 　　老王告诉庄建海，在纽约没有三陪。这让庄建海惊讶无比。难怪纽约来的也这么土。他真高兴当年没盲目地去凑出国的热闹。 \n  \n 　　那更要带老王见识见识上海的夜总会了，即使所费不菲，也要让老王开开眼界。而且，上海的夜生活最具特色也最能拿得出手的，不就是这大大小小遍布全城的歌舞厅吗？ \n  \n 　　他将老王带到一个叫“新得来”的歌舞厅。他当然从未来过，但凭他经常路过这里的感觉，这里的档次和“海市豪”应该差不多。他对老王说这里的小姐服务得很到位，说这话时显出的老矩连他自己都有点不安，俨然他真是上海歌舞厅的常客。不过上海随便哪个歌舞厅对老王来说都是非常新鲜，不是他在纽约待的土地方能见得到的。 \n  \n 　　不知为何跟老王在一起他总是常常有种优越的感觉。他越来越觉得上海真是个魅力无穷的世界级大城市，他为自己是上海人感到非常骄傲。 \n  \n 　　赵岚已陪这个客人跳了好几曲了，看来这个男人今晚会全泡在她身上。这个男人据他自己说是个什么处长，官虽不大但有些小权，今晚他对她好像很满意，看来今天自己收获不会小。说不定他还会用公款付帐呢？谁知道。 \n  \n 　　能被这个男人包下来，让她有些骄傲。 \n  \n 　　在这里她的姿色实在不算上等，年轻的外来妹个个都很出众，让她非常嫉妒。但她也有她的媚力，这是成熟女人才有的媚力。而且她有经验。她知道如何讨客人的欢心。 \n  \n 　　上海女人的“嗲”是全国闻名的。这在“海市豪”里非常明显。她们几个上海本地的三陪女论姿色都比不过外地来的“乡屋”女人，但她们却总是能得到许多回头客的亲咪，这和她们的素质是分不开的。 \n  \n 　　现在他们搂抱着挤在沙发一角。不远处还有两对男女都搂在一堆，都旁若无人地做着很大胆的亲密动作，其中一个小姐的带裙的带被拉到了胳膊上，没有穿胸罩的双乳几乎就全部裸露出来。另一个女人的裙子被摞起来，露出刺眼的白色内裤。 \n  \n 　　男人的大手开始沿着赵岚的裙子里向上摸索，她已不能再阻止他的侵犯了，这样的客人她可不愿得罪。她有些半真半假地喘着气，用脸在他脸上若即若离地蹭着，在他每一次进犯时都要半推半就地假意抗拒着，一手虚抓着他伸进裙内的大手，另一只手按住裙子另一边，两腿紧紧地并住。 \n  \n 　　她的娇羞其实鼓励了他的进一步的动作。他开始隔着她的内裤摸着她的最隐秘的部位，手指头摸出了阴缝的位置，上下搓揉。 \n  \n 　　她一边夸张地啊啊地呻吟着，一边用手摸到男人的下体，在他挺立的阳具上隔着裤子温柔地相应搓揉。她从他粗重的喘息声中知道自己的动作在起作用，更加卖力地用手刺激他的下体，并用嘴在他脸上讨好地亲着。 \n  \n 　　他的手指不安分地插入她的内裤，挑摸着她的阴毛。她扭动了几下身体，并不打算立刻阻止他的侵犯。 \n  \n 　　他越发起劲，手指更深入到她的内裤，直接摸到了她的业已充血的阴唇。她很高兴自己的下体已经湿润，男人总是喜欢看到女人在他们的玩弄下身体产生反应。 \n  \n 　　该是阻止他的时候了。得让他浅尝即止，不能让他太容易就得到一切，否则很难长时间让他保持兴趣。她娇嗔地推开他的手，将一条腿交叉到他的腿上，既保持了亲密的接触，又有效地护住自己的隐私部位。同时她两手搂住他的脖子，开始对他嗲声嗲气的假意埋怨着。 \n  \n 　　这个男人显然是个中老手，对她的挑痳顺势而上，一把将她搂进怀里，在她嘴上一阵狂亲。她未能躲过这次袭击，干脆让他占尽便宜，然后大喘着气娇嗔地推开他，嘴里不住地说着“要死人了要死人了”。 \n  \n 　　他当然不会就此放过她。他一把将她拉起来，让她完全跨坐到他的双腿上，拉住她的双臂，让她勾回到他的脖子，开始用两手攻击她的上半身。他的手扒下她裙子的带，让带子挂到她的胳膊上，胸部露出她乳白色的胸罩。挺立的双峰在丝布中若隐若现。 \n  \n 　　他抱紧她，不让她后撤，开始用嘴压在乳罩上亲吻。 \n  \n 　　她啊啊地低叫着，这时她的叫声大部份是出于身体的本能反应。不知为什么，她的乳房在结婚了这么多年后仍然非常敏感。这也是她总是坚持戴乳罩的原因。当然戴乳罩是不可能阻止多少男人的进攻的。经常会有客人要求她主动将乳罩去掉。不过这终归多给了她一个周旋的筹码，而且确实有客人曾对她说戴乳罩的女人更有性感，更能挑痳人。 \n  \n 　　现在这个男人不慌不忙地用嘴在她胸部的乳罩上摩擦着，两个手却摸到了她的背后。她将脸抵着他的头发，抵御着胸部传来的刺激。每一次客人玩弄她的乳房时都是她最难熬的时刻，可恨的是几乎每一个客人都对她的乳房感兴趣，也不知是不是她的胸部特别丰满的原因，还是女人的这个部位就是对男人有无穷的吸引力。 \n  \n 　　不管她多么讨厌客人玩她的乳房，她现在都得忍耐了。刚才跳舞时她已多次利用乐曲扭动身子躲避他的狎玩，再躲避他恐怕真会让他不高兴了。 \n  \n 　　他果然是个玩弄女人的老手。他两只手在她背后隔着她的裙子就解开了她胸罩的扣子，他再用双唇拱开已经松动的乳罩，直接用嘴吻在了她胸部上的肉体。 \n  \n 　　强烈的刺激让她有些受不了。但他的双手按在她的背部，逃是逃不掉了。她两手从他脖子上撤回来，紧紧捂住要脱落的胸罩，小心地护住乳头部位，留下一小半乳房让他得些便宜。她开始扭动起身子，向前压住他的头。他的嘴唇却紧紧地附在她胸部周围，任她如何扭动也摆脱不了。她叹息着不得不放弃，任他在她的乳房上直接用嘴吻弄，只是每次他快碰到她的乳尖时才猛地用劲摆脱。 \n  \n 　　舞曲响起，她再次邀他去跳舞。但他却从她的乳部抬起头说：“勿跳了，就格么玩好了。”她有些紧张。这样玩下去他说不定就会要求来真的。她已碰到许多次这样的情形。以前她总是简单地加以拒绝。一般男人不会特别不高兴，顶多只是额外的小费给的少。 \n  \n 　　但今天呢？真要答应他作那事？ \n  \n 　　想到要将整个身子彻底开放让这个人进入，从而跨过这一道每个女人都极其珍惜的最后底线，她心中突然慌张极了。 \n  \n 　　她要跟他怎么开口讲价？要二百块？还是一百？至少要八十。打一炮还是玩一个小时？外面的野鸡也要五十块一小时呢。就跟他说自己是第一次，这倒不是骗他，他可以去老板那里打听。反正少于八十就不干。 \n  \n 　　她有点后悔昨天没有让庄建海给她定个确切的价钱。 \n  \n 　　胡思乱想之中她见到他一手伸到被她裙子盖住的裤子拉开他自己裤子的拉链。看来他已到了非要发泄体内聚集起来的性欲不可的地步。 \n  \n 　　这正是该说的时候了。她轻轻地用手移开裙子，再盖住他的裤子咧开的口子，温柔地对他说，这里不是做这事的地方。如果他愿意，她可以陪他去包厢。 \n  \n 　　他有些怒气地说，为什么不可以？又不怕被人看见。 \n  \n 　　说着，他撩起她的裙子，将她的一只手按到裙下挺挺的阳具上，暧昧地冲着她淫笑，两手摩挲着她的雪白的大腿。原来他连内裤都没穿，早就准备好要让小姐方便帮他手淫。 \n  \n 　　她知道他只想要她帮他在这里打手枪，舍不得花包厢的钱。心中暗骂一声小气鬼，但想到自己不会立刻就跨过那卖淫的最后防线，虽然这只是暂时的延缓，心里倒像是一块石头落了地。他真要作那事她反而要紧张了。 \n  \n 　　她扭捏了几下，故意羞涩地将裙子盖住他的整个下体，手伸进去开始轻轻地摸着他的肉棒，虚虚地握住，慢慢套弄。 \n  \n 　　他的嘴吻住她的双唇。", "timestamp": 1635677293, "digest": "3N2rcJBqvcOVjbE-aeE9SkGt488yPoz4eM6-3UVhank", "contributor":

（一）\n\n庄建海在他的面包车前座上换了个姿势，懒洋洋地抬头看着街道上的天空。夜上海的天空是灰亮的，在街旁霓虹灯的映照下不断闪烁着五彩斑斓的色彩。\n\n远处最耀眼的自然是那直指夜空的东方明珠电视塔，被灯光镶成的轮廓在上海几乎每个地方都能看到，是上海人最骄傲的标志性建筑。\n\n他左前方的辉煌的门庭上紫红色的“海市豪”三个字被一串快速闪烁着的彩灯围绕着，在夜空中格外醒目。优雅的慢三的旋律从里面飘出来，使得大街上也充满浪漫的气息。这是一家中等规模的夜总会，也就是目下在上海最常见到的带有许多三陪小姐的歌舞厅。\n\n庄建海的妻子赵岚正在里面做三陪女。他刚刚目送她那婀娜的身影在暮色中消失在舞厅门里。\n\n天色刚刚暗下来，里面的客人还不多。不知她现在是在台前等候客人的挑选，还是已经被某个客人搂在舞厅里随着慢四的节奏摇晃，还是……八成她还坐在台前的长椅上。毕竟她已不很年轻，论身材论姿色都比不上外地来的“打工妹”。\n\n庄建海不再往下想。这样想没有什么好处，这是他早就知道的，只是他还是常常会忍不住去猜想妻子在里面陪客的情景，特别是最近这两周，他的思路更是不自觉得往这方面想。\n\n赵岚在“海市豪”做三陪已有两年多了，庄建海早已走过了那种一想到妻子在别人怀中卖笑就发酸的心里历程。“绿帽情结”，这是他总结出的词汇，是刚出道的新手才会有的。他为自己能很快就能潇洒对待这事而骄傲。这也是一种成熟，一种人生的境界。\n\n他能坦然面对妻子卖笑不卖身，陪客人聊天喝酒跳舞。但是，他如何能真正面对她即将跨出的最后一步——卖淫？\n\n他自己也说不清楚自己会是个什么感受。既然他们已经决定要走这一步，也许今晚赵岚就可能……他真不愿再去想这些。他们没有选择——赵岚是这么说的，他心里也是这么想的。\n\n上海是个“笑贫不笑娼”的地方。这种事越来越司空见惯。其实不光是上海，全国各地又有哪个地方不如此？\n\n他认识的十几个开面包车的，有一小半的妻子都在歌舞厅里做三陪。不做的老婆不是太老就是太丑，可以说能做的几乎都在做了。有什么丢脸的？不都是这样吗？真有钱的也不开这种车了。他们还不就是为了挣钱？谁还在乎面子？\n\n不过真正卖身的他只知道两个。毕竟陪客人过夜和陪客人跳舞的差别太大了。按他们的说法，在舞厅里三陪只是让人得些手脚便宜，但要是全卖了，就便宜全被人占了。这个便宜能挣得回来吗？\n\n对于三陪他以前是很看得开的。老婆被人搂着跳舞后身子也不损失什么。早年他追上她之前她在学校的舞场里还不是被许多人搂过？为此他没少劝过和他一同下岗的小吴。小吴每天等老婆时总是唉声叹气，埋怨自己没用，只能让老婆干这三陪。\n\n“侬哪能格么想勿通？勿就是挣钞票吗？有啥想勿通的？宁家占侬老婆格些么手头便宜，侬占伊皮夹子里钞票便宜，啥宁赚啥宁呀？侬看宁家段沪生，老婆拉客人出来都是上伊开的车，赚两份子钞票，那个叫精呃。”\n\n干这行就得这么想，阿Q 就阿Q 吧，现在还有什么地方能挣到钱呢？他们可都是太缺钱了。下岗津贴区区可数，糊口也可以马虎对付。但厂里搞住房改革，现在他们住的房子必须要从厂里买下来，虽说只是四万元优惠价，这对他们来说可是一笔巨大的开销。又加上去年为了让儿子上教学质量最好的实验初中要交三万元，他们将家里全部的血汗存款全部花完，还借了很大的债才能凑够。\n\n想到儿子，他心中油然升起一股骄傲。他儿子没有辜负他的期望，学习成绩一路直上，下学期肯定要升入重点班：重点中学的重点班，这怎能不让他感到骄傲？\n\n当然，进重点班还要交八千块，现在这个社会到处都要钱，学校当然也不例外。但是，他们夫妻双双下岗，这八千又是一笔太大的数字，再加上未还完的债，他还想赞钱买一辆桑塔那跑出租。这面包车是租来的，每天付近乎一半以上的收入作租金实在是太亏了，而且上面政策时紧时松，谁知道什么时候这种面包车就会全面取缔。他们这么开也是不怎么合法。但这钱，唉……\n\n正像赵岚说的，他们没有选择。虽然这几年生活质量是好了不少，不愁吃不愁穿的，但真要过好日子，没有钱哪成？而且现在他们也都不年轻了，还能这么没日没夜地挣几年？\n\n这时又有一拨男人进去，都是西装革履人模人样，但其实都不是好东西。庄在心里暗骂几句操你们娘的，以换点心里平衡。不过骂归骂，庄建海还是希望舞厅生意兴隆，而且也希望赵岚被男人选中。坐冷板凳等待的滋味肯定不好受，她们没有小费就赚不到什么钱。\n\n他们中会不会有哪个人会挑中赵岚？他对这群人多看了几眼，立刻有点心虚地转过头，向远处的东方明珠电视塔望去。灯火辉煌的电视塔在夜空中直指云霄，背后映忖着浦东美丽的夜景，组成一副艳丽的上海夜色。\n\n这是他为之骄傲的上海。一想到这几年浦东的快速发展的巨大成就他就会无比自豪和骄傲。若不是赶上上海这几年的大发展，他们的生意也不会做到今天。\n\n他了口气，启动了车子，向淮海路慢慢开去。\n\n“海市豪”里的赵岚并未被那群新进来的男人们挑中。她暗然无语，心中无限惆怅。坐在椅子上的姐妹们其实都在互相较着劲，每当客人进来时都用自己最迷人最媚力的眼光去挑痳他们。能被先选中就像是证明自己的姿色胜过别的女人的一项奖状。\n\n几个被挑中的小姐挽着各自客人的胳膊娇媚地伏在他们身上进入内间的舞厅，身后留下一片莺声笑语在屋里回荡。\n\n赵岚的姿色已经比不过年轻的外来妹和大三大四的在校大学生了，成群结队来的客人都不喜欢挑她。而这种结队来的客人往往是最慷慨的，因为一般他们都是被招待来玩的，而且很可能会用公款付帐，给小费时眼都不眨一下。\n\n这时又进来一个单身的客人。赵岚打起精神，温柔地微笑着，现出非常端庄淑女和体贴温柔的样子。\n\n赵岚不像那些年轻的小姐，她们要么打扮得花枝招展，浓妆艳抹，用轻佻诱惑的形象来吸引客人，要么就故意淡妆，做出天真清纯的青春女学生模样，用娇情羞涩的可爱形象来招徕客人。赵岚走的是另一路子，她既不故意骚情，也不故作清纯，而是选择正派成熟女人的形象。这也是没有办法的选择，她实在没有多少青春的资本。\n\n但她还是比较成功的，在“海市豪”里算是有些固定客户的。不少中年男人就喜欢专门挑选她这样体贴温馨的成熟妇人，按他们的话来讲，就是受不了那帮骚货的俗气，也不喜欢娇柔造作的假纯情。\n\n在又过了几批客人后来了一位中年男子，看上去还算正派，在长椅上的小姐们脸上和身上扫过一遍后终于用手指向了赵岚。\n\n一阵暗喜，赵岚满脸微笑着迎接住客人，很老练地挽住他的胳膊，像是招待熟人一样将他拉向里面的舞厅。她温柔地笑着，将胸部小心地贴到他的胳膊上，一面走一面柔声地问候奉承着他。\n\n在舞厅一角的双人沙发上并排坐定，赵岚用柔和的语调招待他，开始缠绵地和他套近乎，并主动将他的手拉到自己肩上让他搂住她的颈子。\n\n搂着她的中年男人一上来就不客气地用手隔着她的衣服在她的乳房上捏了几下。她心下一边叹息又遇到一个色场老手，一边媚笑着扭开身子和他应承。现在生意是越来越难作了，男人们个个都圆滑无比，不让他们占许多便宜是不可能的了。\n\n唉，可怜自己的丈夫还不知道现在的三陪女可不是像以前那样简单地陪客人聊天喝酒跳舞。因为三陪女的数量越来越多，客人们在她们身上也就越来越放肆，现在身上什么地方都可以摸了。供过于求，就成了买方市场，色情业也不例外。你不愿作还有许多人求之不得呢。\n\n舞厅周围都是成双成对的男女们，几乎没有例外地，男人们对着各自的女人调戏挑痳，而小姐们都是强颜欢笑曲意奉承。在这里能得到男人的欢心是挣小费的唯一手段，以前那种清高的姿态再也行不通了，她已很久没有遇到过那种只是坐着聊天的拘谨客人。\n\n赵岚身旁的男人一手揽在她的脖子上，另一手就摸着她裙下的大腿。她用手护住大腿上部，尽量延阻着男人的进犯，一边举着酒杯不停的哄着这个男人喝酒，希望将他弄得醉一点好容易周旋。\n\n这个男人对赵岚的调情不是很感兴趣，他更多的兴趣就是在她身上乱摸乱捏。这样的男人最难对付。\n\n舞曲起来，他们搂到舞厅的中央开始跳舞。\n\n其实这根本不叫跳舞，而是站在那里，女人两手搂住男人的脖子，被男人搂着随意地晃动。女人的手因无法再用来阻挡男人的侵犯，女人的身体成了男人们随意品玩的对象。跳这种姿势的舞成了男人占女人便宜的最佳方式。\n\n赵岚搂着的男人开始在她的身上用力抚摸着，像是要透过她的裙子摸透她的肌肤。他带有烟味和酒味的嘴追她的嘴唇，身子紧紧地贴在她的胸部。她有意娇笑着摇着头躲避着他的嘴，似娇似嗔地挑痳着他的情欲，不时地故意让他得逞，容许他的嘴在她双唇边上占些便宜。\n\n这是她长时间总结出来的技巧。不能让男人一次吻个够，而是一点点地让他得些便宜，这样可以最大地挑痳起男人对她的情欲，而且又能让男人长时间的保持对她的兴趣。\n\n她的耳边被男人粗重的喘息弄得稣痒无比，耳环也被他用舌头挑起。她嘤笑着转过头，脸蛋划过他的舌尖，令她恶心的口水在她精心化装的脸上留下一道湿痕。她将脸埋进他的胸膛。这是最有效地躲避男人嘴巴的骚扰而又不会太激怒客人的方式。\n\n男人的双手移到她的前胸，手伸进她的吊带裙在她的乳罩上用手指旋转着捏揉她的乳尖。虽然他的动作还算温柔体贴，她身体还是做出了强烈的反应。这里是她最敏感的部位。\n\n她忍耐着任他轻薄，心中想起在开着面包车的丈夫，还一直坚持要她不陪客人做出格的事——就是只卖笑不卖淫。\n\n其实什么是出格什么是不出格？被男人伸进衣服摸乳房算不算？摸阴部呢？连手指都插进去呢？还不算越过了底线出了格？若从脱衣服来看，客人有时会将她的内裤从裙子里扒下来。这算不算出格？若以射不射精为界线，那她用手帮客人手淫射精，还算不算出格呢？这些已经是三陪的基本格式了，根本不是她能左右得了的。\n\n她在舞厅里能坚持的最后的底线，就是不让客人插入体内交媾。其他怎么互相摸都可以。有一回客人甚至将龟头放到了她阴唇上摩擦着往里拱，同时让她帮他手淫。虽说未让他最后进入，但这和交媾差别又有多少？\n\n她一直不让丈夫知道这种事。她不知道他要是知道了她们三陪的实际情形会怎么反应。\n\n赵岚曾试探性地对庄建海说，她们这些上了三十几的三陪女，如果还坚持在舞厅只是清陪，是非常难再混下去了。客人给的坐台费越来越少，都要求来点真的。她举出了好几个姐妹，都开始陪客人在包厢里做全陪挣更多的钱，或干脆就和客人出去。\n\n他的反应不是非常排斥。但他还是坚持她要保持自己的尊严和纯洁。他说，“侬是晓得的，我是勿在意格种事情，勿就格么回事？但侬跟各种客人做我实在不放心。啥宁晓得他们有没有传泄病？”\n\n她也实在无言以对。她相信安全问题决不是他最关注的，他反对的原因根本上还是他“在意”那事。但他们都不愿深究这一点，都留在心底心照不宣。她其实很感激他对她的这种态度。\n\n但是，昨夜他们夫妻又作了一次长谈。出乎她的意料，他竟然同意了她可以陪客做那事，也就是同意了自己可以卖淫，只要客人给钱给的还可以，她可以自己看着办。\n\n这可是赤裸裸的卖淫啊。这样她的三陪的性质可就彻底变了。虽说她也很想挣那个钱，但毕竟从未让客人真的干过，心中一想到那事就非常紧张。真要让那些个大大小小的硬家伙插入体内啊。这跟和自己丈夫做那事总会不一样吧？\n\n搂着她的男人将她贴紧到他的身上，两手玩弄起她的臀部，隔着她的裙子和内裤慢慢揉捏着。她能感到他的阳具已经膨胀起来，隔着衣服顶在了她的下体附近。\n\n这人会不会要求做那事？看他对她的身体这么感兴趣，也许会的。\n\n想到这赵岚心中一阵慌张发毛。\n\n庄建海一边慢慢开着车，一边盯着街道上的每一对男女，寻找潜在的客户。\n\n他开的面包车不是一般的出租车，不是简单的那种拉客人从一个地方到另一个地方的交通工具。他的面包车后厢，是一个经过改装的别致的床铺，他真正的生意，其实就是拉妓女和嫖客在车后厢里干那事。\n\n许多嫖客其实就只需要一个隐蔽的地方和妓女搞，到旅店开个按小时算的房间要比在歌舞厅开包厢便宜。但更便宜的，还是租这种面包车，既可以按小时算，也可以一边开一边搞，搞到好就停车按里程算。而且还可以让车开到客人想要去的地方，路上的时间可以用来玩女人，既经济，又实惠。一些客人会让他停在隐蔽处，搞完了再走。但更多的客人发现在摇晃的车中做爱非常浪漫。\n\n这主意不是他最先想出来的。但他是最快加入这种生意的人之一。在上海头脑不活洛可不行。\n\n在不远的街口庄建海接到了一笔生意。一个大学生模样的青年搭上了一个妖冶流莺，上了他的车。\n\n他心中轻松起来。至少今晚不会白耗油了。随着开这种面包车的人数的增多，他的生意越来越不如以前，常常出现整晚放空车的情形。\n\n他将后视镜扭开，这是在向客人表明他不会偷看。其实他的后视镜还是会有一个拐角将后面全部反射到，他只要稍稍抬抬头就可看到后面的春光。\n\n男人的好奇心总是很大的，特别是这样的西洋景。不过庄建海也不是每次都偷看。毕竟看得多了也就没什么意思了，几乎总是千篇一律，按他的话来说，不就是两团肉在车上晃来晃去吗？\n\n这个青年好像经验不多，一上车就急猴猴的将女的裙子脱掉搂住乱摸，然后自己脱光后很快又将她的内裤扒掉，开始趴上去就嗯嗯呀呀干起来。\n\n庄建海知道如何在车子每一次经过路灯下时恰到好处地扫两眼后视镜。但今天他没有多大的兴趣，只是瞄了一两眼。后面两个裸露的肉体纠缠在一起，在霓虹灯下蠕动着，对他来说都是些老镜头，了无新意。\n\n他将车子开在最省油的一个慢速度，无聊地将眼光投向远处的江边夜景。现在他正沿着外滩向南悠悠地驶着，黄浦江对岸的夜景不断在障碍物间闪现。\n\n赵岚今晚也会被人这样搞吗？他的思路又飞到妻子身上，脑海里映出赵岚雪白的肉体被陌生男人搂着的幻觉。一想到此他的心就非常乱。赵岚刚去作三陪时他也是这种心情。但他很快就克服了那种情绪。他相信这次也会如此。\n\n不就是插来插去吗？在舞厅赵岚的身子可不是早就被摸透了？\n\n他知道他不该这么去想。但两周前他平生第一次有机会泡小姐，才惊讶地发现他以前对三陪的了解是多么落后。\n\n老实本份的他虽然一直在各个夜总会门口拉客，但还从未进过舞厅叫过小姐，居然不清楚里面三陪现在到底陪到什么程度了，也不知道舞厅里的小包厢里到底是怎么一回事，还以为那里只是唱卡拉OK的地方。\n\n他为自己一直如此天真而感到可笑。\n\n那是两个星期前从美国纽约回来探亲的老同学路过上海时来看他，他为了显示自己的好客带着老同学逛了一次舞厅。\n\n从纽约来的同学老王至今还未娶上媳妇，庄建海不禁暗暗生出一丝优越感。\n\n当年自己实在不是考托考G 的料，未能赶上出国的热潮。不过，老王这么多年在国外，混的也不过如此。在庄看来，他从骨子里透的都是土气。要是不知道他的底细，谁见了都会以为他是刚从哪个县城来的。\n\n上海人最瞧不起的就是土气。\n\n庄建海那天特地歇业不开车了，带老王到上海的南京路外滩转转。老王有十来年没回上海看看了，这回可是大开眼界。那一栋栋新建的摩天大楼，那高架人行桥跨江大桥江底隧道，无不让老王看得眼化缭乱。他不断地感慨上海的变化太大了。\n\n庄建海为此非常自豪。是的，上海这几年的建设让全世界都为之震惊。\n\n夜色下的上海更是让老王大开眼界。上海这个花花世界比之纽约这样的世界大城市可以说是毫不逊色。这是老王打心眼里承认的。\n\n他请老王到城皇庙去吃各种小吃。这是最省钱的办法，稍稍像样点的餐厅都是死贵。\n\n果然老王对小吃街上的众多的食物大赞不已。早就听说外国人的吃是很差劲的，哪能和中国的饮食文化相比。这里吃的不仅花样繁多，而且极其便宜，都是下岗工人开的小本生意，却让老王这样从纽约来的人留连忘返。\n\n这让庄建海非常开心。花钱少办事好，是上海人最精明的地方。\n\n吃过晚饭后庄准备带老王见识见识上海的夜总会。他从老王每次路过夜总会闪烁的霓虹灯时看到外面美女的招牌的眼神里，就知道老王心里在想什么。干他这行察言观色是他的吃饭本领。他很能理解老王。毕竟这么大年纪了，还没有过女人。在美国那地方，爱滋病泛滥，估计他那种老实巴交的人，也不敢乱找妓女。\n\n老王告诉庄建海，在纽约没有三陪。这让庄建海惊讶无比。难怪纽约来的也这么土。他真高兴当年没盲目地去凑出国的热闹。\n\n那更要带老王见识见识上海的夜总会了，即使所费不菲，也要让老王开开眼界。而且，上海的夜生活最具特色也最能拿得出手的，不就是这大大小小遍布全城的歌舞厅吗？\n\n他将老王带到一个叫“新得来”的歌舞厅。他当然从未来过，但凭他经常路过这里的感觉，这里的档次和“海市豪”应该差不多。他对老王说这里的小姐服务得很到位，说这话时显出的老矩连他自己都有点不安，俨然他真是上海歌舞厅的常客。不过上海随便哪个歌舞厅对老王来说都是非常新鲜，不是他在纽约待的土地方能见得到的。\n\n不知为何跟老王在一起他总是常常有种优越的感觉。他越来越觉得上海真是个魅力无穷的世界级大城市，他为自己是上海人感到非常骄傲。\n\n赵岚已陪这个客人跳了好几曲了，看来这个男人今晚会全泡在她身上。这个男人据他自己说是个什么处长，官虽不大但有些小权，今晚他对她好像很满意，看来今天自己收获不会小。说不定他还会用公款付帐呢？谁知道。\n\n能被这个男人包下来，让她有些骄傲。\n\n在这里她的姿色实在不算上等，年轻的外来妹个个都很出众，让她非常嫉妒。但她也有她的媚力，这是成熟女人才有的媚力。而且她有经验。她知道如何讨客人的欢心。\n\n上海女人的“嗲”是全国闻名的。这在“海市豪”里非常明显。她们几个上海本地的三陪女论姿色都比不过外地来的“乡屋”女人，但她们却总是能得到许多回头客的亲咪，这和她们的素质是分不开的。\n\n现在他们搂抱着挤在沙发一角。不远处还有两对男女都搂在一堆，都旁若无人地做着很大胆的亲密动作，其中一个小姐的带裙的带被拉到了胳膊上，没有穿胸罩的双乳几乎就全部裸露出来。另一个女人的裙子被摞起来，露出刺眼的白色内裤。\n\n男人的大手开始沿着赵岚的裙子里向上摸索，她已不能再阻止他的侵犯了，这样的客人她可不愿得罪。她有些半真半假地喘着气，用脸在他脸上若即若离地蹭着，在他每一次进犯时都要半推半就地假意抗拒着，一手虚抓着他伸进裙内的大手，另一只手按住裙子另一边，两腿紧紧地并住。\n\n她的娇羞其实鼓励了他的进一步的动作。他开始隔着她的内裤摸着她的最隐秘的部位，手指头摸出了阴缝的位置，上下搓揉。\n\n她一边夸张地啊啊地呻吟着，一边用手摸到男人的下体，在他挺立的阳具上隔着裤子温柔地相应搓揉。她从他粗重的喘息声中知道自己的动作在起作用，更加卖力地用手刺激他的下体，并用嘴在他脸上讨好地亲着。\n\n他的手指不安分地插入她的内裤，挑摸着她的阴毛。她扭动了几下身体，并不打算立刻阻止他的侵犯。\n\n他越发起劲，手指更深入到她的内裤，直接摸到了她的业已充血的阴唇。她很高兴自己的下体已经湿润，男人总是喜欢看到女人在他们的玩弄下身体产生反应。\n\n该是阻止他的时候了。得让他浅尝即止，不能让他太容易就得到一切，否则很难长时间让他保持兴趣。她娇嗔地推开他的手，将一条腿交叉到他的腿上，既保持了亲密的接触，又有效地护住自己的隐私部位。同时她两手搂住他的脖子，开始对他嗲声嗲气的假意埋怨着。\n\n这个男人显然是个中老手，对她的挑痳顺势而上，一把将她搂进怀里，在她嘴上一阵狂亲。她未能躲过这次袭击，干脆让他占尽便宜，然后大喘着气娇嗔地推开他，嘴里不住地说着“要死人了要死人了”。\n\n他当然不会就此放过她。他一把将她拉起来，让她完全跨坐到他的双腿上，拉住她的双臂，让她勾回到他的脖子，开始用两手攻击她的上半身。他的手扒下她裙子的带，让带子挂到她的胳膊上，胸部露出她乳白色的胸罩。挺立的双峰在丝布中若隐若现。\n\n他抱紧她，不让她后撤，开始用嘴压在乳罩上亲吻。\n\n她啊啊地低叫着，这时她的叫声大部份是出于身体的本能反应。不知为什么，她的乳房在结婚了这么多年后仍然非常敏感。这也是她总是坚持戴乳罩的原因。当然戴乳罩是不可能阻止多少男人的进攻的。经常会有客人要求她主动将乳罩去掉。不过这终归多给了她一个周旋的筹码，而且确实有客人曾对她说戴乳罩的女人更有性感，更能挑痳人。\n\n现在这个男人不慌不忙地用嘴在她胸部的乳罩上摩擦着，两个手却摸到了她的背后。她将脸抵着他的头发，抵御着胸部传来的刺激。每一次客人玩弄她的乳房时都是她最难熬的时刻，可恨的是几乎每一个客人都对她的乳房感兴趣，也不知是不是她的胸部特别丰满的原因，还是女人的这个部位就是对男人有无穷的吸引力。\n\n不管她多么讨厌客人玩她的乳房，她现在都得忍耐了。刚才跳舞时她已多次利用乐曲扭动身子躲避他的狎玩，再躲避他恐怕真会让他不高兴了。\n\n他果然是个玩弄女人的老手。他两只手在她背后隔着她的裙子就解开了她胸罩的扣子，他再用双唇拱开已经松动的乳罩，直接用嘴吻在了她胸部上的肉体。\n\n强烈的刺激让她有些受不了。但他的双手按在她的背部，逃是逃不掉了。她两手从他脖子上撤回来，紧紧捂住要脱落的胸罩，小心地护住乳头部位，留下一小半乳房让他得些便宜。她开始扭动起身子，向前压住他的头。他的嘴唇却紧紧地附在她胸部周围，任她如何扭动也摆脱不了。她叹息着不得不放弃，任他在她的乳房上直接用嘴吻弄，只是每次他快碰到她的乳尖时才猛地用劲摆脱。\n\n舞曲响起，她再次邀他去跳舞。但他却从她的乳部抬起头说：“勿跳了，就格么玩好了。”她有些紧张。这样玩下去他说不定就会要求来真的。她已碰到许多次这样的情形。以前她总是简单地加以拒绝。一般男人不会特别不高兴，顶多只是额外的小费给的少。\n\n但今天呢？真要答应他作那事？\n\n想到要将整个身子彻底开放让这个人进入，从而跨过这一道每个女人都极其珍惜的最后底线，她心中突然慌张极了。\n\n她要跟他怎么开口讲价？要二百块？还是一百？至少要八十。打一炮还是玩一个小时？外面的野鸡也要五十块一小时呢。就跟他说自己是第一次，这倒不是骗他，他可以去老板那里打听。反正少于八十就不干。\n\n她有点后悔昨天没有让庄建海给她定个确切的价钱。\n\n胡思乱想之中她见到他一手伸到被她裙子盖住的裤子拉开他自己裤子的拉链。看来他已到了非要发泄体内聚集起来的性欲不可的地步。\n\n这正是该说的时候了。她轻轻地用手移开裙子，再盖住他的裤子咧开的口子，温柔地对他说，这里不是做这事的地方。如果他愿意，她可以陪他去包厢。\n\n他有些怒气地说，为什么不可以？又不怕被人看见。\n\n说着，他撩起她的裙子，将她的一只手按到裙下挺挺的阳具上，暧昧地冲着她淫笑，两手摩挲着她的雪白的大腿。原来他连内裤都没穿，早就准备好要让小姐方便帮他手淫。\n\n她知道他只想要她帮他在这里打手枪，舍不得花包厢的钱。心中暗骂一声小气鬼，但想到自己不会立刻就跨过那卖淫的最后防线，虽然这只是暂时的延缓，心里倒像是一块石头落了地。他真要作那事她反而要紧张了。\n\n她扭捏了几下，故意羞涩地将裙子盖住他的整个下体，手伸进去开始轻轻地摸着他的肉棒，虚虚地握住，慢慢套弄。\n\n他的嘴吻住她的双唇。\n\n##  （二）\n\n车厢后面的喘息声越来越重，庄建海能感到本来平稳的车子在行驶中有些不易察觉的抖动。他轻蔑地笑了一下，后面的年轻人好像没有弄多久就不行了，车子这才刚刚开出外滩。 \n  \n 　　这种男女之事对他来说真像是家常便饭，几乎每天都这么在他眼皮底下发生。这也是他对此很看得开的原因。他相信自己是不在乎赵岚被人这样玩的。但……能捞回便宜吗？如果挣的不多，还不如不做。这是他反覆对赵岚说的。他坚信世上每件事都有个价钱。 \n  \n 　　一想起那次他陪老王去逛夜总会的情形，他就对她现在挣的很不满意。都被玩成这样了，才这几个钱，还不如讲开来干真的来钱。 \n  \n 　　这也是他为什么同意让赵岚对要求来全程的客人看情形办的原因。当然他不会这么同她讲。他对她说的，就是“要是有人愿作冤大头，不宰白不宰。” \n  \n 　　他不明白自己为何一直未能洒脱到看出这一点。真是太幼稚了，看人家段沪生那才是精明。段的老婆约了客人出来，都要先CALL段沪生。要是段沪生的车还空着，就可以挣个双份。那个潇洒。 \n  \n 　　想起段沪生老婆挽着男人扭动屁股的作做姿态，他又回忆起那次在“新得来”里坐在他腿上的女人肉体——那也是个上海女人。 \n  \n 　　他只是偶然地选上了个上海女人。他对老王吹嘘说他是有眼光的。事后他自己也觉得自己有品味。 \n  \n 　　那天老王一进门就被一排小姐痳得眼都直了，但庄建海是见过世面的。他看到那些小姐搔首弄姿的样子，竟一点不为所动，毕竟自己就是吃这行饭的，看来自己还真像个老手。他对那些过于轻佻的女人比较反感，很自然就挑了一个还算端庄的成熟女人。而且她的皮肤真是白，很是让他赏心悦目，跟赵岚的皮肤比起来还要白。 \n  \n 　　他也许选她时的心理在不知不觉中有点受了赵岚的影响？ \n  \n 　　当他后来发现她是货真价实的上海女人时，他为自己的眼光感到非常高兴。他后来对老王吹说，这个年头舞厅里多的是外地小姐，但他一眼就能看出谁是真正的上海人。 \n  \n 　　老王就不行了，被一个妖艳的女人迷住。据老王后来说，他真受不了那个女人。他说这话时满脸都是口红印子。不过庄建海知道这不是老王的心里话。他能看出来老王还是对那个女人非常受用的。 \n  \n 　　陪庄建海的小姐叫云红。真是俗气的名字。但也没办法。现在的小姐都取俗气的名字。赵岚在舞厅里叫的是什么名字？他居然还一直不知道。好像叫什么晶晶？还是筝筝？ \n  \n 　　不知为何被这个女人搂着胳膊总是让他想到自己的老婆。也许是第一次在外面玩女人，所以有些心虚？他陪老王出来赵岚是知道的，只是来舞厅没有对她讲。庄建海倒不是因怕老婆而不敢讲。和许多上海男人不同，他从来就不是个妻管严。庄建海未将这次逛舞厅告诉赵岚，是因为他事前根本就没计划来这里花这冤枉钱。 \n  \n 　　他相信赵岚绝对会理解的。毕竟人家老王是远道而来，又从未见识过上海的夜总会，带他去一次也不就是几百块钱，几个晚上也就挣回来了。上海人从来就不是小气的人。该花钱的地方上海人从来就是很大方的，只是因为上海人花钱花得比较精明，让许多人误以为是小气。 \n  \n 　　不过事后他也未对赵岚提这事，不是不敢提，而是另一个原因了。 \n  \n 　　在他看来，在歌舞厅里花钱基本上就是作冤大头。不说那些贵的出奇的饮料，点个歌扯开嗓子让其他人难受自己发泄倒也罢了，但被女人假心假意地挑痳几下就要给小费，这是他怎么也不愿接受的。谁不知道那些小姐的甜言蜜语都是假的？搂着小姐跳舞？连搂自己的老婆跳舞都没兴趣了。都是过来人了，还不就这么回事？ \n  \n 　　他事后没跟赵岚讲这次经历，实在是因为这次经历还真是出乎他的预料。可以说让他大吃一惊。虽然他们在那里只待了很短的时间，却是个地地道道的销魂的夜晚，让他终身难忘。 \n  \n 　　他还记得大厅里面在天花板上的昏暗的旋转彩灯映照下的诡秘的男男女女。他的脑海里渐渐清晰地回忆起那天的几乎每一个情节。 \n  \n 　　云红将他带到里面，他马上就被舞池里几对男女的“出格”的“舞姿”惊呆了。这是个什么野路子歌舞厅？ \n  \n 　　一个男人撩起舞伴裙子，将大腿在她的内裤上一遍遍的摩擦，就连毫无音乐素养的庄建海都看出来那腿的动作根本就不合节拍，纯粹就是占小姐的便宜。另一个男人的手竟插入女方的内裤里直接占她的屁股的便宜，嘴巴还在对着她的嘴猛烈缠绵的热吻。赵岚不是说客人一般是不许直接亲嘴的吗？ \n  \n 　　而另一个男人的举动就更让他震惊：他嘴巴竟然含住小姐从脱落的带裙里裸露的乳头，脸在她的胸部揉压着。 \n  \n 　　而这些小姐好像对这些男人的出格举动毫不在意，任他们随意施为。有的小姐还主动用身子招引男人的亲薄。这哪里还是在跳舞？ \n  \n 　　庄建海无法将这样的画面和他记忆里的男女跳舞形象联系到一起。他原以为搂紧了跳贴面舞就是最过份的了。 \n  \n 　　台上两个穿着极少的少女还跳着撩人的劲舞。她们的动作几乎就是对男人的挑痳. 连他自认为很是见过世面的人也大为心跳。 \n  \n 　　他一度以为自己走错了地方。但既然进来了，而且对老王暗示过自己常来这里，总不好就退出去。而且几十块钱的门票估计也不容易就要回来。 \n  \n 　　那时的老王好像已经血脉喷涨了，眼里射出来的都是欲火。 \n  \n 　　看到老王的样子，庄建海反而镇定下来。既来之则安之。自己又不是没见过男女搞过？跳跳艳舞有什么大惊小怪的？ \n  \n 　　不过他心中翻腾的，不是这些男女的出格动作，而是想到了赵岚。因为这里跳舞的男人在女人身上毫无例外地大占便宜到了过份的地步。难道赵岚也被人这么玩弄？还是这里是个很不正规的舞厅？ \n  \n 　　当他们坐到角落里的沙发上时，他才又发现在昏暗的沙发上坐着的男女的动作比之舞池里的人还要更加不堪入目。 \n  \n 　　未等他仔细看清楚周围男女的情形，云红温柔的嘴已经凑了上来，在他腮帮子上娇声地左一个先生右一个老板，还对他用上海话说“侬勿常来吧？” \n  \n 　　幸亏她的话音很小，他肯定老王没听见，否则真会让他难堪。老王那时已被那个叫倩英的骚女人搂在脖子上正在手足无措。 \n  \n 　　庄建海还真被云红贴上来的身体上散发出的刺激的香味有点弄得神魂颠倒了。这对他来说还是从未有过的。经常在他后车厢里的女人的香味都很浓，但这一次女人的肉体是主动地贴在了他的肩膀上，他胳膊动一动就能碰到她的乳房。 \n  \n 　　他的惊愕是短暂的。虽说是第一次真正和一个小姐贴在一起，一想到他来这里就是要花钱的，不玩白不玩，他就慢慢冷静下来。什么样的小姐自己没有见过？自己的老婆就是小姐，还不是经常搂？ \n  \n 　　后来他开始慢慢适应，大胆地伸开手臂，将那个送上来的诱人的肉体搂住。嘴里还对着对面的倩英说道，“伊可是从纽约来的，侬要好好招待招待”。一副十足的老手派头。 \n  \n 　　他身上的云红也哎吆吆地一副惊讶的神情，好像更加热情地将身子贴紧到他的怀里。这让他非常开心。他不再麻木，在云红将他的手往她颈子下移动时趁势开始往云红的雪白的胸部上摸起来。他本以为她必定会娇柔地躲避一番，但他却惊讶地发现她竟主动地将他的手引向乳罩里面，同时还讨好地用嘴亲他的腮帮。 \n  \n 　　他暗自赞叹，果然这里的小姐的服务很到位，对老王吹的牛还被他蒙对了。他心中很是快慰。 \n  \n 　　当他摸入她乳罩里柔软的乳房上时，他的脸不自觉地红起来，竟有些不忍往下摸。毕竟还是他第一次这么摸一个陌生女人的乳房，下体竟开始蠢蠢欲动起来。 \n  \n 　　云红的手也在他的身上随意地游走，从他的上身摸向他的大腿，再摸向他的大腿根部。她的手有意无意地触摸着他的阴部。 \n  \n 　　他的下体立刻翘了起来。这么快就来如此刺激的动作，大大出乎他的意料。云红的手更是有意无意地在他敏感处撩拨，鼓起来的阴部被这个陌生女人摸到让他很是尴尬。 \n  \n 　　他忽然想到，自己的老婆是否现在也正在如此这般地服务别的男人？心中竟呼的生出一股醋意——那种他很久以前才有过的酸溜溜的感觉。 \n  \n 　　他手下再也不客气，开始在她的乳房上更加大胆地揉捏起来。她的乳罩只罩住了她乳房的一半多一点，而且是松垮地搭在上面，他甚至能很容易地在里面摸到她的乳尖。 \n  \n 　　他后来才发现她的乳罩扣子不知何时已经解开了，乳罩在带裙里形同虚设。她在他的揉捏下似乎疼痛地呻吟起来，反倒让他有些怜意，手不得不停下来。 \n  \n 　　她对他的好心似乎很感动，主动将他的手按在自己乳房上，好像是在表示你随便玩好了。在这样的女人身上乱摸让他大感刺激。他已很久没这么摸过女人的乳房了，其实赵岚就从未这么让他随意摸过，稍微碰几下她就要大叫难受。现在就不一样了，云红可以任他尽情的摸玩。他几乎就是将她整个的乳房都捏在手里。 \n  \n 　　难道现在的三陪就是这样可以任客人在小姐身上乱摸？看到周围男男女女极其出格的淫乱场面，庄建海想到的还是正在“海市豪”陪客的妻子赵岚。 \n  \n 　　这个亏吃的可是太大了。他万万没想到赵岚现在从事的三陪已变成如此露骨。这比直接卖淫又好到哪里？可赚的钱却不成比例，难怪赵岚几次三番地说想接全程服务的客。 \n  \n 　　对面的倩英横坐在老王的大腿上，勾着他的脖子，不知在低声地说着什么，嘴巴不时地磨蹭着他的脸，一副娇情的样子，将老王痳得晕晕呼呼。 \n  \n 　　台上出现一个穿着俗气的女人，开始在迪斯科的强劲旋律下扭动身子，并开始一件件脱去遮在身上的衣物。那真是一个极其淫糜的气氛。庄建海在一个多月后还能记住其中的许多感受的细节，特别清晰的是云红雪白光滑的皮肤在手里揉捏的那种销魂感觉。 \n  \n 　　后面车厢里的乘客的声音将他从回忆中惊醒。他们玩够了开始一边穿衣服一边在朦浓的昏暗中结帐。女人的上半身还裸露在幽暗的车厢里。 \n  \n 　　赵岚胯坐在男人的腿上，一手搂着他的脖子，另一手在他的阴茎上的加快了套弄的速度。她能从客人的喘息声中知道客人会有何种需要。男人将嘴张开对着她的双唇亲吻，好像要吸尽唇她嘴唇上的口红。她慢慢张开嘴唇，让他更尽兴地热烈对吻。 \n  \n 　　以前她是从不让客人直接接吻她的嘴的，体液的接触总是让她厌恶。但现在这种接吻已是家常便饭，一个晚上她要被这么吻数十次。有时还被迫接受法式亲吻，让客人的舌头在嘴里搅乎，或者让客人将她的舌头含进嘴里。最讨厌的是客人嘴对嘴地逼她喝酒，那种受辱的感受非常强烈。 \n  \n 　　男人的口腔带着浓厚的烟酒味，对受惯了的赵岚来说已不再那么难以忍受。让她难以忍受的，还是他在她乳房上的双手给她带来强烈的刺激。他早已拉下她的乳罩，两手完全自由地在她的乳房上揉捏把玩。为了摆脱这种玩弄，只能想法尽快让他泄欲。 \n  \n 　　她用手亲捏他阴茎上的包皮，上下快速搓动着，增强的刺激让他对着她的嘴更大地喘息。她手里已沾上了从他阴茎里渗出的一丝液体，她知道让他达到高潮还要加把劲。 \n  \n 　　他两手移到下面，从她的裙子下伸进去，将她的内裤往下拉到他大腿处不能再拉为止。她的阴部基本上暴露在他的阴茎前方。她暗叹口气，没有阻止他的侵犯，继续为他手淫，同时更主动地和他接吻，想让他分散底下的动作。 \n  \n 　　他开始用手在她的阴唇里扣捏，另一手缕玩她的阴毛。还好，似乎他只是想玩弄玩弄她的阴部，并不打算用阴茎往里面捅，否则那又会是一番纠缠。 \n  \n 　　她安心地继续用手刺激着他的生殖器，手里的肉棒越来越坚硬，还不时地在她手中跳动。她知道她的阴部很快将会沾满一大片令人恶心的淫液。不过这已是不坏的结果了，但愿不要将她的裙子也弄得一塌糊涂。 \n  \n 　　他从嘴唇里伸出了魔鬼般的舌头，探入她的口腔，在她嘴里开始肆虐地挺进。她将嘴张得更大，好让他得以尽兴。在这种快要达到他高潮的时候她不愿打断他的兴奋，将他刺激到这种程度已很费劲。而且真的不让他占这个便宜很可能会得罪客人，所以只能任他在嘴里得寸进尺地大占便宜。 \n  \n 　　火热的肉棒在手里越来越坚硬，眼看就要快到尽头。他突然将她的屁股猛地往他大腿根部一抱，阴茎上的龟头直接抵在了她的阴唇口上，再要前进就可以探入里面。 \n  \n 　　真是遇到了狡猾的老手。她嗯呀地回拒着，决心只能让他到此为止。用手将他的阴茎向上拉起一点，错开她阴唇的位置，将龟头抵在阴毛里，更快速地用手摩擦。他没有强求，只是一手按住她的后脑，更猛烈地压住她的嘴在她嘴里乱搅着舌头，另一手则抓住了她的一个乳房快速抓捏着，捏得她几乎疼的要叫出来。 \n  \n 　　高潮猛的爆发了。一股湿漉漉的火热的液体在赵岚的阴部上方的阴毛里流开，粗大的阴茎连续在她的手心中跳动，他整个身子向前连挺几下，似是在配合他的每一次喷射，以得到更多的快感。 \n  \n 　　她继续快速用手抚慰着他的肉棒，直到他松开她的头让她的嘴离开大口大口地喘气。 \n  \n 　　她歇了一口气，从桌子上取出两张纸巾将他的阴茎包住，然后小心地将内裤卷起包住糊满她整个阴部的浓稠的淫液。对着这个满意地喘着气的男人妩媚地娇笑献殷，两手勾住他的脖子再次献上一个温柔的亲吻。 \n  \n 　　庄建海沿着西藏南路向人民广场慢慢地开着。脑海里又转到赵岚的身上。她现在是否正在某个男人的怀里被人姿意地玩弄？还是…… \n  \n 　　他知道自己最近想这些想得太多了。这么不潇洒还怎么吃这碗饭？更惶论让赵岚真去作全程服务了。自从他上次去了“新得来”舞厅后脑子就一直充满赵岚裸露在男人怀里的幻觉。 \n  \n 　　他猛地摇了摇头，知道自己又在毫无益处地胡思乱想。用劲捏了一下方向盘后他两眼职业性地向街边的人群中溜过去，在每一对男女身上巡视。 \n  \n 　　一对男女靠在树干上紧紧地搂着，女人叉开了两腿，让男人的腿插在中间。另有一对男女挤在一个不易令人察觉的墙角，两张脸完全贴在一起。成双成对的恋人也是上海夜间街头一大艳景。女人们的衣裙这几年随着生活水平的提高变得越来越非常暴露和性感。 \n  \n 　　一个娇艳的倩影刚好从他的侧镜中闪过，让他的脑海里又闪现出云红俏艳的容颜和她迷人的肉体。庄建海的思绪再次回到那天在“新得来”舞厅里的那一个销魂的夜晚。 \n  \n 　　“新得来”舞厅的确太过淫乱了。庄建海在云红的身上可以说上下摸了个透。好像是要验证他心里最后一点疑惑，当他的手摸向云红内裤时，她不仅半点拒绝的意思都没有，还主动分开两腿，让他在她的阴部隔着一层内裤随意摸捏。他几乎就要将手指隔着裤子插进她的阴道了。 \n  \n 　　这已经远远超过了他所认可的三陪的底线。但似乎里面的三陪小姐都是如此。而且这种摸捏还只是开始。 \n  \n 　　赵岚也是象云红这样接客的吗？他一直没有这样询问妻子。他实在不想让她难堪。她最初去做三陪还是他极力劝服的。让赵岚这样保守的女人去干那种事是要费不少口舌的。没想到现在的三陪变得如此赤裸裸，纵是一惯潇洒的他也感到有些难以接受。倒是赵岚居然能够承受这样性质的三陪，让他大为吃惊。也许赵岚所在的“海市豪”并不像“新得来”这样出格？ \n  \n 　　庄建海想起云红的手一开始就在他的裤裆部位不时地轻捏，一双巧手的刺激隔着裤子传到他阳具上，那真是刺激无比。在庄建海几次拒绝了她邀他跳舞的邀请后她干脆就拉下了他裤子拉链，将手伸进里面隔着薄薄的内裤把玩起他的鼓鼓的肉棒。这种大胆的服务让庄建海大为吃惊。这时的他全身的燥热已难以抵挡，在她的手的巧妙搓揉下肉棒立刻就膨胀到了最大状态。但他还是想进一步试探她到底能服务到什么程度。他问她能否将她的手直接伸进去弄。 \n  \n 　　不出他的意料，云红竟真的伸进他的外裤里拉下他的内裤，将他挺立的阴茎暴露出来，毫不羞涩地对他意味深长的一笑，就用手掳着他的肉棒，开始上下搓揉起上面的嫩皮。 \n  \n 　　他从来未曾受过如此待遇。女人的手在他肉棒上温柔的感觉强烈地刺激起他的性欲，他紧搂住她的细腰，靠在沙发上尽情享受着异性的手淫服务。这是他从未享受过的服务。简直比直接趴在女人身上做爱还要刺激。他曾见过男人在他面包车后厢里让妓女为他手淫。当时他还大为不解，打手枪不就自己做就行了？还得花钱让女人帮忙？现在看来那人并不像自己以为的那样“港督”。手淫的感觉竟能如此奇妙。 \n  \n 　　他在她的搓揉下坚持了好一会，突然他意识到自己即将射精。这样子不是要将自己的裤子射脏一大片？ \n  \n 　　看他低头犹豫的样子，云红马上就理会出他的心思。她放开握住他肉棒的手，两手伸进裙子里，不慌不忙地抬了一下屁股，在庄建海难以置信的眼光下从裙子里面脱下了她的内裤。笑着回到他的胯下，将她那粉红色的内裤套在了他的肉棒上，非常善解人意地对他轻声说道，“侬就射在这个里厢吧。” \n  \n 　　庄建海那一瞬真是惊呆了。她不是就是光着屁股了吗？ \n  \n 　　好像是要验证给他看，云红竟跨坐到他的腿上，裸露的阴部就直接坐上去，他能隔着裤子清晰地感受到她毛扎扎的阴毛磨着他的大腿。 \n  \n 　　云红搂住他的脖子，红唇轻轻印在他嘴上，慢慢用力压住他，在他的嘴唇上揉擦着，像是邀请他的热吻。被这么揉情的女人搂着接吻，腿上摩擦着她的阴部，肉棒上还套着女性刚刚退下的内裤，一种极其异样的刺激将庄建海的全身包裹住。 \n  \n 　　他两手干脆伸进她的裙子里，直接摸索着她光滑的腿部髋部甚至是小腹部，再往下就是她的浓密的阴毛，在下去就摸到了她的裂缝处。他惊的差点叫出声来。她毫不在意他的侵犯，反而用一手伸进裙子下面再次开始为他手淫，这时肉棒在她的绸质的内裤下面感觉更加美妙了。 \n  \n 　　庄建海彻底陶醉了。他忘情地接受她的热吻，两手在她阴部姿意乱摸，同时享受着她在他肉棒上越来越快的搓动。他一阵颤抖，浓烈的精液勃然而出，全部射在她的内裤之中。那种舒畅的感觉至今还记忆犹新。 \n  \n 　　庄建海每每想到云红脱了内裤为自己手淫的情景，他下面就开始发硬。 \n  \n 　　突然他醒悟出为何赵岚经常要洗内裤，而且有时会一下洗两条甚至三条。这么看来赵岚确是为客人作这种手淫服务了，估计摸过她隐私的男人大概已不记其数了。这样想来，庄建海心中又开始隐隐作疼。 \n  \n 　　他叹息了一声，知道如果赵岚真要去作全套服务，他还是会有很强的心理反应。真是不争气。他在心里暗骂自己。不就是这么回事吗？有什么放不下的。 \n  \n 　　正在这时，路口一对男女向他招手。他心中大喜。今晚生意还真不错，能一晚接到两笔生意的日子越来越少了。 \n  \n 　　在洗手间擦干下体湿漉漉的精液，换上一条新的内裤，赵岚有些疲惫地回到长椅上，等着下一个客人的挑选。 \n  \n 　　一个多小时也未接到新客，长椅上的小姐渐渐多起来，看着墙上的时钟慢慢接近午夜，赵岚越来越失望。 \n  \n 　　看来今晚就只接到那一个客人了。 \n  \n 　　虽说她时不时会有整个晚上接不到一个客人的情形，但她还是很想在回家前能够再做一笔。但午夜已近，看来是没有多大希望了。不知道庄建海今晚生意如何，总不会好到哪去。再这样下去，可能真的得直接到大街上拉客了。那可就太丢人了。她可不像段沪生的老婆那么放得开，经常在回家的路上还能拉住客人打一炮。赵岚无论如何是拉不下那个脸面在大街上对着每个路过的男人调情。 \n  \n 　　正在她胡思乱想之际，一个魁梧的身材风风火火地闯进来。一个响亮的带口音的山东人的声音对着领班就是一通连珠发问。 \n  \n 　　原来是个外地人。以前赵岚打心眼里不愿陪外地客，不过现在她早已不在乎客人是否是外地人了。往往外地人给的小费倒反而多。她摆出她惯常的笑容，对着这个山东人扫来的目光妩媚地一笑。这时的长椅上还有十几个小姐，个个都摆出了最迷人的笑脸，都想争取这个也许是今晚最后一个客人。 \n  \n 　　山东人对着领班说，“有没有上海小姐？我要找个上海小姐。不要外地来的。听人说上海小姐很有风味，我这次是特地来找上海小姐的。” \n  \n 　　赵岚眼睛一亮。她是椅子上不多的上海人之一。领班让她们几个上海小姐站起来，让山东人挑选。山东人有些疑惑地对着她们上下打量了几眼，说道：“没有年轻一点的啦？” \n  \n 　　对他粗鲁的语气赵岚保持着她本质的克制，脸上依然媚笑着，按下心中的不满。长年的职业经验告诉她，要赚钱就得忍耐。 \n  \n 　　果然山东人眼睛盯住了她的乳部，似乎对她的身材非常满意，不等领班回答他就一把抓住了赵岚的胳膊大声说着：“好吧好吧，就是她了。” \n  \n 　　一边说着一边往里面走。 \n  \n 　　在其他几双嫉妒的眼睛下赵岚挽住客人将他向里面引。 \n  \n 　　直率的山东汉子一坐下就将赵岚抱到他粗大的腿上坐着，一手搂着她的脖子，一手开始摸她身子，急不可待的在她身上摸捏玩弄。赵岚后来知道他是刚下飞机，坐了出租就来到这里，早有些等不及的味道。 \n  \n 　　赵岚职业性地娇笑着，开始跟他调情打趣。就像第一个客人一样，这个山东人好像也不太在意这种调情，嘴里嗯嗯啊啊的应着，注意力还都是放在在她身上乱摸的手里，不住地赞叹着她：“上海女人的皮肤都真他奶奶的又白又滑，俺听人说上海人的皮白，都是因为这里的自来水里漂白粉多，是真事儿吗？” \n  \n 　　对他这种憨实的样子，赵岚真的笑了出来，也不答他的问话，只是轻轻将脸凑过去，在他耳畔和颈子上摩挲，对他哈着香气。山东人被她果真的弄得有些迷乱，在她光滑的腿上不停地摸着，嘴上还在唠叨：“你们上海女人的肉可真他奶奶的嫩哎。” \n  \n 　　突然，他问她：“你们这儿有带铺的包厢吗？怎么算钱？俺俩开一间来好好玩玩。”他的问话一下将赵岚惊醒，天啊，他不是要全套服务吧？她的心跳一下子加快起来，想到自己即将要真正做这第一次全套服务，心中立刻慌张起来。 \n  \n 　　未等她回答，山东人将正在另一个桌子边上的老板娘招了过来，问她说，“你们这包厢怎么算钱？” \n  \n 　　老板娘满面春风地走过来，笑嘻嘻地说道：“老板要包包厢啊？按小时包的话一个小时是一百元，小姐的小费您要和她另说。不过，您这位晶晶从不去包厢接客的。要不您等着，我给您再找几个小姐来。” \n  \n 　　“什么？” \n  \n 　　山东人狐疑地看着赵岚，不明白她为何不去包厢接客。 \n  \n 　　赵岚尴尬异常。要不要接？为何不接？对着他疑惑的眼光，赵岚赶紧解释说：“是这样的，进这里的包厢都是要做那种服务的。我从来都是只在外面的素台陪客人喝酒跳舞，从不进包厢陪客，所以……” \n  \n 　　山东人像是明白了这里的规矩。很是惋惜地捏着她的身子说：“你从不在包厢接客？你从不在包厢接客？” \n  \n 　　赵岚突然明白再不抓紧说出来就要失去今天这最后的客人。 \n  \n 　　她涨红了脸，一下子鼓起了勇气，对他低声说道：“如果我陪你去包厢，你付多少钱？” \n  \n 　　山东人看她突然改变主意，大是高兴，立刻就说，“你要多少？” \n  \n 　　“嗯……一个小时，两百。” \n  \n 　　“什么？这么贵？一个小时两百？” \n  \n 　　赵岚的脸更加红了。她怀疑自己叫的价也许太高了。 \n  \n 　　山东人看着默默不语的赵岚，狠狠地说道：“好，好，看在你是第一次，俺就付你两百。两个小时，四百。来全套。如何？” \n  \n 　　见他这么爽快就答应她开出的价钱，她心头惊喜交加，简直有点喜出望外。但想到要陪他两个小时，心中立刻突突地起伏不定。这回可是要来真的了，她紧张的心情就像那第一天来“海市豪”上班时的一模一样。毕竟要跨出这最后的一步，成为一个地地道道妓女了，和她第一次下海做三陪一样，这将是她的人生的另一个最大的转变。 \n  \n 　　迟早得过这一关，像以前一样，会很快适应的。她在心里暗暗安慰自己。想到自己即将跨过这最关键的一步，心中的惴惴不安真是难以形容。早就想好了要面对这一刻，但当这一刻真的到来时，她发现自己好像还是毫无思想准备。 \n  \n 　　正不知该如何往下说，老板娘领着三个小姐走了过来。她们都听见了山东人最后的话。一听说山东人肯出四百，她们三个小姐眼都红了。她们分别拉住他的衣服，都嗲嗲地要陪他。 \n  \n 　　山东人将她们都抖掉摆脱了她们的纠缠，指着赵岚对老板娘说就是她了，让她去开个包房，要两个小时。 \n  \n 　　那三个上海小姐开始在边上冷言冷语地嘲讽起来：“呦，还真格寇勿出伊能卖轧许多。”“勿是说勿卖的吗？我还以为伊是个……”“勿是勿卖的啦，宁家是要卖个好价钱。”“格种宁啊……”“伊格会做啊？全套会勿啦？”“宁家什么勿会呀？侬阿勿要小瞧宁……”她们一边往外走一边你一句我一句的说着，让赵岚听了心里非常难受。平常还都是挺要好的姐妹，真到这时说翻脸就翻脸。 \n  \n 　　突然，老板娘有些为难地对这个山东人说，“哎呀，真不好意思，我们舞厅一点钟就要关门了，我只能给您开一个小时。怎样？” \n  \n 　　山东人有些火了，“什么？你们上海怎么搞的？一点就要关门？在俺们那儿一玩就玩通宵，一点钟才当是开始。” \n  \n 　　“哎呀，您不知道啊，最近市里为了扫黄新出的规定，各娱乐场所一律不准在一点以后营业。我们也是没有办法啊，谁不想挣钱？公安局的半夜真的来查啊，要是抓到我们就完了。” \n  \n 　　赵岚再次感到了人情的冷暖。老板娘说的规定确是实情，但外面大门关上后里面的客人待到很晚的是常有的事。估计今天自己突然同意到包厢里面接客有些激恼了老板娘，现在故意来刁难一下。平时老板娘就一直劝她去包厢接客，让她想开来，现在她真想开了老板娘又不高兴了。 \n  \n 　　山东人真有些火了，“不行，要开就开两个小时，俺不管你们什么时候关门。要不行，俺就带小姐出去。” \n  \n 　　说着他一把拉起赵岚就往外走。 \n  \n 　　赵岚脑子里一片空白，不知该怎么应付此事。四百块啦，要是不接这笔生意庄建海肯定会说自己蠢。这么好的事真是很难碰到。但真要陪他出去？到哪去呢？自己还从未陪客人出过“海市豪”的门，这么半夜了，真要陪他去旅馆吗？ \n  \n 　　犹豫之中赵岚已被这个山东人拉出了舞厅。 \n  \n 　　赵岚还指望老板娘做最后挽留，但她一句话都没说，就眼看着他们走出了大门。", "timestamp": 1635677444, "digest": "3N2rcJBqvcOVjbE-aeE9SkGt488yPoz4eM6-3UVhank", "contributor": "0x83aF5a649B2164F5e51b4F6D7e650426B35665f7"}

"（一）\n\n庄建海在他的面包车前座上换了个姿势，懒洋洋地抬头看着街道上的天空。夜上海的天空是灰亮的，在街旁霓虹灯的映照下不断闪烁着五彩斑斓的色彩。\n\n远处最耀眼的自然是那直指夜空的东方明珠电视塔，被灯光镶成的轮廓在上海几乎每个地方都能看到，是上海人最骄傲的标志性建筑。\n\n他左前方的辉煌的门庭上紫红色的“海市豪”三个字被一串快速闪烁着的彩灯围绕着，在夜空中格外醒目。优雅的慢三的旋律从里面飘出来，使得大街上也充满浪漫的气息。这是一家中等规模的夜总会，也就是目下在上海最常见到的带有许多三陪小姐的歌舞厅。\n\n庄建海的妻子赵岚正在里面做三陪女。他刚刚目送她那婀娜的身影在暮色中消失在舞厅门里。\n\n天色刚刚暗下来，里面的客人还不多。不知她现在是在台前等候客人的挑选，还是已经被某个客人搂在舞厅里随着慢四的节奏摇晃，还是……八成她还坐在台前的长椅上。毕竟她已不很年轻，论身材论姿色都比不上外地来的“打工妹”。\n\n庄建海不再往下想。这样想没有什么好处，这是他早就知道的，只是他还是常常会忍不住去猜想妻子在里面陪客的情景，特别是最近这两周，他的思路更是不自觉得往这方面想。\n\n赵岚在“海市豪”做三陪已有两年多了，庄建海早已走过了那种一想到妻子在别人怀中卖笑就发酸的心里历程。“绿帽情结”，这是他总结出的词汇，是刚出道的新手才会有的。他为自己能很快就能潇洒对待这事而骄傲。这也是一种成熟，一种人生的境界。\n\n他能坦然面对妻子卖笑不卖身，陪客人聊天喝酒跳舞。但是，他如何能真正面对她即将跨出的最后一步——卖淫？\n\n他自己也说不清楚自己会是个什么感受。既然他们已经决定要走这一步，也许今晚赵岚就可能……他真不愿再去想这些。他们没有选择——赵岚是这么说的，他心里也是这么想的。\n\n上海是个“笑贫不笑娼”的地方。这种事越来越司空见惯。其实不光是上海，全国各地又有哪个地方不如此？\n\n他认识的十几个开面包车的，有一小半的妻子都在歌舞厅里做三陪。不做的老婆不是太老就是太丑，可以说能做的几乎都在做了。有什么丢脸的？不都是这样吗？真有钱的也不开这种车了。他们还不就是为了挣钱？谁还在乎面子？\n\n不过真正卖身的他只知道两个。毕竟陪客人过夜和陪客人跳舞的差别太大了。按他们的说法，在舞厅里三陪只是让人得些手脚便宜，但要是全卖了，就便宜全被人占了。这个便宜能挣得回来吗？\n\n对于三陪他以前是很看得开的。老婆被人搂着跳舞后身子也不损失什么。早年他追上她之前她在学校的舞场里还不是被许多人搂过？为此他没少劝过和他一同下岗的小吴。小吴每天等老婆时总是唉声叹气，埋怨自己没用，只能让老婆干这三陪。\n\n“侬哪能格么想勿通？勿就是挣钞票吗？有啥想勿通的？宁家占侬老婆格些么手头便宜，侬占伊皮夹子里钞票便宜，啥宁赚啥宁呀？侬看宁家段沪生，老婆拉客人出来都是上伊开的车，赚两份子钞票，那个叫精呃。”\n\n干这行就得这么想，阿Q 就阿Q 吧，现在还有什么地方能挣到钱呢？他们可都是太缺钱了。下岗津贴区区可数，糊口也可以马虎对付。但厂里搞住房改革，现在他们住的房子必须要从厂里买下来，虽说只是四万元优惠价，这对他们来说可是一笔巨大的开销。又加上去年为了让儿子上教学质量最好的实验初中要交三万元，他们将家里全部的血汗存款全部花完，还借了很大的债才能凑够。\n\n想到儿子，他心中油然升起一股骄傲。他儿子没有辜负他的期望，学习成绩一路直上，下学期肯定要升入重点班：重点中学的重点班，这怎能不让他感到骄傲？\n\n当然，进重点班还要交八千块，现在这个社会到处都要钱，学校当然也不例外。但是，他们夫妻双双下岗，这八千又是一笔太大的数字，再加上未还完的债，他还想赞钱买一辆桑塔那跑出租。这面包车是租来的，每天付近乎一半以上的收入作租金实在是太亏了，而且上面政策时紧时松，谁知道什么时候这种面包车就会全面取缔。他们这么开也是不怎么合法。但这钱，唉……\n\n正像赵岚说的，他们没有选择。虽然这几年生活质量是好了不少，不愁吃不愁穿的，但真要过好日子，没有钱哪成？而且现在他们也都不年轻了，还能这么没日没夜地挣几年？\n\n这时又有一拨男人进去，都是西装革履人模人样，但其实都不是好东西。庄在心里暗骂几句操你们娘的，以换点心里平衡。不过骂归骂，庄建海还是希望舞厅生意兴隆，而且也希望赵岚被男人选中。坐冷板凳等待的滋味肯定不好受，她们没有小费就赚不到什么钱。\n\n他们中会不会有哪个人会挑中赵岚？他对这群人多看了几眼，立刻有点心虚地转过头，向远处的东方明珠电视塔望去。灯火辉煌的电视塔在夜空中直指云霄，背后映忖着浦东美丽的夜景，组成一副艳丽的上海夜色。\n\n这是他为之骄傲的上海。一想到这几年浦东的快速发展的巨大成就他就会无比自豪和骄傲。若不是赶上上海这几年的大发展，他们的生意也不会做到今天。\n\n他了口气，启动了车子，向淮海路慢慢开去。\n\n“海市豪”里的赵岚并未被那群新进来的男人们挑中。她暗然无语，心中无限惆怅。坐在椅子上的姐妹们其实都在互相较着劲，每当客人进来时都用自己最迷人最媚力的眼光去挑痳他们。能被先选中就像是证明自己的姿色胜过别的女人的一项奖状。\n\n几个被挑中的小姐挽着各自客人的胳膊娇媚地伏在他们身上进入内间的舞厅，身后留下一片莺声笑语在屋里回荡。\n\n赵岚的姿色已经比不过年轻的外来妹和大三大四的在校大学生了，成群结队来的客人都不喜欢挑她。而这种结队来的客人往往是最慷慨的，因为一般他们都是被招待来玩的，而且很可能会用公款付帐，给小费时眼都不眨一下。\n\n这时又进来一个单身的客人。赵岚打起精神，温柔地微笑着，现出非常端庄淑女和体贴温柔的样子。\n\n赵岚不像那些年轻的小姐，她们要么打扮得花枝招展，浓妆艳抹，用轻佻诱惑的形象来吸引客人，要么就故意淡妆，做出天真清纯的青春女学生模样，用娇情羞涩的可爱形象来招徕客人。赵岚走的是另一路子，她既不故意骚情，也不故作清纯，而是选择正派成熟女人的形象。这也是没有办法的选择，她实在没有多少青春的资本。\n\n但她还是比较成功的，在“海市豪”里算是有些固定客户的。不少中年男人就喜欢专门挑选她这样体贴温馨的成熟妇人，按他们的话来讲，就是受不了那帮骚货的俗气，也不喜欢娇柔造作的假纯情。\n\n在又过了几批客人后来了一位中年男子，看上去还算正派，在长椅上的小姐们脸上和身上扫过一遍后终于用手指向了赵岚。\n\n一阵暗喜，赵岚满脸微笑着迎接住客人，很老练地挽住他的胳膊，像是招待熟人一样将他拉向里面的舞厅。她温柔地笑着，将胸部小心地贴到他的胳膊上，一面走一面柔声地问候奉承着他。\n\n在舞厅一角的双人沙发上并排坐定，赵岚用柔和的语调招待他，开始缠绵地和他套近乎，并主动将他的手拉到自己肩上让他搂住她的颈子。\n\n搂着她的中年男人一上来就不客气地用手隔着她的衣服在她的乳房上捏了几下。她心下一边叹息又遇到一个色场老手，一边媚笑着扭开身子和他应承。现在生意是越来越难作了，男人们个个都圆滑无比，不让他们占许多便宜是不可能的了。\n\n唉，可怜自己的丈夫还不知道现在的三陪女可不是像以前那样简单地陪客人聊天喝酒跳舞。因为三陪女的数量越来越多，客人们在她们身上也就越来越放肆，现在身上什么地方都可以摸了。供过于求，就成了买方市场，色情业也不例外。你不愿作还有许多人求之不得呢。\n\n舞厅周围都是成双成对的男女们，几乎没有例外地，男人们对着各自的女人调戏挑痳，而小姐们都是强颜欢笑曲意奉承。在这里能得到男人的欢心是挣小费的唯一手段，以前那种清高的姿态再也行不通了，她已很久没有遇到过那种只是坐着聊天的拘谨客人。\n\n赵岚身旁的男人一手揽在她的脖子上，另一手就摸着她裙下的大腿。她用手护住大腿上部，尽量延阻着男人的进犯，一边举着酒杯不停的哄着这个男人喝酒，希望将他弄得醉一点好容易周旋。\n\n这个男人对赵岚的调情不是很感兴趣，他更多的兴趣就是在她身上乱摸乱捏。这样的男人最难对付。\n\n舞曲起来，他们搂到舞厅的中央开始跳舞。\n\n其实这根本不叫跳舞，而是站在那里，女人两手搂住男人的脖子，被男人搂着随意地晃动。女人的手因无法再用来阻挡男人的侵犯，女人的身体成了男人们随意品玩的对象。跳这种姿势的舞成了男人占女人便宜的最佳方式。\n\n赵岚搂着的男人开始在她的身上用力抚摸着，像是要透过她的裙子摸透她的肌肤。他带有烟味和酒味的嘴追她的嘴唇，身子紧紧地贴在她的胸部。她有意娇笑着摇着头躲避着他的嘴，似娇似嗔地挑痳着他的情欲，不时地故意让他得逞，容许他的嘴在她双唇边上占些便宜。\n\n这是她长时间总结出来的技巧。不能让男人一次吻个够，而是一点点地让他得些便宜，这样可以最大地挑痳起男人对她的情欲，而且又能让男人长时间的保持对她的兴趣。\n\n她的耳边被男人粗重的喘息弄得稣痒无比，耳环也被他用舌头挑起。她嘤笑着转过头，脸蛋划过他的舌尖，令她恶心的口水在她精心化装的脸上留下一道湿痕。她将脸埋进他的胸膛。这是最有效地躲避男人嘴巴的骚扰而又不会太激怒客人的方式。\n\n男人的双手移到她的前胸，手伸进她的吊带裙在她的乳罩上用手指旋转着捏揉她的乳尖。虽然他的动作还算温柔体贴，她身体还是做出了强烈的反应。这里是她最敏感的部位。\n\n她忍耐着任他轻薄，心中想起在开着面包车的丈夫，还一直坚持要她不陪客人做出格的事——就是只卖笑不卖淫。\n\n其实什么是出格什么是不出格？被男人伸进衣服摸乳房算不算？摸阴部呢？连手指都插进去呢？还不算越过了底线出了格？若从脱衣服来看，客人有时会将她的内裤从裙子里扒下来。这算不算出格？若以射不射精为界线，那她用手帮客人手淫射精，还算不算出格呢？这些已经是三陪的基本格式了，根本不是她能左右得了的。\n\n她在舞厅里能坚持的最后的底线，就是不让客人插入体内交媾。其他怎么互相摸都可以。有一回客人甚至将龟头放到了她阴唇上摩擦着往里拱，同时让她帮他手淫。虽说未让他最后进入，但这和交媾差别又有多少？\n\n她一直不让丈夫知道这种事。她不知道他要是知道了她们三陪的实际情形会怎么反应。\n\n赵岚曾试探性地对庄建海说，她们这些上了三十几的三陪女，如果还坚持在舞厅只是清陪，是非常难再混下去了。客人给的坐台费越来越少，都要求来点真的。她举出了好几个姐妹，都开始陪客人在包厢里做全陪挣更多的钱，或干脆就和客人出去。\n\n他的反应不是非常排斥。但他还是坚持她要保持自己的尊严和纯洁。他说，“侬是晓得的，我是勿在意格种事情，勿就格么回事？但侬跟各种客人做我实在不放心。啥宁晓得他们有没有传泄病？”\n\n她也实在无言以对。她相信安全问题决不是他最关注的，他反对的原因根本上还是他“在意”那事。但他们都不愿深究这一点，都留在心底心照不宣。她其实很感激他对她的这种态度。\n\n但是，昨夜他们夫妻又作了一次长谈。出乎她的意料，他竟然同意了她可以陪客做那事，也就是同意了自己可以卖淫，只要客人给钱给的还可以，她可以自己看着办。\n\n这可是赤裸裸的卖淫啊。这样她的三陪的性质可就彻底变了。虽说她也很想挣那个钱，但毕竟从未让客人真的干过，心中一想到那事就非常紧张。真要让那些个大大小小的硬家伙插入体内啊。这跟和自己丈夫做那事总会不一样吧？\n\n搂着她的男人将她贴紧到他的身上，两手玩弄起她的臀部，隔着她的裙子和内裤慢慢揉捏着。她能感到他的阳具已经膨胀起来，隔着衣服顶在了她的下体附近。\n\n这人会不会要求做那事？看他对她的身体这么感兴趣，也许会的。\n\n想到这赵岚心中一阵慌张发毛。\n\n庄建海一边慢慢开着车，一边盯着街道上的每一对男女，寻找潜在的客户。\n\n他开的面包车不是一般的出租车，不是简单的那种拉客人从一个地方到另一个地方的交通工具。他的面包车后厢，是一个经过改装的别致的床铺，他真正的生意，其实就是拉妓女和嫖客在车后厢里干那事。\n\n许多嫖客其实就只需要一个隐蔽的地方和妓女搞，到旅店开个按小时算的房间要比在歌舞厅开包厢便宜。但更便宜的，还是租这种面包车，既可以按小时算，也可以一边开一边搞，搞到好就停车按里程算。而且还可以让车开到客人想要去的地方，路上的时间可以用来玩女人，既经济，又实惠。一些客人会让他停在隐蔽处，搞完了再走。但更多的客人发现在摇晃的车中做爱非常浪漫。\n\n这主意不是他最先想出来的。但他是最快加入这种生意的人之一。在上海头脑不活洛可不行。\n\n在不远的街口庄建海接到了一笔生意。一个大学生模样的青年搭上了一个妖冶流莺，上了他的车。\n\n他心中轻松起来。至少今晚不会白耗油了。随着开这种面包车的人数的增多，他的生意越来越不如以前，常常出现整晚放空车的情形。\n\n他将后视镜扭开，这是在向客人表明他不会偷看。其实他的后视镜还是会有一个拐角将后面全部反射到，他只要稍稍抬抬头就可看到后面的春光。\n\n男人的好奇心总是很大的，特别是这样的西洋景。不过庄建海也不是每次都偷看。毕竟看得多了也就没什么意思了，几乎总是千篇一律，按他的话来说，不就是两团肉在车上晃来晃去吗？\n\n这个青年好像经验不多，一上车就急猴猴的将女的裙子脱掉搂住乱摸，然后自己脱光后很快又将她的内裤扒掉，开始趴上去就嗯嗯呀呀干起来。\n\n庄建海知道如何在车子每一次经过路灯下时恰到好处地扫两眼后视镜。但今天他没有多大的兴趣，只是瞄了一两眼。后面两个裸露的肉体纠缠在一起，在霓虹灯下蠕动着，对他来说都是些老镜头，了无新意。\n\n他将车子开在最省油的一个慢速度，无聊地将眼光投向远处的江边夜景。现在他正沿着外滩向南悠悠地驶着，黄浦江对岸的夜景不断在障碍物间闪现。\n\n赵岚今晚也会被人这样搞吗？他的思路又飞到妻子身上，脑海里映出赵岚雪白的肉体被陌生男人搂着的幻觉。一想到此他的心就非常乱。赵岚刚去作三陪时他也是这种心情。但他很快就克服了那种情绪。他相信这次也会如此。\n\n不就是插来插去吗？在舞厅赵岚的身子可不是早就被摸透了？\n\n他知道他不该这么去想。但两周前他平生第一次有机会泡小姐，才惊讶地发现他以前对三陪的了解是多么落后。\n\n老实本份的他虽然一直在各个夜总会门口拉客，但还从未进过舞厅叫过小姐，居然不清楚里面三陪现在到底陪到什么程度了，也不知道舞厅里的小包厢里到底是怎么一回事，还以为那里只是唱卡拉OK的地方。\n\n他为自己一直如此天真而感到可笑。\n\n那是两个星期前从美国纽约回来探亲的老同学路过上海时来看他，他为了显示自己的好客带着老同学逛了一次舞厅。\n\n从纽约来的同学老王至今还未娶上媳妇，庄建海不禁暗暗生出一丝优越感。\n\n当年自己实在不是考托考G 的料，未能赶上出国的热潮。不过，老王这么多年在国外，混的也不过如此。在庄看来，他从骨子里透的都是土气。要是不知道他的底细，谁见了都会以为他是刚从哪个县城来的。\n\n上海人最瞧不起的就是土气。\n\n庄建海那天特地歇业不开车了，带老王到上海的南京路外滩转转。老王有十来年没回上海看看了，这回可是大开眼界。那一栋栋新建的摩天大楼，那高架人行桥跨江大桥江底隧道，无不让老王看得眼化缭乱。他不断地感慨上海的变化太大了。\n\n庄建海为此非常自豪。是的，上海这几年的建设让全世界都为之震惊。\n\n夜色下的上海更是让老王大开眼界。上海这个花花世界比之纽约这样的世界大城市可以说是毫不逊色。这是老王打心眼里承认的。\n\n他请老王到城皇庙去吃各种小吃。这是最省钱的办法，稍稍像样点的餐厅都是死贵。\n\n果然老王对小吃街上的众多的食物大赞不已。早就听说外国人的吃是很差劲的，哪能和中国的饮食文化相比。这里吃的不仅花样繁多，而且极其便宜，都是下岗工人开的小本生意，却让老王这样从纽约来的人留连忘返。\n\n这让庄建海非常开心。花钱少办事好，是上海人最精明的地方。\n\n吃过晚饭后庄准备带老王见识见识上海的夜总会。他从老王每次路过夜总会闪烁的霓虹灯时看到外面美女的招牌的眼神里，就知道老王心里在想什么。干他这行察言观色是他的吃饭本领。他很能理解老王。毕竟这么大年纪了，还没有过女人。在美国那地方，爱滋病泛滥，估计他那种老实巴交的人，也不敢乱找妓女。\n\n老王告诉庄建海，在纽约没有三陪。这让庄建海惊讶无比。难怪纽约来的也这么土。他真高兴当年没盲目地去凑出国的热闹。\n\n那更要带老王见识见识上海的夜总会了，即使所费不菲，也要让老王开开眼界。而且，上海的夜生活最具特色也最能拿得出手的，不就是这大大小小遍布全城的歌舞厅吗？\n\n他将老王带到一个叫“新得来”的歌舞厅。他当然从未来过，但凭他经常路过这里的感觉，这里的档次和“海市豪”应该差不多。他对老王说这里的小姐服务得很到位，说这话时显出的老矩连他自己都有点不安，俨然他真是上海歌舞厅的常客。不过上海随便哪个歌舞厅对老王来说都是非常新鲜，不是他在纽约待的土地方能见得到的。\n\n不知为何跟老王在一起他总是常常有种优越的感觉。他越来越觉得上海真是个魅力无穷的世界级大城市，他为自己是上海人感到非常骄傲。\n\n赵岚已陪这个客人跳了好几曲了，看来这个男人今晚会全泡在她身上。这个男人据他自己说是个什么处长，官虽不大但有些小权，今晚他对她好像很满意，看来今天自己收获不会小。说不定他还会用公款付帐呢？谁知道。\n\n能被这个男人包下来，让她有些骄傲。\n\n在这里她的姿色实在不算上等，年轻的外来妹个个都很出众，让她非常嫉妒。但她也有她的媚力，这是成熟女人才有的媚力。而且她有经验。她知道如何讨客人的欢心。\n\n上海女人的“嗲”是全国闻名的。这在“海市豪”里非常明显。她们几个上海本地的三陪女论姿色都比不过外地来的“乡屋”女人，但她们却总是能得到许多回头客的亲咪，这和她们的素质是分不开的。\n\n现在他们搂抱着挤在沙发一角。不远处还有两对男女都搂在一堆，都旁若无人地做着很大胆的亲密动作，其中一个小姐的带裙的带被拉到了胳膊上，没有穿胸罩的双乳几乎就全部裸露出来。另一个女人的裙子被摞起来，露出刺眼的白色内裤。\n\n男人的大手开始沿着赵岚的裙子里向上摸索，她已不能再阻止他的侵犯了，这样的客人她可不愿得罪。她有些半真半假地喘着气，用脸在他脸上若即若离地蹭着，在他每一次进犯时都要半推半就地假意抗拒着，一手虚抓着他伸进裙内的大手，另一只手按住裙子另一边，两腿紧紧地并住。\n\n她的娇羞其实鼓励了他的进一步的动作。他开始隔着她的内裤摸着她的最隐秘的部位，手指头摸出了阴缝的位置，上下搓揉。\n\n她一边夸张地啊啊地呻吟着，一边用手摸到男人的下体，在他挺立的阳具上隔着裤子温柔地相应搓揉。她从他粗重的喘息声中知道自己的动作在起作用，更加卖力地用手刺激他的下体，并用嘴在他脸上讨好地亲着。\n\n他的手指不安分地插入她的内裤，挑摸着她的阴毛。她扭动了几下身体，并不打算立刻阻止他的侵犯。\n\n他越发起劲，手指更深入到她的内裤，直接摸到了她的业已充血的阴唇。她很高兴自己的下体已经湿润，男人总是喜欢看到女人在他们的玩弄下身体产生反应。\n\n该是阻止他的时候了。得让他浅尝即止，不能让他太容易就得到一切，否则很难长时间让他保持兴趣。她娇嗔地推开他的手，将一条腿交叉到他的腿上，既保持了亲密的接触，又有效地护住自己的隐私部位。同时她两手搂住他的脖子，开始对他嗲声嗲气的假意埋怨着。\n\n这个男人显然是个中老手，对她的挑痳顺势而上，一把将她搂进怀里，在她嘴上一阵狂亲。她未能躲过这次袭击，干脆让他占尽便宜，然后大喘着气娇嗔地推开他，嘴里不住地说着“要死人了要死人了”。\n\n他当然不会就此放过她。他一把将她拉起来，让她完全跨坐到他的双腿上，拉住她的双臂，让她勾回到他的脖子，开始用两手攻击她的上半身。他的手扒下她裙子的带，让带子挂到她的胳膊上，胸部露出她乳白色的胸罩。挺立的双峰在丝布中若隐若现。\n\n他抱紧她，不让她后撤，开始用嘴压在乳罩上亲吻。\n\n她啊啊地低叫着，这时她的叫声大部份是出于身体的本能反应。不知为什么，她的乳房在结婚了这么多年后仍然非常敏感。这也是她总是坚持戴乳罩的原因。当然戴乳罩是不可能阻止多少男人的进攻的。经常会有客人要求她主动将乳罩去掉。不过这终归多给了她一个周旋的筹码，而且确实有客人曾对她说戴乳罩的女人更有性感，更能挑痳人。\n\n现在这个男人不慌不忙地用嘴在她胸部的乳罩上摩擦着，两个手却摸到了她的背后。她将脸抵着他的头发，抵御着胸部传来的刺激。每一次客人玩弄她的乳房时都是她最难熬的时刻，可恨的是几乎每一个客人都对她的乳房感兴趣，也不知是不是她的胸部特别丰满的原因，还是女人的这个部位就是对男人有无穷的吸引力。\n\n不管她多么讨厌客人玩她的乳房，她现在都得忍耐了。刚才跳舞时她已多次利用乐曲扭动身子躲避他的狎玩，再躲避他恐怕真会让他不高兴了。\n\n他果然是个玩弄女人的老手。他两只手在她背后隔着她的裙子就解开了她胸罩的扣子，他再用双唇拱开已经松动的乳罩，直接用嘴吻在了她胸部上的肉体。\n\n强烈的刺激让她有些受不了。但他的双手按在她的背部，逃是逃不掉了。她两手从他脖子上撤回来，紧紧捂住要脱落的胸罩，小心地护住乳头部位，留下一小半乳房让他得些便宜。她开始扭动起身子，向前压住他的头。他的嘴唇却紧紧地附在她胸部周围，任她如何扭动也摆脱不了。她叹息着不得不放弃，任他在她的乳房上直接用嘴吻弄，只是每次他快碰到她的乳尖时才猛地用劲摆脱。\n\n舞曲响起，她再次邀他去跳舞。但他却从她的乳部抬起头说：“勿跳了，就格么玩好了。”她有些紧张。这样玩下去他说不定就会要求来真的。她已碰到许多次这样的情形。以前她总是简单地加以拒绝。一般男人不会特别不高兴，顶多只是额外的小费给的少。\n\n但今天呢？真要答应他作那事？\n\n想到要将整个身子彻底开放让这个人进入，从而跨过这一道每个女人都极其珍惜的最后底线，她心中突然慌张极了。\n\n她要跟他怎么开口讲价？要二百块？还是一百？至少要八十。打一炮还是玩一个小时？外面的野鸡也要五十块一小时呢。就跟他说自己是第一次，这倒不是骗他，他可以去老板那里打听。反正少于八十就不干。\n\n她有点后悔昨天没有让庄建海给她定个确切的价钱。\n\n胡思乱想之中她见到他一手伸到被她裙子盖住的裤子拉开他自己裤子的拉链。看来他已到了非要发泄体内聚集起来的性欲不可的地步。\n\n这正是该说的时候了。她轻轻地用手移开裙子，再盖住他的裤子咧开的口子，温柔地对他说，这里不是做这事的地方。如果他愿意，她可以陪他去包厢。\n\n他有些怒气地说，为什么不可以？又不怕被人看见。\n\n说着，他撩起她的裙子，将她的一只手按到裙下挺挺的阳具上，暧昧地冲着她淫笑，两手摩挲着她的雪白的大腿。原来他连内裤都没穿，早就准备好要让小姐方便帮他手淫。\n\n她知道他只想要她帮他在这里打手枪，舍不得花包厢的钱。心中暗骂一声小气鬼，但想到自己不会立刻就跨过那卖淫的最后防线，虽然这只是暂时的延缓，心里倒像是一块石头落了地。他真要作那事她反而要紧张了。\n\n她扭捏了几下，故意羞涩地将裙子盖住他的整个下体，手伸进去开始轻轻地摸着他的肉棒，虚虚地握住，慢慢套弄。\n\n他的嘴吻住她的双唇。\n\n （二）\n\n车厢后面的喘息声越来越重，庄建海能感到本来平稳的车子在行驶中有些不易察觉的抖动。他轻蔑地笑了一下，后面的年轻人好像没有弄多久就不行了，车子这才刚刚开出外滩。\n\n这种男女之事对他来说真像是家常便饭，几乎每天都这么在他眼皮底下发生。这也是他对此很看得开的原因。他相信自己是不在乎赵岚被人这样玩的。但……能捞回便宜吗？如果挣的不多，还不如不做。这是他反覆对赵岚说的。他坚信世上每件事都有个价钱。\n\n一想起那次他陪老王去逛夜总会的情形，他就对她现在挣的很不满意。都被玩成这样了，才这几个钱，还不如讲开来干真的来钱。\n\n这也是他为什么同意让赵岚对要求来全程的客人看情形办的原因。当然他不会这么同她讲。他对她说的，就是“要是有人愿作冤大头，不宰白不宰。”\n\n他不明白自己为何一直未能洒脱到看出这一点。真是太幼稚了，看人家段沪生那才是精明。段的老婆约了客人出来，都要先CALL段沪生。要是段沪生的车还空着，就可以挣个双份。那个潇洒。\n\n想起段沪生老婆挽着男人扭动屁股的作做姿态，他又回忆起那次在“新得来”里坐在他腿上的女人肉体——那也是个上海女人。\n\n他只是偶然地选上了个上海女人。他对老王吹嘘说他是有眼光的。事后他自己也觉得自己有品味。\n\n那天老王一进门就被一排小姐痳得眼都直了，但庄建海是见过世面的。他看到那些小姐搔首弄姿的样子，竟一点不为所动，毕竟自己就是吃这行饭的，看来自己还真像个老手。他对那些过于轻佻的女人比较反感，很自然就挑了一个还算端庄的成熟女人。而且她的皮肤真是白，很是让他赏心悦目，跟赵岚的皮肤比起来还要白。\n\n他也许选她时的心理在不知不觉中有点受了赵岚的影响？\n\n当他后来发现她是货真价实的上海女人时，他为自己的眼光感到非常高兴。他后来对老王吹说，这个年头舞厅里多的是外地小姐，但他一眼就能看出谁是真正的上海人。\n\n老王就不行了，被一个妖艳的女人迷住。据老王后来说，他真受不了那个女人。他说这话时满脸都是口红印子。不过庄建海知道这不是老王的心里话。他能看出来老王还是对那个女人非常受用的。\n\n陪庄建海的小姐叫云红。真是俗气的名字。但也没办法。现在的小姐都取俗气的名字。赵岚在舞厅里叫的是什么名字？他居然还一直不知道。好像叫什么晶晶？还是筝筝？\n\n不知为何被这个女人搂着胳膊总是让他想到自己的老婆。也许是第一次在外面玩女人，所以有些心虚？他陪老王出来赵岚是知道的，只是来舞厅没有对她讲。庄建海倒不是因怕老婆而不敢讲。和许多上海男人不同，他从来就不是个妻管严。庄建海未将这次逛舞厅告诉赵岚，是因为他事前根本就没计划来这里花这冤枉钱。\n\n他相信赵岚绝对会理解的。毕竟人家老王是远道而来，又从未见识过上海的夜总会，带他去一次也不就是几百块钱，几个晚上也就挣回来了。上海人从来就不是小气的人。该花钱的地方上海人从来就是很大方的，只是因为上海人花钱花得比较精明，让许多人误以为是小气。\n\n不过事后他也未对赵岚提这事，不是不敢提，而是另一个原因了。\n\n在他看来，在歌舞厅里花钱基本上就是作冤大头。不说那些贵的出奇的饮料，点个歌扯开嗓子让其他人难受自己发泄倒也罢了，但被女人假心假意地挑痳几下就要给小费，这是他怎么也不愿接受的。谁不知道那些小姐的甜言蜜语都是假的？搂着小姐跳舞？连搂自己的老婆跳舞都没兴趣了。都是过来人了，还不就这么回事？\n\n他事后没跟赵岚讲这次经历，实在是因为这次经历还真是出乎他的预料。可以说让他大吃一惊。虽然他们在那里只待了很短的时间，却是个地地道道的销魂的夜晚，让他终身难忘。\n\n他还记得大厅里面在天花板上的昏暗的旋转彩灯映照下的诡秘的男男女女。他的脑海里渐渐清晰地回忆起那天的几乎每一个情节。\n\n云红将他带到里面，他马上就被舞池里几对男女的“出格”的“舞姿”惊呆了。这是个什么野路子歌舞厅？\n\n一个男人撩起舞伴裙子，将大腿在她的内裤上一遍遍的摩擦，就连毫无音乐素养的庄建海都看出来那腿的动作根本就不合节拍，纯粹就是占小姐的便宜。另一个男人的手竟插入女方的内裤里直接占她的屁股的便宜，嘴巴还在对着她的嘴猛烈缠绵的热吻。赵岚不是说客人一般是不许直接亲嘴的吗？\n\n而另一个男人的举动就更让他震惊：他嘴巴竟然含住小姐从脱落的带裙里裸露的乳头，脸在她的胸部揉压着。\n\n而这些小姐好像对这些男人的出格举动毫不在意，任他们随意施为。有的小姐还主动用身子招引男人的亲薄。这哪里还是在跳舞？\n\n庄建海无法将这样的画面和他记忆里的男女跳舞形象联系到一起。他原以为搂紧了跳贴面舞就是最过份的了。\n\n台上两个穿着极少的少女还跳着撩人的劲舞。她们的动作几乎就是对男人的挑痳. 连他自认为很是见过世面的人也大为心跳。\n\n他一度以为自己走错了地方。但既然进来了，而且对老王暗示过自己常来这里，总不好就退出去。而且几十块钱的门票估计也不容易就要回来。\n\n那时的老王好像已经血脉喷涨了，眼里射出来的都是欲火。\n\n看到老王的样子，庄建海反而镇定下来。既来之则安之。自己又不是没见过男女搞过？跳跳艳舞有什么大惊小怪的？\n\n不过他心中翻腾的，不是这些男女的出格动作，而是想到了赵岚。因为这里跳舞的男人在女人身上毫无例外地大占便宜到了过份的地步。难道赵岚也被人这么玩弄？还是这里是个很不正规的舞厅？\n\n当他们坐到角落里的沙发上时，他才又发现在昏暗的沙发上坐着的男女的动作比之舞池里的人还要更加不堪入目。\n\n未等他仔细看清楚周围男女的情形，云红温柔的嘴已经凑了上来，在他腮帮子上娇声地左一个先生右一个老板，还对他用上海话说“侬勿常来吧？”\n\n幸亏她的话音很小，他肯定老王没听见，否则真会让他难堪。老王那时已被那个叫倩英的骚女人搂在脖子上正在手足无措。\n\n庄建海还真被云红贴上来的身体上散发出的刺激的香味有点弄得神魂颠倒了。这对他来说还是从未有过的。经常在他后车厢里的女人的香味都很浓，但这一次女人的肉体是主动地贴在了他的肩膀上，他胳膊动一动就能碰到她的乳房。\n\n他的惊愕是短暂的。虽说是第一次真正和一个小姐贴在一起，一想到他来这里就是要花钱的，不玩白不玩，他就慢慢冷静下来。什么样的小姐自己没有见过？自己的老婆就是小姐，还不是经常搂？\n\n后来他开始慢慢适应，大胆地伸开手臂，将那个送上来的诱人的肉体搂住。嘴里还对着对面的倩英说道，“伊可是从纽约来的，侬要好好招待招待”。一副十足的老手派头。\n\n他身上的云红也哎吆吆地一副惊讶的神情，好像更加热情地将身子贴紧到他的怀里。这让他非常开心。他不再麻木，在云红将他的手往她颈子下移动时趁势开始往云红的雪白的胸部上摸起来。他本以为她必定会娇柔地躲避一番，但他却惊讶地发现她竟主动地将他的手引向乳罩里面，同时还讨好地用嘴亲他的腮帮。\n\n他暗自赞叹，果然这里的小姐的服务很到位，对老王吹的牛还被他蒙对了。他心中很是快慰。\n\n当他摸入她乳罩里柔软的乳房上时，他的脸不自觉地红起来，竟有些不忍往下摸。毕竟还是他第一次这么摸一个陌生女人的乳房，下体竟开始蠢蠢欲动起来。\n\n云红的手也在他的身上随意地游走，从他的上身摸向他的大腿，再摸向他的大腿根部。她的手有意无意地触摸着他的阴部。\n\n他的下体立刻翘了起来。这么快就来如此刺激的动作，大大出乎他的意料。云红的手更是有意无意地在他敏感处撩拨，鼓起来的阴部被这个陌生女人摸到让他很是尴尬。\n\n他忽然想到，自己的老婆是否现在也正在如此这般地服务别的男人？心中竟呼的生出一股醋意——那种他很久以前才有过的酸溜溜的感觉。\n\n他手下再也不客气，开始在她的乳房上更加大胆地揉捏起来。她的乳罩只罩住了她乳房的一半多一点，而且是松垮地搭在上面，他甚至能很容易地在里面摸到她的乳尖。\n\n他后来才发现她的乳罩扣子不知何时已经解开了，乳罩在带裙里形同虚设。她在他的揉捏下似乎疼痛地呻吟起来，反倒让他有些怜意，手不得不停下来。\n\n她对他的好心似乎很感动，主动将他的手按在自己乳房上，好像是在表示你随便玩好了。在这样的女人身上乱摸让他大感刺激。他已很久没这么摸过女人的乳房了，其实赵岚就从未这么让他随意摸过，稍微碰几下她就要大叫难受。现在就不一样了，云红可以任他尽情的摸玩。他几乎就是将她整个的乳房都捏在手里。\n\n难道现在的三陪就是这样可以任客人在小姐身上乱摸？看到周围男男女女极其出格的淫乱场面，庄建海想到的还是正在“海市豪”陪客的妻子赵岚。\n\n这个亏吃的可是太大了。他万万没想到赵岚现在从事的三陪已变成如此露骨。这比直接卖淫又好到哪里？可赚的钱却不成比例，难怪赵岚几次三番地说想接全程服务的客。\n\n对面的倩英横坐在老王的大腿上，勾着他的脖子，不知在低声地说着什么，嘴巴不时地磨蹭着他的脸，一副娇情的样子，将老王痳得晕晕呼呼。\n\n台上出现一个穿着俗气的女人，开始在迪斯科的强劲旋律下扭动身子，并开始一件件脱去遮在身上的衣物。那真是一个极其淫糜的气氛。庄建海在一个多月后还能记住其中的许多感受的细节，特别清晰的是云红雪白光滑的皮肤在手里揉捏的那种销魂感觉。\n\n后面车厢里的乘客的声音将他从回忆中惊醒。他们玩够了开始一边穿衣服一边在朦浓的昏暗中结帐。女人的上半身还裸露在幽暗的车厢里。\n\n赵岚胯坐在男人的腿上，一手搂着他的脖子，另一手在他的阴茎上的加快了套弄的速度。她能从客人的喘息声中知道客人会有何种需要。男人将嘴张开对着她的双唇亲吻，好像要吸尽唇她嘴唇上的口红。她慢慢张开嘴唇，让他更尽兴地热烈对吻。\n\n以前她是从不让客人直接接吻她的嘴的，体液的接触总是让她厌恶。但现在这种接吻已是家常便饭，一个晚上她要被这么吻数十次。有时还被迫接受法式亲吻，让客人的舌头在嘴里搅乎，或者让客人将她的舌头含进嘴里。最讨厌的是客人嘴对嘴地逼她喝酒，那种受辱的感受非常强烈。\n\n男人的口腔带着浓厚的烟酒味，对受惯了的赵岚来说已不再那么难以忍受。让她难以忍受的，还是他在她乳房上的双手给她带来强烈的刺激。他早已拉下她的乳罩，两手完全自由地在她的乳房上揉捏把玩。为了摆脱这种玩弄，只能想法尽快让他泄欲。\n\n她用手亲捏他阴茎上的包皮，上下快速搓动着，增强的刺激让他对着她的嘴更大地喘息。她手里已沾上了从他阴茎里渗出的一丝液体，她知道让他达到高潮还要加把劲。\n\n他两手移到下面，从她的裙子下伸进去，将她的内裤往下拉到他大腿处不能再拉为止。她的阴部基本上暴露在他的阴茎前方。她暗叹口气，没有阻止他的侵犯，继续为他手淫，同时更主动地和他接吻，想让他分散底下的动作。\n\n他开始用手在她的阴唇里扣捏，另一手缕玩她的阴毛。还好，似乎他只是想玩弄玩弄她的阴部，并不打算用阴茎往里面捅，否则那又会是一番纠缠。\n\n她安心地继续用手刺激着他的生殖器，手里的肉棒越来越坚硬，还不时地在她手中跳动。她知道她的阴部很快将会沾满一大片令人恶心的淫液。不过这已是不坏的结果了，但愿不要将她的裙子也弄得一塌糊涂。\n\n他从嘴唇里伸出了魔鬼般的舌头，探入她的口腔，在她嘴里开始肆虐地挺进。她将嘴张得更大，好让他得以尽兴。在这种快要达到他高潮的时候她不愿打断他的兴奋，将他刺激到这种程度已很费劲。而且真的不让他占这个便宜很可能会得罪客人，所以只能任他在嘴里得寸进尺地大占便宜。\n\n火热的肉棒在手里越来越坚硬，眼看就要快到尽头。他突然将她的屁股猛地往他大腿根部一抱，阴茎上的龟头直接抵在了她的阴唇口上，再要前进就可以探入里面。\n\n真是遇到了狡猾的老手。她嗯呀地回拒着，决心只能让他到此为止。用手将他的阴茎向上拉起一点，错开她阴唇的位置，将龟头抵在阴毛里，更快速地用手摩擦。他没有强求，只是一手按住她的后脑，更猛烈地压住她的嘴在她嘴里乱搅着舌头，另一手则抓住了她的一个乳房快速抓捏着，捏得她几乎疼的要叫出来。\n\n高潮猛的爆发了。一股湿漉漉的火热的液体在赵岚的阴部上方的阴毛里流开，粗大的阴茎连续在她的手心中跳动，他整个身子向前连挺几下，似是在配合他的每一次喷射，以得到更多的快感。\n\n她继续快速用手抚慰着他的肉棒，直到他松开她的头让她的嘴离开大口大口地喘气。\n\n她歇了一口气，从桌子上取出两张纸巾将他的阴茎包住，然后小心地将内裤卷起包住糊满她整个阴部的浓稠的淫液。对着这个满意地喘着气的男人妩媚地娇笑献殷，两手勾住他的脖子再次献上一个温柔的亲吻。\n\n庄建海沿着西藏南路向人民广场慢慢地开着。脑海里又转到赵岚的身上。她现在是否正在某个男人的怀里被人姿意地玩弄？还是……\n\n他知道自己最近想这些想得太多了。这么不潇洒还怎么吃这碗饭？更惶论让赵岚真去作全程服务了。自从他上次去了“新得来”舞厅后脑子就一直充满赵岚裸露在男人怀里的幻觉。\n\n他猛地摇了摇头，知道自己又在毫无益处地胡思乱想。用劲捏了一下方向盘后他两眼职业性地向街边的人群中溜过去，在每一对男女身上巡视。\n\n一对男女靠在树干上紧紧地搂着，女人叉开了两腿，让男人的腿插在中间。另有一对男女挤在一个不易令人察觉的墙角，两张脸完全贴在一起。成双成对的恋人也是上海夜间街头一大艳景。女人们的衣裙这几年随着生活水平的提高变得越来越非常暴露和性感。\n\n一个娇艳的倩影刚好从他的侧镜中闪过，让他的脑海里又闪现出云红俏艳的容颜和她迷人的肉体。庄建海的思绪再次回到那天在“新得来”舞厅里的那一个销魂的夜晚。\n\n“新得来”舞厅的确太过淫乱了。庄建海在云红的身上可以说上下摸了个透。好像是要验证他心里最后一点疑惑，当他的手摸向云红内裤时，她不仅半点拒绝的意思都没有，还主动分开两腿，让他在她的阴部隔着一层内裤随意摸捏。他几乎就要将手指隔着裤子插进她的阴道了。\n\n这已经远远超过了他所认可的三陪的底线。但似乎里面的三陪小姐都是如此。而且这种摸捏还只是开始。\n\n赵岚也是象云红这样接客的吗？他一直没有这样询问妻子。他实在不想让她难堪。她最初去做三陪还是他极力劝服的。让赵岚这样保守的女人去干那种事是要费不少口舌的。没想到现在的三陪变得如此赤裸裸，纵是一惯潇洒的他也感到有些难以接受。倒是赵岚居然能够承受这样性质的三陪，让他大为吃惊。也许赵岚所在的“海市豪”并不像“新得来”这样出格？\n\n庄建海想起云红的手一开始就在他的裤裆部位不时地轻捏，一双巧手的刺激隔着裤子传到他阳具上，那真是刺激无比。在庄建海几次拒绝了她邀他跳舞的邀请后她干脆就拉下了他裤子拉链，将手伸进里面隔着薄薄的内裤把玩起他的鼓鼓的肉棒。这种大胆的服务让庄建海大为吃惊。这时的他全身的燥热已难以抵挡，在她的手的巧妙搓揉下肉棒立刻就膨胀到了最大状态。但他还是想进一步试探她到底能服务到什么程度。他问她能否将她的手直接伸进去弄。\n\n不出他的意料，云红竟真的伸进他的外裤里拉下他的内裤，将他挺立的阴茎暴露出来，毫不羞涩地对他意味深长的一笑，就用手掳着他的肉棒，开始上下搓揉起上面的嫩皮。\n\n他从来未曾受过如此待遇。女人的手在他肉棒上温柔的感觉强烈地刺激起他的性欲，他紧搂住她的细腰，靠在沙发上尽情享受着异性的手淫服务。这是他从未享受过的服务。简直比直接趴在女人身上做爱还要刺激。他曾见过男人在他面包车后厢里让妓女为他手淫。当时他还大为不解，打手枪不就自己做就行了？还得花钱让女人帮忙？现在看来那人并不像自己以为的那样“港督”。手淫的感觉竟能如此奇妙。\n\n他在她的搓揉下坚持了好一会，突然他意识到自己即将射精。这样子不是要将自己的裤子射脏一大片？\n\n看他低头犹豫的样子，云红马上就理会出他的心思。她放开握住他肉棒的手，两手伸进裙子里，不慌不忙地抬了一下屁股，在庄建海难以置信的眼光下从裙子里面脱下了她的内裤。笑着回到他的胯下，将她那粉红色的内裤套在了他的肉棒上，非常善解人意地对他轻声说道，“侬就射在这个里厢吧。”\n\n庄建海那一瞬真是惊呆了。她不是就是光着屁股了吗？\n\n好像是要验证给他看，云红竟跨坐到他的腿上，裸露的阴部就直接坐上去，他能隔着裤子清晰地感受到她毛扎扎的阴毛磨着他的大腿。\n\n云红搂住他的脖子，红唇轻轻印在他嘴上，慢慢用力压住他，在他的嘴唇上揉擦着，像是邀请他的热吻。被这么揉情的女人搂着接吻，腿上摩擦着她的阴部，肉棒上还套着女性刚刚退下的内裤，一种极其异样的刺激将庄建海的全身包裹住。\n\n他两手干脆伸进她的裙子里，直接摸索着她光滑的腿部髋部甚至是小腹部，再往下就是她的浓密的阴毛，在下去就摸到了她的裂缝处。他惊的差点叫出声来。她毫不在意他的侵犯，反而用一手伸进裙子下面再次开始为他手淫，这时肉棒在她的绸质的内裤下面感觉更加美妙了。\n\n庄建海彻底陶醉了。他忘情地接受她的热吻，两手在她阴部姿意乱摸，同时享受着她在他肉棒上越来越快的搓动。他一阵颤抖，浓烈的精液勃然而出，全部射在她的内裤之中。那种舒畅的感觉至今还记忆犹新。\n\n庄建海每每想到云红脱了内裤为自己手淫的情景，他下面就开始发硬。\n\n突然他醒悟出为何赵岚经常要洗内裤，而且有时会一下洗两条甚至三条。这么看来赵岚确是为客人作这种手淫服务了，估计摸过她隐私的男人大概已不记其数了。这样想来，庄建海心中又开始隐隐作疼。\n\n他叹息了一声，知道如果赵岚真要去作全套服务，他还是会有很强的心理反应。真是不争气。他在心里暗骂自己。不就是这么回事吗？有什么放不下的。\n\n正在这时，路口一对男女向他招手。他心中大喜。今晚生意还真不错，能一晚接到两笔生意的日子越来越少了。\n\n在洗手间擦干下体湿漉漉的精液，换上一条新的内裤，赵岚有些疲惫地回到长椅上，等着下一个客人的挑选。\n\n一个多小时也未接到新客，长椅上的小姐渐渐多起来，看着墙上的时钟慢慢接近午夜，赵岚越来越失望。\n\n看来今晚就只接到那一个客人了。\n\n虽说她时不时会有整个晚上接不到一个客人的情形，但她还是很想在回家前能够再做一笔。但午夜已近，看来是没有多大希望了。不知道庄建海今晚生意如何，总不会好到哪去。再这样下去，可能真的得直接到大街上拉客了。那可就太丢人了。她可不像段沪生的老婆那么放得开，经常在回家的路上还能拉住客人打一炮。赵岚无论如何是拉不下那个脸面在大街上对着每个路过的男人调情。\n\n正在她胡思乱想之际，一个魁梧的身材风风火火地闯进来。一个响亮的带口音的山东人的声音对着领班就是一通连珠发问。\n\n原来是个外地人。以前赵岚打心眼里不愿陪外地客，不过现在她早已不在乎客人是否是外地人了。往往外地人给的小费倒反而多。她摆出她惯常的笑容，对着这个山东人扫来的目光妩媚地一笑。这时的长椅上还有十几个小姐，个个都摆出了最迷人的笑脸，都想争取这个也许是今晚最后一个客人。\n\n山东人对着领班说，“有没有上海小姐？我要找个上海小姐。不要外地来的。听人说上海小姐很有风味，我这次是特地来找上海小姐的。”\n\n赵岚眼睛一亮。她是椅子上不多的上海人之一。领班让她们几个上海小姐站起来，让山东人挑选。山东人有些疑惑地对着她们上下打量了几眼，说道：“没有年轻一点的啦？”\n\n对他粗鲁的语气赵岚保持着她本质的克制，脸上依然媚笑着，按下心中的不满。长年的职业经验告诉她，要赚钱就得忍耐。\n\n果然山东人眼睛盯住了她的乳部，似乎对她的身材非常满意，不等领班回答他就一把抓住了赵岚的胳膊大声说着：“好吧好吧，就是她了。”\n\n一边说着一边往里面走。\n\n在其他几双嫉妒的眼睛下赵岚挽住客人将他向里面引。\n\n直率的山东汉子一坐下就将赵岚抱到他粗大的腿上坐着，一手搂着她的脖子，一手开始摸她身子，急不可待的在她身上摸捏玩弄。赵岚后来知道他是刚下飞机，坐了出租就来到这里，早有些等不及的味道。\n\n赵岚职业性地娇笑着，开始跟他调情打趣。就像第一个客人一样，这个山东人好像也不太在意这种调情，嘴里嗯嗯啊啊的应着，注意力还都是放在在她身上乱摸的手里，不住地赞叹着她：“上海女人的皮肤都真他奶奶的又白又滑，俺听人说上海人的皮白，都是因为这里的自来水里漂白粉多，是真事儿吗？”\n\n对他这种憨实的样子，赵岚真的笑了出来，也不答他的问话，只是轻轻将脸凑过去，在他耳畔和颈子上摩挲，对他哈着香气。山东人被她果真的弄得有些迷乱，在她光滑的腿上不停地摸着，嘴上还在唠叨：“你们上海女人的肉可真他奶奶的嫩哎。”\n\n突然，他问她：“你们这儿有带铺的包厢吗？怎么算钱？俺俩开一间来好好玩玩。”他的问话一下将赵岚惊醒，天啊，他不是要全套服务吧？她的心跳一下子加快起来，想到自己即将要真正做这第一次全套服务，心中立刻慌张起来。\n\n未等她回答，山东人将正在另一个桌子边上的老板娘招了过来，问她说，“你们这包厢怎么算钱？”\n\n老板娘满面春风地走过来，笑嘻嘻地说道：“老板要包包厢啊？按小时包的话一个小时是一百元，小姐的小费您要和她另说。不过，您这位晶晶从不去包厢接客的。要不您等着，我给您再找几个小姐来。”\n\n“什么？”\n\n山东人狐疑地看着赵岚，不明白她为何不去包厢接客。\n\n赵岚尴尬异常。要不要接？为何不接？对着他疑惑的眼光，赵岚赶紧解释说：“是这样的，进这里的包厢都是要做那种服务的。我从来都是只在外面的素台陪客人喝酒跳舞，从不进包厢陪客，所以……”\n\n山东人像是明白了这里的规矩。很是惋惜地捏着她的身子说：“你从不在包厢接客？你从不在包厢接客？”\n\n赵岚突然明白再不抓紧说出来就要失去今天这最后的客人。\n\n她涨红了脸，一下子鼓起了勇气，对他低声说道：“如果我陪你去包厢，你付多少钱？”\n\n山东人看她突然改变主意，大是高兴，立刻就说，“你要多少？”\n\n“嗯……一个小时，两百。”\n\n“什么？这么贵？一个小时两百？”\n\n赵岚的脸更加红了。她怀疑自己叫的价也许太高了。\n\n山东人看着默默不语的赵岚，狠狠地说道：“好，好，看在你是第一次，俺就付你两百。两个小时，四百。来全套。如何？”\n\n见他这么爽快就答应她开出的价钱，她心头惊喜交加，简直有点喜出望外。但想到要陪他两个小时，心中立刻突突地起伏不定。这回可是要来真的了，她紧张的心情就像那第一天来“海市豪”上班时的一模一样。毕竟要跨出这最后的一步，成为一个地地道道妓女了，和她第一次下海做三陪一样，这将是她的人生的另一个最大的转变。\n\n迟早得过这一关，像以前一样，会很快适应的。她在心里暗暗安慰自己。想到自己即将跨过这最关键的一步，心中的惴惴不安真是难以形容。早就想好了要面对这一刻，但当这一刻真的到来时，她发现自己好像还是毫无思想准备。\n\n正不知该如何往下说，老板娘领着三个小姐走了过来。她们都听见了山东人最后的话。一听说山东人肯出四百，她们三个小姐眼都红了。她们分别拉住他的衣服，都嗲嗲地要陪他。\n\n山东人将她们都抖掉摆脱了她们的纠缠，指着赵岚对老板娘说就是她了，让她去开个包房，要两个小时。\n\n那三个上海小姐开始在边上冷言冷语地嘲讽起来：“呦，还真格寇勿出伊能卖轧许多。”“勿是说勿卖的吗？我还以为伊是个……”“勿是勿卖的啦，宁家是要卖个好价钱。”“格种宁啊……”“伊格会做啊？全套会勿啦？”“宁家什么勿会呀？侬阿勿要小瞧宁……”她们一边往外走一边你一句我一句的说着，让赵岚听了心里非常难受。平常还都是挺要好的姐妹，真到这时说翻脸就翻脸。\n\n突然，老板娘有些为难地对这个山东人说，“哎呀，真不好意思，我们舞厅一点钟就要关门了，我只能给您开一个小时。怎样？”\n\n山东人有些火了，“什么？你们上海怎么搞的？一点就要关门？在俺们那儿一玩就玩通宵，一点钟才当是开始。”\n\n“哎呀，您不知道啊，最近市里为了扫黄新出的规定，各娱乐场所一律不准在一点以后营业。我们也是没有办法啊，谁不想挣钱？公安局的半夜真的来查啊，要是抓到我们就完了。”\n\n赵岚再次感到了人情的冷暖。老板娘说的规定确是实情，但外面大门关上后里面的客人待到很晚的是常有的事。估计今天自己突然同意到包厢里面接客有些激恼了老板娘，现在故意来刁难一下。平时老板娘就一直劝她去包厢接客，让她想开来，现在她真想开了老板娘又不高兴了。\n\n山东人真有些火了，“不行，要开就开两个小时，俺不管你们什么时候关门。要不行，俺就带小姐出去。”\n\n说着他一把拉起赵岚就往外走。\n\n赵岚脑子里一片空白，不知该怎么应付此事。四百块啦，要是不接这笔生意庄建海肯定会说自己蠢。这么好的事真是很难碰到。但真要陪他出去？到哪去呢？自己还从未陪客人出过“海市豪”的门，这么半夜了，真要陪他去旅馆吗？\n\n犹豫之中赵岚已被这个山东人拉出了舞厅。\n\n赵岚还指望老板娘做最后挽留，但她一句话都没说，就眼看着他们走出了大门。",

（一）\n\n庄建海在他的面包车前座上换了个姿势，懒洋洋地抬头看着街道上的天空。夜上海的天空是灰亮的，在街旁霓虹灯的映照下不断闪烁着五彩斑斓的色彩。\n\n远处最耀眼的自然是那直指夜空的东方明珠电视塔，被灯光镶成的轮廓在上海几乎每个地方都能看到，是上海人最骄傲的标志性建筑。\n\n他左前方的辉煌的门庭上紫红色的“海市豪”三个字被一串快速闪烁着的彩灯围绕着，在夜空中格外醒目。优雅的慢三的旋律从里面飘出来，使得大街上也充满浪漫的气息。这是一家中等规模的夜总会，也就是目下在上海最常见到的带有许多三陪小姐的歌舞厅。\n\n庄建海的妻子赵岚正在里面做三陪女。他刚刚目送她那婀娜的身影在暮色中消失在舞厅门里。\n\n天色刚刚暗下来，里面的客人还不多。不知她现在是在台前等候客人的挑选，还是已经被某个客人搂在舞厅里随着慢四的节奏摇晃，还是……八成她还坐在台前的长椅上。毕竟她已不很年轻，论身材论姿色都比不上外地来的“打工妹”。\n\n庄建海不再往下想。这样想没有什么好处，这是他早就知道的，只是他还是常常会忍不住去猜想妻子在里面陪客的情景，特别是最近这两周，他的思路更是不自觉得往这方面想。\n\n赵岚在“海市豪”做三陪已有两年多了，庄建海早已走过了那种一想到妻子在别人怀中卖笑就发酸的心里历程。“绿帽情结”，这是他总结出的词汇，是刚出道的新手才会有的。他为自己能很快就能潇洒对待这事而骄傲。这也是一种成熟，一种人生的境界。\n\n他能坦然面对妻子卖笑不卖身，陪客人聊天喝酒跳舞。但是，他如何能真正面对她即将跨出的最后一步——卖淫？\n\n他自己也说不清楚自己会是个什么感受。既然他们已经决定要走这一步，也许今晚赵岚就可能……他真不愿再去想这些。他们没有选择——赵岚是这么说的，他心里也是这么想的。\n\n上海是个“笑贫不笑娼”的地方。这种事越来越司空见惯。其实不光是上海，全国各地又有哪个地方不如此？\n\n他认识的十几个开面包车的，有一小半的妻子都在歌舞厅里做三陪。不做的老婆不是太老就是太丑，可以说能做的几乎都在做了。有什么丢脸的？不都是这样吗？真有钱的也不开这种车了。他们还不就是为了挣钱？谁还在乎面子？\n\n不过真正卖身的他只知道两个。毕竟陪客人过夜和陪客人跳舞的差别太大了。按他们的说法，在舞厅里三陪只是让人得些手脚便宜，但要是全卖了，就便宜全被人占了。这个便宜能挣得回来吗？\n\n对于三陪他以前是很看得开的。老婆被人搂着跳舞后身子也不损失什么。早年他追上她之前她在学校的舞场里还不是被许多人搂过？为此他没少劝过和他一同下岗的小吴。小吴每天等老婆时总是唉声叹气，埋怨自己没用，只能让老婆干这三陪。\n\n“侬哪能格么想勿通？勿就是挣钞票吗？有啥想勿通的？宁家占侬老婆格些么手头便宜，侬占伊皮夹子里钞票便宜，啥宁赚啥宁呀？侬看宁家段沪生，老婆拉客人出来都是上伊开的车，赚两份子钞票，那个叫精呃。”\n\n干这行就得这么想，阿Q 就阿Q 吧，现在还有什么地方能挣到钱呢？他们可都是太缺钱了。下岗津贴区区可数，糊口也可以马虎对付。但厂里搞住房改革，现在他们住的房子必须要从厂里买下来，虽说只是四万元优惠价，这对他们来说可是一笔巨大的开销。又加上去年为了让儿子上教学质量最好的实验初中要交三万元，他们将家里全部的血汗存款全部花完，还借了很大的债才能凑够。\n\n想到儿子，他心中油然升起一股骄傲。他儿子没有辜负他的期望，学习成绩一路直上，下学期肯定要升入重点班：重点中学的重点班，这怎能不让他感到骄傲？\n\n当然，进重点班还要交八千块，现在这个社会到处都要钱，学校当然也不例外。但是，他们夫妻双双下岗，这八千又是一笔太大的数字，再加上未还完的债，他还想赞钱买一辆桑塔那跑出租。这面包车是租来的，每天付近乎一半以上的收入作租金实在是太亏了，而且上面政策时紧时松，谁知道什么时候这种面包车就会全面取缔。他们这么开也是不怎么合法。但这钱，唉……\n\n正像赵岚说的，他们没有选择。虽然这几年生活质量是好了不少，不愁吃不愁穿的，但真要过好日子，没有钱哪成？而且现在他们也都不年轻了，还能这么没日没夜地挣几年？\n\n这时又有一拨男人进去，都是西装革履人模人样，但其实都不是好东西。庄在心里暗骂几句操你们娘的，以换点心里平衡。不过骂归骂，庄建海还是希望舞厅生意兴隆，而且也希望赵岚被男人选中。坐冷板凳等待的滋味肯定不好受，她们没有小费就赚不到什么钱。\n\n他们中会不会有哪个人会挑中赵岚？他对这群人多看了几眼，立刻有点心虚地转过头，向远处的东方明珠电视塔望去。灯火辉煌的电视塔在夜空中直指云霄，背后映忖着浦东美丽的夜景，组成一副艳丽的上海夜色。\n\n这是他为之骄傲的上海。一想到这几年浦东的快速发展的巨大成就他就会无比自豪和骄傲。若不是赶上上海这几年的大发展，他们的生意也不会做到今天。\n\n他了口气，启动了车子，向淮海路慢慢开去。\n\n“海市豪”里的赵岚并未被那群新进来的男人们挑中。她暗然无语，心中无限惆怅。坐在椅子上的姐妹们其实都在互相较着劲，每当客人进来时都用自己最迷人最媚力的眼光去挑痳他们。能被先选中就像是证明自己的姿色胜过别的女人的一项奖状。\n\n几个被挑中的小姐挽着各自客人的胳膊娇媚地伏在他们身上进入内间的舞厅，身后留下一片莺声笑语在屋里回荡。\n\n赵岚的姿色已经比不过年轻的外来妹和大三大四的在校大学生了，成群结队来的客人都不喜欢挑她。而这种结队来的客人往往是最慷慨的，因为一般他们都是被招待来玩的，而且很可能会用公款付帐，给小费时眼都不眨一下。\n\n这时又进来一个单身的客人。赵岚打起精神，温柔地微笑着，现出非常端庄淑女和体贴温柔的样子。\n\n赵岚不像那些年轻的小姐，她们要么打扮得花枝招展，浓妆艳抹，用轻佻诱惑的形象来吸引客人，要么就故意淡妆，做出天真清纯的青春女学生模样，用娇情羞涩的可爱形象来招徕客人。赵岚走的是另一路子，她既不故意骚情，也不故作清纯，而是选择正派成熟女人的形象。这也是没有办法的选择，她实在没有多少青春的资本。\n\n但她还是比较成功的，在“海市豪”里算是有些固定客户的。不少中年男人就喜欢专门挑选她这样体贴温馨的成熟妇人，按他们的话来讲，就是受不了那帮骚货的俗气，也不喜欢娇柔造作的假纯情。\n\n在又过了几批客人后来了一位中年男子，看上去还算正派，在长椅上的小姐们脸上和身上扫过一遍后终于用手指向了赵岚。\n\n一阵暗喜，赵岚满脸微笑着迎接住客人，很老练地挽住他的胳膊，像是招待熟人一样将他拉向里面的舞厅。她温柔地笑着，将胸部小心地贴到他的胳膊上，一面走一面柔声地问候奉承着他。\n\n在舞厅一角的双人沙发上并排坐定，赵岚用柔和的语调招待他，开始缠绵地和他套近乎，并主动将他的手拉到自己肩上让他搂住她的颈子。\n\n搂着她的中年男人一上来就不客气地用手隔着她的衣服在她的乳房上捏了几下。她心下一边叹息又遇到一个色场老手，一边媚笑着扭开身子和他应承。现在生意是越来越难作了，男人们个个都圆滑无比，不让他们占许多便宜是不可能的了。\n\n唉，可怜自己的丈夫还不知道现在的三陪女可不是像以前那样简单地陪客人聊天喝酒跳舞。因为三陪女的数量越来越多，客人们在她们身上也就越来越放肆，现在身上什么地方都可以摸了。供过于求，就成了买方市场，色情业也不例外。你不愿作还有许多人求之不得呢。\n\n舞厅周围都是成双成对的男女们，几乎没有例外地，男人们对着各自的女人调戏挑痳，而小姐们都是强颜欢笑曲意奉承。在这里能得到男人的欢心是挣小费的唯一手段，以前那种清高的姿态再也行不通了，她已很久没有遇到过那种只是坐着聊天的拘谨客人。\n\n赵岚身旁的男人一手揽在她的脖子上，另一手就摸着她裙下的大腿。她用手护住大腿上部，尽量延阻着男人的进犯，一边举着酒杯不停的哄着这个男人喝酒，希望将他弄得醉一点好容易周旋。\n\n这个男人对赵岚的调情不是很感兴趣，他更多的兴趣就是在她身上乱摸乱捏。这样的男人最难对付。\n\n舞曲起来，他们搂到舞厅的中央开始跳舞。\n\n其实这根本不叫跳舞，而是站在那里，女人两手搂住男人的脖子，被男人搂着随意地晃动。女人的手因无法再用来阻挡男人的侵犯，女人的身体成了男人们随意品玩的对象。跳这种姿势的舞成了男人占女人便宜的最佳方式。\n\n赵岚搂着的男人开始在她的身上用力抚摸着，像是要透过她的裙子摸透她的肌肤。他带有烟味和酒味的嘴追她的嘴唇，身子紧紧地贴在她的胸部。她有意娇笑着摇着头躲避着他的嘴，似娇似嗔地挑痳着他的情欲，不时地故意让他得逞，容许他的嘴在她双唇边上占些便宜。\n\n这是她长时间总结出来的技巧。不能让男人一次吻个够，而是一点点地让他得些便宜，这样可以最大地挑痳起男人对她的情欲，而且又能让男人长时间的保持对她的兴趣。\n\n她的耳边被男人粗重的喘息弄得稣痒无比，耳环也被他用舌头挑起。她嘤笑着转过头，脸蛋划过他的舌尖，令她恶心的口水在她精心化装的脸上留下一道湿痕。她将脸埋进他的胸膛。这是最有效地躲避男人嘴巴的骚扰而又不会太激怒客人的方式。\n\n男人的双手移到她的前胸，手伸进她的吊带裙在她的乳罩上用手指旋转着捏揉她的乳尖。虽然他的动作还算温柔体贴，她身体还是做出了强烈的反应。这里是她最敏感的部位。\n\n她忍耐着任他轻薄，心中想起在开着面包车的丈夫，还一直坚持要她不陪客人做出格的事——就是只卖笑不卖淫。\n\n其实什么是出格什么是不出格？被男人伸进衣服摸乳房算不算？摸阴部呢？连手指都插进去呢？还不算越过了底线出了格？若从脱衣服来看，客人有时会将她的内裤从裙子里扒下来。这算不算出格？若以射不射精为界线，那她用手帮客人手淫射精，还算不算出格呢？这些已经是三陪的基本格式了，根本不是她能左右得了的。\n\n她在舞厅里能坚持的最后的底线，就是不让客人插入体内交媾。其他怎么互相摸都可以。有一回客人甚至将龟头放到了她阴唇上摩擦着往里拱，同时让她帮他手淫。虽说未让他最后进入，但这和交媾差别又有多少？\n\n她一直不让丈夫知道这种事。她不知道他要是知道了她们三陪的实际情形会怎么反应。\n\n赵岚曾试探性地对庄建海说，她们这些上了三十几的三陪女，如果还坚持在舞厅只是清陪，是非常难再混下去了。客人给的坐台费越来越少，都要求来点真的。她举出了好几个姐妹，都开始陪客人在包厢里做全陪挣更多的钱，或干脆就和客人出去。\n\n他的反应不是非常排斥。但他还是坚持她要保持自己的尊严和纯洁。他说，“侬是晓得的，我是勿在意格种事情，勿就格么回事？但侬跟各种客人做我实在不放心。啥宁晓得他们有没有传泄病？”\n\n她也实在无言以对。她相信安全问题决不是他最关注的，他反对的原因根本上还是他“在意”那事。但他们都不愿深究这一点，都留在心底心照不宣。她其实很感激他对她的这种态度。\n\n但是，昨夜他们夫妻又作了一次长谈。出乎她的意料，他竟然同意了她可以陪客做那事，也就是同意了自己可以卖淫，只要客人给钱给的还可以，她可以自己看着办。\n\n这可是赤裸裸的卖淫啊。这样她的三陪的性质可就彻底变了。虽说她也很想挣那个钱，但毕竟从未让客人真的干过，心中一想到那事就非常紧张。真要让那些个大大小小的硬家伙插入体内啊。这跟和自己丈夫做那事总会不一样吧？\n\n搂着她的男人将她贴紧到他的身上，两手玩弄起她的臀部，隔着她的裙子和内裤慢慢揉捏着。她能感到他的阳具已经膨胀起来，隔着衣服顶在了她的下体附近。\n\n这人会不会要求做那事？看他对她的身体这么感兴趣，也许会的。\n\n想到这赵岚心中一阵慌张发毛。\n\n庄建海一边慢慢开着车，一边盯着街道上的每一对男女，寻找潜在的客户。\n\n他开的面包车不是一般的出租车，不是简单的那种拉客人从一个地方到另一个地方的交通工具。他的面包车后厢，是一个经过改装的别致的床铺，他真正的生意，其实就是拉妓女和嫖客在车后厢里干那事。\n\n许多嫖客其实就只需要一个隐蔽的地方和妓女搞，到旅店开个按小时算的房间要比在歌舞厅开包厢便宜。但更便宜的，还是租这种面包车，既可以按小时算，也可以一边开一边搞，搞到好就停车按里程算。而且还可以让车开到客人想要去的地方，路上的时间可以用来玩女人，既经济，又实惠。一些客人会让他停在隐蔽处，搞完了再走。但更多的客人发现在摇晃的车中做爱非常浪漫。\n\n这主意不是他最先想出来的。但他是最快加入这种生意的人之一。在上海头脑不活洛可不行。\n\n在不远的街口庄建海接到了一笔生意。一个大学生模样的青年搭上了一个妖冶流莺，上了他的车。\n\n他心中轻松起来。至少今晚不会白耗油了。随着开这种面包车的人数的增多，他的生意越来越不如以前，常常出现整晚放空车的情形。\n\n他将后视镜扭开，这是在向客人表明他不会偷看。其实他的后视镜还是会有一个拐角将后面全部反射到，他只要稍稍抬抬头就可看到后面的春光。\n\n男人的好奇心总是很大的，特别是这样的西洋景。不过庄建海也不是每次都偷看。毕竟看得多了也就没什么意思了，几乎总是千篇一律，按他的话来说，不就是两团肉在车上晃来晃去吗？\n\n这个青年好像经验不多，一上车就急猴猴的将女的裙子脱掉搂住乱摸，然后自己脱光后很快又将她的内裤扒掉，开始趴上去就嗯嗯呀呀干起来。\n\n庄建海知道如何在车子每一次经过路灯下时恰到好处地扫两眼后视镜。但今天他没有多大的兴趣，只是瞄了一两眼。后面两个裸露的肉体纠缠在一起，在霓虹灯下蠕动着，对他来说都是些老镜头，了无新意。\n\n他将车子开在最省油的一个慢速度，无聊地将眼光投向远处的江边夜景。现在他正沿着外滩向南悠悠地驶着，黄浦江对岸的夜景不断在障碍物间闪现。\n\n赵岚今晚也会被人这样搞吗？他的思路又飞到妻子身上，脑海里映出赵岚雪白的肉体被陌生男人搂着的幻觉。一想到此他的心就非常乱。赵岚刚去作三陪时他也是这种心情。但他很快就克服了那种情绪。他相信这次也会如此。\n\n不就是插来插去吗？在舞厅赵岚的身子可不是早就被摸透了？\n\n他知道他不该这么去想。但两周前他平生第一次有机会泡小姐，才惊讶地发现他以前对三陪的了解是多么落后。\n\n老实本份的他虽然一直在各个夜总会门口拉客，但还从未进过舞厅叫过小姐，居然不清楚里面三陪现在到底陪到什么程度了，也不知道舞厅里的小包厢里到底是怎么一回事，还以为那里只是唱卡拉OK的地方。\n\n他为自己一直如此天真而感到可笑。\n\n那是两个星期前从美国纽约回来探亲的老同学路过上海时来看他，他为了显示自己的好客带着老同学逛了一次舞厅。\n\n从纽约来的同学老王至今还未娶上媳妇，庄建海不禁暗暗生出一丝优越感。\n\n当年自己实在不是考托考G 的料，未能赶上出国的热潮。不过，老王这么多年在国外，混的也不过如此。在庄看来，他从骨子里透的都是土气。要是不知道他的底细，谁见了都会以为他是刚从哪个县城来的。\n\n上海人最瞧不起的就是土气。\n\n庄建海那天特地歇业不开车了，带老王到上海的南京路外滩转转。老王有十来年没回上海看看了，这回可是大开眼界。那一栋栋新建的摩天大楼，那高架人行桥跨江大桥江底隧道，无不让老王看得眼化缭乱。他不断地感慨上海的变化太大了。\n\n庄建海为此非常自豪。是的，上海这几年的建设让全世界都为之震惊。\n\n夜色下的上海更是让老王大开眼界。上海这个花花世界比之纽约这样的世界大城市可以说是毫不逊色。这是老王打心眼里承认的。\n\n他请老王到城皇庙去吃各种小吃。这是最省钱的办法，稍稍像样点的餐厅都是死贵。\n\n果然老王对小吃街上的众多的食物大赞不已。早就听说外国人的吃是很差劲的，哪能和中国的饮食文化相比。这里吃的不仅花样繁多，而且极其便宜，都是下岗工人开的小本生意，却让老王这样从纽约来的人留连忘返。\n\n这让庄建海非常开心。花钱少办事好，是上海人最精明的地方。\n\n吃过晚饭后庄准备带老王见识见识上海的夜总会。他从老王每次路过夜总会闪烁的霓虹灯时看到外面美女的招牌的眼神里，就知道老王心里在想什么。干他这行察言观色是他的吃饭本领。他很能理解老王。毕竟这么大年纪了，还没有过女人。在美国那地方，爱滋病泛滥，估计他那种老实巴交的人，也不敢乱找妓女。\n\n老王告诉庄建海，在纽约没有三陪。这让庄建海惊讶无比。难怪纽约来的也这么土。他真高兴当年没盲目地去凑出国的热闹。\n\n那更要带老王见识见识上海的夜总会了，即使所费不菲，也要让老王开开眼界。而且，上海的夜生活最具特色也最能拿得出手的，不就是这大大小小遍布全城的歌舞厅吗？\n\n他将老王带到一个叫“新得来”的歌舞厅。他当然从未来过，但凭他经常路过这里的感觉，这里的档次和“海市豪”应该差不多。他对老王说这里的小姐服务得很到位，说这话时显出的老矩连他自己都有点不安，俨然他真是上海歌舞厅的常客。不过上海随便哪个歌舞厅对老王来说都是非常新鲜，不是他在纽约待的土地方能见得到的。\n\n不知为何跟老王在一起他总是常常有种优越的感觉。他越来越觉得上海真是个魅力无穷的世界级大城市，他为自己是上海人感到非常骄傲。\n\n赵岚已陪这个客人跳了好几曲了，看来这个男人今晚会全泡在她身上。这个男人据他自己说是个什么处长，官虽不大但有些小权，今晚他对她好像很满意，看来今天自己收获不会小。说不定他还会用公款付帐呢？谁知道。\n\n能被这个男人包下来，让她有些骄傲。\n\n在这里她的姿色实在不算上等，年轻的外来妹个个都很出众，让她非常嫉妒。但她也有她的媚力，这是成熟女人才有的媚力。而且她有经验。她知道如何讨客人的欢心。\n\n上海女人的“嗲”是全国闻名的。这在“海市豪”里非常明显。她们几个上海本地的三陪女论姿色都比不过外地来的“乡屋”女人，但她们却总是能得到许多回头客的亲咪，这和她们的素质是分不开的。\n\n现在他们搂抱着挤在沙发一角。不远处还有两对男女都搂在一堆，都旁若无人地做着很大胆的亲密动作，其中一个小姐的带裙的带被拉到了胳膊上，没有穿胸罩的双乳几乎就全部裸露出来。另一个女人的裙子被摞起来，露出刺眼的白色内裤。\n\n男人的大手开始沿着赵岚的裙子里向上摸索，她已不能再阻止他的侵犯了，这样的客人她可不愿得罪。她有些半真半假地喘着气，用脸在他脸上若即若离地蹭着，在他每一次进犯时都要半推半就地假意抗拒着，一手虚抓着他伸进裙内的大手，另一只手按住裙子另一边，两腿紧紧地并住。\n\n她的娇羞其实鼓励了他的进一步的动作。他开始隔着她的内裤摸着她的最隐秘的部位，手指头摸出了阴缝的位置，上下搓揉。\n\n她一边夸张地啊啊地呻吟着，一边用手摸到男人的下体，在他挺立的阳具上隔着裤子温柔地相应搓揉。她从他粗重的喘息声中知道自己的动作在起作用，更加卖力地用手刺激他的下体，并用嘴在他脸上讨好地亲着。\n\n他的手指不安分地插入她的内裤，挑摸着她的阴毛。她扭动了几下身体，并不打算立刻阻止他的侵犯。\n\n他越发起劲，手指更深入到她的内裤，直接摸到了她的业已充血的阴唇。她很高兴自己的下体已经湿润，男人总是喜欢看到女人在他们的玩弄下身体产生反应。\n\n该是阻止他的时候了。得让他浅尝即止，不能让他太容易就得到一切，否则很难长时间让他保持兴趣。她娇嗔地推开他的手，将一条腿交叉到他的腿上，既保持了亲密的接触，又有效地护住自己的隐私部位。同时她两手搂住他的脖子，开始对他嗲声嗲气的假意埋怨着。\n\n这个男人显然是个中老手，对她的挑痳顺势而上，一把将她搂进怀里，在她嘴上一阵狂亲。她未能躲过这次袭击，干脆让他占尽便宜，然后大喘着气娇嗔地推开他，嘴里不住地说着“要死人了要死人了”。\n\n他当然不会就此放过她。他一把将她拉起来，让她完全跨坐到他的双腿上，拉住她的双臂，让她勾回到他的脖子，开始用两手攻击她的上半身。他的手扒下她裙子的带，让带子挂到她的胳膊上，胸部露出她乳白色的胸罩。挺立的双峰在丝布中若隐若现。\n\n他抱紧她，不让她后撤，开始用嘴压在乳罩上亲吻。\n\n她啊啊地低叫着，这时她的叫声大部份是出于身体的本能反应。不知为什么，她的乳房在结婚了这么多年后仍然非常敏感。这也是她总是坚持戴乳罩的原因。当然戴乳罩是不可能阻止多少男人的进攻的。经常会有客人要求她主动将乳罩去掉。不过这终归多给了她一个周旋的筹码，而且确实有客人曾对她说戴乳罩的女人更有性感，更能挑痳人。\n\n现在这个男人不慌不忙地用嘴在她胸部的乳罩上摩擦着，两个手却摸到了她的背后。她将脸抵着他的头发，抵御着胸部传来的刺激。每一次客人玩弄她的乳房时都是她最难熬的时刻，可恨的是几乎每一个客人都对她的乳房感兴趣，也不知是不是她的胸部特别丰满的原因，还是女人的这个部位就是对男人有无穷的吸引力。\n\n不管她多么讨厌客人玩她的乳房，她现在都得忍耐了。刚才跳舞时她已多次利用乐曲扭动身子躲避他的狎玩，再躲避他恐怕真会让他不高兴了。\n\n他果然是个玩弄女人的老手。他两只手在她背后隔着她的裙子就解开了她胸罩的扣子，他再用双唇拱开已经松动的乳罩，直接用嘴吻在了她胸部上的肉体。\n\n强烈的刺激让她有些受不了。但他的双手按在她的背部，逃是逃不掉了。她两手从他脖子上撤回来，紧紧捂住要脱落的胸罩，小心地护住乳头部位，留下一小半乳房让他得些便宜。她开始扭动起身子，向前压住他的头。他的嘴唇却紧紧地附在她胸部周围，任她如何扭动也摆脱不了。她叹息着不得不放弃，任他在她的乳房上直接用嘴吻弄，只是每次他快碰到她的乳尖时才猛地用劲摆脱。\n\n舞曲响起，她再次邀他去跳舞。但他却从她的乳部抬起头说：“勿跳了，就格么玩好了。”她有些紧张。这样玩下去他说不定就会要求来真的。她已碰到许多次这样的情形。以前她总是简单地加以拒绝。一般男人不会特别不高兴，顶多只是额外的小费给的少。\n\n但今天呢？真要答应他作那事？\n\n想到要将整个身子彻底开放让这个人进入，从而跨过这一道每个女人都极其珍惜的最后底线，她心中突然慌张极了。\n\n她要跟他怎么开口讲价？要二百块？还是一百？至少要八十。打一炮还是玩一个小时？外面的野鸡也要五十块一小时呢。就跟他说自己是第一次，这倒不是骗他，他可以去老板那里打听。反正少于八十就不干。\n\n她有点后悔昨天没有让庄建海给她定个确切的价钱。\n\n胡思乱想之中她见到他一手伸到被她裙子盖住的裤子拉开他自己裤子的拉链。看来他已到了非要发泄体内聚集起来的性欲不可的地步。\n\n这正是该说的时候了。她轻轻地用手移开裙子，再盖住他的裤子咧开的口子，温柔地对他说，这里不是做这事的地方。如果他愿意，她可以陪他去包厢。\n\n他有些怒气地说，为什么不可以？又不怕被人看见。\n\n说着，他撩起她的裙子，将她的一只手按到裙下挺挺的阳具上，暧昧地冲着她淫笑，两手摩挲着她的雪白的大腿。原来他连内裤都没穿，早就准备好要让小姐方便帮他手淫。\n\n她知道他只想要她帮他在这里打手枪，舍不得花包厢的钱。心中暗骂一声小气鬼，但想到自己不会立刻就跨过那卖淫的最后防线，虽然这只是暂时的延缓，心里倒像是一块石头落了地。他真要作那事她反而要紧张了。\n\n她扭捏了几下，故意羞涩地将裙子盖住他的整个下体，手伸进去开始轻轻地摸着他的肉棒，虚虚地握住，慢慢套弄。\n\n他的嘴吻住她的双唇。\n\n## （二）\n\n车厢后面的喘息声越来越重，庄建海能感到本来平稳的车子在行驶中有些不易察觉的抖动。他轻蔑地笑了一下，后面的年轻人好像没有弄多久就不行了，车子这才刚刚开出外滩。\n\n这种男女之事对他来说真像是家常便饭，几乎每天都这么在他眼皮底下发生。这也是他对此很看得开的原因。他相信自己是不在乎赵岚被人这样玩的。但……能捞回便宜吗？如果挣的不多，还不如不做。这是他反覆对赵岚说的。他坚信世上每件事都有个价钱。\n\n一想起那次他陪老王去逛夜总会的情形，他就对她现在挣的很不满意。都被玩成这样了，才这几个钱，还不如讲开来干真的来钱。\n\n这也是他为什么同意让赵岚对要求来全程的客人看情形办的原因。当然他不会这么同她讲。他对她说的，就是“要是有人愿作冤大头，不宰白不宰。”\n\n他不明白自己为何一直未能洒脱到看出这一点。真是太幼稚了，看人家段沪生那才是精明。段的老婆约了客人出来，都要先CALL段沪生。要是段沪生的车还空着，就可以挣个双份。那个潇洒。\n\n想起段沪生老婆挽着男人扭动屁股的作做姿态，他又回忆起那次在“新得来”里坐在他腿上的女人肉体——那也是个上海女人。\n\n他只是偶然地选上了个上海女人。他对老王吹嘘说他是有眼光的。事后他自己也觉得自己有品味。\n\n那天老王一进门就被一排小姐痳得眼都直了，但庄建海是见过世面的。他看到那些小姐搔首弄姿的样子，竟一点不为所动，毕竟自己就是吃这行饭的，看来自己还真像个老手。他对那些过于轻佻的女人比较反感，很自然就挑了一个还算端庄的成熟女人。而且她的皮肤真是白，很是让他赏心悦目，跟赵岚的皮肤比起来还要白。\n\n他也许选她时的心理在不知不觉中有点受了赵岚的影响？\n\n当他后来发现她是货真价实的上海女人时，他为自己的眼光感到非常高兴。他后来对老王吹说，这个年头舞厅里多的是外地小姐，但他一眼就能看出谁是真正的上海人。\n\n老王就不行了，被一个妖艳的女人迷住。据老王后来说，他真受不了那个女人。他说这话时满脸都是口红印子。不过庄建海知道这不是老王的心里话。他能看出来老王还是对那个女人非常受用的。\n\n陪庄建海的小姐叫云红。真是俗气的名字。但也没办法。现在的小姐都取俗气的名字。赵岚在舞厅里叫的是什么名字？他居然还一直不知道。好像叫什么晶晶？还是筝筝？\n\n不知为何被这个女人搂着胳膊总是让他想到自己的老婆。也许是第一次在外面玩女人，所以有些心虚？他陪老王出来赵岚是知道的，只是来舞厅没有对她讲。庄建海倒不是因怕老婆而不敢讲。和许多上海男人不同，他从来就不是个妻管严。庄建海未将这次逛舞厅告诉赵岚，是因为他事前根本就没计划来这里花这冤枉钱。\n\n他相信赵岚绝对会理解的。毕竟人家老王是远道而来，又从未见识过上海的夜总会，带他去一次也不就是几百块钱，几个晚上也就挣回来了。上海人从来就不是小气的人。该花钱的地方上海人从来就是很大方的，只是因为上海人花钱花得比较精明，让许多人误以为是小气。\n\n不过事后他也未对赵岚提这事，不是不敢提，而是另一个原因了。\n\n在他看来，在歌舞厅里花钱基本上就是作冤大头。不说那些贵的出奇的饮料，点个歌扯开嗓子让其他人难受自己发泄倒也罢了，但被女人假心假意地挑痳几下就要给小费，这是他怎么也不愿接受的。谁不知道那些小姐的甜言蜜语都是假的？搂着小姐跳舞？连搂自己的老婆跳舞都没兴趣了。都是过来人了，还不就这么回事？\n\n他事后没跟赵岚讲这次经历，实在是因为这次经历还真是出乎他的预料。可以说让他大吃一惊。虽然他们在那里只待了很短的时间，却是个地地道道的销魂的夜晚，让他终身难忘。\n\n他还记得大厅里面在天花板上的昏暗的旋转彩灯映照下的诡秘的男男女女。他的脑海里渐渐清晰地回忆起那天的几乎每一个情节。\n\n云红将他带到里面，他马上就被舞池里几对男女的“出格”的“舞姿”惊呆了。这是个什么野路子歌舞厅？\n\n一个男人撩起舞伴裙子，将大腿在她的内裤上一遍遍的摩擦，就连毫无音乐素养的庄建海都看出来那腿的动作根本就不合节拍，纯粹就是占小姐的便宜。另一个男人的手竟插入女方的内裤里直接占她的屁股的便宜，嘴巴还在对着她的嘴猛烈缠绵的热吻。赵岚不是说客人一般是不许直接亲嘴的吗？\n\n而另一个男人的举动就更让他震惊：他嘴巴竟然含住小姐从脱落的带裙里裸露的乳头，脸在她的胸部揉压着。\n\n而这些小姐好像对这些男人的出格举动毫不在意，任他们随意施为。有的小姐还主动用身子招引男人的亲薄。这哪里还是在跳舞？\n\n庄建海无法将这样的画面和他记忆里的男女跳舞形象联系到一起。他原以为搂紧了跳贴面舞就是最过份的了。\n\n台上两个穿着极少的少女还跳着撩人的劲舞。她们的动作几乎就是对男人的挑痳. 连他自认为很是见过世面的人也大为心跳。\n\n他一度以为自己走错了地方。但既然进来了，而且对老王暗示过自己常来这里，总不好就退出去。而且几十块钱的门票估计也不容易就要回来。\n\n那时的老王好像已经血脉喷涨了，眼里射出来的都是欲火。\n\n看到老王的样子，庄建海反而镇定下来。既来之则安之。自己又不是没见过男女搞过？跳跳艳舞有什么大惊小怪的？\n\n不过他心中翻腾的，不是这些男女的出格动作，而是想到了赵岚。因为这里跳舞的男人在女人身上毫无例外地大占便宜到了过份的地步。难道赵岚也被人这么玩弄？还是这里是个很不正规的舞厅？\n\n当他们坐到角落里的沙发上时，他才又发现在昏暗的沙发上坐着的男女的动作比之舞池里的人还要更加不堪入目。\n\n未等他仔细看清楚周围男女的情形，云红温柔的嘴已经凑了上来，在他腮帮子上娇声地左一个先生右一个老板，还对他用上海话说“侬勿常来吧？”\n\n幸亏她的话音很小，他肯定老王没听见，否则真会让他难堪。老王那时已被那个叫倩英的骚女人搂在脖子上正在手足无措。\n\n庄建海还真被云红贴上来的身体上散发出的刺激的香味有点弄得神魂颠倒了。这对他来说还是从未有过的。经常在他后车厢里的女人的香味都很浓，但这一次女人的肉体是主动地贴在了他的肩膀上，他胳膊动一动就能碰到她的乳房。\n\n他的惊愕是短暂的。虽说是第一次真正和一个小姐贴在一起，一想到他来这里就是要花钱的，不玩白不玩，他就慢慢冷静下来。什么样的小姐自己没有见过？自己的老婆就是小姐，还不是经常搂？\n\n后来他开始慢慢适应，大胆地伸开手臂，将那个送上来的诱人的肉体搂住。嘴里还对着对面的倩英说道，“伊可是从纽约来的，侬要好好招待招待”。一副十足的老手派头。\n\n他身上的云红也哎吆吆地一副惊讶的神情，好像更加热情地将身子贴紧到他的怀里。这让他非常开心。他不再麻木，在云红将他的手往她颈子下移动时趁势开始往云红的雪白的胸部上摸起来。他本以为她必定会娇柔地躲避一番，但他却惊讶地发现她竟主动地将他的手引向乳罩里面，同时还讨好地用嘴亲他的腮帮。\n\n他暗自赞叹，果然这里的小姐的服务很到位，对老王吹的牛还被他蒙对了。他心中很是快慰。\n\n当他摸入她乳罩里柔软的乳房上时，他的脸不自觉地红起来，竟有些不忍往下摸。毕竟还是他第一次这么摸一个陌生女人的乳房，下体竟开始蠢蠢欲动起来。\n\n云红的手也在他的身上随意地游走，从他的上身摸向他的大腿，再摸向他的大腿根部。她的手有意无意地触摸着他的阴部。\n\n他的下体立刻翘了起来。这么快就来如此刺激的动作，大大出乎他的意料。云红的手更是有意无意地在他敏感处撩拨，鼓起来的阴部被这个陌生女人摸到让他很是尴尬。\n\n他忽然想到，自己的老婆是否现在也正在如此这般地服务别的男人？心中竟呼的生出一股醋意——那种他很久以前才有过的酸溜溜的感觉。\n\n他手下再也不客气，开始在她的乳房上更加大胆地揉捏起来。她的乳罩只罩住了她乳房的一半多一点，而且是松垮地搭在上面，他甚至能很容易地在里面摸到她的乳尖。\n\n他后来才发现她的乳罩扣子不知何时已经解开了，乳罩在带裙里形同虚设。她在他的揉捏下似乎疼痛地呻吟起来，反倒让他有些怜意，手不得不停下来。\n\n她对他的好心似乎很感动，主动将他的手按在自己乳房上，好像是在表示你随便玩好了。在这样的女人身上乱摸让他大感刺激。他已很久没这么摸过女人的乳房了，其实赵岚就从未这么让他随意摸过，稍微碰几下她就要大叫难受。现在就不一样了，云红可以任他尽情的摸玩。他几乎就是将她整个的乳房都捏在手里。\n\n难道现在的三陪就是这样可以任客人在小姐身上乱摸？看到周围男男女女极其出格的淫乱场面，庄建海想到的还是正在“海市豪”陪客的妻子赵岚。\n\n这个亏吃的可是太大了。他万万没想到赵岚现在从事的三陪已变成如此露骨。这比直接卖淫又好到哪里？可赚的钱却不成比例，难怪赵岚几次三番地说想接全程服务的客。\n\n对面的倩英横坐在老王的大腿上，勾着他的脖子，不知在低声地说着什么，嘴巴不时地磨蹭着他的脸，一副娇情的样子，将老王痳得晕晕呼呼。\n\n台上出现一个穿着俗气的女人，开始在迪斯科的强劲旋律下扭动身子，并开始一件件脱去遮在身上的衣物。那真是一个极其淫糜的气氛。庄建海在一个多月后还能记住其中的许多感受的细节，特别清晰的是云红雪白光滑的皮肤在手里揉捏的那种销魂感觉。\n\n后面车厢里的乘客的声音将他从回忆中惊醒。他们玩够了开始一边穿衣服一边在朦浓的昏暗中结帐。女人的上半身还裸露在幽暗的车厢里。\n\n赵岚胯坐在男人的腿上，一手搂着他的脖子，另一手在他的阴茎上的加快了套弄的速度。她能从客人的喘息声中知道客人会有何种需要。男人将嘴张开对着她的双唇亲吻，好像要吸尽唇她嘴唇上的口红。她慢慢张开嘴唇，让他更尽兴地热烈对吻。\n\n以前她是从不让客人直接接吻她的嘴的，体液的接触总是让她厌恶。但现在这种接吻已是家常便饭，一个晚上她要被这么吻数十次。有时还被迫接受法式亲吻，让客人的舌头在嘴里搅乎，或者让客人将她的舌头含进嘴里。最讨厌的是客人嘴对嘴地逼她喝酒，那种受辱的感受非常强烈。\n\n男人的口腔带着浓厚的烟酒味，对受惯了的赵岚来说已不再那么难以忍受。让她难以忍受的，还是他在她乳房上的双手给她带来强烈的刺激。他早已拉下她的乳罩，两手完全自由地在她的乳房上揉捏把玩。为了摆脱这种玩弄，只能想法尽快让他泄欲。\n\n她用手亲捏他阴茎上的包皮，上下快速搓动着，增强的刺激让他对着她的嘴更大地喘息。她手里已沾上了从他阴茎里渗出的一丝液体，她知道让他达到高潮还要加把劲。\n\n他两手移到下面，从她的裙子下伸进去，将她的内裤往下拉到他大腿处不能再拉为止。她的阴部基本上暴露在他的阴茎前方。她暗叹口气，没有阻止他的侵犯，继续为他手淫，同时更主动地和他接吻，想让他分散底下的动作。\n\n他开始用手在她的阴唇里扣捏，另一手缕玩她的阴毛。还好，似乎他只是想玩弄玩弄她的阴部，并不打算用阴茎往里面捅，否则那又会是一番纠缠。\n\n她安心地继续用手刺激着他的生殖器，手里的肉棒越来越坚硬，还不时地在她手中跳动。她知道她的阴部很快将会沾满一大片令人恶心的淫液。不过这已是不坏的结果了，但愿不要将她的裙子也弄得一塌糊涂。\n\n他从嘴唇里伸出了魔鬼般的舌头，探入她的口腔，在她嘴里开始肆虐地挺进。她将嘴张得更大，好让他得以尽兴。在这种快要达到他高潮的时候她不愿打断他的兴奋，将他刺激到这种程度已很费劲。而且真的不让他占这个便宜很可能会得罪客人，所以只能任他在嘴里得寸进尺地大占便宜。\n\n火热的肉棒在手里越来越坚硬，眼看就要快到尽头。他突然将她的屁股猛地往他大腿根部一抱，阴茎上的龟头直接抵在了她的阴唇口上，再要前进就可以探入里面。\n\n真是遇到了狡猾的老手。她嗯呀地回拒着，决心只能让他到此为止。用手将他的阴茎向上拉起一点，错开她阴唇的位置，将龟头抵在阴毛里，更快速地用手摩擦。他没有强求，只是一手按住她的后脑，更猛烈地压住她的嘴在她嘴里乱搅着舌头，另一手则抓住了她的一个乳房快速抓捏着，捏得她几乎疼的要叫出来。\n\n高潮猛的爆发了。一股湿漉漉的火热的液体在赵岚的阴部上方的阴毛里流开，粗大的阴茎连续在她的手心中跳动，他整个身子向前连挺几下，似是在配合他的每一次喷射，以得到更多的快感。\n\n她继续快速用手抚慰着他的肉棒，直到他松开她的头让她的嘴离开大口大口地喘气。\n\n她歇了一口气，从桌子上取出两张纸巾将他的阴茎包住，然后小心地将内裤卷起包住糊满她整个阴部的浓稠的淫液。对着这个满意地喘着气的男人妩媚地娇笑献殷，两手勾住他的脖子再次献上一个温柔的亲吻。\n\n庄建海沿着西藏南路向人民广场慢慢地开着。脑海里又转到赵岚的身上。她现在是否正在某个男人的怀里被人姿意地玩弄？还是……\n\n他知道自己最近想这些想得太多了。这么不潇洒还怎么吃这碗饭？更惶论让赵岚真去作全程服务了。自从他上次去了“新得来”舞厅后脑子就一直充满赵岚裸露在男人怀里的幻觉。\n\n他猛地摇了摇头，知道自己又在毫无益处地胡思乱想。用劲捏了一下方向盘后他两眼职业性地向街边的人群中溜过去，在每一对男女身上巡视。\n\n一对男女靠在树干上紧紧地搂着，女人叉开了两腿，让男人的腿插在中间。另有一对男女挤在一个不易令人察觉的墙角，两张脸完全贴在一起。成双成对的恋人也是上海夜间街头一大艳景。女人们的衣裙这几年随着生活水平的提高变得越来越非常暴露和性感。\n\n一个娇艳的倩影刚好从他的侧镜中闪过，让他的脑海里又闪现出云红俏艳的容颜和她迷人的肉体。庄建海的思绪再次回到那天在“新得来”舞厅里的那一个销魂的夜晚。\n\n“新得来”舞厅的确太过淫乱了。庄建海在云红的身上可以说上下摸了个透。好像是要验证他心里最后一点疑惑，当他的手摸向云红内裤时，她不仅半点拒绝的意思都没有，还主动分开两腿，让他在她的阴部隔着一层内裤随意摸捏。他几乎就要将手指隔着裤子插进她的阴道了。\n\n这已经远远超过了他所认可的三陪的底线。但似乎里面的三陪小姐都是如此。而且这种摸捏还只是开始。\n\n赵岚也是象云红这样接客的吗？他一直没有这样询问妻子。他实在不想让她难堪。她最初去做三陪还是他极力劝服的。让赵岚这样保守的女人去干那种事是要费不少口舌的。没想到现在的三陪变得如此赤裸裸，纵是一惯潇洒的他也感到有些难以接受。倒是赵岚居然能够承受这样性质的三陪，让他大为吃惊。也许赵岚所在的“海市豪”并不像“新得来”这样出格？\n\n庄建海想起云红的手一开始就在他的裤裆部位不时地轻捏，一双巧手的刺激隔着裤子传到他阳具上，那真是刺激无比。在庄建海几次拒绝了她邀他跳舞的邀请后她干脆就拉下了他裤子拉链，将手伸进里面隔着薄薄的内裤把玩起他的鼓鼓的肉棒。这种大胆的服务让庄建海大为吃惊。这时的他全身的燥热已难以抵挡，在她的手的巧妙搓揉下肉棒立刻就膨胀到了最大状态。但他还是想进一步试探她到底能服务到什么程度。他问她能否将她的手直接伸进去弄。\n\n不出他的意料，云红竟真的伸进他的外裤里拉下他的内裤，将他挺立的阴茎暴露出来，毫不羞涩地对他意味深长的一笑，就用手掳着他的肉棒，开始上下搓揉起上面的嫩皮。\n\n他从来未曾受过如此待遇。女人的手在他肉棒上温柔的感觉强烈地刺激起他的性欲，他紧搂住她的细腰，靠在沙发上尽情享受着异性的手淫服务。这是他从未享受过的服务。简直比直接趴在女人身上做爱还要刺激。他曾见过男人在他面包车后厢里让妓女为他手淫。当时他还大为不解，打手枪不就自己做就行了？还得花钱让女人帮忙？现在看来那人并不像自己以为的那样“港督”。手淫的感觉竟能如此奇妙。\n\n他在她的搓揉下坚持了好一会，突然他意识到自己即将射精。这样子不是要将自己的裤子射脏一大片？\n\n看他低头犹豫的样子，云红马上就理会出他的心思。她放开握住他肉棒的手，两手伸进裙子里，不慌不忙地抬了一下屁股，在庄建海难以置信的眼光下从裙子里面脱下了她的内裤。笑着回到他的胯下，将她那粉红色的内裤套在了他的肉棒上，非常善解人意地对他轻声说道，“侬就射在这个里厢吧。”\n\n庄建海那一瞬真是惊呆了。她不是就是光着屁股了吗？\n\n好像是要验证给他看，云红竟跨坐到他的腿上，裸露的阴部就直接坐上去，他能隔着裤子清晰地感受到她毛扎扎的阴毛磨着他的大腿。\n\n云红搂住他的脖子，红唇轻轻印在他嘴上，慢慢用力压住他，在他的嘴唇上揉擦着，像是邀请他的热吻。被这么揉情的女人搂着接吻，腿上摩擦着她的阴部，肉棒上还套着女性刚刚退下的内裤，一种极其异样的刺激将庄建海的全身包裹住。\n\n他两手干脆伸进她的裙子里，直接摸索着她光滑的腿部髋部甚至是小腹部，再往下就是她的浓密的阴毛，在下去就摸到了她的裂缝处。他惊的差点叫出声来。她毫不在意他的侵犯，反而用一手伸进裙子下面再次开始为他手淫，这时肉棒在她的绸质的内裤下面感觉更加美妙了。\n\n庄建海彻底陶醉了。他忘情地接受她的热吻，两手在她阴部姿意乱摸，同时享受着她在他肉棒上越来越快的搓动。他一阵颤抖，浓烈的精液勃然而出，全部射在她的内裤之中。那种舒畅的感觉至今还记忆犹新。\n\n庄建海每每想到云红脱了内裤为自己手淫的情景，他下面就开始发硬。\n\n突然他醒悟出为何赵岚经常要洗内裤，而且有时会一下洗两条甚至三条。这么看来赵岚确是为客人作这种手淫服务了，估计摸过她隐私的男人大概已不记其数了。这样想来，庄建海心中又开始隐隐作疼。\n\n他叹息了一声，知道如果赵岚真要去作全套服务，他还是会有很强的心理反应。真是不争气。他在心里暗骂自己。不就是这么回事吗？有什么放不下的。\n\n正在这时，路口一对男女向他招手。他心中大喜。今晚生意还真不错，能一晚接到两笔生意的日子越来越少了。\n\n在洗手间擦干下体湿漉漉的精液，换上一条新的内裤，赵岚有些疲惫地回到长椅上，等着下一个客人的挑选。\n\n一个多小时也未接到新客，长椅上的小姐渐渐多起来，看着墙上的时钟慢慢接近午夜，赵岚越来越失望。\n\n看来今晚就只接到那一个客人了。\n\n虽说她时不时会有整个晚上接不到一个客人的情形，但她还是很想在回家前能够再做一笔。但午夜已近，看来是没有多大希望了。不知道庄建海今晚生意如何，总不会好到哪去。再这样下去，可能真的得直接到大街上拉客了。那可就太丢人了。她可不像段沪生的老婆那么放得开，经常在回家的路上还能拉住客人打一炮。赵岚无论如何是拉不下那个脸面在大街上对着每个路过的男人调情。\n\n正在她胡思乱想之际，一个魁梧的身材风风火火地闯进来。一个响亮的带口音的山东人的声音对着领班就是一通连珠发问。\n\n原来是个外地人。以前赵岚打心眼里不愿陪外地客，不过现在她早已不在乎客人是否是外地人了。往往外地人给的小费倒反而多。她摆出她惯常的笑容，对着这个山东人扫来的目光妩媚地一笑。这时的长椅上还有十几个小姐，个个都摆出了最迷人的笑脸，都想争取这个也许是今晚最后一个客人。\n\n山东人对着领班说，“有没有上海小姐？我要找个上海小姐。不要外地来的。听人说上海小姐很有风味，我这次是特地来找上海小姐的。”\n\n赵岚眼睛一亮。她是椅子上不多的上海人之一。领班让她们几个上海小姐站起来，让山东人挑选。山东人有些疑惑地对着她们上下打量了几眼，说道：“没有年轻一点的啦？”\n\n对他粗鲁的语气赵岚保持着她本质的克制，脸上依然媚笑着，按下心中的不满。长年的职业经验告诉她，要赚钱就得忍耐。\n\n果然山东人眼睛盯住了她的乳部，似乎对她的身材非常满意，不等领班回答他就一把抓住了赵岚的胳膊大声说着：“好吧好吧，就是她了。”\n\n一边说着一边往里面走。\n\n在其他几双嫉妒的眼睛下赵岚挽住客人将他向里面引。\n\n直率的山东汉子一坐下就将赵岚抱到他粗大的腿上坐着，一手搂着她的脖子，一手开始摸她身子，急不可待的在她身上摸捏玩弄。赵岚后来知道他是刚下飞机，坐了出租就来到这里，早有些等不及的味道。\n\n赵岚职业性地娇笑着，开始跟他调情打趣。就像第一个客人一样，这个山东人好像也不太在意这种调情，嘴里嗯嗯啊啊的应着，注意力还都是放在在她身上乱摸的手里，不住地赞叹着她：“上海女人的皮肤都真他奶奶的又白又滑，俺听人说上海人的皮白，都是因为这里的自来水里漂白粉多，是真事儿吗？”\n\n对他这种憨实的样子，赵岚真的笑了出来，也不答他的问话，只是轻轻将脸凑过去，在他耳畔和颈子上摩挲，对他哈着香气。山东人被她果真的弄得有些迷乱，在她光滑的腿上不停地摸着，嘴上还在唠叨：“你们上海女人的肉可真他奶奶的嫩哎。”\n\n突然，他问她：“你们这儿有带铺的包厢吗？怎么算钱？俺俩开一间来好好玩玩。”他的问话一下将赵岚惊醒，天啊，他不是要全套服务吧？她的心跳一下子加快起来，想到自己即将要真正做这第一次全套服务，心中立刻慌张起来。\n\n未等她回答，山东人将正在另一个桌子边上的老板娘招了过来，问她说，“你们这包厢怎么算钱？”\n\n老板娘满面春风地走过来，笑嘻嘻地说道：“老板要包包厢啊？按小时包的话一个小时是一百元，小姐的小费您要和她另说。不过，您这位晶晶从不去包厢接客的。要不您等着，我给您再找几个小姐来。”\n\n“什么？”\n\n山东人狐疑地看着赵岚，不明白她为何不去包厢接客。\n\n赵岚尴尬异常。要不要接？为何不接？对着他疑惑的眼光，赵岚赶紧解释说：“是这样的，进这里的包厢都是要做那种服务的。我从来都是只在外面的素台陪客人喝酒跳舞，从不进包厢陪客，所以……”\n\n山东人像是明白了这里的规矩。很是惋惜地捏着她的身子说：“你从不在包厢接客？你从不在包厢接客？”\n\n赵岚突然明白再不抓紧说出来就要失去今天这最后的客人。\n\n她涨红了脸，一下子鼓起了勇气，对他低声说道：“如果我陪你去包厢，你付多少钱？”\n\n山东人看她突然改变主意，大是高兴，立刻就说，“你要多少？”\n\n“嗯……一个小时，两百。”\n\n“什么？这么贵？一个小时两百？”\n\n赵岚的脸更加红了。她怀疑自己叫的价也许太高了。\n\n山东人看着默默不语的赵岚，狠狠地说道：“好，好，看在你是第一次，俺就付你两百。两个小时，四百。来全套。如何？”\n\n见他这么爽快就答应她开出的价钱，她心头惊喜交加，简直有点喜出望外。但想到要陪他两个小时，心中立刻突突地起伏不定。这回可是要来真的了，她紧张的心情就像那第一天来“海市豪”上班时的一模一样。毕竟要跨出这最后的一步，成为一个地地道道妓女了，和她第一次下海做三陪一样，这将是她的人生的另一个最大的转变。\n\n迟早得过这一关，像以前一样，会很快适应的。她在心里暗暗安慰自己。想到自己即将跨过这最关键的一步，心中的惴惴不安真是难以形容。早就想好了要面对这一刻，但当这一刻真的到来时，她发现自己好像还是毫无思想准备。\n\n正不知该如何往下说，老板娘领着三个小姐走了过来。她们都听见了山东人最后的话。一听说山东人肯出四百，她们三个小姐眼都红了。她们分别拉住他的衣服，都嗲嗲地要陪他。\n\n山东人将她们都抖掉摆脱了她们的纠缠，指着赵岚对老板娘说就是她了，让她去开个包房，要两个小时。\n\n那三个上海小姐开始在边上冷言冷语地嘲讽起来：“呦，还真格寇勿出伊能卖轧许多。”“勿是说勿卖的吗？我还以为伊是个……”“勿是勿卖的啦，宁家是要卖个好价钱。”“格种宁啊……”“伊格会做啊？全套会勿啦？”“宁家什么勿会呀？侬阿勿要小瞧宁……”她们一边往外走一边你一句我一句的说着，让赵岚听了心里非常难受。平常还都是挺要好的姐妹，真到这时说翻脸就翻脸。\n\n突然，老板娘有些为难地对这个山东人说，“哎呀，真不好意思，我们舞厅一点钟就要关门了，我只能给您开一个小时。怎样？”\n\n山东人有些火了，“什么？你们上海怎么搞的？一点就要关门？在俺们那儿一玩就玩通宵，一点钟才当是开始。”\n\n“哎呀，您不知道啊，最近市里为了扫黄新出的规定，各娱乐场所一律不准在一点以后营业。我们也是没有办法啊，谁不想挣钱？公安局的半夜真的来查啊，要是抓到我们就完了。”\n\n赵岚再次感到了人情的冷暖。老板娘说的规定确是实情，但外面大门关上后里面的客人待到很晚的是常有的事。估计今天自己突然同意到包厢里面接客有些激恼了老板娘，现在故意来刁难一下。平时老板娘就一直劝她去包厢接客，让她想开来，现在她真想开了老板娘又不高兴了。\n\n山东人真有些火了，“不行，要开就开两个小时，俺不管你们什么时候关门。要不行，俺就带小姐出去。”\n\n说着他一把拉起赵岚就往外走。\n\n赵岚脑子里一片空白，不知该怎么应付此事。四百块啦，要是不接这笔生意庄建海肯定会说自己蠢。这么好的事真是很难碰到。但真要陪他出去？到哪去呢？自己还从未陪客人出过“海市豪”的门，这么半夜了，真要陪他去旅馆吗？\n\n犹豫之中赵岚已被这个山东人拉出了舞厅。\n\n赵岚还指望老板娘做最后挽留，但她一句话都没说，就眼看着他们走出了大门。",

He recently gave a talk at Next.js Conf on the tech stack to build with Web3 technologies. Here are some notes that I took on the talk.\n\n## Web3\n\n* The decentralized web\n* Web1: read-only web. You needed to be a dev to create; everyone else was a consumer.\n* Web2: read/write/interactive web. Anyone can be a creator.\n* Web3: web protocols (SSH, TCP, HTTP) + native payments & state\n* Buying on the internet vs building the internet\n\n### Attributes of Web3\n\n* Decentralized\n* Ownership of data/platform\n* Native digital payments\n* Self-sovereign identity\n* Distributed trustless & robust infra\n* Open and public backends\n* Apps compete on interfaces for the same data\n\n## Types of Applications\n\n### Play-to-Earn Gaming\n\n* **Fortnite**. Web3-fying a Web2 game. 100% of money to this game cannot be taken out. Axie Infinity allows players to earn tokens by playing. 95% of money goes back to the users/players of the game.\n\n### DeFi & Stable Currencies\n\n* Inflation and government crisis in Venezuela, Lebanon, Zimbabwe, Sudan\n* People need to leave the country because they've lost their ability to provide for themselves and their families\n* Stable coins are pegged against the US dollar; people can get paid in these instead of their local currencies\n* 1.7B people are unbanked; Web3 can provide access to this under-served demographic\n\n### Social Media\n\n* **Web2**: exploitation, advertising, zero ownership. Exchange your content for hearts and likes (gain followers)\n* **Web3**: tokenization, content ownership (follower gains)\n\n### Music\n\n* [Audius](https://audius.co/)\n\n### Blogging\n\n* [Mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/)\n\n## Building Web3\n\n### API Layer\n\n* How do you query data from blocks on the blockchain? The data isn't as easy to query as Web2 databases.\n* [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/).\n\n### Off Chain Data\n\n* [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network/).\n\n### Video Streaming\n\n* [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/). 10x cheaper than any other centralized alternative.\n\n### File Storing\n\n* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/). Decentralized file storage network; not guaranteed how long the files will be stored\n* [Arweave.org](https://www.arweave.org/). Protocol that allows you to store files permanently.\n\n### Authentication & Wallets\n\n* Public key encryption using some time of wallet\n* [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)\n* [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/)\n\n## Core Infrastructure\n\n* Typical infrastructure + smart contracts\n* Progressive decentralization --> full decentralization\n* Client framework, Blockchain, Client library, Wallet\n* **Building a dapp**: Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Fantom, Near\n* **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**: learning this will allow you to build on several different blockchains\n* **Starter Stack**: Next.js, Hardhat, Ethersj.js, Metamask\n* <https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth>", "timestamp": 1635687718, "digest": "lRwew3vHIEJwdJh3SB1cPP_Y0teDKhvbrsy-8rE3cE0", "contributor": "0xbaD39682B85a8F2B210E3394a17053C6d38EfAD7"}
{"id": "A_QVLl8FWupmGd1O66DeVahumbSVCOs1e7WvPCj8gy8", "title": "1SWIPEAWAY", "body": "**I think it hit me at some point during the Uber ride to her house: this could be the most important hook-up in human history. And the scariest. I know it sounds stupid and indulgent to say that, especially coming from another hetero-normative dude in black Christian Diors like me. (Whatever, they were knock-offs.) But given the extraordinary features of this interaction, along with its consequences for how people think of themselves, I really don’t think it’s an exaggeration. All of this is true by the way. I don’t have the time to make any of this up, and frankly I sucked pretty bad in Language Arts. My grade-school teachers will bug out if they read this.**\n\n**My band was doing a show in Salt Lake City–you know, Mormon utopia in the middle of the desert. Our next gig in Boise had been cancelled for reasons we didn’t entirely understand. When you’re on the road you just kind of run with things, I guess. We decided to hang out in Utah for a couple of days. Somebody said we could “backpack in the watercolor meadows of the Uintahs”. Sounded like a good time. We do retrowave electronica stuff, lots of synthy sounds with flashing lights and voice effects. Everyone’s into the eighties again, even the Mormons it turns out.**\n\n**I still don’t think of myself as a hook-up guy, even after all these years on the road. I’m serious. It’s not something I enjoy or even particularly like. I see hook-ups as one of the rites of being a traveling musician, or maybe even a curse. It’s like how prime ministers have to shake hands with people they don’t necessarily like. I’m a reluctant diplomat of the grunge scene. Everything that guys like David Bowie did make total sense to me. They turned their lives upside-down just to try and find something real. I wonder if they ever found it–when I did, it scared the crap out of me.**\n\n**The first Tinder girl I met in Utah was one of those “it’s for a good cause”-type chicks. I’m not trying to offend anybody, it’s just the only way I can think to describe her. What annoys me about those girls is that they all have the same personality. They’re almost breathless to prove how angry they are about all the *right* things. It makes me feel like everything I know is wrong or something. You just sit there and listen and drown in their syndicated outrage. I swiped right for shallow reasons, yes. The messed-up thing is that I anticipated my annoyance as I glanced at her pics. I was shamelessly undeterred.**\n\n**Her peach spaghetti-strap top swallowed most of my attention, even as she soliloquized about non binary love and dying pandas. (OK, I made that last one up.) Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail. It was less a conversation and more a kind of reciting on her part–anyone could’ve been sitting in front of her. I wonder if she would’ve acted differently if she knew who I was. A few hours later, I finished softly somewhere in the bobbing bramble of hair in my lap. It was depressing. She fixed her ponytail in the mirror, checked her phone, then quickly left.**\n\n**I don’t usually let people get to know me too well, not even my bandmates. I mean we drop acid together sometimes, bro-bonding stuff, that kind of thing. That’s about it. Even with girls, I’m a sex-in-the-dark kind of dude. They probably think I’m weird but I never ask. When the peach-top pedant was leaving I gave her one of our albums on cassette tape. It was awkward (“Uh, thanks…?”) but I feel like it’s the best I can do.**\n\n**Somewhere in the discussion of her saintly works, she had mentioned something her uncle had seen in a mall near downtown Salt Lake City. It was like an upright human with amphibian skin or something. Her uncle was a janitor who cleaned floors there late at night. The thing had come out of a basement stairwell, looked at him for a moment, then turned right back around and disappeared. The really crazy thing was that her uncle said he felt some kind of emotion deep in his chest that he never felt before, sort of like how you feel when you lock eyes with a stranger that looks inexplicably familiar. She reported all of this as a joke, rattling it off at blinding speed in her machine-gun dialogue of goodspeak. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, though, even when we started making out.**\n\n**The guys in our band like to joke about the golden thumb–it’s when you start a streak of matching with the city’s hottest women. That’s millennial serendipity at its finest. Isaac had the golden thumb in Topeka and we didn’t see him until Michigan, but in Michigan the algorithms failed him. It works in mysterious ways. When I matched with this Clarissa girl from Provo, I decided Salt Lake City *was* a promised land, or at least my own Topeka. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, nor has that condition of not-knowing changed. But let me back up...**\n\n**Clarissa was one of those one-pic profiles, which is risky. You’re betting that this single picture is so alluring that the opposite swiper needs no further proof of your hotness. In her case, it was a win. She was wearing a black romper striped orange, yellow, green; her hair was blue and cut boyishly short. The obligatory septum piercing made her nose look like a jewelled accessory. Style, attitude, cuteness. Bad-ass but delicate. The interesting part: the picture wasn’t a picture but actually a moving boomerang, one of those images perpetually repeating two seconds of movement.**\n\n**The boomerang showed Clarissa from behind, jogging in-place on a sidewalk with her face looking coyly back into the camera. I don’t need to mention the advantages such an angle affords those of the requisite affinities–but there was something else. Something *else.* There looked to be a kind of independent movement beneath the fabric around her tailbone, like an appendage that was rising and falling as she ran. You could *just* make out the outline. It couldn’t be…**\n\n**I put my phone away and started pumping some beat-mixes to get my mind straight. Things couldn’t be *that* freaky in Utah. My headphones weren’t loud enough to block out the image. The thing that bothered me most was that my attraction to her hadn’t waned; if anything, I felt *more* attracted. Had I been watching too many shapeshifter animes? That was probably the case regardless.**\n\n**Even so, there was no doubt that Clarissa’s festive romper was hiding a full-grown tail–like, none at all.  I watched the boomerang over and over again, turning my phone this way and that. There was no other conclusion. I considered calling my bandmates for brotherly support but in the end opted for privacy. Imagine if they heard I was seeing a girl with a *tail.* Literally a tail dangling down her rear. Her caption read: “Wyoming-raised, Utah-grown. I don’t want to go to Paris or Prague. Take me to a hidden place we can share secrets.” It was just too much.**\n\n**The first time I met Clarissa it was somewhere near State St. It’s hard for me to keep track of the roads because they’re all numbered on a grid based on their proximity to the Mormon temple. Clarissa told me that this system makes it easier to get around and not get lost. She laughed when I disagreed. We ate vegan wraps in one of those generic Salt Lake plazas made of Mexican eateries and Asian stores. Clarissa explained that she ate healthy when it suited her schedule and mood, which made her “a seasonal vegan”. It was summertime in Salt Lake; she wore a dirty-green tank-top and gray denim shorts ripped across the thighs; her hair was bluer than Freddie Mercury’s stage lighting.**\n\n**She was one of those girls who was easy to talk to, but from whom you couldn’t allow your attention to waver. Clarissa was no prolific talker. Instead I got a watchful loner vibe, someone you’d see walking along deserted railroad tracks, someone who considered Bjork their private therapist. I kept imagining how I could bring the topic up without coming across as a total creep. “I didn’t know people in Utah had tails...is that common here?” Gross. Maybe something more personal. “That romper you had on does a lot for your tail.” God, no. I settled on: “Can you show me that running move from your profile?”**\n\n**We were walking along the sidewalks in the glow of the street lamps; night had fallen on the strange city made of numbers. Clarissa’s hand was clasped softly in mine. I kept resisting the temptation to look behind her like an idiot. She was pressing me with questions somewhat absently. When I told her my band’s name was Nineteeneightyfornicate, she lost it and started going through all of our pictures on Instagram. That name was Isaac’s idea, not mine! It did have a nice ring to it.**\n\n**She stopped walking and turned on me suddenly.**\n\n**“You know, don’t you?”**\n\n**“Know–know what?” I stammered lamely.**\n\n**“Oh come off the bullshit, man. You’ve known this whole time.” Staring me frankly in the eyes, she took my hand and ran it along something long, firm, cylindrical on her backside. My heartbeat quickened and a soft moan emitted from my throat. Clarissa giggled and threw my hand away.**\n\n**“Any secrets you’d like to share with me?”**\n\n**I looked at her for a second, processing. “I already told you my dirty band name–”**\n\n**“Right,” she scoffed. “I hope you come up with something better by tomorrow.”**\n\n**She turned and began receding into the jasmine-bordered shadows. I realized that we had been surrounded by cats ever since we started walking. They now trailed her in unison like a row of ducklings down the sidewalk.**\n\n**“I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE A CAT PERSON!” I yelled hopelessly.**\n\n**She laughed and raised a long middle finger into the air without turning around. I sighed and began walking in the other direction back to my hotel. I opened my phone to a new text message from Clarissa. It didn’t say anything; she’d only sent three cat emojis with their tails in the air. I marveled at how little I knew what in the hell was going on. *I just stroked a human tail. That really happened.* And yet, perversely, I couldn’t wait for the next day.**\n\n***....Any secrets you’d like to share with me…***\n\n**I’ll come clean–that night wasn’t the first time I googled “humans with tails”. There had been drunken nights alone that I obsessed over the idea. My thoughts were ransacked by half-humanoids risen from primordial tetrapods, dripping with sea-foam and tails dragging in the sand. I told you I was a weird guy. To this point, the greatest harm all this had done was butcher my online algorithms–I would get ads for kinky Halloween costumes, which routinely raised some eyebrows.**\n\n***She could be a government spy on some troll-job,* I thought to myself. The idea tormented me for several hours. What was worse, I thought, the CIA using search history and store-bought accessories to play with my mind, or the possibility that I had met some kind of hybrid human with a rope of flesh swinging from her backside? The little bit of ganja I had left made my speculations thicker and more confusing. She had to be real. Why would the government waste time mind-fucking a guy from a band named Nineteeneightyfornicate? I went from that to wondering what she ate when she was stoned.**\n\n**Before I knew it, I was stepping out onto the curb in front of her house in my black knock-off Christian Diors. Who was this profane intruder in Provo? An agent *provo*cateur, I grinned to myself. I didn’t know there could be neighborhoods with trees in the desert. Seemed like the Mormons were pretty good landscapers when they weren’t busy granting all their wives eternal life. Who knew! Clarissa lived in a blue house with a quaint little front porch, one of those places that really has the picture-book mailbox with a perfect red lever pointed upwards.**\n\n**“Were you tailing me earlier?”**\n\n**Clarissa’s voice came out of nowhere, disembodied. I looked around me wildly, my unease ratcheting up several notches. A hand rested on my shoulder from behind; I wheeled around.**\n\n**“Chill out, freak,” Clarissa laughed. She looked at the tree next to her, brushing off some twigs. “My nest is up *there*.”**\n\n**“Your–nest?”**\n\n**“It’s a joke, heard of those before?”**\n\n**I suddenly noticed she was wearing a yellow Walkman cassette player. We always BS that if we meet a chick with a portable cassette player, we’ll automatically drop to one knee, no questions asked.**\n\n**“So you’re that much of a dork that you listen to cassette tapes in 2020?!”**\n\n**“And you’re telling me you don’t have one on you right now?”**\n\n**Wordlessly, I raised my band’s cassette tape out of my pocket.**\n\n**“Give me that,” she laughed, snatching it out of my hand. “Maybe we *are* a match!”**\n\n**I followed her inside.**\n\n**“My roommates are out for the weekend”–glancing at the couch–”you can just shove all that shit over, sorry. We have beer, lemonade, soda...or maybe you like the harder stuff?”**\n\n**I settled in and tried to relax, taking in what was around me. Nothing odd really. There was a crystal salt lamp whose warm glow looked afloat in the dim room. I could faintly sniff sage. A white cat met my gaze and darted out of sight, desperate to be forgotten.**\n\n**“You don’t get many visit–”**\n\n**The sentence was robbed from my throat. Clarissa was putting a glass of Jack Daniels on the table, naked beside the burgundy lingerie faintly interrupting her skin. I could see the thing in plain sight–it was moving from side to side in a sort of carefree, feline attitude, *curling* back on itself this way and that, hairless and freckled as it tapered to its tip. It was a magnificent tail, too magnificent to be an accident. I closed my eyes and took a shot of the Jack.**\n\n**“I know what you’re thinking,” Clarissa smiled. She sat down next to me, running her hand along my shoulder. “You’re thinking ‘it’s impossible, this can’t actually be happening.’”**\n\n**“You must be psychic,” I shot back dryly.**\n\n**“You’re thinking,” she pressed on, “that science eliminates the possibility of my existence.”**\n\n**I didn’t say anything.**\n\n**“What’s wrong, rock star, you don’t want to play along? I know that you know it all–how they say a human tail is only an abomination of the coccyx, a *vestige* of the behind that we all left behind...right?”**\n\n**“What are you getting at here, Clarissa?”**\n\n**She took a swig of lemonade and rolled the juice around her mouth, her gaze unbroken.**\n\n**“Nothing you haven’t already thought of ten thousand times, but I’ll humor you. If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”**\n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.**\n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.**\n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”**\n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”**\n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.**\n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”**\n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am. Clarissa hasn’t left my side since; we’re in Cheyenne now. There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think: I’ve never been happier–or more deeply, inconsolably frightened.**", "timestamp": 1635688434, "digest": "56648re9YKSnaRoHNgg2OrkLba9o04K-E3bNS5Hdiqc", "contributor": "0xBbb538b84ED95aBa94585c6cE7C2f8790dBfE53B"}

The name was later changed to *Writelier* but by this time I had already left the platform/community.\n\nI initially joined the community to build a writing habit. And I think it paved the way for me to eventually venture out on my own on my [website](https://david-neuman.com) (which I am actually rebuilding [here](https://david-neuman.vercel.app)). It was a place where anyone could sign up and start writing in a community with like-minded people. It was motivating and incredible.\n\nUnfortunately, the site was eventually taken down by its creator. Users were given an opportunity to port their data/writing before its gates were shuttered. Since I only discovered about the platform’s demise months too late, my data was all but lost.\n\n## Writing to the Blockchain\n\nDeploying *anything* to the blockchain is immutable; it can and will never change. Writing and saving my thoughts and ideas on Mirror means that this data can never be lost. That’s an amazing thing. And it only touches the surface of what’s possible.\n\n## Experimentation\n\nI’m primarily writing here as an experiment. I have my own website and blog where I will continue to post fleshed-out articles and newsletter editions based on my interests. However, I’m thinking about using Mirror as a place to record random thoughts and unfinished ideas. Maybe release some articles as NFTs to experiment. I see it as a new, thriving space that I’m assuming many of its users are trying to figure out for themselves.\n\n## Parting Thoughts\n\n### Editor\n\nI use [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) as a CMS/editor for my blog. Ghost’s editor is intuitive, elegant and makes writing fun. This editor feels similarly beautiful. I like the fact that there are predefined blocks as well as a shortcut to using them. It would be even better if you could simply press `/` and have the blocks appear, sort of how it works in Ghost.\n\n### Scattered and Excited\n\nReading back the above sections, it doesn’t appear that there is any flow to this writing. My ideas are scattered and all over the place. I think that reflects my excitement of the platform. I’m curious to see how users will monetize their writing via editions and minting their own NFTs.

They are crypto-native objects, very similar to ETH and others, freely transmittable between wallets and interchangeable for other coins. Every kitty is unique with each element being codified to generate a unique combination of eyes, colour, tail etc.\n\nKids used to collect stickers and now grown-ups collect these ‘cards’ where every single one is unique, their ownership can be viewed on-chain, making them a perfect collectible to boast about. Once they got traction, the amount of trading activity in them was so large that it clogged the network, substantially slowing down all other transactions. Ultimately, with the excitement reaching its peak, one of them was sold for $170k.\n\n$170k for a digital image of a cat? If that’s not an indicator of a market bubble then it’s hard to imagine what it might be (it was). With the speculative mania fading away kitties slowed down, prices normalised and for most people it remained a memory of the good old bubble days.\n\nAs it turns out, however, this was yet another fundamental innovation in the crypto land, which opened doors to new realities.\n\n#### ***Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs)***\n\nThat’s the official name of a crypto ‘standard’ (think of it as a file type - pdf, jpeg etc). The ‘normal’ coins follow a certain standard which defines their properties, one of them being a free ability to swap one into another. The NFT standard allows for more creativity where unique content can be created right on the blockchain and can function as part the wider ecosystem with all the benefits of composability. In short, it allows to create digital art, collectibles and many other types of objects which were unthinkable before this.\n\n*Digital Art?* Sure:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d7a7bdb-ac84-48db-bcb6-06755937bf8b\\_2274x1076.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d7a7bdb-ac84-48db-bcb6-06755937bf8b\\_2274x1076.png)\n\nThe logic of this is intuitive yet questionable. If physical art is understandable and has both investment and aesthetic value, this is little bit more confusing. Aesthetics - sure, but why can’t you just screenshot the same image? That’s the question that’s most often asked about these objects. Turns out, when a limited number of digital assets is created and you can prove you are rightful owner of the *original*, people attach value to it. Drawing parallels to the physical world, we might enjoy a Water Lilly Pond poster in our apartments but the original is far more desirable.\n\nNow let’s go one step deeper. For those of us engaged in social media, what’s the representation of our identity there?\n\n*Avatars - *how much would you be willing to pay for your profile picture to be a) unique; b) designed by a famous artist; c) you would have proof of ownership that it’s only yours; d) it easily sellable online at any time?

It is also in aide of The DAOists in their mission of educating and converting the world into “DAOism.”\n\n[https://discord.gg/dEJFDKHvCp](https://discord.gg/dEJFDKHvCp)\n\nDAOhaus is playing a playing a game. Every week, DAOhaus does their weekly “Haus Party” chat on their discord server. During this event there are [POAP](https://poap.xyz/)s distributed to attendees. If you are the owner of the POAP you are then able to enter the “War Games.” This game is a DAO and is about as open ended as possible. The direction of the game is decided by making proposals in the DAO, and holding votes. Basically, doing the thing that DAOs do. It truly is a wonderful way to teach about DAO’s and how to use a moloch DAO. So I’m stealing their idea.\n\n## German Art and Slaying Demons\n\n![Slaying Moloch requires Co-Ordination](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dry6Az1t194mgdoARFgE.png?height=719&width=721)\n\nIn [Scott Alexander’s](https://slatestarcodex.com/author/admin/) essay [Meditaions on Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) we learn of a powerful demon Moloch that represents a system humankind hates but lack the tools to co-ordinate and make the changes everyone knows needs to be made.\n\n> There’s [a passage](http://principiadiscordia.com/book/45.php) in the *Principia Discordia* where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. “Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.”\n>\n> The Goddess answers: “What is the matter with that, if it’s what you want to do?”\n>\n> Malaclypse: “But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!”\n>\n> Goddess: “Oh. Well, then stop.”\n>\n> The implicit question is – if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: “Moloch”.\n\nThe Moloch DAO framework seems to have been built around the ideas introduced in Alexander’s analysis of Ginsberg’s poem [Howl](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl). Aiming to create a set of tools humans can use, to address the issues of co-ordination failure and truly take the world into a new direction and slaying the moloch.\n\nDAOhaus brings a whole new level to the story of co-ordination. What they have done, is take the Moloch code and created a user interface in which anybody with a little knowledge of how to navigate [Web3](https://web3.foundation/), can create and/or be a part of a DAO.\n\n> [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/) was [born at ETHBerlin 2019](https://medium.com/odyssy/daohaus-bauhaus-b855cd9db19e), a hackathon project aiming to make it easier (or possible at all) to interact with the [Moloch DAO smart contracts](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch/blob/master/v1_contracts/README.md) in a human-readable way. After a days-long, Club Mate induced frenzy, the very first build of DAOhaus was born! Thus beginning the almost two year journey focused on bringing more open tools for financial coordination to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n[https://medium.com/daohaus-club/haus-launch-bd781bbbf13a](https://medium.com/daohaus-club/haus-launch-bd781bbbf13a)\n\nThe story that I’ve heard, (I was looking everywhere for where I’ve heard, so I may well be taking some artistic liberty here) is something about the original hack group in Berlin rocking out to a band called Bauhaus during EthBerlin 2019. Which, if true, is a very serendipitous event.\n\nIf we look a little deeper, into the history of the German bauhaus art scene, we learn it is built around a philosophy of creating functional art using multidisciplinary skillsets collaborating in new and innovative ways. This began in actual buildings in which the interiors were fitted with all the tools students required to work and collaborate together. In a digital Web3 format, DAOhaus is doing the same thing. Providing a haus of tools for people to collaborate and slay moloch.\n\n> The Bauhaus was founded in 1919 in the city of Weimar by German architect Walter Gropius (1883–1969). Its core objective was a radical concept: to reimagine the material world to reflect the unity of all the arts. Gropius explained this vision for a union of art and design in the Proclamation of the Bauhaus (1919), which described a utopian craft guild combining architecture, sculpture, and painting into a single creative expression. Gropius developed a craft-based curriculum that would turn out artisans and designers capable of creating useful and beautiful objects appropriate to this new system of living.\n\n[https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm)\n\nThe idea is, I am going to create a new DAO. As you may have already guessed, it will be called Boiler DAO. In this case, I put the cart before the horse. I made the token, named after my social media alias, then decided instead of it just taking up space, I might as well use it. The token is not swappable for anything on any exchange. It is a “pure” social token. It may not always be that way.\n\nThe goal of this DAO will be to tell a story. In both the literal sense and the figurative sense. I will begin this DAO and start some of the basic fundamentals. From there, I will let it grow or fade on it’s own.  Creativity in decentralized story telling, at the same time learning about DAO’s, provides a new tool to aide startups who would like to spend their time focusing on the product or service they intend to offer, instead of teaching fundementals of DAOs.\n\n## How the Story Will be Told\n\nHonestly, I don’t know. If I did, then I wouldn’t be honest in my intentions to have a decentralized project. I will start it. I will create videos. These videos will aide anybody who wants to view them in their own journey of creating or participating in a DAO. This will be a large part of the educational aspect of this DAO.\n\nI will do the basics and then the DAO will decide everything else through proposals, this article being the first part of the process. Obviously I’m not going to make a video of myself typing an article but the rest of it I will. I will create the DAO on xDai. I will then create a [safe minion](https://daohaus.club/docs/users/minion/), which will create a [gnosis safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/), controlled by the DAO. I will deposit 9 Million BOILD tokens into the DAO and from that point forward those tokens will be controlled by the DAO.\n\nI will then create a Discord server and a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjlcjNvqwUxRIma1_d05uYA) channel. Again, this will be as bare bones as possible but it is an opportunity to teach how to do this, as it is a pretty vital part of the *process for this DAO.* I say this because there are many ways to form a DAO and I don’t want anybody to come out of this thinking, ok, If I do every step I see here, I will have a DAO. This may very well be true, but you may not have the DAO you want. The point of this exercise, is to show a particular set of tools that I happened to learn about. All I want you to recognize is that they are tools, and you can use many different tools in different combinations to form your own DAO. If you click the link I provided above to The DAOists tools airtable you will get a good overview of some of the other tools available to you.\n\nThere certainly are other forms of social media at our disposal I could set up as well but it will be up to the DAO to decide how that goes. The one thing I will do, beyond the basics, is set up the collab.land bot on the discord. This will allow for distribution of the remaining tokens to people interested in the DAO. I will distribute 1000 tokens, through the bot to anybody that requests them, up until the point that the DAO decides to change that. Being the creator of the discord, I will be the mod there, until there are a few members of the DAO, then the DAO will decide. 500,000 tokens will be deposited into the collab.land bot for distribution purposes.\n\nThe remaining tokens I reserve to keep, as the creator of the token. It will be mostly used during the making of the tutorial videos but maybe one day I will use them to buy a lambo.\n\n![Who Knows?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RQlRj7T29gFxs02IdeBZl.gif?height=187&width=198)\n\nThe price for entry into the DAO will be: one share per one $BOILD token. The token will also be used as the currency to perform actions within the DAO (so if you do propose membership, keep that in mind you will still need some later. You will also need a little wxdai and xdai in your wallet. You can wrap your xdai easily at [WrapEth.com]().  After everything is set up, with the basics, I will then make the first proposal for the beginning of the literal story and gamification of The Boiler DAO.\n\n## Gamification of Boiler DAO\n\nThe idea will be a fictional tale with distributed authorship and each part of the story told after being democratically decided upon by the DAO. A proposal can be a sentence, paragraph, chapter, word, haiku, an edit, a photo…. who knows. Perhaps to entries for the next part of the story are so good it creates a fork in the story, which may even cause a fork in the DAO itself, which would also be super interesting. The point being, the DAO will decide and grow (or fail) as it’s own organism set loose upon the Web3 space.\n\nMy original thought was that, after everything was set up, I would make a proposal for the first line or paragraph and *we* would take it from there. As I was working on this document and doing a few other tasks I was listening in on a Discord call for the Moloch DAO discord server.\n\n[https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth](https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth)\n\nFor the most part I was just enjoying the talk, I believe I could listen to [Travis Wyche](https://medium.com/@traviswyche) talk for hours. Eventually I could no longer concentrate on what I was doing and had to focus on the conversation until it actually lead to a point where I could jump in. It was interesting because the *first* act of collaboration for this “autonomous” organization still required some human to human collaboration. (He also suggested xdai as opposed to the “[broken](https://cryptobriefing.com/polygon-swerves-850-million-hack-ethereum-bridge/)” [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) as another successful virtual yet personal collaboration).\n\nThe point of Travis’ constructive questioning of decentralized story telling was the very valid concern that character development and plot is essentially the result of an authors imagination which leads to a narrative being told and there may be a fundamental problem in the story which could lead to a directionless jumble of words. That could also be interesting, but perhaps unreadable.\n\nSo now I have changed my mind about how to start this. Instead of starting the story, I will just leave a blank page. Perhaps the DAO will decide to spend time on character and plot development first and then “elect” writers to move the story forward. I really don’t know and I don’t want to know either. This \"game” could turn into a publishing powerhouse with multiple ongoing narratives, or it might produce a haiku and dissolve. Time will tell and democracy will decide.\n\nThere are many tools available to us in the Web3 space. This game/story/educational DAO will attempt to use as many tools as it can in order to be successful. It is meant as a seed and will grow if tended to. Hopefully it will take advantage of as many web3 tools as we can. We will start with youtube and hopefully transition that to a Web3 service WHEN one become available. We can use this DAO to experiment with new ideas and new tools, find out what works what doesn’t and offer suggestions to create things that don’t even exist yet.\n\n## Fictionalized Micro Economy\n\nAs this story unfolds, there will be opportunities within the DAO to earn tokens. Again, this will be up to the DAO how this is handled but there are many tasks that will need to be completed in order to make this successful. For example, there may not be a way for the DAO, after a proposal has passed for the next paragraph, to automate the text adding the text to the publishing service. A member of the DAO may be hired to perform that task and be rewarded by tips or even through a constant trickle of tokens, controlled by the DAO (yes this is possible). The direction is to be decided as we weave our way through [The Rise of The Micro-Economies](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/gWY6Kfebs9wHdfoZZswfiLTBVzfKiyFaIwNf2q8JpgI)\n\nThe DAO may even decide that there is a particular NFT on Rarible that would be an excellent part of the story. There are many different ways for the DAO to go about acquiring one and the fun part will be for the DAO to figure out which tools it will need to carry out the tasks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI think I have explained enough as far as the creation of this DAO goes. It is nearly impossible to start a DAO without the original creator or creators influence. I intend to minimize that as much as possible for the launch and then let it be an exercise in creative use of existing and future Web3 technologies. Let’s do it as an exercise in democracy in a micro-economy with no borders. Let’s use it as a foundational educational tool for an emerging technology that is more and more becoming the daily life of humans.\n\nLet’s make a cool story.\n\n![When we're done you'll be buff](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SVMy6xuWDsvttRsHZCVxa.JPG?height=1200&width=1190)\n\n[https://youtu.be/TNQ0fK-kqow](https://youtu.be/TNQ0fK-kqow)\n\nI would have liked to have done a split here with some of the people mentioned in this article.

Every week, DAOhaus does their weekly “Haus Party” chat on their discord server. During this event there are [POAP](https://poap.xyz/)s distributed to attendees. If you are the owner of the POAP you are then able to enter the “War Games.” This game is a DAO and is about as open ended as possible. The direction of the game is decided by making proposals in the DAO, and holding votes. Basically, doing the thing that DAOs do. It truly is a wonderful way to teach about DAO’s and how to use a moloch DAO. So I’m stealing their idea.\n\n## German Art and Slaying Demons\n\n![Slaying Moloch requires Co-Ordination](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dry6Az1t194mgdoARFgE.png?height=719&width=721)\n\nIn [Scott Alexander’s](https://slatestarcodex.com/author/admin/) essay [Meditaions on Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) we learn of a powerful demon Moloch that represents a system humankind hates but lack the tools to co-ordinate and make the changes everyone knows needs to be made.\n\n> There’s [a passage](http://principiadiscordia.com/book/45.php) in the *Principia Discordia* where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. “Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.”\n>\n> The Goddess answers: “What is the matter with that, if it’s what you want to do?”\n>\n> Malaclypse: “But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!”\n>\n> Goddess: “Oh. Well, then stop.”\n>\n> The implicit question is – if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: “Moloch”.\n\nThe Moloch DAO framework seems to have been built around the ideas introduced in Alexander’s analysis of Ginsberg’s poem [Howl](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl). Aiming to create a set of tools humans can use, to address the issues of co-ordination failure and truly take the world into a new direction and slaying the moloch.\n\nDAOhaus brings a whole new level to the story of co-ordination. What they have done, is take the Moloch code and created a user interface in which anybody with a little knowledge of how to navigate [Web3](https://web3.foundation/), can create and/or be a part of a DAO.\n\n> [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/) was [born at ETHBerlin 2019](https://medium.com/odyssy/daohaus-bauhaus-b855cd9db19e), a hackathon project aiming to make it easier (or possible at all) to interact with the [Moloch DAO smart contracts](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch/blob/master/v1_contracts/README.md) in a human-readable way. After a days-long, Club Mate induced frenzy, the very first build of DAOhaus was born! Thus beginning the almost two year journey focused on bringing more open tools for financial coordination to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n[https://medium.com/daohaus-club/haus-launch-bd781bbbf13a](https://medium.com/daohaus-club/haus-launch-bd781bbbf13a)\n\nThe story that I’ve heard, (I was looking everywhere for where I’ve heard, so I may well be taking some artistic liberty here) is something about the original hack group in Berlin rocking out to a band called Bauhaus during EthBerlin 2019. Which, if true, is a very serendipitous event.\n\nIf we look a little deeper, into the history of the German bauhaus art scene, we learn it is built around a philosophy of creating functional art using multidisciplinary skillsets collaborating in new and innovative ways. This began in actual buildings in which the interiors were fitted with all the tools students required to work and collaborate together. In a digital Web3 format, DAOhaus is doing the same thing. Providing a haus of tools for people to collaborate and slay moloch.\n\n> The Bauhaus was founded in 1919 in the city of Weimar by German architect Walter Gropius (1883–1969). Its core objective was a radical concept: to reimagine the material world to reflect the unity of all the arts. Gropius explained this vision for a union of art and design in the Proclamation of the Bauhaus (1919), which described a utopian craft guild combining architecture, sculpture, and painting into a single creative expression. Gropius developed a craft-based curriculum that would turn out artisans and designers capable of creating useful and beautiful objects appropriate to this new system of living.\n\n[https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm)\n\nThe idea is, I am going to create a new DAO. As you may have already guessed, it will be called Boiler DAO. In this case, I put the cart before the horse. I made the token, named after my social media alias, then decided instead of it just taking up space, I might as well use it. The token is not swappable for anything on any exchange. It is a “pure” social token. It may not always be that way.\n\nThe goal of this DAO will be to tell a story. In both the literal sense and the figurative sense. I will begin this DAO and start some of the basic fundamentals. From there, I will let it grow or fade on it’s own.  Creativity in decentralized story telling, at the same time learning about DAO’s, provides a new tool to aide startups who would like to spend their time focusing on the product or service they intend to offer, instead of teaching fundementals of DAOs.\n\n## How the Story Will be Told\n\nHonestly, I don’t know. If I did, then I wouldn’t be honest in my intentions to have a decentralized project. I will start it. I will create videos. These videos will aide anybody who wants to view them in their own journey of creating or participating in a DAO. This will be a large part of the educational aspect of this DAO.\n\nI will do the basics and then the DAO will decide everything else through proposals, this article being the first part of the process. Obviously I’m not going to make a video of myself typing an article but the rest of it I will. I will create the DAO on xDai. I will then create a [safe minion](https://daohaus.club/docs/users/minion/), which will create a [gnosis safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/), controlled by the DAO. I will deposit 9 Million BOILD tokens into the DAO and from that point forward those tokens will be controlled by the DAO.\n\nI will then create a Discord server and a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjlcjNvqwUxRIma1_d05uYA) channel. Again, this will be as bare bones as possible but it is an opportunity to teach how to do this, as it is a pretty vital part of the *process for this DAO.* I say this because there are many ways to form a DAO and I don’t want anybody to come out of this thinking, ok, If I do every step I see here, I will have a DAO. This may very well be true, but you may not have the DAO you want. The point of this exercise, is to show a particular set of tools that I happened to learn about. All I want you to recognize is that they are tools, and you can use many different tools in different combinations to form your own DAO. If you click the link I provided above to The DAOists tools airtable you will get a good overview of some of the other tools available to you.\n\nThere certainly are other forms of social media at our disposal I could set up as well but it will be up to the DAO to decide how that goes. The one thing I will do, beyond the basics, is set up the collab.land bot on the discord. This will allow for distribution of the remaining tokens to people interested in the DAO. I will distribute 1000 tokens, through the bot to anybody that requests them, up until the point that the DAO decides to change that. Being the creator of the discord, I will be the mod there, until there are a few members of the DAO, then the DAO will decide. 500,000 tokens will be deposited into the collab.land bot for distribution purposes.\n\nThe remaining tokens I reserve to keep, as the creator of the token. It will be mostly used during the making of the tutorial videos but maybe one day I will use them to buy a lambo.\n\n![Who Knows?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RQlRj7T29gFxs02IdeBZl.gif?height=187&width=198)\n\nThe price for entry into the DAO will be: one share per one $BOILD token. The token will also be used as the currency to perform actions within the DAO (so if you do propose membership, keep that in mind you will still need some later. You will also need a little wxdai and xdai in your wallet. You can wrap your xdai easily at [WrapEth.com]().  After everything is set up, with the basics, I will then make the first proposal for the beginning of the literal story and gamification of The Boiler DAO.\n\n## Gamification of Boiler DAO\n\nThe idea will be a fictional tale with distributed authorship and each part of the story told after being democratically decided upon by the DAO. A proposal can be a sentence, paragraph, chapter, word, haiku, an edit, a photo…. who knows. Perhaps to entries for the next part of the story are so good it creates a fork in the story, which may even cause a fork in the DAO itself, which would also be super interesting. The point being, the DAO will decide and grow (or fail) as it’s own organism set loose upon the Web3 space.\n\nMy original thought was that, after everything was set up, I would make a proposal for the first line or paragraph and *we* would take it from there. As I was working on this document and doing a few other tasks I was listening in on a Discord call for the Moloch DAO discord server.\n\n[https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth](https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth)\n\nFor the most part I was just enjoying the talk, I believe I could listen to [Travis Wyche](https://medium.com/@traviswyche) talk for hours. Eventually I could no longer concentrate on what I was doing and had to focus on the conversation until it actually lead to a point where I could jump in. It was interesting because the *first* act of collaboration for this “autonomous” organization still required some human to human collaboration. (He also suggested xdai as opposed to the “[broken](https://cryptobriefing.com/polygon-swerves-850-million-hack-ethereum-bridge/)” [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) as another successful virtual yet personal collaboration).\n\nThe point of Travis’ constructive questioning of decentralized story telling was the very valid concern that character development and plot is essentially the result of an authors imagination which leads to a narrative being told and there may be a fundamental problem in the story which could lead to a directionless jumble of words. That could also be interesting, but perhaps unreadable.\n\nSo now I have changed my mind about how to start this. Instead of starting the story, I will just leave a blank page. Perhaps the DAO will decide to spend time on character and plot development first and then “elect” writers to move the story forward. I really don’t know and I don’t want to know either. This \"game” could turn into a publishing powerhouse with multiple ongoing narratives, or it might produce a haiku and dissolve. Time will tell and democracy will decide.\n\nThere are many tools available to us in the Web3 space. This game/story/educational DAO will attempt to use as many tools as it can in order to be successful. It is meant as a seed and will grow if tended to. Hopefully it will take advantage of as many web3 tools as we can. We will start with youtube and hopefully transition that to a Web3 service WHEN one become available. We can use this DAO to experiment with new ideas and new tools, find out what works what doesn’t and offer suggestions to create things that don’t even exist yet.\n\n## Fictionalized Micro Economy\n\nAs this story unfolds, there will be opportunities within the DAO to earn tokens. Again, this will be up to the DAO how this is handled but there are many tasks that will need to be completed in order to make this successful. For example, there may not be a way for the DAO, after a proposal has passed for the next paragraph, to automate the text adding the text to the publishing service. A member of the DAO may be hired to perform that task and be rewarded by tips or even through a constant trickle of tokens, controlled by the DAO (yes this is possible). The direction is to be decided as we weave our way through [The Rise of The Micro-Economies](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/gWY6Kfebs9wHdfoZZswfiLTBVzfKiyFaIwNf2q8JpgI)\n\nThe DAO may even decide that there is a particular NFT on Rarible that would be an excellent part of the story. There are many different ways for the DAO to go about acquiring one and the fun part will be for the DAO to figure out which tools it will need to carry out the tasks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI think I have explained enough as far as the creation of this DAO goes. It is nearly impossible to start a DAO without the original creator or creators influence. I intend to minimize that as much as possible for the launch and then let it be an exercise in creative use of existing and future Web3 technologies. Let’s do it as an exercise in democracy in a micro-economy with no borders. Let’s use it as a foundational educational tool for an emerging technology that is more and more becoming the daily life of humans.\n\nLet’s make a cool story.\n\n![When we're done you'll be buff](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SVMy6xuWDsvttRsHZCVxa.JPG?height=1200&width=1190)\n\n[https://youtu.be/TNQ0fK-kqow](https://youtu.be/TNQ0fK-kqow)\n\nI would have liked to have done a split here with some of the people mentioned in this article.

The reason I made the tokens is to power a DAO for people to have access to a resource in creating a DAO from scratch.\n\nThere is another DAO I am a part of that has been without a token. There wasn’t really a need for it. Governance of the DAO is handled perfectly using moloch as implemented by [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/). Where the need for a token really presented itself, is in encouraging user engagement in the DAO. Practising token creation on an L2 sidechain (aka inexpensive) was a task I took on for the [DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xd8837c5bf792443edec94576e23450166dfd3ae8/proposals)\n\nThe more time I have spent working on and learning about DAO’s, I have encountered the same problem repeatedly. Teaching the fundamentals of DAO’s seems to be a front and centre issue for a lot of DAO start-ups. Resources have been thin and compiling information has been a task most have to deal with. The DAOists is a DAO, mostly located on Discord and airtable right now, that has taken this problem head on by collecting as much information as possible through it’s [resource list airbase](https://airtable.com/shrKgyx43sFvQE5lp/tblNQOw5j40sTBtPg), including a separate airbase for [DAO tools](https://airtable.com/shrrXaF1CvPdp94Y8/tblsy93cTWAhYiXOQ) and one for [articles](https://airtable.com/shrAyCIteuG6kB1H3) about the space.\n\nAs a disclaimer, a lot of what I do here, such as writing this article and the videos created, will be shared with DAOhaus to add to their own content if they choose. A side goal of my developing this DAO, is to put it in some work in aide of developing and supporting the documentaion of moloch DAOs as it is implemented through DAOhaus.

The reason I made the tokens is to power a DAO for people to have access to a resource in creating a DAO from scratch.\n\nThere is another DAO I am a part of that has been without a token. There wasn’t really a need for it. Governance of the DAO is handled perfectly using moloch as implemented by [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/). Where the need for a token really presented itself, is in encouraging user engagement in the DAO. Practising token creation on an L2 sidechain (aka inexpensive) was a task I took on for the [DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xd8837c5bf792443edec94576e23450166dfd3ae8/proposals)\n\nThe more time I have spent working on and learning about DAO’s, I have encountered the same problem repeatedly. Teaching the fundamentals of DAO’s seems to be a front and centre issue for a lot of DAO start-ups. Resources have been thin and compiling information has been a task most have to deal with. The DAOists is a DAO, mostly located on Discord and airtable right now, that has taken this problem head on by collecting as much information as possible through it’s [resource list airbase](https://airtable.com/shrKgyx43sFvQE5lp/tblNQOw5j40sTBtPg), including a separate airbase for [DAO tools](https://airtable.com/shrrXaF1CvPdp94Y8/tblsy93cTWAhYiXOQ) and one for [articles](https://airtable.com/shrAyCIteuG6kB1H3) about the space.\n\nAs a disclaimer, a lot of what I do here, such as writing this article and the videos created, will be shared with DAOhaus to add to their own content if they choose. A side goal of my developing this DAO, is to put it in some work in aide of developing and supporting the documentaion of moloch DAOs as it is implemented through DAOhaus. It is also in aide of The DAOists in their mission of educating and converting the world into “DAOism.”\n\n[https://discord.gg/dEJFDKHvCp](https://discord.gg/dEJFDKHvCp)\n\nDAOhaus is playing a game. Every week, DAOhaus does their weekly “Haus Party” chat on their discord server. During this event there are [POAP](https://poap.xyz/)s distributed to attendees. If you are the owner of the POAP you are then able to enter the “War Games.” This game is a DAO and is about as open ended as possible. The direction of the game is decided by making proposals in the DAO, and holding votes. Basically, doing the thing that DAOs do. It truly is a wonderful way to teach about DAO’s and how to use a moloch DAO. So I’m stealing their idea.\n\n## German Art and Slaying Demons\n\n![Slaying Moloch requires Co-Ordination](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dry6Az1t194mgdoARFgE.png?height=719&width=721)\n\nIn [Scott Alexander’s](https://slatestarcodex.com/author/admin/) essay [Meditaions on Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) we learn of a powerful demon Moloch that represents a system humankind hates but lack the tools to co-ordinate and make the changes everyone knows needs to be made.\n\n> There’s [a passage](http://principiadiscordia.com/book/45.php) in the *Principia Discordia* where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. “Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.”\n>\n> The Goddess answers: “What is the matter with that, if it’s what you want to do?”\n>\n> Malaclypse: “But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!”\n>\n> Goddess: “Oh. Well, then stop.”\n>\n> The implicit question is – if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: “Moloch”.\n\nThe Moloch DAO framework seems to have been built around the ideas introduced in Alexander’s analysis of Ginsberg’s poem [Howl](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl). Aiming to create a set of tools humans can use, to address the issues of co-ordination failure and truly take the world into a new direction and slaying the moloch.\n\nDAOhaus brings a whole new level to the story of co-ordination. What they have done, is take the Moloch code and created a user interface in which anybody with a little knowledge of how to navigate [Web3](https://web3.foundation/), can create and/or be a part of a DAO.\n\n> [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/) was [born at ETHBerlin 2019](https://medium.com/odyssy/daohaus-bauhaus-b855cd9db19e), a hackathon project aiming to make it easier (or possible at all) to interact with the [Moloch DAO smart contracts](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch/blob/master/v1_contracts/README.md) in a human-readable way. After a days-long, Club Mate induced frenzy, the very first build of DAOhaus was born! Thus beginning the almost two year journey focused on bringing more open tools for financial coordination to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n[https://medium.com/daohaus-club/haus-launch-bd781bbbf13a](https://medium.com/daohaus-club/haus-launch-bd781bbbf13a)\n\nThe story that I’ve heard, (I was looking everywhere for where I’ve heard, so I may well be taking some artistic liberty here) is something about the original hack group in Berlin rocking out to a band called Bauhaus during EthBerlin 2019. Which, if true, is a very serendipitous event.\n\nIf we look a little deeper, into the history of the German bauhaus art scene, we learn it is built around a philosophy of creating functional art using multidisciplinary skillsets collaborating in new and innovative ways. This began in actual buildings in which the interiors were fitted with all the tools students required to work and collaborate together. In a digital Web3 format, DAOhaus is doing the same thing. Providing a haus of tools for people to collaborate and slay moloch.\n\n> The Bauhaus was founded in 1919 in the city of Weimar by German architect Walter Gropius (1883–1969). Its core objective was a radical concept: to reimagine the material world to reflect the unity of all the arts. Gropius explained this vision for a union of art and design in the Proclamation of the Bauhaus (1919), which described a utopian craft guild combining architecture, sculpture, and painting into a single creative expression. Gropius developed a craft-based curriculum that would turn out artisans and designers capable of creating useful and beautiful objects appropriate to this new system of living.\n\n[https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm)\n\nThe idea is, I am going to create a new DAO. As you may have already guessed, it will be called Boiler DAO. In this case, I put the cart before the horse. I made the token, named after my social media alias, then decided instead of it just taking up space, I might as well use it. The token is not swappable for anything on any exchange. It is a “pure” social token. It may not always be that way.\n\nThe goal of this DAO will be to tell a story. In both the literal sense and the figurative sense. I will begin this DAO and start some of the basic fundamentals. From there, I will let it grow or fade on it’s own.  Creativity in decentralized story telling, at the same time learning about DAO’s, provides a new tool to aide startups who would like to spend their time focusing on the product or service they intend to offer, instead of teaching fundementals of DAOs.\n\n## How the Story Will be Told\n\nHonestly, I don’t know. If I did, then I wouldn’t be honest in my intentions to have a decentralized project. I will start it. I will create videos. These videos will aide anybody who wants to view them in their own journey of creating or participating in a DAO. This will be a large part of the educational aspect of this DAO.\n\nI will do the basics and then the DAO will decide everything else through proposals, this article being the first part of the process. Obviously I’m not going to make a video of myself typing an article but the rest of it I will. I will create the DAO on xDai. I will then create a [safe minion](https://daohaus.club/docs/users/minion/), which will create a [gnosis safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/), controlled by the DAO. I will deposit 9 Million BOILD tokens into the DAO and from that point forward those tokens will be controlled by the DAO.\n\nI will then create a Discord server and a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjlcjNvqwUxRIma1_d05uYA) channel. Again, this will be as bare bones as possible but it is an opportunity to teach how to do this, as it is a pretty vital part of the *process for this DAO.* I say this because there are many ways to form a DAO and I don’t want anybody to come out of this thinking, ok, If I do every step I see here, I will have a DAO. This may very well be true, but you may not have the DAO you want. The point of this exercise, is to show a particular set of tools that I happened to learn about. All I want you to recognize is that they are tools, and you can use many different tools in different combinations to form your own DAO. If you click the link I provided above to The DAOists tools airtable you will get a good overview of some of the other tools available to you.\n\nThere certainly are other forms of social media at our disposal I could set up as well but it will be up to the DAO to decide how that goes. The one thing I will do, beyond the basics, is set up the collab.land bot on the discord. This will allow for distribution of the remaining tokens to people interested in the DAO. I will distribute 1000 tokens, through the bot to anybody that requests them, up until the point that the DAO decides to change that. Being the creator of the discord, I will be the mod there, until there are a few members of the DAO, then the DAO will decide. 500,000 tokens will be deposited into the collab.land bot for distribution purposes.\n\nThe remaining tokens I reserve to keep, as the creator of the token. It will be mostly used during the making of the tutorial videos but maybe one day I will use them to buy a lambo.\n\n![Who Knows?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RQlRj7T29gFxs02IdeBZl.gif?height=187&width=198)\n\nThe price for entry into the DAO will be: one share per one $BOILD token. The token will also be used as the currency to perform some actions within the DAO (so if you do propose membership, keep that in mind you will still need some later. You will also need a little wxdai and xdai in your wallet for proposals and gas on the xdai blockchain. You can wrap your xdai easily at [WrapEth.com]().  After everything is set up, with the basics, I will then make the first proposal for the beginning of the literal story and gamification of The Boiler DAO.\n\n## Gamification of Boiler DAO\n\nThe idea will be a fictional tale with distributed authorship and each part of the story told after being democratically decided upon by the DAO. A proposal can be a sentence, paragraph, chapter, word, haiku, an edit, a photo…. who knows. Perhaps to entries for the next part of the story are so good it creates a fork in the story, which may even cause a fork in the DAO itself, which would also be super interesting. The point being, the DAO will decide and grow (or fail) as it’s own organism set loose upon the Web3 space.\n\nMy original thought was that, after everything was set up, I would make a proposal for the first line or paragraph and *we* would take it from there. As I was working on this document and doing a few other tasks I was listening in on a Discord call for the Moloch DAO discord server.\n\n[https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth](https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth)\n\nFor the most part I was just enjoying the talk, I believe I could listen to [Travis Wyche](https://medium.com/@traviswyche) talk for hours. Eventually I could no longer concentrate on what I was doing and had to focus on the conversation until it actually lead to a point where I could jump in. It was interesting because the *first* act of collaboration for this “autonomous” organization still required some human to human collaboration. (He also suggested xdai as opposed to the “[broken](https://cryptobriefing.com/polygon-swerves-850-million-hack-ethereum-bridge/)” [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) as another successful virtual yet personal collaboration).\n\nThe point of Travis’ constructive questioning of decentralized story telling was the very valid concern that character development and plot is essentially the result of an authors imagination which leads to a narrative being told and there may be a fundamental problem in the story which could lead to a directionless jumble of words. That could also be interesting, but perhaps unreadable.\n\nSo now I have changed my mind about how to start this. Instead of starting the story, I will just leave a blank page. Perhaps the DAO will decide to spend time on character and plot development first and then “elect” writers to move the story forward. I really don’t know and I don’t want to know either. This \"game” could turn into a publishing powerhouse with multiple ongoing narratives, or it might produce a haiku and dissolve. Time will tell and democracy will decide.\n\nThere are many tools available to us in the Web3 space. This game/story/educational DAO will attempt to use as many tools as it can in order to be successful. It is meant as a seed and will grow if tended to. Hopefully it will take advantage of as many web3 tools as we can. We will start with youtube and hopefully transition that to a Web3 service WHEN one become available. We can use this DAO to experiment with new ideas and new tools, find out what works what doesn’t and offer suggestions to create things that don’t even exist yet.\n\n## Fictionalized Micro Economy\n\nAs this story unfolds, there will be opportunities within the DAO to earn tokens. Again, this will be up to the DAO how this is handled but there are many tasks that will need to be completed in order to make this successful. For example, there may not be a way for the DAO, after a proposal has passed for the next paragraph, to automate the text adding the text to the publishing service. A member of the DAO may be hired to perform that task and be rewarded by tips or even through a constant trickle of tokens, controlled by the DAO (yes this is possible). The direction is to be decided as we weave our way through [The Rise of The Micro-Economies](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/gWY6Kfebs9wHdfoZZswfiLTBVzfKiyFaIwNf2q8JpgI)\n\nThe DAO may even decide that there is a particular NFT on Rarible that would be an excellent part of the story. There are many different ways for the DAO to go about acquiring one and the fun part will be for the DAO to figure out which tools it will need to carry out the tasks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI think I have explained enough as far as the creation of this DAO goes. It is nearly impossible to start a DAO without the original creator or creators influence. I intend to minimize that as much as possible for the launch and then let it be an exercise in creative use of existing and future Web3 technologies. Let’s do it as an exercise in democracy in a micro-economy with no borders. Let’s use it as a foundational educational tool for an emerging technology that is more and more becoming the daily life of humans.\n\nLet’s make a cool story.\n\n![When we're done you'll be buff](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SVMy6xuWDsvttRsHZCVxa.JPG?height=1200&width=1190)\n\n[https://youtu.be/TNQ0fK-kqow](https://youtu.be/TNQ0fK-kqow)\n\nI would have liked to have done a split here with some of the people mentioned in this article.

I only read about him passingly, but I remember one thing he wrote that kind of moved me. He put it in the mouth of Hamlet, I think it was, who said “to be or not to be”. He was in doubt about something. Whether it was nobler, in the mind of man, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune— moderation—or to take up arms against the sea of troubles and, by opposing, end them. And I go for that; if you take up arms you’ll end it, but if you sit around and wait for the one who is in power to make up his mind that he should end it, you’ll be waiting a long time. And in my opinion… you’re living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution, a time when there’s got to be a change, people in power have misused it, and now there has to be a change. And a better world has to be built and the only way it’s going to be built is with extreme methods. And I, for one, will join in with anyone—don’t care what color you are—as long as you want to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth. Thank you.”\n\n\\-Malcolm X\n\nThe above is a closing excerpt from Malcom X’s Oxford Union Debate, December 3, 1964. It is one of many of the revolutionary speeches that he made as a global voice against racism and a symbol of Black liberation up until his assassination in February the following year.\n\nIn today’s climate, his message remains true more than ever— we  all live in a time of extremism and revolution. A massive subtle war goes on around us, with pervasively amplified attempts to suffocate those that speak out against the old crumbled systems, and no sector of our lives remains free from it, despite what most play dress up to pretend otherwise.\n\n“...to take up arms against the sea of troubles and, by opposing, end them..”\n\nIn a centralized tech and media dystopia, where our every thought and data metric is calibrated to work against us in favor of a mediocrity of convenience and inertia, culture becomes the currency and arms that we take up to break free.\n\nIn this corner of the nascent web3 metaverse, we trash the myths that hold us back, to create a new fashion movement.\n\nWeb3 is our one true shot at transforming the foundation and every aspect of the landscape surrounding us. To get the next evolution of the internet right. To co-create the open web3 metaverse, where not just communication infrastructure is decentralised as in web1, or semi decentralised as in web2, but, is fully decentralised end-to-end across everything of value. Accelerating the timeline to when we get there has become critically urgent as the old legacy players from web2 and many decades before, continue to give us the twin illusions of freedom and choice. Weaving systems that work actively against us to the short term benefit of the very few, these cartels continue to exert accelerating control of our data, finances, health, social mobility, beliefs, thoughts, relationships with each other, and more, through shocking levels of fraud and abuse.\n\nThese illusions are made worse by those who wear the glitter of web3 in #CT public, but simp web2 Meta behind their masks.\n\nPumping NFTs and VC social clubs deployed on chain isn’t enough to actually be web3. If that’s all it took, all we’d be doing is petitioning for slightly better conditions from those in old power in the hope that we might become the new priesthood. We can do better than become replacement gatekeepers as the previous generations retire on the data riches they’ve extracted from us.\n\nSo what’s so revolutionary about fashion?\n\nIt makes us into anyone we dare to be.\n\nIt gives us superpowers.\n\nIn a traditional sense, that’s limited to an impression and what our pockets or bags carry for us. With web3, the metastory, programmable utility, and interoperability enabled by transformative redefinitions of fashion extend to our senses, and the tangible exercise, of luxury and power.\n\nIt is an Arthur C. Clarke kind of magic when we can reframe how and where we wear fashion, the materials we use to design it, and what it ultimately is.\n\nIt is finally the full set of all the tools that we wear.\n\nIf we hope to build the better world we all know is within reach, the only fashion that matters is that which empowers us as designers, wearers, and buyers with enhanced ownership, self-determination, prospects for wealth, and creative freedom. Beyond simply artisanal images, 3d models, and glitzy videos secured by NFTs and DAO vaults, web3 fashion actively advances the interconnectivity between us and our strengths from edge to edge. From lace to seam.\n\nWithin this broader vision fast becoming more real by the day, Trash Fashion, is an anti-establishment form of digital design that takes what many might see as old, worn out, used pieces and recycles them into an entirely novel interpretation as part of a much larger message. It’s a bottom up composable approach to directly imprint mod culture into the very fabric of the source materials.\n\nIt is not for the faint of heart or the risk averse. But then, again, when is anything good and revolutionary afraid of getting trashy for change?\n\nFor far too long traditional fashion has been among the most unsustainable industries, with the most exploitative, destructive, dehumanizing, and extractive practices. As these legacy brands catch up to the supposedly easy new money enabled by web3, it is no surprise that many are now in a rush to spin up blockchain x fashion initiatives and are experimenting with minting all too ordinary fashion NFTs— as direct transplants from old ideas of luxury and appeal, without any of the industry fundamentals actually changing. At the crossroads of a radically new socio-economic medium, it’s obvious we need to define the difference between old famous throwaway fashion NFTs vs real web3 fashion, and with our actions, choose to build and scale the latter. It’s just far too comfortable and safe not to.\n\nThe safest thing that we can do in a time like this is supply fashion, digital or physical, that is cozy within what those before us defined as the constraints of what we could be.

But we can choose whose children we would like to be.”\n>\n> — Seneca in the “Shortness of Life”\n\nI am an accountant by profession and have scrolled through many different ledgers and debit/credits during my professional career.\n\nBut, there is one ledger, the owner, and how it works is known to no one.\n\n**The ledger of birth and death.**\n\nNo, No………I am not trying to touch the “reflective” aspect of Life. Instead, I am trying to identify my uniqueness.\n\nThe more I ponder, the more it intrigues me — **How is this all decided?**\n\nAnd then, every time I am left with nothing but a simple answer to admit —\n\n**I was lucky to find a place on this planet. Plain and simple.**\n\nNo effort, no plan, nothing can be attributed to me when I landed on that hospital bed.\n\nA coincidence or a well-calculated ledger? Who knows?\n\nAnd, once that 20-inch body started growing, people were still around to take care and offer help.\n\n# The Choice was Not Ours. But the Choice is Always.\n\nWe all ultimately have to play the game of Life with the dice given to us. It’s up to us to play the game with honesty or leave the game without complaining.\n\nWe all are products of our surroundings, but we are also equally responsible for creating our surroundings.\n\nDecide whether you want to be shaped or shape for yourself.\n\nEvery game has its own rule and that small piece of luck. As Stoics say, we should recognize this luck but never rely on it. Instead, focus on becoming the child you want to be; that’s all we can do.\n\n**It’s time to decide and choose whose children we want to be.**\n\nSurprisingly, we all **have** this choice. We all **had** this choice. Every time. Each day. Every moment.\n\n*When you make decisions for yourself, you give yourself the right to be right or wrong.*\n\nLeave it to someone else, and we lose that privilege.\n\n# Decisions Others Make for You\n\n[Almost all the time, we are being guided by others.](https://theapeiron.co.uk/transform-your-belief-by-recognizing-its-source-2306b445ccf8) No problems with that. But then, when this guidance becomes a burden on our original thoughts, we start losing.\n\n* The school you joined was primarily the choice of your parents or caretakers.\n* The name that you are carrying so proudly is a gift from someone.\n* Many of your belief systems were developed because of your interactions with people in school, college, and society.\n\nAnd then there came a day when you decided to fly out of the nest. A sudden change in the city, the residence, a new job, or an unfortunate incident. Things changes suddenly.\n\nYou don’t find the people to make the decisions for you.\n\nJust like a newborn bird, you are left to have faith in your skills, abilities, and instincts and then fly.\n\nIn his book — **[“The Four Agreements](https://medium.com/10-bullets-100-words-book-summary/10-bullets-100-words-book-summary-the-four-agreements-by-don-miguel-ruiz-1b62f2aa547d),” Don Miguel Ruiz writes that** the process of surrendering to the outside belief system is called **“Domestication.”**\n\nWe have accepted this domestication.\n\nNow, they are part of us. Just as the society around us makes the book of laws, our belief system is the rule book for our Life. We believe them; we live with them; we judge; we decide using this book of laws. We have been “Domesticated” using these belief systems.\n\nBut, you can still choose — by reflecting on your belief systems and then challenging the book of the law.\n\nThe choice is always there.\n\n> “Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I shall have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it, even if I may not have it at the beginning.” — Mahatma Gandhi\n\n# The Board Game\n\nWe all are playing this board game called Life. We did not choose the game, the rules, and the dice. But it’s purely up to us to try our best to understand the game and play to the best of our abilities.\n\n> “We don’t get to choose our parents, and parents don’t get to choose their children. But we do get to choose how hard we’re willing to work in order to make the best of what we’re given.”― **Colleen Hoover**\n\n## Decisions to Make for Self\n\n* Give up all your excuses to be consistently on social media and watch Television — **Own your time**.\n* **Give up all your excuses to sleep that extra bit** — Understand your sleep needs and invest only that actual amount. Drop everything else.\n* **Give up control** — Understand that you can’t control a lot of things. Stop complaining about them. Add value to things that are in your control.\n* **Give up procrastination** — Move one step. Make 1% progress. Keep moving.\n* **Give up the excuses to not learn** — If you are not learning every day, you are stagnating. Instead, develop a growth mindset today because there is no tomorrow.\n* **Accept responsibility** — Whatever happens, it happens because of the choices you make.\n\n# Become the Children You Want to Be.\n\nYou are reading this story, and you have made a choice.\n\nDon’t fret over what’s happening to others. Instead, bother what’s happening to you. Make the right choices.\n\n**More importantly, make choices.**\n\nThe world is changing. And changing for good. We all are waiting for you to make the right choices and make this world a better place.\n\nIf you want to be the child you want:\n\n* **Play like a child** — back your instincts,\n* **Think like a child** — give respect to your thoughts,\n* **Take risks like a child** — experiment and keep experimenting,\n* **Be a child** — be true.\n\nOften, in my journal, I answer this question — *“What advice would my twenty-year-old version of myself give me now?”*\n\nMy morning routine and time with journal give me moments of solitude and reflection— closed eyes, a few words from inside, and things look entirely different.\n\nI have answered this question multiple times in the last few years. I would not say the mind speaks the same every time, but the one answer that often comes on the paper is — **Make decisions and own them**.\n\n# To conclude\n\nThe calculations of this Cosmos have left you on this planet Earth. Whether you believe in the power of creation or not, you still need to wake up every day and make the choices you feel are right for you.\n\nI feel fortunate that the power chose me to be at the place where I am right now.

Players are deeply involved in it, and even as long as they have a visible ranking in the whole service, they think that the previous investment is still worthwhile, and the game's winning game seems to eliminate the day's accumulated temper.\n\nFrom the operator's point of view, the players are into the treasure only, the game content has nothing to do with it, everything serves to keep the interest of customers, maintain the stability of the currency trading system, regularly follow the trend, update the elements, add some new ways to play, stick to the customer is the job, or even the only important responsibility.\n\nBut players, ah, they have to have a responsibility too, and it's impossible to get the officials to maintain the big and small things that happen in the game world, and as said above, unless it does have a long-lasting negative impact on the game operations, players have to solve it all by themselves. A particular online game corresponds to a certain community of people in the real world, and everything is no more than a feud between people, except that in the virtual world, people are invisible to each other, as if the world is dark one day, so things like burning and robbing will naturally appear, and people can do everything they wouldn't dare to do on a regular basis. In such a virtual world, emotions are magnified, and everyone can recklessly knock vicious curses in the chat window, or go against the rules of the game and carry out \"criminal activities\" such as vendetta, fraud, blackmail, etc., and all this without being held responsible.\n\nGames can reflect another side of a person - a dark side that is not easily revealed in real life.\n\nHow much a game community is good or bad can be determined by the design structure inherent in a game. More luck, speculative components (i.e. the winning rate depends on the set probability), then it will attract those who love to do nothing and speculate in reality; more veteran players dominate the server (newcomers are discriminated against and mocked), then it will attract those who live on relationships and like to gang up on people; more money determines the strength of the components (RMB warriors), then it will attract those who live in reality Those who spend money to buy titles, spend money to buy laws ...... These people as the mainstream, forming a community, representing the game \"really suitable\" people, want to play well in this game, the best to meet that standard.\n\nIn fact, the above examples highlight certain facets, and perhaps only in some trash page game to see this design. Generally mature, regular companies operating games are trying to maintain a balance - the so-called put a long line, fishing for big fish. In addition to ... In some special periods of the company (such as liquidity or something), the company will sacrifice part of the design to break the balance, which is not without its own.\n\nThe former relies on equipment, props, dress up and other elements designed around the game itself, while the latter relies on pop-ups, traffic, commercial promotion ...... Now the Chinese community so pompous, the reason, product design is part (in the official promotion), the other part, the virtual world, but also, after all, is the real world of people, people were lack of self-control animals, the Internet so chaotic, without the restrictions of the external world, you can indulge yourself at will.", "timestamp": 1635693969, "digest": "seHYXGdX-jlnU9uSBRg0upaqWLzYiitOu04Py5wXCsY", "contributor": "0x896002E29FE4CDa28A3ae139b0bf7bAc26B33a8C"}

Given that the target audience of neighbors is often fixed, and that they know that the other person will not easily refuse, and that they are very talkative and other \"weaknesses\", the previous method is not effective.

{"id": "d0PdvcJoS5T3OQkY5Rrq7bq-25xCZqZ_UAsU64xxWTY", "title": "The selflessness of the good man", "body": "My parents and the generations above did not define their own worth. They built their happiness and well-being on others. They would feel depressed about other people's pain, and they would smile at other people's happiness, and they built their happiness and sorrow on other people, and they had no \"own\" world.\n\nAs long as it is for the good of others, they would rather suffer and call this \"zeal\", an act of kindness and virtue. Unfortunately, because of their deep-rooted values, they do not realize that it is their over-zealousness that leads to many conflicts and unhappiness in their own lives.\n\nI've read quite a few articles about such good old boys. And the results are clear. The enthusiastic helpers are not rewarded (of course they consider it a virtue to help without being rewarded), and the fact that they are enthusiastic becomes more and more widespread, and more and more people ask for their help, and the recipients become more and more dependent and see the help as a matter of course, and are distant and cold when they are dissatisfied.\n\nIn my definition, to be nice to others is to be nice enough to run one's own life properly, and then to find the energy to grant reasonable requests from others. If you are a good person, it's not called being good and virtuous, it's called self-abuse. The kind of sacrifice in their own lives to meet the skinny needs of others, is to do evil to themselves, to train a group of incompetent people who are in need of help, is to do evil to others, how to talk about virtue. Helping others is not an obligation, it is your own need from the heart to make each other better and not to affect your own life. So to see if that person is worth helping, responsible for the value of their time, is also responsible for others, must be crowned with such names as good deeds and virtue to have to respond, to prove the value of their selflessness, this is the value of the sky is too deep poisoning, I pity them. (Naive habits are not easy to change, not to mention the three views, trying to change the parents with their own power? I do not see hope in the visible future. Just like people who have passed on so much experience, they still live like this, because experience is often carved into the brain only when they have suffered)\n\nThe representative example around me, my mother, usually work a free time to do matchmaking, to go to the family husband on a mistress of the relatives to do comfort work, to buy a house to provide others to choose the site to lead the field reference ...... Once she met a property developer because of someone else's introduction (two layers of relationship), apparently the work of the unit spread, a lot of people looking for her and then to ask for connections to the number, one of them is my mother's so-called best friend, busy for more than a month for her to get things done from start to finish, without any little worry, the results only mention a little consultation fee thing, colleagues immediately flipped out, thinking that my mother wanted the money, until she The colleague confirmed that it was the developer's side that had the intention, and only after sending the money, invited my mother to dinner together. It is I have long pulled black this person, and she is convinced that their own set of values, chanting, nonsense after a period of time, it is not on the mind, girlfriends or girlfriends, the relationship as before, discontented heart also dare not take any interpersonal loss to risk.\n\nThe family internal relationship is not prioritized, but instead racking their brains to plan every aspect of life for others. I just don't get it.\n\nGood old people, in addition to work is the time is occupied by others for hours long to tell the sick, seek comfort, discuss the trivialities of life phone, they say that others have needs, refusal is rude, so the phone is always put around, with the answer to talk, unless people suddenly something to hang up, otherwise do half of the dinner can be delayed 2-3 hours before burning. As you can imagine, life at home has never been regular. Time is cut by a less important and urgent phone calls, which there is time to run their own family? A little bit of fuse, a word here and a word there, turning up old grievances against each other, old scores, the energy exhausted in other people's affairs is no longer enough to maintain reasonable emotions, but once the call comes, out the door or immediately to maintain the image of the good old boy. It seems exhausting to me that they live like this.\n\nThis chaotic home life is snowballing. The notion of getting satisfaction from others is further reinforced by the inability to find emotional comfort at home, and time and energy is spent more on the outside. A deeper disconnection between family members is then created. The increased imbalance between inside and outside makes life even worse. Yet they don't realize it.\n\nSacrificing themselves to help others because they have never paid attention to every aspect of themselves, and in the long run, they are not in good health.\n\nLong-term unequal value transactions between people are reasonably unsustainable unless the value-exporting party takes the initiative to make sacrifices and belittle the value of their own lives to reach a balance point of value exchange.\n\nWhy bother?", "timestamp": 1635694421, "digest": "sRqdn6BqyVBERsJc89OKHXZCDwgw7-FeEF83cDuaSss", "contributor": "0x71213a9C9504E406d3242436A4bf69c6bfE74461"}

In reality they are obviously not respected, riding a broken tricycle, with each garbage can as a treasure chest, each dumpster as a treasure trove, riding to a stop, bending down, stretching out muddy hands in the search for gold. They are even a class of people despised from the bottom of their hearts.\n\nTimes have changed. The transformation of the social and economic structure, the people's income level, inflation, the rapid development of the industry, the demand is changing, and the corresponding, the pace of the pursuit of profit is also accelerating. From the human tricycle, to electric tricycle, and then to the battery car; from the ringing of the bell, to the automatic playback of amplified speakers, to the obvious commercialization of the content of the broadcast. People are also, the older generation can not keep up with the pace of modern, backward model gradually lost competitiveness. Some young people have seen the business opportunities, bought various sets of equipment, hit the spot, also embarked on this road. To say that the most can reflect these changes, or the content of the collection and sale. From empty bottles, cardboard boxes, books, these fragmented, very low profit discards, into a whole, the profit fluctuation range of electronic products such as cell phones, computers, etc.; from clothes, furniture and other traditional consumer durables to specific appliances, faster replacement of non-traditional consumer durables.\n\nSo, in this era, the scene in the community has changed, the streets, middle-aged uncle slowly riding a battery car containing a trombone, round and round the community tirelessly cycle the \"beautiful\", monotonous and boring commercial advertising \"recycling old color TV, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, computers, water heaters, old mobile phones. You see, the sentences are symmetrical, focused and easy to read and remember.\n\nFor the old people engaged in this business in the past, you can say they are stupid, not enlightened, just this simple repetitive manual labor from the field to the city, daily mediocrity to sell hard work to earn a low tens of dollars, in the end is not as high as the wages of street beggars. But even if this idea is right, but the times have changed, ah, many things have changed, people really will not adapt to change, in order to survive and change, the past 600,700 can still be enough to cover the expenses of the city? The tools of life have been upgraded, requiring maintenance and depreciation; the value of time has increased (labor costs have increased), bringing higher time costs and the accompanying opportunity costs; competition has increased, diluting profits and bringing risks ...... In response to all the changes in the external and internal environment, they have had to make changes just to survive.\n\nIn fact, people in this industry have always been smart, so smart that they can bring themselves the average income of the average working class with just simple manual labor. It's just that in the past, no one noticed because of the relatively meager profits; today, there is no reason to underestimate the income generated by their industry. The formula is the same as in the past, but the change in the type of goods collected and sold has increased the net profit, which has made this sector to be recognized again. Specifically, you can base your calculations on the size of the community (of course, make a good pre-survey, the default target community has sufficient material storage), calculate the number of appliances that may be eliminated per building and per household per day, the probability of a successful transaction at a certain price... The cost of equipment, manpower, competition (can be maximized by cooperating with each other to reduce), etc., gross estimate, at least 3,000 yuan per month net income (and tax??). Here we consider the cost of entering the market of this community, such as property, security that off ... Generally are invested as a preliminary fixed cost, according to the nature of this industry will soon be able to pay back).\n\nSo you can't just judge the income by the industry's high and low, although I don't think it's considered an industry. And when disturbed by the tannoy headache, have to admire (or justify) their low level of intelligence as a means of survival. Anyway, there is a demand, there is a supply, and then there is an enduring market.\n\nShout to survive.", "timestamp": 1635694298, "digest": "7vhp78w7Hwyo1VBXljONN-j3m9dR2MjkThl0Su6ZXXg", "contributor": "0x078Ad5270b0240D8529f600f35A271Fc6E2b2bD8"}

Since language is the vehicle for expressing one's culture, we can perceive clearly the various elements of culture manifested by the language someone use: mentality(way of thinking), refinement, religion, sophistication(variants of meaning) and so on. Through learning more deelpy, we cross over the language barrier and start to acquire the cultural competence, that's one thing where language majors diiferent from languge learners. The same work, with foreign language translated, can be regarded as two compositions. As we walk into the museum of another country, we're entering a new world, finding a strange self inside us.\n\nSum: language as the keystone of culture is tightly intertwined with culture. Learning a language is inseparable from learning its culture. We have to see the world as native speakers do while learning the pronunciation, idioms, grammar...etc. We're gonna achieve the linguistic competence as well as the pragmatic or communicative competence.", "timestamp": 1635694484, "digest": "fdCqmuGlBz42HfT6FSM2FS0gAlO_m6tt26F3q_rqGuk", "contributor": "0x71213a9C9504E406d3242436A4bf69c6bfE74461"}

It became a smart device that reported how many drinks it had and if they were cold or not. 10 years later, \"The Computer of the 21st Century\" was fixated on computing everywhere, right into the real world.\n\nThe Internet was growing 24/7 more nodes were coming online.\n\nIt began to disrupt and displace real businesses. New layers of the stack began to feed on what were constant parts of the real world and economy. The network's nodes and data were made, taken, and uploaded by humans.\n\nType it in, hit a return key, snap a picture on a digital camera or hit record on a machine, slide barcodes over scanners.\n\nThe greatest routers were still the two-legged kind. Then, the Network was connected through sensors embedded in everything. Radio Frequency ID (RFID) was part of the key.\n\nYou get an Internet of Things, a network joined to the real world.\n\nKevin Ashton, P&G alum, and founder of MIT's Auto-ID lab coined the phrase in 1999. Bill Joy imagined \"device-to-device\" in a presentation at WEF at Davos. Cisco said \"IoT\" began 10 years later, when things to people went from 0.8 in 2003 to 1.8+ in 2010.\n\nThe Internet was no longer just PCs and mainframes.\n\nIt was in the home, or even its smart phones, it was the home itself, its electrical, mechanical innards, and appliances. It was factories, boats, ships, planes, offices, hospitals, power plants, and schools. It spread beyond civilian life, right back to its defense-related roots.\n\nA network's unreal reality melted into every corner of the real world.\n\n\\*\\*2877 Earth, The Necklace, The Promenade, Diplomatic Quarter\\*\\*\n\"Okay, let's talk, we'll go the long way round to your Consulate.\"\n\nThe Chief Inspector called in a floater, at the arrival/departure pad, and we took off for an elevated view of the sights. We were hermetically sealed in a police vehicle. No-one would hear us talk.\n\nThe Chief Inspector took a flask from a compartment and poured two drinks for this tour and talk.\n\n\"Just water. I was planning to send you back to the Consulate and then assign people to watch you, as if you were involved with that Coop we've been after but now you’re telling me that fight was not some kind of post-War grudge between Earthers and “Rusties”.\n\nThere's nothing I can do to detain or even stop you from going off-world, and back home. The higher-ups want make sure the Necklace is a business showcase for a new post-war Earth.\n\nI see a chance to get me closer to what I want. I want to take down that coop, they’ve been criminals we’ve wanted to arrest for a long time, even back during the War.”\n\n\"I can tell you share some details about the item but I’m not going to show you the item Chief Inspector.”\n\n“Commander, I have been after this shadow Co-op for a long time, and I want to know what has them ambitious to try to do this in a public place. They are either desperate, greedy, stupid, or insane. Maybe they are all of that. If you’re playing games...”\n\n\"Inspector, this item has cutting edge data and research that looked like it was from a top security facility, from the War Effort. Andreea’s family is one of the top dealer co-ops of Mars. The item was stolen from what thought to be a secure hiding place\" but it was some other group, and they used her family to bring it to Earth. I think they want to trade her for the item.\n\nThey can never get their hands on this device.”\n\n[https://audius.co/NetTerminalGene/ultraglow-131747](https://audius.co/NetTerminalGene/ultraglow-131747)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vB_F0wTW6JavYy25F8zAD.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A4Hv9W63UNKyMTFKhoiUg.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n", "timestamp": 1635695184, "digest": "QFuUQRtXycD9bey-epTK7thnHGpcKv_eciE1CVos8ok", "contributor": "0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f"}

∞)<br>皆さんこんにちは。お時間ありがとうございます！日本のコミュニティでAMAを行うことができて、本当に嬉しいです。\n\nえんまいさん)<br>\nまずICPuppiesの開発チームについて、そしてあなたとチームのバックグラウンドを教えてもらえますか？\n\nLucian ∞)<br>私たちのコアチームは、私とトムです。私たちは全く異なる経歴とスキルを持っていますが、だからこそ、一緒に仕事をすることで高い相乗効果が得られています。トムはどちらかというと人と接するのが好きなので、パートナーシップを構築したり、人脈を作ったり、一般的なオペレーションを担当しています。一方、私は静かで控えめな性格なので、アーティスティックな面を重視し、戦略を練るなどを担当しています。\n\nえんまいさん)<br>なぜDFINITYを選んだのですか？\n\nLucian ∞)<br>\nまず、我々はイーサリアムとそれを開発したチームには大変感謝しています。スマートコントラクトは技術的に見て大変大きなブレークスルーであり、近い将来、全世界が何らかの形でスマートコントラクト上で動くようになると強く信じています。\n\nしかしながら、イーサリアムは現状では多くの問題を抱えています。スケーラビリティからはじまりガス料金、さらには非中央集権性に至るまでについてです。これらの問題を解決するために、例えばSolanaのようなレイヤー2のソリューションがありますが、DFINITYのInternet Computerのようなモンスターブロックチェーン上に直接構築できるのに、なぜ「パッチ」を当てるのでしょうか？\n\nいただいたご質問に具体的な回答をしましょう。インターネットコンピュータは暗号空間全体の食物連鎖の頂点にあると考えているため、私たちはICP上に構築することを決めました。\n\nえんまいさん)<br>\n今回のプロジェクトについて、改めて詳しく教えてください。\n\nLucian ∞)<br>\nもちろんです。ICPuppiesは、皆さんご存知のように、10,000匹の子犬がランダムに生成される8ビットのコレクションです。最初にこのコレクションを始めた理由は幾つかあるのですが、一つ目にインターネット・コンピュータ上で何かを作りたかったから、二つ目に人々が共感できるNFTのコレクションを作りたかったから、そして三つ目に様々なチャリティへの寄付を統合したかったからです。コレクションの開発開始後すぐに、ローンチ（立ち上げ）を手伝ってくれたToniqLabsのメンバーと出会い、そこからすべてが変わりました。\n私たちは、インターネット上のコンピュータでNFTを使って多くのことができることに気づきました。いくつかのアイデアをブレインストーミングし始め、最終的にはウェアラブル、ゲームの開発、メタバースのコンセプトなどについて話し始めました。\n\nえんまいさん)<br>\n今後、CRONICSのような育種システムを取り入れて、交配を増やしていく予定はありますか？\n\nLucian ∞)<br>\nはい、あります。私たちのコミュニティでは、交配のアイデアを非常に重視しており、将来的にこの仕組みを取り入れます。しかし繁殖というのは非常に難しいことだと私は考えています。というのも、経済の視点で見ると、繁殖というのは供給を操作することになるからです。このため、実際に実装する前に、まずは数学的な視点にて繁殖による影響を充分に検証する必要があります。\n\nえんまいさん)<br>\n今度のゲームでは、子犬の服を着せ替えられるようになると聞きました。そうだとすると、なぜ裸の犬が貴重なのでしょうか？\n\nLucian ∞)<br>\n具体的なことは、ゲーム開発が進んでから明らかにしたいと思います。お楽しみに。\n\nえんまいさん)<br>\n今後どのようなゲームを作っていくのか具体的に聞きせてください。\n\nLucian ∞)<br>\n私たちは、RPG、ストラテジー、MMORPGの大ファンです。いくつかのアイデアがありますが、今はICPuppiesとチームの拡大に集中したいと思っています。\n\nえんまいさん)<br>\nゲーム内トークンはICPのみに交換されるのですか？また、どのように交換できるのでしょうか？\n\nLucian ∞)<br>\nトークンについて議論するのは現時点では少し時期尚早かと思っています。現時点では多くの部分で変更点となる可能性があるため、後から変更されるような発言は控えます。いたずらにハイプ（誇大広告）をすることは避けたいと思います。\n\nえんまいさん)<br>\nICPプラットフォームの内外を問わず、動物をモチーフにした新しいNFTが増えてきています。私たちのICPuppiesコミュニティがさらに成長するためには、それらとの差別化が必要だと考えています。もし、そのような差別化戦略があれば、ぜひ教えてください。\n\nLucian ∞)<br>\n私たちの最大の目標は、コア・バリューを中心としたコミュニティを発展させることです。コミュニティは、NFTのプロジェクトの成否を決めるものですから、そこに主眼を置いています。その他の戦略については、トムと私は毎日のようにブレインストーミングを行っています。適切な時期は自ずとやって来るはずなので、その際には計画の詳細を明らかにしましょう。\n\nえんまいさん)<br>\nゲーム内のトークンは、エアドロップと同じような方法で配布されるのでしょうか？レアリティに基づいているという記事を見ました。\n\nLucian ∞)<br>\nまだ公には議論していません。トークンの配布は、コミュニティ全体にとって公平なものになるのでご安心ください。\n\nえんまいさん)<br>\nこれまで他のICPのNFTプロジェクトとのコラボレーションはありますか？例えばコラボレーションNFTなども含めて。\n\nLucian ∞)<br>\nコラボレーションNFTの話はまだしていません。しかし、Infinite CharityやICMojiなどいくつかのプロジェクトとはコラボレーションをしています。\n\nえんまいさん)<br>\n子犬の世話をしないことで発生する子犬の幸福度の低下の内容と、そのデメリットは何でしょうか。\n\nLucian ∞)<br>\nこれは、今後のゲームの基本的なシステムのひとつになります。たまごっちのように、子犬のお世話をすることになります。おそらく、オリジナルのTamagotchiとはいくつかの違いはあるでしょう。例えば、子犬に朝4時に起こされて撫でないといけない、ということはないはずです（笑）でも、子犬が喜んでいれば、さまざまなアクティビティで多くの報酬を得ることができます。子犬が悲しんでいると、他のアクティビティから得られる報酬は少なくなります。これがハピネスシステムの主な目的です。\n\nえんまいさん)<br>\n繁殖は使いすぎないように高いレベルで行うことになっていますが、具体的にはどのようなものになるのでしょうか。\n\nLucian ∞)<br>\n個人的には、NG+（ニューゲームプラス）というコンセプトが好きです。私は『ダークソウル』のゲームを何時間もプレイしているのですが、あのシリーズでいつも気に入っているのは、ゲームを終えるとステータスを保持したままゲームプレイをリセットできることです。ゲームを最初からやり直す際、ステータスに合わせ難易度が上がっていきます。子犬のゲームでは、NG+のような実装を考えています。NG+に入ると、子犬の繁殖ポイントが1つ増えます。\n供給過多を避けるため、繁殖は稀少なものにしたいと考えたいます。これは繁殖を制限するための一つのアイデアです。もちろん、現時点では変更の可能性もあります。\n\nえんまいさん)<br>\nありがとうございました。最後に、アピールのためのコメントをお願いします！\n\nLucian ∞)<br>私を招待してくれてありがとうございます 何か質問があれば、遠慮なく聞いてください、すぐにお答えします\n\n## 当日の質問コーナー\n\nKAYATOさん)<br>\n交配システムは非常に魅力的だと感じました。\n供給過多にならないような具体的なアイデアを持っていますか？\n例）オリジナル品種以外の犬には寿命の概念があるなど\n\nLucian ∞)<br>\nそれについては、私とトムが話し合っています（過剰供給の回避）。そのためのバーニングメカニズムが実装されるかもしれません。最良のシナリオは、供給量に応じてプレイヤー数が増えることですが、そうでなければ、何かコントロールする方法を導入します。\n\noorennuさん)<br>\nあなた達はIC上で新しい歴史を生み出しました。\nそれに触発されて生まれたKittiesはあなた方とのコラボレーションを期待しています。\n今後同じDapps内で実装される可能性はありますか？\n\nLucian ∞)<br>\n我々はすでにKittiesと話をし、彼らの活動も気に入っています。そのため、将来的にはゲーム分野でのコラボレーションも期待できるでしょう。もちろん、このようなことをするためには、本番前にお互いのプロジェクトの間で多くの議論をする必要がありますが、最高の結果になることを期待しています\n\n***\n\nICPuppiesの皆さま、運営の皆さま、そして、お集まり頂いた皆さま\n\nとても良いAMAでした。ありがとうございました。\n\n***\n\nICPuppiesのツイッターアカウントは以下になります。\n\n<blockquote

{"id": "4VCiZdK3dj2xMDGwnBgbTBsGRSDXGt7IQpLATZAOc_Q", "title": "谈谈对元宇宙的理解", "body": "Facebook改名Meta的新闻最近成了最热门的话题，说起元宇宙我们每个人都会有一副大概的画面。或许来自《头号玩家》，《失控玩家》，也或许只是你喜欢的某款游戏，目前大家对元宇宙一致的理解是它是3D的，立体的，但这其实是个误区，Facebook这次更名让这个误解更深了。元宇宙并非是指VR/AR技术带来的全方位体验升级，它更多是指人类通过大规模协作构建出一个可以满足生活工作的数字空间。\n\n经过大厂的推广，大家已经认识到元宇宙就是下一代互联网，但很多人还不理解元宇宙和互联网最大区别是什么，所有权。元宇宙中的一草一木，一块土地一栋房子都是具有所有权的。这种所有权是指绝对拥有某个物品的权力，这种绝对所有权只有数字空间中能够实现。实现绝对所有权就离不开区块链技术，这也是为什么十年前就有VR技术，而我们直到今天才发展元宇宙。正因为区块链技术的发展成熟，元宇宙才明确了发展方向和建设形式。\n\n前段时间库里花18万美金购买NFT的新闻也成了热门话题，几乎大家都在讨论，但大部分互联网用户无法理解这到底意味着什么。互联网用户无法理解元宇宙这很正常，互联网流行之前很多人也无法理解它到底是什么。一些人以调侃的心态把自己头像也换成了那个NFT图片，然后美滋滋的说自己白嫖了18万。这就是在事物发生巨大变革时期人们的真实写照，就像T型车发明者福特所说的，如果你问人们想要什么，得到的答案是更快的马车。是这些换了头像的人是白嫖了库里，还是库里NFT白嫖了他们呢？这些人帮助库里免费传播了他的NFT，也增加这个NFT的价值。如果你无法理解一个二维图片的价值，那可以想象库里的一个3D物品，手表，汽车或房屋。\n\n不带上头盔你无法感知那种虚拟现实，不了解区块链你无法理解绝对所有权的意义。这两个东西构成了未来的元宇宙，但表现形式并没有大家认为的那么重要，2D的NFT头像很快要植入twitter上了，真正拥有某个NFT的人才能使用那个头像。其实这和购买游戏中的皮肤并没有本质区别，唯一区别是它可以转卖。不能转让的所有权没有任何意义，就像中国房地产改革那样，1998年中国彻底停止了房产分配制，后来的事情大家都知道了。这里并不是鼓励大家去投机这些虚拟物品，而是希望讲清楚即将到来的元宇宙到底是什么，以及如何提前布局获得发展红利。\n\n我会鼓励创意工作者要尽早了解元宇宙是什么，并参与到建设中去。创意工作者在数字空间中赚到钱并不是现在才有，《第二人生》这款游戏中早就有人以设计游戏道具为生，但最终由于游戏生命周期耗尽而被迫失业。问题出在哪呢？游戏的寿命。我们一直认为游戏是快销品，短则几个月，长则十年就会走向消亡。元宇宙是不会消亡的，不然这些Facebook也不会搞这么大动作了。\n\n即将到来的元宇宙是永久的，它基于区块链技术，区块链只能增加数据不可修改和删除。这为确定交互规则和保护用户权益提供了基础。权益如何体现呢？游戏中资产的所有权是每个玩过游戏的人都理解的，游戏中的道具让你更好的获得游戏体验。在元宇宙中，你拥有的数字商品不只是游戏道具，它可能还是一些拥有版权的图片，影片剪辑，帮助你更好的完成工作。对于建筑设计师，那些就是复用别人的设计成果再发挥自己的创意让作品变得更好的素材。对于IT工程师，代码也因为有了所有权成了一种商品。\n\n代码只需要写一次，就能复制到任何地方。程序员们不断复用其他人的劳动成果才能构建出如此复杂且丰富的互联网。在其他领域，软件也在继续吞噬世界，但他们缺少可以复用其他人劳动成果的模式。\n\n`“世界著名的工匠Wagmi-san，以最精致的配饰而闻名，最近在新东京开设了一家名为10KTF的商店。`\n\n`视日期而定，Wagmi-san先生可能会为猿、猫、机器人、Loot制作配饰……这完全取决于他的心情。作为一个有尊严的人，他只为拥有母 NFT 的客户制作物品。他的配件是 1 个只能创建一次的数字对象之一。`\n\n`生活很好。但他仍然需要收入以保持他的商店营业。它比替代方案更好。在去年夏天发生的事情之后，他不能让这种情况再次发生。”`\n\n这段文字来自10KTF的网站，它通过一段故事带你进入元宇宙中的虚拟店铺，10KTF团队设计了一系列商品，并通过组合NFT让这些商品变得与众不同。至于我们要不要把这些商品制造为实物，只是取决于你在现实世界中是否真的需要它。\n\n![爱好者挑选的无聊猿周边服饰](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IdhmVTSQCLG8Drpvg9c3x.png?height=461&width=616)\n\n随着元宇宙发展成熟，人类自然而然会过度到一种更环保的生活方式。大量现实世界中的库存将会被数字库存取代，非必要不制造并不需要强迫你做到，它只是一种自然的生活习惯。更多人需要的商品会更便宜，对接元宇宙的制造商会很乐意制造一些元宇宙中流行商品的物理版本，承接商品制造可以让厂商获得二次方投票积分，这是他们保持产品质量的动力。\n\n因为你的大部分物质需求和社交环境有关，而在未来你在虚拟世界中的社交活动会占到最大比重。这会产生大量虚拟商品的需求，NFT头像只是我们预览元宇宙的第一站。Facebook将吸引更多人关注元宇宙，但真正进入元宇宙是从你理解绝对所有权开始。\n\n在未来，我们在虚拟世界中铺张浪费，而在物理世界中精细调配。只有元宇宙才能让人类文明得以延续。", "timestamp": 1635698024, "digest": "UY5_-kOghLbRC6y5WwrQ0Nawh7IffXcc-b0JCMItOpQ", "contributor": "0xABEe5597EB23AfDE43f0b6654CD60aB8329556c7"}

{"id": "LV3YY6Un2oPZ4So48l4_Q6IBHHzvS4iPA__nRTOhExA", "title": "元宇宙是一场所有权革命", "body": "Facebook改名Meta的新闻最近成了最热门的话题，说起元宇宙我们每个人都会有一副大概的画面。或许来自《头号玩家》，《失控玩家》，也或许只是你喜欢的某款游戏，目前大家对元宇宙一致的理解是它是3D的，立体的，但这其实是个误区，Facebook这次更名让这个误解更深了。元宇宙并非是指VR/AR技术带来的全方位体验升级，它更多是指人类通过大规模协作构建出一个可以满足生活工作的数字空间。\n\n经过大厂的推广，大家已经认识到元宇宙就是下一代互联网，但很多人还不理解元宇宙和互联网最大区别是什么，所有权。元宇宙中的一草一木，一块土地一栋房子都是具有所有权的。这种所有权是指绝对拥有某个物品的权力，这种绝对所有权只有数字空间中能够实现。实现绝对所有权就离不开区块链技术，这也是为什么十年前就有VR技术，而我们直到今天才发展元宇宙。正因为区块链技术的发展成熟，元宇宙才明确了发展方向和建设形式。\n\n前段时间库里花18万美金购买NFT的新闻也成了热门话题，几乎大家都在讨论，但大部分互联网用户无法理解这到底意味着什么。互联网用户无法理解元宇宙这很正常，互联网流行之前很多人也无法理解它到底是什么。一些人以调侃的心态把自己头像也换成了那个NFT图片，然后美滋滋的说自己白嫖了18万。这就是在事物发生巨大变革时期人们的真实写照，就像T型车发明者福特所说的，如果你问人们想要什么，得到的答案是更快的马车。是这些换了头像的人是白嫖了库里，还是库里NFT白嫖了他们呢？这些人帮助库里免费传播了他的NFT，也增加这个NFT的价值。如果你无法理解一个二维图片的价值，那可以想象库里的一个3D物品，手表，汽车或房屋。\n\n不带上头盔你无法感知那种虚拟现实，不了解区块链你无法理解绝对所有权的意义。这两个东西构成了未来的元宇宙，但表现形式并没有大家认为的那么重要，2D的NFT头像很快要植入twitter上了，真正拥有某个NFT的人才能使用那个头像。其实这和购买游戏中的皮肤并没有本质区别，唯一区别是它可以转卖。不能转让的所有权没有任何意义，就像中国房地产改革那样，1998年中国彻底停止了房产分配制，后来的事情大家都知道了。这里并不是鼓励大家去投机这些虚拟物品，而是希望讲清楚即将到来的元宇宙到底是什么，以及如何提前布局获得发展红利。\n\n我会鼓励创意工作者要尽早了解元宇宙是什么，并参与到建设中去。创意工作者在数字空间中赚到钱并不是现在才有，《第二人生》这款游戏中早就有人以设计游戏道具为生，但最终由于游戏生命周期耗尽而被迫失业。问题出在哪呢？游戏的寿命。我们一直认为游戏是快销品，短则几个月，长则十年就会走向消亡。元宇宙是不会消亡的，不然这些Facebook也不会搞这么大动作了。\n\n即将到来的元宇宙是永久的，它基于区块链技术，区块链只能增加数据不可修改和删除。这为确定交互规则和保护用户权益提供了基础。权益如何体现呢？游戏中资产的所有权是每个玩过游戏的人都理解的，游戏中的道具让你更好的获得游戏体验。在元宇宙中，你拥有的数字商品不只是游戏道具，它可能还是一些拥有版权的图片，影片剪辑，帮助你更好的完成工作。对于建筑设计师，那些就是复用别人的设计成果再发挥自己的创意让作品变得更好的素材。对于IT工程师，代码也因为有了所有权成了一种商品。\n\n代码只需要写一次，就能复制到任何地方。程序员们不断复用其他人的劳动成果才能构建出如此复杂且丰富的互联网。在其他领域，软件也在继续吞噬世界，但他们缺少可以复用其他人劳动成果的模式。\n\n`“世界著名的工匠Wagmi-san，以最精致的配饰而闻名，最近在新东京开设了一家名为10KTF的商店。`\n\n`视日期而定，Wagmi-san先生可能会为猿、猫、机器人、Loot制作配饰……这完全取决于他的心情。作为一个有尊严的人，他只为拥有母 NFT 的客户制作物品。他的配件是 1 个只能创建一次的数字对象之一。`\n\n`生活很好。但他仍然需要收入以保持他的商店营业。它比替代方案更好。在去年夏天发生的事情之后，他不能让这种情况再次发生。”`\n\n这段文字来自10KTF的网站，它通过一段故事带你进入元宇宙中的虚拟店铺，10KTF团队设计了一系列商品，并通过组合NFT让这些商品变得与众不同。至于我们要不要把这些商品制造为实物，只是取决于你在现实世界中是否真的需要它。\n\n爱好者挑选的无聊猿周边服饰\n\n随着元宇宙发展成熟，人类自然而然会过度到一种更环保的生活方式。大量现实世界中的库存将会被数字库存取代，非必要不制造并不需要强迫你做到，它只是一种自然的生活习惯。更多人需要的商品会更便宜，对接元宇宙的制造商会很乐意制造一些元宇宙中流行商品的物理版本，承接商品制造可以让厂商获得二次方投票积分，这是他们保持产品质量的动力。\n\n因为你的大部分物质需求和社交环境有关，而在未来你在虚拟世界中的社交活动会占到最大比重。这会产生大量虚拟商品的需求，NFT头像只是我们预览元宇宙的第一站。Facebook将吸引更多人关注元宇宙，但真正进入元宇宙是从你理解绝对所有权开始。\n\n在未来，我们在虚拟世界中铺张浪费，而在物理世界中精细调配。只有元宇宙才能让人类文明得以延续。", "timestamp": 1635698080, "digest": "HV82fSw-eecvK2DWR9kN3GjdPHwIjGpdGI1Dk7FEzr0", "contributor": "0xABEe5597EB23AfDE43f0b6654CD60aB8329556c7"}

IDO参与流程\n\n当IDO开启后，在首页会看到IDO的入口，如下图所示。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FTp5kEA_TleQSmH2HeYOrE.jpg\\&w=3840\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n进入之后，会看到Participate按钮，点击进入。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FmWfvSL_XerMHEzL3XNxct.jpg\\&w=3840\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n然后，你会看到一个任务列表（如下图），完成所有的任务，你才有资格参与IDO，由于截图是用我自己的钱包，因此，所有任务字体都被标为绿色，当你第一次进的时候，任务显示为红色，你需要逐项完成。\n\n**Note**: 需要注意的是，第四项任务是KYC认证，对很多国家做了限制，其中就包括中国大陆，因此，我建议你先完成此任务，因为一旦审核不通过，你就会功亏一篑。特别第二步是支付IDO预付款，不管你KYC过没过，这些钱仍然会在IDO期间锁定，影响你自己的资金流通。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F2ORABHSfwrfgAxnJpt60C.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n先说第一项任务，选择你的资金档次（Tier）。这里，大体有三个档次可供选择，如下图所示。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FoPFjWRb0Kdd1B5-gf0H_V.png\\&w=1920\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n这三个档次从左至右分别是中队（squadron）、新兵（recruit）、兵团（faction）。每一档的门槛都不一样，新兵的门槛最低，需要250 STE（StarTerra Energy），中队需要500 STE，军团则需要3000 STE。\n\nSTE的计算方式如下：\n\n> *STE = $STT + ($STT-UST LP x 1.25)*\n\n也就是说，如果你想加入新兵，那么，你可以质押250个$STT，还可以质押200个$STT-UST LP（*200 x 1.25=250*），二者都可以满足250 STE的最低要求。\n\n不论是LP，还是单币，你都需要质押到平台。在质押的界面，同样有三个军团可供选择，如图所示。从左至右分别是守护者（lunatics）、星际殖民者（interstellars）、战士（degens），此三个军团的选择，会影响你后面战队的选择。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FmXQa5nASfI3ZU4FZYofSu.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n完成质押后，你可以自行选择档次，也可以用auto-match来自动匹配。\n\n对于最低的新兵档而言，你在完成选择后，会自动跳回IDO主界面。对于中队和兵团档而言，你会进入战队选择界面，如下图所示。不同的兵团会有不同的战队可供选择，每个战队有15人的上限，先到先得。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FAmenCMuEsykksoj-iVhV3.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n在完成质押和档次选择后，你需要支付IDO的预付款，预付款和你的档次选择有关，对于新兵和中队档，预付款的最小支付金额是250 $UST，对于军团，最小支付金额是1000 $UST，但请注意，这里是**最小**金额，也就是说，最终你的中签金额并不一定是这个数字，有可能比这个要多，所以，我个人建议，一定要备足预付款，宁多勿少，一旦预付款不足，你就会失去IDO资格，这无疑会让人扼腕叹息。如果无法一次性质押足额预付款也没关系，界面有入口让你补足。\n\n关于具体能拿到多少IDO额度，不同档次会有区别，总体来说，由两部分构成，分别是保障额度（guaranteed）和随机额度（lottery）。\n\n从档次选择界面可以看到，新兵档次只有随机额度，而中队和兵团有保障额度和随机额度两部分构成。保障额度根据每个档次的总奖励和总人数，进行平均分配，而随机额度则是随机分配，没有最低保障，随机额度的具体大小，和你贡献的STE有关，贡献越多，获得随机额度的概率就越高，数额也越大。在官方文档中，建议质押500 STE的用户仍然选择新兵档次，个人猜测，是因为500以上STE的贡献，在新兵阵营里是比较有竞争力的数额，虽然只能拿到随机额度，但比较容易分配到较大份额，而在中队阵营里，显然500 STE并没有很大的竞争力，往往拿不到随机额度，而只能拿到保障额度，因此，这并不一定划算。\n\n在IDO页面还能看到STE排行榜（如下图），排名越高，分到的随机额度越大，说白了，这就是给大户氪金用的，如果资金充足，可以拿到非常大额度的IDO。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FxwfH4qv8Lea7PyU-uSbXW.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n在IDO结束后，你的预付款会解除锁定，未使用的预付款可以自行退回钱包。\n\n## 总评\n\nStarTerra在Terra链上的定位，是基础平台类应用，相似的产品还有Pylon，代币经济模型比较完整，具有通缩、回购机制，代币在IDO过程中也有足够的使用场景。但平台主打的Play2Earn概念，限量NFT等，目前仍然未上线，我目前还无法评价好坏，但按照白皮书所描述的roadmap，后期$STT的赋能会更加丰富。\n\n## 参考\n\n*   [\\[1\\] StarTerra项目白皮书](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o0SlAth8HWt9V98Pj8N7qiXC2qGYK18a/view)\n*   [\\[2\\] Terra Land X StarTerra IDO Instructions](https://medium.com/@StarTerra/terra-land-x-starterra-ido-instructions-cdd9aebff883)\n", "timestamp": 1635698017, "digest": "jco6E-wejhyg1ofPzZf4GrUeumn2o4d21rwlBD1p9PM", "contributor": "0xfbeb760002BF602d4e563c4B774e03d548F81ab6"}
{"id": "cMD5902s5xzBbwx77z8WYjQWKYFhvKUu1X0GjuUfpqY", "title": "元宇宙是一场所有权革命", "body": "Facebook改名Meta的新闻最近成了最热门的话题，说起元宇宙我们每个人都会有一副大概的画面。或许来自《头号玩家》，《失控玩家》，也或许只是你喜欢的某款游戏，目前大家对元宇宙一致的理解是它是3D的，立体的，但这其实是个误区，Facebook这次更名让这个误解更深了。元宇宙并非是指VR/AR技术带来的全方位体验升级，它更多是指人类通过大规模协作构建出一个可以满足生活工作的数字空间。\n\n经过大厂的推广，大家已经认识到元宇宙就是下一代互联网，但很多人还不理解元宇宙和互联网最大区别是什么，所有权。元宇宙中的一草一木，一块土地一栋房子都是具有所有权的。这种所有权是指绝对拥有某个物品的权力，这种绝对所有权只有数字空间中能够实现。实现绝对所有权就离不开区块链技术，这也是为什么十年前就有VR技术，而我们直到今天才发展元宇宙。正因为区块链技术的发展成熟，元宇宙才明确了发展方向和建设形式。\n\n前段时间库里花18万美金购买NFT的新闻也成了热门话题，几乎大家都在讨论，但大部分互联网用户无法理解这到底意味着什么。互联网用户无法理解元宇宙这很正常，互联网流行之前很多人也无法理解它到底是什么。一些人以调侃的心态把自己头像也换成了那个NFT图片，然后美滋滋的说自己白嫖了18万。这就是在事物发生巨大变革时期人们的真实写照，就像T型车发明者福特所说的，如果你问人们想要什么，得到的答案是更快的马车。是这些换了头像的人是白嫖了库里，还是库里NFT白嫖了他们呢？这些人帮助库里免费传播了他的NFT，也增加这个NFT的价值。如果你无法理解一个二维图片的价值，那可以想象库里的一个3D物品，手表，汽车或房屋。\n\n不带上头盔你无法感知那种虚拟现实，不了解区块链你无法理解绝对所有权的意义。这两个东西构成了未来的元宇宙，但表现形式并没有大家认为的那么重要，2D的NFT头像很快要植入twitter上了，真正拥有某个NFT的人才能使用那个头像。其实这和购买游戏中的皮肤并没有本质区别，唯一区别是它可以转卖。不能转让的所有权没有任何意义，就像中国房地产改革那样，1998年中国彻底停止了房产分配制，后来的事情大家都知道了。这里并不是鼓励大家去投机这些虚拟物品，而是希望讲清楚即将到来的元宇宙到底是什么，以及如何提前布局获得发展红利。\n\n我会鼓励创意工作者要尽早了解元宇宙是什么，并参与到建设中去。创意工作者在数字空间中赚到钱并不是现在才有，《第二人生》这款游戏中早就有人以设计游戏道具为生，但最终由于游戏生命周期耗尽而被迫失业。问题出在哪呢？游戏的寿命。我们一直认为游戏是快销品，短则几个月，长则十年就会走向消亡。元宇宙是不会消亡的，不然这些Facebook也不会搞这么大动作了。\n\n即将到来的元宇宙是永久的，它基于区块链技术，区块链只能增加数据不可修改和删除。这为确定交互规则和保护用户权益提供了基础。权益如何体现呢？游戏中资产的所有权是每个玩过游戏的人都理解的，游戏中的道具让你更好的获得游戏体验。在元宇宙中，你拥有的数字商品不只是游戏道具，它可能还是一些拥有版权的图片，影片剪辑，帮助你更好的完成工作。对于建筑设计师，那些就是复用别人的设计成果再发挥自己的创意让作品变得更好的素材。对于IT工程师，代码也因为有了所有权成了一种商品。\n\n代码只需要写一次，就能复制到任何地方。程序员们不断复用其他人的劳动成果才能构建出如此复杂且丰富的互联网。在其他领域，软件也在继续吞噬世界，但他们缺少可以复用其他人劳动成果的模式。\n\n`“世界著名的工匠Wagmi-san，以最精致的配饰而闻名，最近在新东京开设了一家名为10KTF的商店。`\n\n`视日期而定，Wagmi-san先生可能会为猿、猫、机器人、Loot制作配饰……这完全取决于他的心情。作为一个有尊严的人，他只为拥有母 NFT 的客户制作物品。他的配件是 1 个只能创建一次的数字对象之一。`\n\n`生活很好。但他仍然需要收入以保持他的商店营业。它比替代方案更好。在去年夏天发生的事情之后，他不能让这种情况再次发生。”`\n\n这段文字来自10KTF的网站，它通过一段故事带你进入元宇宙中的虚拟店铺，10KTF团队设计了一系列商品，并通过组合NFT让这些商品变得与众不同。至于我们要不要把这些商品制造为实物，只是取决于你在现实世界中是否真的需要它。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bnJF4eEb4Jk3VZuxrav8l.png?height=616&width=616)\n\n![爱好者挑选的无聊猿周边服饰](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4oUTN8ihT2LwT28tkOn-.png?height=461&width=616)\n\n随着元宇宙发展成熟，人类自然而然会过度到一种更环保的生活方式。大量现实世界中的库存将会被数字库存取代，非必要不制造并不需要强迫你做到，它只是一种自然的生活习惯。更多人需要的商品会更便宜，对接元宇宙的制造商会很乐意制造一些元宇宙中流行商品的物理版本，承接商品制造可以让厂商获得二次方投票积分，这是他们保持产品质量的动力。\n\n因为你的大部分物质需求和社交环境有关，而在未来你在虚拟世界中的社交活动会占到最大比重。这会产生大量虚拟商品的需求，NFT头像只是我们预览元宇宙的第一站。Facebook将吸引更多人关注元宇宙，但真正进入元宇宙是从你理解绝对所有权开始。\n\n在未来，我们在虚拟世界中铺张浪费，而在物理世界中精细调配。只有元宇宙才能让人类文明得以延续。", "timestamp": 1635698322, "digest": "HV82fSw-eecvK2DWR9kN3GjdPHwIjGpdGI1Dk7FEzr0", "contributor": "0xABEe5597EB23AfDE43f0b6654CD60aB8329556c7"}

Wow!!\n\n## 当日の質問コーナー\n\n***\n\nnmkmnさん)<br>ロードマップに関する詳しい説明をありがとうございました。2つの質問があります。<br>\n\n1.  来年の1月～2月にリリースされる「Meme metaverse」にとても興味があります。スニークピークはありますか？\n2.  ICPでは様々なプロジェクトが生まれています。そこで発表されたNFTは、将来的にメタバースに移行すると思います。ICPの他のプロジェクトとのコラボレーションの予定はありますか？\n\ncakemakerさん)<br>ミーム・メタバースは、基本的にミーム構築ツールでできています。ここでは、素晴らしいものを追加・作成することができます。しかし、私たちの焦点は、メタバースのソリューションではなく、プラットフォームにあります。これはOGのためのものです。\n\n現時点では、プラットフォームを構築し、価値を生み出すことに注力しています。適切なパートナーが見つかれば、ぜひ提携したいと思います。現時点では、私たちのプラットフォームは誰でもプリセールスを扱うことができます。これは開発中のもので、ある素晴らしいプロジェクトと交渉中です。\n\n***\n\noorennuさん)<br>IC上には既に分散型TikTokのCANCANがありますが、今後それと提携する予定はありますか？\n\ncakemakerさん)<br>CAN CANは、開発が終了したプロジェクトです。コードを拡張することも考えました。モバイルアプリのアルファ版は用意しています。\n\noorennuさん)<br>申し訳ありません。\nこれはとてもふざけた質問になるのですが、あなた方のメインキャラクター“Balls”はやはり2もしくは複数描かれているのですか？\n\ncakemakerさん)<br>Ballsはキャラクターの名前です。それは単数形です。\n\nbug slayerさん)<br>そのキャラクターの名前と、1:1の割合でボールをエアドロップします。\n\n***\n\n死者蘇生のカードさん)<br>バックグランドとプロジェクトのご説明ありがとうございます。どうしてmeme プロジェクトを始めようと思ったのですか？\n\ncakemakerさん)<br>ソーシャルネットワークで活発な問題が発生しています。最も有名なプラットフォームである9gagは、インセンティブによってメンバーをサポートしていません。これらのプラットフォームは何十億ドルも稼いでいますが、メンバーは何も受け取っていません。もし、インセンティブのあるプラットフォームがあれば、流れを変えて、Dfinityにネットワーク効果をもたらすことができます。\n\nbug slayerさん)<br>\nこのプラットフォームを支えているのは、笑いが大好きな人々で、ジェネレーションYとZを中心としたグローバルなオーディエンスのためのものです。\n\n***\n\nHWRDさん)<br>私の質問は以下の通りです。\n\n1.  EntrepotのようなプラットフォームでNFTを売買できるようになるのでしょうか？また、EntrepotのようなプラットフォームでNFTを売買できるようになるのでしょうか、それともcakeclubのマーケットプレイスのみでの売買になるのでしょうか？\n2.  どのウォレットがNFTをサポートする予定ですか？\n\ncakemakerさん)<br>\nはい、Entrepotで売買できますし、近い将来、私たちのプラットフォームで取引ができるようになることを期待しています。誰でもプラットフォーム/マーケットプレイスに入ることができます。制限はありません。現在の制限は、初期段階のプロトタイプであるために設定されています。\n\nプラグとストイックウォレットをサポートします。\n\n***\n\nえんまいさん)<br>\n投資家やユーザーにとっての魅力は何ですか？\n\ncakemakerさん)<br>我々の評価は現時点ではかなり低い。もしあなたがNFTを購入しているのであれば、自動的にいくつかのトークンのエアドロップを受け取ることになります。これらのNFTをburnすることを選択した場合、MCKトークンを請求しながらボーナスリワードを得ることができます。私たちの焦点は、プラットフォームを通じて収益を上げ、持続可能なビジネスを構築することです。投資家にとっては、評価額が低いため、参入するのに適した時期だと思います。私たちのチームは、ビジネスと技術に関する確かな知識を持っており、これを流行らせることができると確信しています。\n\n***\n\nSYOGAKU-TOUSHI)<br>こんにちは。ステーキングのことで質問します。\nステーキングの重要度スコアの中身はどのようなものになるか？\nスコアの計算方法などは開示されますか？\n\ncakemakerさん)<br>絶対に。算出方法については今後明らかにしていきます。実際に、この件に関するFAQがすでにデータベースに登録されています。ステイキングプロセスの開発については、こちらをご覧ください。<br>\nPOIスコアはいくつかの要素で構成されています。\n\n1.  お客様の賭け金額（NFT/Tokens）\n2.  あなたのプラットフォーム活動\n3.  マーケットプレイスでの活動 など 現在進行中です。\n\n***\n\nbug slayerさん)<br>\nこのプロジェクトに関する質問や詳細については、DiscordとTelegramにお問い合わせください。どちらのプラットフォームでも、最初の10K人の参加者にはトークンのエアドロップがあります。\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/6xZptaadZy](https://discord.gg/6xZptaadZy)<br>\nTelegram: [https://t.me/meme_cake](https://t.me/meme_cake)\n\nプレセールに参加したい方は、こちらのフォームから\n[https://a05ws92sxh8.typeform.com/to/iQjISeuT](https://a05ws92sxh8.typeform.com/to/iQjISeuT)\n\nを予約してください。\nなお、ICPのお振込みでご請求いただけます。\n\n***\n\nちょっと後から、また修正するかもしれませんが、大体こんな感じです。\n\n何か変なところあったら教えてくださいませー\n", "timestamp": 1635699470, "digest": "yAD6VDMNTn0qrdnVyNvbU5MoQ80IdDP5zj3M6dekQCc", "contributor": "0xEF83a287DED45962997584174DdB2c68dC215E3B"}

I only read about him passingly, but I remember one thing he wrote that kind of moved me. He put it in the mouth of Hamlet, I think it was, who said “to be or not to be”. He was in doubt about something. Whether it was nobler, in the mind of man, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune— moderation—or to take up arms against the sea of troubles and, by opposing, end them. And I go for that; if you take up arms you’ll end it, but if you sit around and wait for the one who is in power to make up his mind that he should end it, you’ll be waiting a long time. And in my opinion… you’re living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution, a time when there’s got to be a change, people in power have misused it, and now there has to be a change. And a better world has to be built and the only way it’s going to be built is with extreme methods. And I, for one, will join in with anyone—don’t care what color you are—as long as you want to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth. Thank you.”*\n>\n> *-Malcolm X*\n\nThe above is a closing excerpt from Malcom X’s Oxford Union Debate, December 3, 1964. It is one of many of the revolutionary speeches that he made as a global voice against racism and a symbol of Black liberation up until his assassination in February the following year.\n\nIn today’s climate, his message remains true more than ever— we all live in a time of extremism and revolution. A massive subtle war goes on around us, with pervasively amplified attempts to suffocate those that speak out against the old crumbled systems, and no sector of our lives remains free from it, despite what most play dress up to pretend otherwise.\n\n### “...to take up arms against the sea of troubles and, by opposing, end them..”\n\nIn a centralized tech and media dystopia, where our every thought and data metric is calibrated to work against us in favor of a mediocrity of convenience and inertia, culture becomes the currency and arms that we take up to break free.\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=509](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=509)\n\n**In this corner of the nascent web3 metaverse, we trash the myths that hold us back, to create a new fashion movement.**\n\nWeb3 is our one true shot at transforming the foundation and every aspect of the landscape surrounding us. To get the next evolution of the internet right. To co-create the open web3 metaverse, where not just communication infrastructure is decentralised as in web1, or semi decentralised as in web2, but, is fully decentralised end-to-end across everything of value. Accelerating the timeline to when we get there has become critically urgent as the old legacy players from web2 and many decades before, continue to give us the twin illusions of freedom and choice. Weaving systems that work actively against us to the short term benefit of the very few, these cartels continue to exert accelerating control of our data, finances, health, social mobility, beliefs, thoughts, relationships with each other, and more, through shocking levels of fraud and abuse.\n\nThese illusions are made worse by those who wear the glitter of web3 in #CT public, but simp web2 Meta behind their masks.\n\nPumping NFTs and VC social clubs deployed on chain isn’t enough to actually be web3. If that’s all it took, all we’d be doing is petitioning for slightly better conditions from those in old power in the hope that we might become the new priesthood. We can do better than become replacement gatekeepers as the previous generations retire on the data riches they’ve extracted from us.\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=510](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=510)\n\n## So what’s so revolutionary about fashion?\n\nIt makes us into anyone we dare to be.\n\nIt gives us superpowers.\n\nIn a traditional sense, that’s limited to an impression and what our pockets or bags carry for us. With web3, the metastory, programmable utility, and interoperability enabled by transformative redefinitions of fashion extend to our senses, and the tangible exercise, of luxury and power.\n\nIt is an Arthur C. Clarke kind of magic when we can reframe how and where we wear fashion, the materials we use to design it, and what it ultimately is.\n\n**It is finally the full set of all the tools that we wear.**\n\nIf we hope to build the better world we all know is within reach, the only fashion that matters is that which empowers us as designers, wearers, and buyers with enhanced ownership, self-determination, prospects for wealth, and creative freedom. Beyond simply artisanal images, 3d models, and glitzy videos secured by NFTs and DAO vaults, web3 fashion actively advances the interconnectivity between us and our strengths from edge to edge. From lace to seam.\n\nWithin this broader vision fast becoming more real by the day, Trash Fashion, is an anti-establishment form of digital design that takes what many might see as old, worn out, used pieces and recycles them into an entirely novel interpretation as part of a much larger message. It’s a bottom up composable approach to directly imprint mod culture into the very fabric of the source materials.\n\n**It is not for the faint of heart or the risk averse. But then, again, when is anything good and revolutionary afraid of getting trashy for change?**\n\nFor far too long traditional fashion has been among the most unsustainable industries, with the most exploitative, destructive, dehumanizing, and extractive practices. As these legacy brands catch up to the supposedly easy new money enabled by web3, it is no surprise that many are now in a rush to spin up blockchain x fashion initiatives and are experimenting with minting all too ordinary fashion NFTs— as direct transplants from old ideas of luxury and appeal, without any of the industry fundamentals actually changing. At the crossroads of a radically new socio-economic medium, it’s obvious we need to define the difference between old famous throwaway fashion NFTs vs real web3 fashion, and with our actions, choose to build and scale the latter. It’s just far too comfortable and safe not to.\n\nThe safest thing that we can do in a time like this is supply fashion, digital or physical, that is cozy within what those before us defined as the constraints of what we could be. It’s not to say that high fidelity 3D is something that I don’t enjoy immensely, or that it can’t be revolutionary, but, to take a radical stance we must strike at the heart of the abusive system.\n\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=511](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=511)\n\n## Trash fashion breaks the illusion.\n\nIt is the ultimate form of expression that you can wear and take off without permission.\n\nAll interpretations are welcome.\n\n🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑\n\n\n---\n\nTo commemorate Robness’s epic sales this week & Max Capacity’s awesome Dos Punks, I’ve designed 4 Dos Trash Fashion NFTs.

{"id": "UVdQw9W1ABH4T743cK7qPf_T20rJrGF2e8lDStsyxY0", "title": "Ep 10 | The Great Awakening", "body": "After years and years of holding apart from social media, I finally decided to go “all in”, December 24, 2020.\n\nNow coming up on the one-year anniversary when I spun up my Twitter account, with the handle @SpaceXponential.\n\nThough reasons remain to tread lightly, I can say, without a second’s hesitation, that everything every social media guru tweeted about has happened.\n\nYes, for me, it happened just the way they said it would.\n\nWhen I finally put myself out there, everything changed. When I finally began writing consistently, sharing ideas, that mythical magnet came alive.\n\nI began to draw new connections, new warmth, new possibilities into my life. An abundant flow of good will.\n\nThe velocity at which things are evolving stuns me, daily, hourly. For good, for ill.\n\nBefore taking the plunge into the Twitter-verse, I read and listened to quite a bit of David Perell, Gary Vaynerchuk, Jack Butcher. Something I heard repeatedly, which I’m sure is tried and true, is the importance of listening.\n\nYou put yourself out there and then you listen. How does stuff land? You look at views, engagement. You lean into what resonates. Simple as that.\n\nOnly, I find, it’s not so simple.\n\nI can look at my analytics on the YouTube channel and see clearly which video got the most views and longest average view duration. I know which article got the most engagement, retweets. And it’s easy for me to understand why.\n\nI totally get the value of sharing concrete strategies around DAOs. If the tables were turned, I would want that, prefer that, myself. But it’s quite rare for me to feel that I have something to offer that is a, air quotes, concrete strategy.\n\nThese days, I have questions. I have things bubbling up that are hard to articulate. I’m feeling my way through the dark.\n\nSo I listened, and there is a path ahead that I could take, that is clearly lit. But I am, for now, going another way. This would not be the recommended strategy.\n\nI’ve been asked why my YouTube videos are unlisted. I know this makes it difficult for my ten subscribers *(smiling proudly)* to catch up with me. Yet at the moment, I feel like I don’t want to put any energy into building “a presence” on YouTube, a company whose values and actions are so opposite mine.\n\nBut the discoverability issue, the issue of watching videos on YouTube having a certain friction, are real. For instance, if someone has a vague desire to watch one of my videos but wants to “save it for later,” that’s not the easiest thing to do. I have dozens of YT videos that I’ve saved for later, that I never get around to.\n\nSo the plan right now is to stand up a podcast and publish the audio there. Theory is that pods are more easily saved, and returned to. And a pod opens the door for me to collab with a talented musician… more on this later.\n\n## The Identity\n\nI’m working with a designer to try to forge an identity for the Tao of DAO. I sent a quick brief. She sent back some first thoughts quite some time ago.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IBj2ifsOhC6WKlV_LuL97.jpeg?height=1918&width=2000)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c6Eq8EtNRVlZtGEvY17Af.jpeg?height=2324&width=2908)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P4e6Sm7mm6NZ5ah2WmQ1_.jpeg?height=1622&width=2495)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Qba6fgUGOegpGOp6mMTDj.jpeg?height=3301&width=2136)\n\nWhat do you think, dear Friends?\n\nI’m not sure if I can sense the seed in any of these. Tonight, I clarified some of the language I had offered to her for guidance, asked the designer to start again. I do sense something in the image immediately above, not sure.\n\n## Gardening in Public\n\nIn tonight’s vlog, I think aloud on what the media is dubbing the Great Resignation - millions of Americans are leaving their jobs.\n\nA record-breaking 4-million plus Americans quit their jobs in August alone.\n\nWhy? Why now, when uncertainty has never felt so prevalent in our lives? Seems, in a word, counterintuitive.\n\nWasn’t the insecurity of the American worker supposed to work in the employers’ favor, a la [Alan Greenspan](https://money.cnn.com/1997/01/22/economy/workers_pkg/)?  From the linked article:\n\n> [Sam Bacharach](https://money.cnn.com/1997/01/22/economy/workers_pkg/bacharach.06.jpg), a Cornell University labor-relations professor, said that \"in plain English,\" Greenspan's \\[1997\\] remarks \\[about the insecure American worker\\] mean \"that for all too long we've ignored ... those workers in our society who are working, but are working with the fear that tomorrow they won't have a job -- so they'd better keep their mouths shut.\"\n\nThe experts with fancy titles have their theories. The same ones who predicted that the ending of federal unemployment assistance would drive the hordes of laborers back into the the market.\n\nI propose a re-frame.\n\nThis is the Great Awakening.\n\n[https://youtu.be/7NHyn4X6aQE](https://youtu.be/7NHyn4X6aQE)\n\nIn my mind’s eye, I keep seeing [Zuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOn2CZWnxxY) and his practiced-politician gestures, saying “Presence! Felt presence.”\n\nPresence, I think, has nothing to do with simulating reality.\n\nsigning off, with gratitude for the presence in my life of Natalie, Flex, Louis, Jack, Mark, and Alex,\n\nC", "timestamp": 1635699457, "digest": "xottlZo2Il4ouaEgCCYNhTvPjZvkYCPsp-q5HIQZXFA", "contributor": "0xF737EBd5f22E661136737bb92218B398Fb0Ab584"}

L’équipe de journal du coin aussi, mais moins j’avoue, je les trouve plutôt brut de décoffrage, là pour l’argent et ils s’en foutent de l’éthique, je les vois comme des gens sans vergogne (désolé si vous lisez ça, t’façon vous étiez pas censés). Sam, tes petits yeux de requin sur les miniatures, ça me fait peur plutôt que cliquer, je mets mon ledger autour du cou avant de lancer parce que ça se voit que je suis en danger.

Puis TokenBrice et Nolan sur le serveur DeFi France.\n\nAprès ça, vu que j’ai la “chance” (NON) de parler ce langage arriéré et moyenâgeux qu’est l’angloy, j’ai pu me plonger dans le flux de merd… d’innovations, à la source.

Écoutes, je vais être franc, je suis un putain de maximaliste, oui j’ai raté plein d’occasions de faire de l’argent parce que je suis con (tu te souviens, va voir plus haut sinon) et que je ne comprends vraiment qu’Ethereum, j’ai pas forcément mis autant de temps à comprendre d’autres projets. J’ai toujours mon petit 9-5 pour acheter mes clopes et ma drogue (c’est de la weed m’sieur l’agent, chez moi c’est légal) et donc j’en manque, du temps.

史料として\n\n[比叡山](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1)[延暦寺](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA)は、「[古都京都の文化財（京都市、宇治市、大津市）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%A4%E9%83%BD%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E3%81%AE%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E8%B2%A1)」を構成する17の寺社のひとつとして、[ユネスコ](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E9%9A%9B%E9%80%A3%E5%90%88%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E6%A9%9F%E9%96%A2)の[世界遺産](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E9%81%BA%E7%94%A3)に登録されています \\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[6\\]。また、比叡山延暦寺は、国宝である[根本中堂](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%B6%E6%9A%A6%E5%AF%BA%E6%A0%B9%E6%9C%AC%E4%B8%AD%E5%A0%82)をはじめとして、複数の国宝や数多くの重要文化財を保有しています。このように、比叡山延暦寺は歴史的文化的に重要な場所であり、かつては現存しているよりも遥かに多くの文化財や史料を保有していました。\n\nしかし、比叡山延暦寺の文化財や史料は、[1571年の延暦寺焼打ち（元亀の法難）](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))で被害を受け、その多くが失われました。そのため、かつての延暦寺の境内に存在した寺社の様子を伝える史料は数少ないです。\n\n『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、比叡山延暦寺の境内や坂本地区の寺社を描いた現存する古絵図の中では、もっとも詳細なものであるとされており、[1571年](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%A1%E5%B1%B1%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1_(1571%E5%B9%B4))以前に存在した可能性のある寺社も描かれています \\[7\\]。そのため、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』は、かつての比叡山延暦寺に存在した寺社の様子を知るための貴重な史料です。\n\n###

画像を入手した経緯\n\nぼくは、正規の手続きに従って、[国立公文書館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%AC%E6%96%87%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8)に対して、『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』の第1鋪と第2鋪の２つの古地図のデジタルデータ（画像ファイル）の利用申請を提出し、下記の手数料等を支払って、2021年4月にこれらの２つの古地図の画像ファイルを入手しました。\n\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（中判特殊撮影）の料金 : 4コマ × 543円/コマ ＝ 2,172円\n* デジタルカメラ撮影（高精細特殊撮影）の料金 : 32コマ × 3,300円/コマ ＝ 105,600円\n* 上記撮影データのDVDＲへの書込みの料金 : DVDＲ 2枚 × 543円/枚 ＝ 1,086円\n* 梱包・送料 : 1件 × 520円/件 ＝ 520円\n* 手数料等合計金額 : 109,378円\n\n第1鋪と第2鋪の2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、縦横サイズが大きいために、国立公文書館は、1回の撮影で地図全体を1枚の写真におさめることができませんでした。 （※第1鋪と第2鋪の縦横サイズは、それぞれ、幅280cm×高さ187.5cm、幅279cm×高さ187.5cm です。） そのため、国立公文書館は、それぞれの地図ごとに、1枚の地図を複数回に分けて撮影しました。 それによって、2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの古地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の古地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\nぼくは、16枚ずつに分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪と第2鋪の古地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\nぼくは、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、これらの古地図の画像ファイルを、ウィキメディア・コモンズのウェブサイトで、パブリックドメインとして公開しました。\n\n*

{"id": "9LY4JxxekLsuBMyt2zSVLHipzsP8MoO5ZEyO4wAUC6o", "title": "NFT Summary Sunday - 31 October 2021", "body": "If you’ve been paying attention to NFTs in the last week, you might have noticed that… uh, well… people kind of aren’t buying anything and prices are either “dipping,” “dunking,” or in full-blown “collapse.” This is due to many factors, one of the more obvious being that ETH gas prices have remained extremely high (between $150-200 for a single ERC token transaction) for a long time, giving speculators and collectors few opportunities to mint or transact at an affordable price. This, combined with the resurgence of meme tokens such as $SHIB have led to network congestion, capital flight towards more optimistic assets, and an oversaturation of NFT projects launching in the last month or so have contributed to this precipitous drop in prices and volumes. \n\nSince this is the dominant story of the last week, I figured today was a good day to dive into some of the analytics to determine exactly what happened, where the money has gone, and if there’s any hope in the near-term for NFTs (there is, I promise).\n\n\n---\n\nFirst of all, let’s look at overall volume on OpenSea. Remember, even though plenty of other NFT platforms across various blockchains exist, OpenSea accounts for the overwhelming majority. \n\n![OpenSea daily volume is a the lowest point since July 2021. Credit to @rchen8 for the chart.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D17ucMwgGb4ZloL4stdKZ.png?height=557&width=1855)\n\nFirst of all, OS daily volume is at the lowest point since July 2021 indicating that even though awareness of NFTs is at an all-time high, the number of people speculating on their price is at a long-time low. The important question is, why is this? The first thing people often point to is ETH’s insane gas prices lately. Let’s take a look at recent ETH gas prices to see if this lines up. \n\n![ETH gas prices have slowly risen since August, with noticeable spikes in gas prices attributed to spikes in OS volume, with the exception of the past 15 days or so.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nCRR4apaVTCkuknjht-L_.png?height=876&width=2032)\n\nWe can see noticeable patterns between gas prices and OS volume since the beginning of August, but sometime around mid-October we start to see a divergence. Gas prices continued to climb during this period, but OS volume dropped off a cliff. However, we see that the second half of August experienced a massive rise in both gas prices *and* OS volume, so this indicates to me that gas prices alone can’t explain the massive selloff. People were obviously willing to pay hundreds of dollars for gas in August, so why aren’t they willing to do the same now?\n\nOne might postulate that the NFT world is oversaturated with mints, airdrops, and new drops that have led to less concentration of attention and therefore less concentrated volume around hyped projects. When there’s so much to choose from, as everybody diversifies into various projects there might not be enough volume to sustain the meteoric rises in prices that we saw in August and September. However, we’ve seen projects like CrypToadz, Jungle Freaks, Lazy Lions, CyberKongz, and numerous other projects sustain strong upwards price action, so obviously there is still appetite for risk in the market. \n\nHowever, are there fewer participants in the market? Is that why most projects are seeing massive declines in floor prices? Well, as you can see below, the number of monthly active traders on OpenSea is at an all time high, and the number of NFTs sold is roughly the same as it was 2 months ago, so this tells me a few things:\n\n1. There are still many new players entering the NFT space, so we’re not seeing a mass exodus from the market, and\n2. The number of transactions is still high, indicating that people are still flipping and participating in the exchange of NFTs in a speculative manner.\n\n![The number of NFTs sold is roughly at the same level as it was in August and September, so the market hasn't died down as some have suggested. Credit again to @rchen8 for making such great visualizations on dune.xyz](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hldbD8u5OsZIjX5o0LxGi.png?height=560&width=1855)\n\n![The number of monthly active traders still grew over August and September, but the rate of growth has slowed considerably. August was a very explosive month, and it appears that we're at an inflection point where the onboarding of new users is slowing down.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6BapMBJMIRCm6P61LozE8.png?height=563&width=1853)\n\nThe fact that the onboarding of new users has slowed down considerably since September tells me that we may have reached a local high in new users in the NFT market, and without new catalysts we could see a strong contraction throughout November as those who have risked too much money start to flee and sell their NFTs for rock bottom prices. I don’t think this will happen with every project, but for “speculative” projects, or projects that are new, unproven, or otherwise incapable of massive growth in the face of strong headwinds, I predict that these projects will likely see precipitous drops in floor prices over the coming weeks until some new NFT narrative emerges.\n\nNow, it’s important to state here that I don’t think most projects are going to die completely, but I do foresee a strong consolidation around the projects whose floor prices have held steady during the last few weeks. I could easily imagine lots of people selling off their riskier NFT bets and consolidating their ETH around more “proven” projects as stores of value, at least for the next several weeks. \n\n\n---\n\nOf course, this isn’t 2017 - crypto truly has gone mainstream. In the United States you cannot avoid crypto advertisement, and the growth of centralized exchanges such as FTX, Coinbase, and Crypto.com have proven that millions of new users are being onboarded into the crypto world, and oftentimes NFTs are their first destination. FTX.us has released a centralized NFT exchange that supports both Solana (their poster child blockchain project supported by the CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried) and Ethereum, however their collections and offerings are slim at this point. Go to [their website](www.ftx.com/nfts) and search for some of your favorite projects; you’re unlikely to find most of them, as I was. This, coupled with the regulatory uncertainty in the USA regarding the asset class of NFTs and tax implications could mean that fewer people are willing to speculate on them. \n\nIn my crypto social circle, we’ve all had the realization that spending 0.1 ETH sounds like a minor purchase, but spending $400 is a pretty major purchase. The fact that new users who have never held crypto before see the entry price to NFTs, and the thought of spending hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of dollars on an image (no matter how cool it looks) may sound absurd. Furthermore, the huge price tag combined with high gas fees may be the one-two punch needed to prevent new users from entering the space. And then, finally, those who have an appetite for risk may have found something a bit juicier to bite into. Let’s discuss the recent elephant in the room: memecoins.\n\n\n---\n\nDOGE has been around for almost 10 years now, and almost like clockwork it would start pumping from a floor of 15-25 satoshis up to anywhere from 100-300 sats, followed by a 100% retrace to find itself back on the floor between 15-25 sats. This has happened at least 10 times since its inception, but something changed in January during the GameStop short squeeze hype, when Elon Musk started tweeting about memecoins. Huge numbers of small retail investors, enabled by trading apps such as RobinHood, were able to buy DOGE with their cell phones and watch it pump well over 1000x from the bottom. Elon did his part pumping the coin, but eventually stopped tweeting and the price plummeted (albeit not down to the original floor). \n\n![DOGE has had consistent reliable pumps for almost 7 years, until Elon Musk started tweeting about it regularly in January 2021.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4eVhzWdzU3ybUifDKfYUG.png?height=1840&width=3187)\n\nHowever, the appetite for memecoins didn’t disappear once DOGE crashed. Other coins, mostly named after types of dogs, started pumping in its wake. Retail investors, hoping to catch another massive pump, piled into the trade. Encouraged by Twitter and Reddit users, they drove the price of one coin in particular (SHIB) through the roof, resulting in a gain of nearly 115,000,000% in less than a year. \n\n![Shiba Inu (SHIB) has pumped over 115 million percent in 11 months. $1 invested in December 2020 is currently worth over $2 million right now. Yes, that math is correct.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RwGPijZghdt_8V_r0JWaT.png?height=86&width=607)\n\nSHIB started pumping again about a month ago, and the hype train kicked back into maximum gear and SHIB pumped over 1000% (a “mere” 9x return on investment) in the last month alone. Technical analysis on memecoins is often futile as the meme narrative and fomo render many technical indicators pointless, but it appears that SHIB has found a (local) top and is in the process of retracing. For a few days, people started chasing other dog and animal-related coins, but those seem to have fizzled out as of recently. \n\n![SHIB made a phenomental comeback but appears to have hit its upper limits, and will likely retrace significantly in the coming weeks unless some new meme narrative takes hold again.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HCme3i37EVgPfU-e3WoFx.png?height=1840&width=3187)\n\nAll of this happened while people started to wonder if their NFTs were ever going to pump again, and we saw some massive fire sales across various NFT projects as people piled into the SHIB trade hoping to get a few extra multiples out of their investment. \n\nHowever, there was one MAJOR event in crypto that went virtually unnoticed in the last week that also likely has been playing a role (albeit in the background amidst the noise): Ethereum hit a new all-time high price of approximately $4450 before slightly retracing to test its former ATH at $4200 as support, where it sits now. The increase in price in Ethereum is also likely drawing people away from riskier bets such as NFTs and back into spot and future trades. \n\n![ETH is currently testing support at $4200 and could potentially see a big run if it breaks to the upside.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/casrQUxaHLEVrWEg_SYkP.png?height=1840&width=3187)\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty around the long-term viability of various NFTs that people blindly aped into chasing massive short-term profits, coupled with a new gamble for high multiples in SHIB, against a rising ETH price testing new all-time highs, has likely been a one-two-three punch to NFTs as they sit at historically high prices and volumes. At this point of a major asset rally, people start to wonder what’s going to happen next and look for various options “just in case,” which is what I suspect has happened here in the last few weeks.\n\n\n---\n\nSo as we’ve seen, NFTs are still at all-time high volumes and customer levels, but various other distractions, headwinds (gas prices), and uncertainties seem to have dissuaded people from continuing to gamble in the space for now. Therefore, I only have one piece of advice: decouple yourself emotionally from your NFTs. Be willing to cut them loose if you’re sitting on profits (or at a loss already) and regroup your funds and prepare for the next phase of the market, which could include an ETH breakout, or worse: an ETH ATH fakeout followed by a retest of earlier support and prolonged sideways ranging while the market decides how bullish it really is. \n\nStay safe out there, continuously take profits, and don’t get too emotionally invested in your NFTs. If you like looking at them that much, you can always right-click save for later! :)", "timestamp": 1635704795, "digest": "BWWmOmvR-mhKeuHmotFsYX_2-C_fRs9rX8kTuGK7U_w", "contributor": "0x940653d9C5076d2FDfd44F7BC8e66aeb5Fb598BE"}
{"id": "peULfLlOR2bzqev6rXFa3p3FPZEw7Pxkc61gEpJOoWY", "title": "User 3.0: Notes on the STEM Player", "body": "I ran a seminar on Iteration and Playtesting this week in class at the Parsons School of Design. My aim was to showcase a product’s creation process as reactive to its technological context then run a playtest of that product using Sharp and Macklin’s framework for evaluating the design efficacy of games.\n\nSpecifically, I was interested in how users were able (or not) to achieve their goals of “Playing Music” using an iPod, the original portable music player released by Apple in 2001. I was curious to see if 20 years later the intended experience was still intelligible by a much younger audience. Most people in my class were 1 when the iPod was released.\n\nIn evaluating the playtest, we looked at actions, goals, challenges, information spaces, feedback, decision-making, player perceptions, contexts of play, takeaways, and emotions.\n\nAfter the playtest, we incubated and brainstormed on potential improvements to the first iPod.\n\n![Student holding the iPod trying to change the date to 2021 using the Calendar feature](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n31RUj2QZI-99t0nN-Xui.JPG?height=4032&width=3024)\n\nFollowing the playtest and iterative incubation session on the iPod, I presented the STEM player, a new audio player designed by YEEZY and KANO, to the class, with no introduction or instruction besides that the device was on and could play music. The STEM player is an interactive audio player that allows the user to remix the song they are playing. It comes loaded with Kanye’s latest album DONDA but any song can be uploaded to the device. The songs on the device are split by their stems: drums, bass, synth, vocals. Users can control each component as well as create loops and control pitch and speed. Finally, the player is also a recorder meaning the user can record and save their newly created remixed track.\n\n![Student holding the STEM trying to figure it out](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LEmUYObmHIsRq_MTr-BZO.JPG?height=4032&width=3024)\n\n### Insights from the iPod playtest\n\nHere are some of the insights the class adduced with regards to the iPod.\n\nIn terms of Actions, answering the question of whether they knew what they could and could not do, users, at first, found it difficult to understand the directions when using the wheel. However, it does not take long for the user to gain familiarity with the repetitive motions of the wheel. The main challenges they faced were in adding music using the iTunes software and using some of the Settings functionalities such as date- and time-changing.\n\n## Behind the iPod\n\nThe iPod was a device that attempted to correct the mistakes of its predecessors. The team behind its design, Steve Jobs, Sir Jonathan Ive, Jon Rubinstein, and Michael Dhuey, sought to create a “better MP3 player”. It was made possible by technological advancements in hard drives, as well as a will to create an accompanying music store to facilitate the music transfer process. Up until now, other flash players were mostly drag-and-drop and storage capacity for portable players was limited.\n\nThe competitive landscape was fragmented amongst many electronic companies.\n\n![The MPMan, released in 1998 by SaeHan, had a 32MB and a 64MB version](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JpFprHO5lLBJM4f20Kf3I.png?height=1067&width=800)\n\n![The Rio PMP300, released in 1998, the first commercially successful portable audio media player, with 32MB of storage and a slot for additional memory](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l8DMVXaXzjr-nV1CGuCP6.png?height=550&width=800)\n\nThis table from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_portable_media_players) shows some of the specs of the different media players and a better overview of the market Apple was entering in.\n\n![Comparison of portable media players](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n_xfkfsdgw1BK9tu6VLur.png?height=697&width=1238)\n\nEach media player had a set of features it inherited from previous media-playing technologies, such as cassette players and CD players. A player should allow users to “Play”, “Pause”, “Stop”, “Go to Next Track”, “Go to Previous Track”, “Raise Volume” and “Lower Volume”.\n\nAlthough the goal was to create a device with the above features as well as improved memory and a computer interface for music transfer, the team at Apple sought to differentiate the product not only technically but also aesthetically. While the design of other media players borrowed from futuristic aesthetics with bright colors and advanced plastics, Apple’s design team borrowed from the past to create a product that was as beautiful as functional. Namely, they drew inspiration from Western European designs such as Dieter Rams’ work at Braun and the luxury home technology products of Bang & Olufsen.\n\n![The Braun T3 Transistor by Dieter Rams (1958) next to the iPod (2001)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/weL2I7acDJ_TJp0BhSgPC.png?height=319&width=501)\n\n![The BeoCom 6000 by Bang & Olufsen, the inspiration for the wheel](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZFh75EYg1rmpnd30Jm-AN.png?height=386&width=596)\n\n## The STEM player\n\nAfter this long preamble presenting the iPod, I introduced the STEM Player. Here are some videos of the playtest.\n\n[https://youtu.be/x5TFaGJGcnw](https://youtu.be/x5TFaGJGcnw)\n\n[https://youtu.be/NxIlMmvXMTw](https://youtu.be/NxIlMmvXMTw)\n\n[https://youtu.be/45V2qWCvAaY](https://youtu.be/45V2qWCvAaY)\n\n### First Impressions\n\nHere are some of the tester’s first impressions following the experience:\n\n* In comparison to the iPod, they felt in much less familiar territory\n* The product has no language which makes comprehension more difficult (language-free)\n* It took about 4 minutes for the users to figure the basic features and commands of the STEM player\n* The sound was subpar\n* Users felt guided by the haptic feedback in the player\n* Its toy-like design made it more approachable than the iPod\n* Even after providing them with the user guide, the testers felt like the drawn instructions were insufficient to completely figure out the product\n\n![Users comparing the instructions for the iPod and the STEM player](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tcQdfJRh2Wt5sW9zulVTR.JPG?height=4032&width=3024)\n\n### Design comparison\n\nNear the end of the seminar, I invited the class to compare both products\n\n* Aesthetic\n  * The iPod has a Western European aesthetic inherited from Braun and Bang & Olufsen. Its shape is geometric and the edges slightly rounded.\n  * The STEM player veers towards natural design, both in terms of colour, the player is sand-coloured, and shape, it is shaped like a pebble. (We were having a harder time finding the inspirations here…)\n* Materials\n  * iPod: Glass and aluminium\n  * STEM: silicon\n* Design Associations (what words does the product bring to mind?)\n  * iPod: House technology, fragile, luxury, style\n  * STEM: Toy, bouncy, hard-to-break, soft, safe for children\n* Emotions (how does the product make you feel?)\n  * iPod: Satisfied (it helps me achieve my goals in a straight-forward fashion with little fuss)\n  * STEM: Curious (it puts me in a more exploratory mood, it feels ludic and open)\n\n## What do both of these objects say about their users?\n\nThe iPod user is a tech-savvy individual who utilizes the product’s simple design and UX to achieve their goal in a defined and concise manner. The iPod user is a *consumer* but a discerning one, one who buys into the Apple brand for its promise of beautiful albeit closed objects. They live in a set of boundaries that are hard to break. The tool does not really allow the user to break free from the product’s designed walls.\n\nIn 2017, I presented a talk at the University of Quebec in Montreal, where I spoke about fan-based shitposting groups and their artistic practices. Specifically, I presented a “Manifesto for Shitposting” that adduced the idea that the members of these groups were a new type of audience, they were no longer passive, their practice was heavily participatory.\n\nI quote from the *Manifesto for Shitposting* (2017)\n\n> Nothing stands in the way of the consumer-become-creator\n> Nothing stands in the way of your hollowing out the peach's pit and turning it into an apple\n> We are no longer passive\n> We are the new creators\n> There are sequels to variations\n> and variations on these variations\n> Sequels to these sequels\n> We have created a franchise outside of the franchise\n> We have created a universe outside of the copyrighted universe\n> There is no author\n> the author is dead\n> there is no author\n> only participants\n> there is no author\n> only creators\n> only hollow words\n> only hollow images\n> waiting to be filled\n> with new meaning\n>\n> the franchises of the future are our franchises\n\nYou may see where I’m going with this but these two products differ in how they conceive of their users. The STEM player represents a new paradigm for audio media players in that it treats its audience not as listeners but as producers. It allows them to create the strongest connection one can have with a piece of music, making it your own. I have no idea if the player is part of a larger corporate strategy or just marketing from Yeezy’s last album. However, I am very excited for this future of music that allows users to directly engage with music in an active manner.\n\nKanye, even after releasing the album, has already changed and tweaked many of the songs on DONDA. Now, so can you.", "timestamp": 1635705453, "digest": "pp_y1OgJqObY5mYhp8xtyA2Df4YcFX2hn-U9734l0AM", "contributor": "0x87fB7c717A4145095Eb076e239BC0F8Fba42cf49"}

Students, parents, and employers all see a gap between what students value and need versus what higher education institutions provide. The mismatch of needs with an ever-increasing price tag is ripe for the startup ecosystem’s attempts to mend. The traditional 4-year degree is a **broken pathway** to the security it once flaunted as its value.\n\n## **Part 1: Hostage to Higher Ed**\n\nThe Problem: outputs of traditional higher education are increasingly underwhelming.\n\n* **University graduates are unemployed or underemployed**. With [48% of recent graduates ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/05/28/half-of-college-grads-are-working-jobs-that-dont-require-a-degree/)working in jobs that do not require a degree, the ROI of tuition seems to be decreasing at alarming rates. This trend exists at selective schools as well. When looking at the US’s top 100 schools, [41% of graduates ](https://www.businessinsider.com/american-higher-education-failure-2013-5)couldn’t get a job in their chosen field.\n* \\*\\*Graduates are underprepared. \\*\\*[34% of students](https://www.earlystagecareers.com/esc-articles/2018/2/28/the-numbers-dont-lie-students-are-unprepared-for-the-workplace) feel that they do not have the right skills for the job market. On the corporate end, just [34% of executives and 25% of hiring managers](https://www.aacu.org/press/press-releases/employers-express-confidence-colleges-and-universities) were confident that recent graduates are well equipped for career advancement. Only [30% of college graduates](https://news.gallup.com/poll/179201/recent-grads-likely-useful-internships.aspx) had an internship during college where they were able to apply what they were learning in the classroom.\n* \\*\\*University students are less adept at independent learning. \\*\\*Institutions are blaming students for their lack of job market preparedness citing college has become an extension of K12, with a lot of hand-holding and guidance. Hyperinflation is running rampant giving students a false sense of understanding. At Yale, [62% of grades were A’s in 2012](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/column-how-an-epidemic-of-grade-inflation-made-as-average#:\\~:text=Grade%20inflation%20%E2%80%94%20no%2C%20hyperinflation%20%E2%80%94,rampant%20in%20American%20higher%20education.&text=A%20recent%20study%20revealed%20that,are%20either%20A's%20or%20B's.) and [only 10%](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/column-how-an-epidemic-of-grade-inflation-made-as-average#:\\~:text=Grade%20inflation%20%E2%80%94%20no%2C%20hyperinflation%20%E2%80%94,rampant%20in%20American%20higher%20education.&text=A%20recent%20study%20revealed%20that,are%20either%20A's%20or%20B's.) in 1963.\n\nIn this post, I will be diving deep into emerging structures for delivering higher education, from those that are more industry-specific leaning on needed skills to those leveraging a need for tribes and leaning on community. Simply speaking, if we accept higher education as a product designed to increase employability, there’s a clear disconnect; the promise of a college degree is fundamentally inadequate. And this has not gone unnoticed — companies are popping up to start to fill that gap. I grouped discussion into three categories to explore innovations in the space and the directions of the leading institutions:\n\n1\\. Global/Subscription University Structure: \\*\\*This space contains MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses) and any other company that supports the trend of skill collection and competency building, rather than a singular, certifying degree.\n\n2\\. Sharing/Regional University Structure: \\*\\*This is where universities utilize the same pot of career services, international recruitment, academic advising, legal affairs, information security, etc. These include companies that allow a more flexible or localized student experience attempting to keep families together and provide nearby careers.\n\n3\\. Entrepreneurial/Corporate Partnership University Structure: \\*\\*This structure is a ‘social contract’ between the university and society. It acts as a yin and yang model of universities and efforts to drive economic recovery. These companies support the school-to-job pipeline with direct relationships with employers.\n\nThese structures hint at the opportunities to fix structural inadequacies in elevating the main tenets of higher education today: the ability to access information, the ability to be a part of a community, and the ability to create a career after graduation.\n\nThe Market: **The [United States lags behind 11 other countries](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/04/22/more-americans-get-degrees-but-the-us-still-lags-behind-rivals) in terms of postsecondary attainment, with a little less than half of 25–34-year-olds currently obtaining any credential beyond a high school diploma. With the US Higher Education Market [estimated to be over $670 billion](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cud.asp#:\\~:text=In%202017%E2%80%9318%2C%20total%20revenues,at%20private%20for%2Dprofit%20institutions.)** \\*\\*with [a consumer base of 16.6 million students](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cha.asp#:\\~:text=In%20fall%202018%2C%20total%20undergraduate,enrollment%20was%2013.2%20million%20students.) enrolled in undergraduate programs and growing, it is a small portion of the global market. Trust in colleges is low and faith in the 4-year departmental degree is non-existent spurring the rise of remote education, personalized learning, and new university funding strategies, all ultimately bringing education away from traditional campuses.\n\nThis has led to the dominance of **MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)**. The most successful startups in US education are by far MOOCs including Coursera with 35 million learners, 150 university partners, 440M in funding with a $2.6B valuation in addition to Udemy with 30 million learners, 100k courses, 223M in funding with a $2B valuation.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*cl3qOOfLCORwGi36)\n\nInternationally, edtech unicorns in this space are Byju (India) and Yuanfudao (China), flaunting high market penetration. With a retention rate of [85%, Byju ](https://medium.com/@gem7creation/case-study-byjus-world-s-highest-valued-edtech-company-265902e4d966)and Yuanfudao (China) have [over 200 million users,](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/yuanfudao-edtech-valuation-china) proving to be the most used edtech application globally at a $7.8 billion dollar valuation.\n\nAs consumer markets start to see higher education as a necessary evil to some career mobility, family investment and willingness to pay will also increase, but in the institutions currently collecting their money. Before 2021, higher education startups tend to focus on financing the stagnant universities we are accustomed to seeing. Innovations in this space tend to be outward and Tier 1 university-led rather than true disruptions. The majority of MOOCs are made by prestigious universities like Stanford, MIT, and Harvard. These are followed by corporate-developed courses made by the tech giants of Microsoft and Google, and by various organizations, such as IEEE or the Linux Foundation.\n\n\\*\\*Change Drivers: \\*\\*Historically, post-war demographic changes including massive student enrollment spikes have been the driving force of education reform, from the Morrill Act after the Civil War to the Higher Education Act from the Cold War. One big shift we see today is with [38% of American workers](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/04/21/about-half-of-lower-income-americans-report-household-job-or-wage-loss-due-to-covid-19/) who lost a job or income during the pandemic say they are more likely to enroll in higher education because of COVID-19. As seen in this live [chart](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-college-cases-tracker.html?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&stream=top), college campuses are not immune to the spread and should have been more cautious than they were. Unfortunately, the[ trend of lower-tier schools dying](https://www.marketplace.org/2020/08/20/some-small-colleges-closing-for-good-covid19/) has only been amplified by the pandemic. There was an estimate that “[20% of America’s private liberal-arts colleges](https://www.marketplace.org/2020/08/20/some-small-colleges-closing-for-good-covid19/) are on the verge of going under.” It seems that only the strong will survive, those including the brands that have already infiltrated common conversation. Almost [30% of newly admitted Harvard students](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/8/7/harvard-coronavirus-fall-enrollment-numbers/) deferred their 2020 enrollment as a part of the larger “coping” phase of COVID-19. This period should end soon after the end of the year pushes some institutions over the edge of closure.\n\nWith the state having less and less to do with higher education, the new status quo for education will be consumer-directed, allowing innovation to happen with technology driving the trends, not government policies. [The edtech race](https://community.nasscom.in/communities/product-startups/the-edtech-story-7-edtech-race-during-covid-19-the-b2b-angle.html) this past summer is only a taste of what is to come.\n\n**Demographics of Students**: In addition, as the [Northeast/ Upper Midwest parts of the United States](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/metro_america_report.pdf) face the steepest declines in the number of high school students, some areas are quickly growing including the South, Plains, Rocky Mountains. The future of higher education **needs to focus on the middle of the country**, an ideology that has rarely been enforced throughout American history. As the demographics of undergraduate students change, online education proves to be a cost-effective alternative as [around 57%](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/05/15/is-college-worth-it/) do not believe tuition and other college-related expenses match the worth of a degree.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2m5yNDxKLHTlw8GcfojIKA.png)\n\nUndergraduate Student Demographic Table. Colleges will still need to consider how to serve this segment of students who are not technically first-generation but nevertheless need guidance on the college experience.\n\nHigher levels of education and experience are needed in a variety of roles. A master's degree is seen as equivalent to a bachelor’s degree 20 years ago in addition to the bachelor’s degree seen as a replacement for high school (the strong argument behind the recent changes in California ensuring [“free” community college for two years](https://edsource.org/2019/gov-newsom-signs-bills-to-expand-college-student-aid-target-admissions-scandal/618207)). It was surveyed that [37% of employers are demanding bachelor’s degrees for jobs](https://www.fastcompany.com/3057941/how-the-masters-degree-became-the-new-bachelors-in-the-hiring-world) that used to be open to high school graduates, and even more jobs are listing having a master’s degree as a strong differentiator.\n\n**Who is to blame?** The changes in these ecosystems have faced pushback as universities blame the decrease of family size, the development of suburban enclaves, and the rise of “helicopter parents”. Helicopter parents often see students as products, collecting a bag of signals to become competitive in arbitrary metrics for university admissions. This has created a generation of 18–22-year-olds that lack internal motivations and special interests needed in developing their purpose and individual career. Institutions also blame the reality that fewer teens and undergraduate students are working than in the past. More than [57% of parents](https://kaplan.com/universities/exploring-new-routes-to-success/) think the best education comes from internships, not courses, and[ 74% of parents ](https://kaplan.com/universities/exploring-new-routes-to-success/)expect their children to work while in college.\\*\\* \\*\\*When there is a set number of internships for a growing population of students, connections and personal networks seem to trump all, diminishing decades of work towards opportunity equality.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0\\*UeIorqJ3_P6Z4yNx)\n\nThose who disagree with the need for career application have countered that colleges are not career training centers and students need to see it as a platform for growth. One of the reasons issues in the higher education space have been pushed to the side of mainstream media is that the majority of American minds have **myopia** about higher education, mistaking the elite university experience as the average student’s. College completion only recently became a concern as the vast majority of students at selective schools still graduate on time whereas less than [50% of first-time, full-time bachelor’s students](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40) think the best education comes from internships, a percentage that gets even smaller for part-time or community college.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Pk8h5bdsUgg5wb5n)\n\n**The Future?** Around half of all participants of this ecosystem, from teacher to investor, prefer changing their model of [engagement](https://www.holoniq.com/2030/education-as-usual/). As both the bachelor's degree and undergraduate institutions lose reputation and credibility, the movement to disrupt this space is truly inevitable. The next generation will not be bred for or by the Harvards and Stanfords of this world. The next two sections will dive deeper into the 3 structures with more takeaways of what will stick.\n\n## **Part 2: Tied to Communities or Connected to a Laptop**\n\nPreviously, I touched on larger tailwinds in education, historical and current change drivers, and grouped three categories on where modern higher education is going as well as talked about the startups supporting progress and key takeaways from their success and failures. Next, I’ll touch on the first two structures, starting with what we see in the news as the edtech unicorns and normalized method of remote schooling: the **Subscription/ Global University Structure**.\n\nThis structure is creating college as a platform for continual and personalized learning, whether it be with micro certifications and nanodegrees, or the ability to continue education no matter the location. The growth is expected to continue: almost[ 80% of college/university students](https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2020/04/29/colleges-could-lose-20-percent-students-analysis-says) surveyed will attend school virtually (online) vs. attending a traditional school within ten years. One company to watch is Chicago-based Series A startup, [Unifyed](https://www.unifyed.com/#home), a higher education management platform helping transition universities into global platforms. Top-tier schools have made these migrations in the past couple of decades, and the systems lagging behind will feel the COVID-produced student shift to remote and individualized learning.\n\nThe Subscription/Global University Structure leans on MOOCS (Massive Online Open Courses), as the largest subset of this space. These support the trend of skill collection and competency building, rather than a singular degree speaking to education, these platforms and corporations like [Google’s career certificates](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/google-plan-disrupt-college-degree-university-higher-education-certificate-project-management-data-analyst.html) are taking center stage. With [72% of users](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/Documents/2018%20Employee%20Benefits%20Report.pdf) reporting immediate career benefits, these platforms have also shown an increase in effectiveness for people with lower socioeconomic status, in developing countries, and with less education. Full-time homemakers/caregivers, ages 25–40, [report higher satisfaction scores using MOOCs](https://hbr.org/2015/09/whos-benefiting-from-moocs-and-why) to refresh key concepts prior to returning to school than traditional in-person courses. Overall, among non-student MOOC completers, the flexibility of this education structure is a saving grace.\n\nOverall, the better performing **Global/Subscription University** remote structure has certain aspects needed to address the complexities in a world without classrooms. \\*\\*The winners \\*\\*will have\n\n* \\*\\*Diversified user engagement \\*\\*by including soft skill/lifestyle categories outside of current career preparation trends.\n* **Synchronous learning** with interactive elements on top of lecture/reading.\n* **Student retention safeguards** for the infamous low rates on these online platforms such as 1:1 coaching/mentoring and other hands-on career support.\n\nInternationally, these companies are doing well due to targeted market penetration, connecting communities to career opportunities nearby. The small cohort size and career coaching are some of the ways these platforms recruit and retain students near their central locations. These include [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/) (Australian) and other niche learning platforms like [Skill Lync](https://skill-lync.com/) supporting a mechanical engineering curriculum with a remote collaborative project model based in India. These models are also entering the post-graduate space with programs like [UNICAF](https://www.unicaf.org/scholarships/partners-programmes/) for master’s degree programs in an array of liberal arts with in-person projects across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWith these platforms gaining traction and tuition becoming less and less of a stable income stream, the consolidation of universities is inevitable and is [already happening](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-08-06-u-of-arizona-bought-a-for-profit-u-for-1-actually-the-for-profit-paid-millions-to-be-acquired). Top universities are struggling to maintain their worth, while second-tier and other low-performing schools are left to collapse.\n\nThis is what sparked the\\*\\* Sharing/Regional University structure, **the second structure I introduced in my first piece, Hostage to Higher Ed. This** \\*\\*structure exemplifies how community strengths can be amplified by educational institutions, and collaborate to grow regional superiority. “Sharing” allows universities to utilize the same pot of career services, international recruitment, academic advising, legal affairs, and information security. There is an increase of trust in local, rather than global programs, to keep families together and provide nearby careers. This can be seen historically in the ingrained community college to state school pipeline in California or the shared credit system in the state of Georgia.\n\nThe rise of these regional alliances, reinforcing their recognition frameworks, has proved to show a \\*\\*decrease of east-west student transfer — \\*\\*students flocking to certain areas of the country outside of their communities, causing a brain drain in areas that need them. Regional alliances also increase **student retention** and subsequent graduation. Innovations in this space are targeting low and middle-income students that are the majority of Americans outside of the 1% Ivy-league myopia, viewing university as more and more out of reach.\n\nA startup innovating on the ability to leverage regional universities to graduate faster with less debt, [Quottly](http://courses.quottly.com/), finds transferable classes at other colleges and universities that count for credit. [Rheaply](https://www.rheaply.com/) has been creating a “shared economy for innovation” by supporting school systems, from K12 through post-graduate programs. Some of the regional alliances that fall in this space include the Pennsylvania State University I-99 Corridor Region expanding into the counties of Bedford, Blair, and Centre, as well as the University of Michigan’s Research Corridor, the alliance between Michigan State University, the University of Michigan and Wayne State University.\n\nAs a marketplace, or shared admission system, [K50 Ventures](https://www.k50ventures.com/) portfolio company [Verto Education](https://vertoeducation.org/) combines guaranteed university admission to those who would like to attend a certain program.\n\nNewer startups popping up are attempting to enhance a formerly physical campus’ presence online, address [declining student retention](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-08-04-covid-era-brings-new-challenges-for-college-retention), and build allegiance including another K50 portfolio company, [EdSights](https://www.edsights.io/), an SMS chatbot to improve student wellness and keep them enrolled. At the end of the day, locality and home pride will live and be redesigned to be accessible and synchronous, without the classic college green to retreat to for lunch.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*F41kuLJz_IkbtGnu)\n\nThis structure does depend on the regions at hand and a localized support system, yet the concept of working for one employer your entire life is now an unheard-of reality for Americans. As economies globalize, students who remain in these regionally-focused education systems are excluded for higher-level positions outside their region and occupations in foreign sectors (especially if the student is from a low-performing region). I believe winners for the Sharing/Regional university structures will:\n\n* **Be localized**: Keep their ear to the ground and consistently reference where job creation will be local.\n* **Sense of belonging:** this may include reigniting college sports, extending networking opportunities to the virtual world, or any other opportunity to create community.\n* **Become more flexible:** These platforms need to compete with Global/Subscription university structures that have targeted audiences in lower socioeconomic statuses in this way. To regain local prominence, specific timing and synchronous work need to become less of a concern.\n\n## **Part 3: Married to Innovation**\n\nThis is the final piece of this 3 part deep dive on change drivers and themes in the slow-moving world of higher education that were jolted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the previous section, I dove deeper into the first two models, Global/Subscription and Regional/Sharing. This last article will explain my last model, the **Entrepreneurial/Corporate Partnership (CP) University**, which is a structure that is very dependent on the initial institution’s surroundings, whether in the Rust Belt or Silicon Valley. Universities are active in developing long-term efforts to promote local economies and regional development. In the post-COVID era, universities have more opportunities than ever to help drive economic recovery.\n\nThis construct is a ‘social contract’ between the university and society for creating economic and social enterprise. The **Entrepreneurial/CP university** model combines teaching and research academic structures for new development and was initially sparked by land grant universities, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford, who started the trend to address the large, complex problems that challenge the world and the ever-changing human condition by new innovations. This is seen in entrepreneurial education as well, as the study of both the liberal arts and social sciences is necessary for every industry’s great founders.\n\nBy aligning educational investments with student and state economic needs, this model supports an increase in peer-to-peer learning, cohort programs, and the emergence of new-age vocational training. As curriculum changes to be influenced through goals of the state and system, we see the rise of co-ops, on-campus accelerators, entrepreneurial dorms, and student venture funds. Programs on the forefront of this include Rice University’s angel investments in student companies and new degrees and certifications to mirror this change such as the University of Colorado Bachelor’s degree in Innovation. The University of Washington hosts a business plan competition throughout the year to push student ideas to market, and the nation’s first entrepreneurship-based academic residential community recently began at the University of Florida.\n\nOne university in this structure is [Minerva Schools](https://www.minerva.kgi.edu/) has taken the ecosystem by storm, flaunting a 3% acceptance rate and extensive waiting list. They are transforming the model for higher education and flipping it on its head with project-based cohort learning and 8 global campuses where students rotate courses. After speaking with a handful of students, their cohort model that travels together allows students to develop deep connections with peers from around the world. The disciplined structure is not as hyper-specialized as the average US university but still allows structure for learning as social sciences, computational sciences, and humanities are chosen as focus areas.\n\nAnother model not translating the traditional Western version of the university is the [African Leadership University](https://www.alueducation.com/), creating a system interweaving work experience and venture accelerators with two campuses in Rwanda and Mauritius. Curriculum and opportunities are flexible on current local needs with the purpose of socioeconomic progression for their families and communities.\n\nWith [new regulations](https://www.educationnext.org/bipartisan-bill-would-set-rules-income-share-agreements/) and income share agreements (ISA) concerns, I do believe that higher education costs will remain uncoupled to future income. For example, the models used by well-known [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/isa)\\*\\* \\*\\*will not become the “norm” for the majority of Americans. \\*\\*Student loan models \\*\\*will remain the primary go-to for students, with solutions such as [Mos](https://www.mos.com/), helping thousands navigate the world of financial aid and scholarships.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*YXAUhqxRMyuzIG_z)\n\nOn the other hand, some systems are leaning into \\*\\*corporate partnerships \\*\\*more so than internal innovation. Universities have long been tied to companies, but some are deepening engagement past the standard licensing and internship offerings. Some corporations are now going as far as providing insights on curriculum and financial assistance for equipment.\n\nThere has also been a recent trend of moving curriculum and training in-house, led by Google and followed by Microsoft, which recently also launched a retraining program. Amazon is also playing in this area, spending[ $700 million to retrain 100,000 employees](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/11/amazon-plans-to-spend-700-million-to-retrain-a-third-of-its-workforce-in-new-skills-wsj.html) by 2025. Other examples include ‘Motorola University’ and the Rand Institute focusing on air technologies and the next generation of employees in that sector, similar to the auto-technology program at Clemson University’s International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR). These programs directly bridge what an employer needs to the skills\n\nThe trend to focus on career skills is moving earlier and earlier. This model many under 18 to develop skills asynchronous to traditional degrees as well, especially as we see [tech giants](https://www.edweek.org/technology/what-does-big-tech-want-from-schools-spoiler-alert-its-not-money/2020/01) turning their heads to high school. We see this as employers are becoming more competitive in recruiting and developing top talent for fast-growing jobs. When parents were asked to consider a program in which employers hire talented students directly out of high school for full-time, paid jobs while the students pursue a bachelor’s degree, the majority wanted their children to apply. The visualization below is a part of [Kaplan’s “Go Pro Early”](https://uspto.report/TM/88579963) thesis, a main point surrounding the future of the university is the future of jobs coming first, education second.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Mzj8Sgw9XOUXNuf4)\n\nAs this trend continues, companies like [Pathstream](https://www.pathstream.com/), a startup that partners with leading technology companies to build branded digital skills career programs delivered through universities, will become crucial to propelling a closer corporate lens on education. These solutions are also built through company-enabled learning management integrations with companies like [Nexus](https://www.nexusedge.com/). This platform fits the build-your-own trend to education onto the education-as-usual platform of university.\n\nIn conclusion, the winners from the \\*\\*Entrepreneurial/CP University Structure \\*\\*will have\n\n* **Direct partnerships** with employers will overcome income share agreements or education models not in direct contact with local corporations.\n* **A sense of security** for students as early as possible to optimize performance.\n\nThe outlook of education as a [pipeline](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonbusteed/2019/04/30/this-will-be-the-biggest-disruption-in-higher-education/#67df7006608a) to an entry-level job is still a strong mindset in most households, particularly the bottom 99%. The convergence of the two spheres will continue to grow until industry and education are cohesive in the post-secondary space, cooperating on what, when, and where to teach 18–25-year-olds to support this rapidly changing economy. As you may have seen on Twitter, [OnDeck](https://www.beondeck.com/), a trending Series A-stage startup, is attempting to couple these new career trends into community-supported fellowships. As one of their investors, Packy McCormick, [wrote](https://www.notboring.co/p/whats-on-deck-for-on-deck), “On Deck doesn’t make programs, it makes organizations that make programs. And it does so incredibly quickly.”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*f5h0EZAs4clmD_UG)\n\nIn conclusion, the **Subscription/Global University**, the **Regional/Sharing University**, and the \\*\\*Entrepreneurial/CP University \\*\\*will all be dependent on how they adapt to one of the most volatile consumers, the post-secondary student. The main themes I see sticking for effective and long-lasting education models are **student retention safeguards.** Without in-person presence or a difference in assessments, students will have a steep learning curve to platform adoption. The ability to \\*\\*support the school-to-job pipeline \\*\\*that the middle class misses. With the gig economy growing and the future of work straying away from the corporate loyalty mindset, adaptability and career flexibility will become the most important factor in lifelong security. And last, higher education still targets young adults and adolescents at a key stage in development. The ability to \\*\\*create community and a sense of belonging \\*\\*to those in a program will be key to happiness while learning. With many motivating factors, I see a change of the 4-year university myopia of self-discovery into the next stage of how we view education: career preparation and community involvement.", "timestamp": 1635710109, "digest": "ZGQuiQx8_6dEkIGxmr9C0Lp2GsLTqWhHe6W9uCU7NmU", "contributor": "0xa0C3a5E5e25dDE1148296d8c3971e17009b45ccF"}

Students, parents, and employers all see a gap between what students value and need versus what higher education institutions provide. The mismatch of needs with an ever-increasing price tag is ripe for the startup ecosystem’s attempts to mend. The traditional 4-year degree is a **broken pathway** to the security it once flaunted as its value.\n\n## **Part 1: Hostage to Higher Ed**\n\nThe Problem: outputs of traditional higher education are increasingly underwhelming.\n\n* **University graduates are unemployed or underemployed**. With [48% of recent graduates ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/05/28/half-of-college-grads-are-working-jobs-that-dont-require-a-degree/)working in jobs that do not require a degree, the ROI of tuition seems to be decreasing at alarming rates. This trend exists at selective schools as well. When looking at the US’s top 100 schools, [41% of graduates ](https://www.businessinsider.com/american-higher-education-failure-2013-5)couldn’t get a job in their chosen field.\n* \\*\\*Graduates are underprepared. \\*\\*[34% of students](https://www.earlystagecareers.com/esc-articles/2018/2/28/the-numbers-dont-lie-students-are-unprepared-for-the-workplace) feel that they do not have the right skills for the job market. On the corporate end, just [34% of executives and 25% of hiring managers](https://www.aacu.org/press/press-releases/employers-express-confidence-colleges-and-universities) were confident that recent graduates are well equipped for career advancement. Only [30% of college graduates](https://news.gallup.com/poll/179201/recent-grads-likely-useful-internships.aspx) had an internship during college where they were able to apply what they were learning in the classroom.\n* \\*\\*University students are less adept at independent learning. \\*\\*Institutions are blaming students for their lack of job market preparedness citing college has become an extension of K12, with a lot of hand-holding and guidance. Hyperinflation is running rampant giving students a false sense of understanding. At Yale, [62% of grades were A’s in 2012](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/column-how-an-epidemic-of-grade-inflation-made-as-average#:\\~:text=Grade%20inflation%20%E2%80%94%20no%2C%20hyperinflation%20%E2%80%94,rampant%20in%20American%20higher%20education.&text=A%20recent%20study%20revealed%20that,are%20either%20A's%20or%20B's.) and [only 10%](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/column-how-an-epidemic-of-grade-inflation-made-as-average#:\\~:text=Grade%20inflation%20%E2%80%94%20no%2C%20hyperinflation%20%E2%80%94,rampant%20in%20American%20higher%20education.&text=A%20recent%20study%20revealed%20that,are%20either%20A's%20or%20B's.) in 1963.\n\nIn this post, I will be diving deep into emerging structures for delivering higher education, from those that are more industry-specific leaning on needed skills to those leveraging a need for tribes and leaning on community. Simply speaking, if we accept higher education as a product designed to increase employability, there’s a clear disconnect; the promise of a college degree is fundamentally inadequate. And this has not gone unnoticed — companies are popping up to start to fill that gap. I grouped discussion into three categories to explore innovations in the space and the directions of the leading institutions:\n\n1\\. Global/Subscription University Structure: \\*\\*This space contains MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses) and any other company that supports the trend of skill collection and competency building, rather than a singular, certifying degree.\n\n2\\. Sharing/Regional University Structure: \\*\\*This is where universities utilize the same pot of career services, international recruitment, academic advising, legal affairs, information security, etc. These include companies that allow a more flexible or localized student experience attempting to keep families together and provide nearby careers.\n\n3\\. Entrepreneurial/Corporate Partnership University Structure: \\*\\*This structure is a ‘social contract’ between the university and society. It acts as a yin and yang model of universities and efforts to drive economic recovery. These companies support the school-to-job pipeline with direct relationships with employers.\n\nThese structures hint at the opportunities to fix structural inadequacies in elevating the main tenets of higher education today: the ability to access information, the ability to be a part of a community, and the ability to create a career after graduation.\n\nThe Market: **The [United States lags behind 11 other countries](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/04/22/more-americans-get-degrees-but-the-us-still-lags-behind-rivals) in terms of postsecondary attainment, with a little less than half of 25–34-year-olds currently obtaining any credential beyond a high school diploma. With the US Higher Education Market [estimated to be over $670 billion](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cud.asp#:\\~:text=In%202017%E2%80%9318%2C%20total%20revenues,at%20private%20for%2Dprofit%20institutions.)** \\*\\*with [a consumer base of 16.6 million students](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cha.asp#:\\~:text=In%20fall%202018%2C%20total%20undergraduate,enrollment%20was%2013.2%20million%20students.) enrolled in undergraduate programs and growing, it is a small portion of the global market. Trust in colleges is low and faith in the 4-year departmental degree is non-existent spurring the rise of remote education, personalized learning, and new university funding strategies, all ultimately bringing education away from traditional campuses.\n\nThis has led to the dominance of **MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)**. The most successful startups in US education are by far MOOCs including Coursera with 35 million learners, 150 university partners, 440M in funding with a $2.6B valuation in addition to Udemy with 30 million learners, 100k courses, 223M in funding with a $2B valuation.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*cl3qOOfLCORwGi36)\n\nInternationally, edtech unicorns in this space are Byju (India) and Yuanfudao (China), flaunting high market penetration. With a retention rate of [85%, Byju ](https://medium.com/@gem7creation/case-study-byjus-world-s-highest-valued-edtech-company-265902e4d966)and Yuanfudao (China) have [over 200 million users,](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/yuanfudao-edtech-valuation-china) proving to be the most used edtech application globally at a $7.8 billion dollar valuation.\n\nAs consumer markets start to see higher education as a necessary evil to some career mobility, family investment and willingness to pay will also increase, but in the institutions currently collecting their money. Before 2021, higher education startups tend to focus on financing the stagnant universities we are accustomed to seeing. Innovations in this space tend to be outward and Tier 1 university-led rather than true disruptions. The majority of MOOCs are made by prestigious universities like Stanford, MIT, and Harvard. These are followed by corporate-developed courses made by the tech giants of Microsoft and Google, and by various organizations, such as IEEE or the Linux Foundation.\n\n\\*\\*Change Drivers: \\*\\*Historically, post-war demographic changes including massive student enrollment spikes have been the driving force of education reform, from the Morrill Act after the Civil War to the Higher Education Act from the Cold War. One big shift we see today is with [38% of American workers](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/04/21/about-half-of-lower-income-americans-report-household-job-or-wage-loss-due-to-covid-19/) who lost a job or income during the pandemic say they are more likely to enroll in higher education because of COVID-19. As seen in this live [chart](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-college-cases-tracker.html?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&stream=top), college campuses are not immune to the spread and should have been more cautious than they were. Unfortunately, the[ trend of lower-tier schools dying](https://www.marketplace.org/2020/08/20/some-small-colleges-closing-for-good-covid19/) has only been amplified by the pandemic. There was an estimate that “[20% of America’s private liberal-arts colleges](https://www.marketplace.org/2020/08/20/some-small-colleges-closing-for-good-covid19/) are on the verge of going under.” It seems that only the strong will survive, those including the brands that have already infiltrated common conversation. Almost [30% of newly admitted Harvard students](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/8/7/harvard-coronavirus-fall-enrollment-numbers/) deferred their 2020 enrollment as a part of the larger “coping” phase of COVID-19. This period should end soon after the end of the year pushes some institutions over the edge of closure.\n\nWith the state having less and less to do with higher education, the new status quo for education will be consumer-directed, allowing innovation to happen with technology driving the trends, not government policies. [The edtech race](https://community.nasscom.in/communities/product-startups/the-edtech-story-7-edtech-race-during-covid-19-the-b2b-angle.html) this past summer is only a taste of what is to come.\n\n**Demographics of Students**: In addition, as the [Northeast/ Upper Midwest parts of the United States](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/metro_america_report.pdf) face the steepest declines in the number of high school students, some areas are quickly growing including the South, Plains, Rocky Mountains. The future of higher education **needs to focus on the middle of the country**, an ideology that has rarely been enforced throughout American history. As the demographics of undergraduate students change, online education proves to be a cost-effective alternative as [around 57%](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/05/15/is-college-worth-it/) do not believe tuition and other college-related expenses match the worth of a degree.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*2m5yNDxKLHTlw8GcfojIKA.png)\n\nUndergraduate Student Demographic Table. Colleges will still need to consider how to serve this segment of students who are not technically first-generation but nevertheless need guidance on the college experience.\n\nHigher levels of education and experience are needed in a variety of roles. A master's degree is seen as equivalent to a bachelor’s degree 20 years ago in addition to the bachelor’s degree seen as a replacement for high school (the strong argument behind the recent changes in California ensuring [“free” community college for two years](https://edsource.org/2019/gov-newsom-signs-bills-to-expand-college-student-aid-target-admissions-scandal/618207)). It was surveyed that [37% of employers are demanding bachelor’s degrees for jobs](https://www.fastcompany.com/3057941/how-the-masters-degree-became-the-new-bachelors-in-the-hiring-world) that used to be open to high school graduates, and even more jobs are listing having a master’s degree as a strong differentiator.\n\n**Who is to blame?** The changes in these ecosystems have faced pushback as universities blame the decrease of family size, the development of suburban enclaves, and the rise of “helicopter parents”. Helicopter parents often see students as products, collecting a bag of signals to become competitive in arbitrary metrics for university admissions. This has created a generation of 18–22-year-olds that lack internal motivations and special interests needed in developing their purpose and individual career. Institutions also blame the reality that fewer teens and undergraduate students are working than in the past. More than [57% of parents](https://kaplan.com/universities/exploring-new-routes-to-success/) think the best education comes from internships, not courses, and[ 74% of parents ](https://kaplan.com/universities/exploring-new-routes-to-success/)expect their children to work while in college.\\*\\* \\*\\*When there is a set number of internships for a growing population of students, connections and personal networks seem to trump all, diminishing decades of work towards opportunity equality.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0\\*UeIorqJ3_P6Z4yNx)\n\nThose who disagree with the need for career application have countered that colleges are not career training centers and students need to see it as a platform for growth. One of the reasons issues in the higher education space have been pushed to the side of mainstream media is that the majority of American minds have **myopia** about higher education, mistaking the elite university experience as the average student’s. College completion only recently became a concern as the vast majority of students at selective schools still graduate on time whereas less than [50% of first-time, full-time bachelor’s students](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40) think the best education comes from internships, a percentage that gets even smaller for part-time or community college.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Pk8h5bdsUgg5wb5n)\n\n**The Future?** Around half of all participants of this ecosystem, from teacher to investor, prefer changing their model of [engagement](https://www.holoniq.com/2030/education-as-usual/). As both the bachelor's degree and undergraduate institutions lose reputation and credibility, the movement to disrupt this space is truly inevitable. The next generation will not be bred for or by the Harvards and Stanfords of this world. The next two sections will dive deeper into the 3 structures with more takeaways of what will stick.\n\n## **Part 2: Tied to Communities or Connected to a Laptop**\n\nPreviously, I touched on larger tailwinds in education, historical and current change drivers, and grouped three categories on where modern higher education is going as well as talked about the startups supporting progress and key takeaways from their success and failures. Next, I’ll touch on the first two structures, starting with what we see in the news as the edtech unicorns and normalized method of remote schooling: the **Subscription/ Global University Structure**.\n\nThis structure is creating college as a platform for continual and personalized learning, whether it be with micro certifications and nanodegrees, or the ability to continue education no matter the location. The growth is expected to continue: almost[ 80% of college/university students](https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2020/04/29/colleges-could-lose-20-percent-students-analysis-says) surveyed will attend school virtually (online) vs. attending a traditional school within ten years. One company to watch is Chicago-based Series A startup, [Unifyed](https://www.unifyed.com/#home), a higher education management platform helping transition universities into global platforms. Top-tier schools have made these migrations in the past couple of decades, and the systems lagging behind will feel the COVID-produced student shift to remote and individualized learning.\n\nThe Subscription/Global University Structure leans on MOOCS (Massive Online Open Courses), as the largest subset of this space. These support the trend of skill collection and competency building, rather than a singular degree speaking to education, these platforms and corporations like [Google’s career certificates](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/google-plan-disrupt-college-degree-university-higher-education-certificate-project-management-data-analyst.html) are taking center stage. With [72% of users](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/Documents/2018%20Employee%20Benefits%20Report.pdf) reporting immediate career benefits, these platforms have also shown an increase in effectiveness for people with lower socioeconomic status, in developing countries, and with less education. Full-time homemakers/caregivers, ages 25–40, [report higher satisfaction scores using MOOCs](https://hbr.org/2015/09/whos-benefiting-from-moocs-and-why) to refresh key concepts prior to returning to school than traditional in-person courses. Overall, among non-student MOOC completers, the flexibility of this education structure is a saving grace.\n\nOverall, the better performing **Global/Subscription University** remote structure has certain aspects needed to address the complexities in a world without classrooms. \\*\\*The winners \\*\\*will have\n\n* \\*\\*Diversified user engagement \\*\\*by including soft skill/lifestyle categories outside of current career preparation trends.\n* **Synchronous learning** with interactive elements on top of lecture/reading.\n* **Student retention safeguards** for the infamous low rates on these online platforms such as 1:1 coaching/mentoring and other hands-on career support.\n\nInternationally, these companies are doing well due to targeted market penetration, connecting communities to career opportunities nearby. The small cohort size and career coaching are some of the ways these platforms recruit and retain students near their central locations. These include [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/) (Australian) and other niche learning platforms like [Skill Lync](https://skill-lync.com/) supporting a mechanical engineering curriculum with a remote collaborative project model based in India. These models are also entering the post-graduate space with programs like [UNICAF](https://www.unicaf.org/scholarships/partners-programmes/) for master’s degree programs in an array of liberal arts with in-person projects across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWith these platforms gaining traction and tuition becoming less and less of a stable income stream, the consolidation of universities is inevitable and is [already happening](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-08-06-u-of-arizona-bought-a-for-profit-u-for-1-actually-the-for-profit-paid-millions-to-be-acquired). Top universities are struggling to maintain their worth, while second-tier and other low-performing schools are left to collapse.\n\nThis is what sparked the\\*\\* Sharing/Regional University structure, **the second structure I introduced in my first piece, Hostage to Higher Ed. This** \\*\\*structure exemplifies how community strengths can be amplified by educational institutions, and collaborate to grow regional superiority. “Sharing” allows universities to utilize the same pot of career services, international recruitment, academic advising, legal affairs, and information security. There is an increase of trust in local, rather than global programs, to keep families together and provide nearby careers. This can be seen historically in the ingrained community college to state school pipeline in California or the shared credit system in the state of Georgia.\n\nThe rise of these regional alliances, reinforcing their recognition frameworks, has proved to show a \\*\\*decrease of east-west student transfer — \\*\\*students flocking to certain areas of the country outside of their communities, causing a brain drain in areas that need them. Regional alliances also increase **student retention** and subsequent graduation. Innovations in this space are targeting low and middle-income students that are the majority of Americans outside of the 1% Ivy-league myopia, viewing university as more and more out of reach.\n\nA startup innovating on the ability to leverage regional universities to graduate faster with less debt, [Quottly](http://courses.quottly.com/), finds transferable classes at other colleges and universities that count for credit. [Rheaply](https://www.rheaply.com/) has been creating a “shared economy for innovation” by supporting school systems, from K12 through post-graduate programs. Some of the regional alliances that fall in this space include the Pennsylvania State University I-99 Corridor Region expanding into the counties of Bedford, Blair, and Centre, as well as the University of Michigan’s Research Corridor, the alliance between Michigan State University, the University of Michigan and Wayne State University.\n\nAs a marketplace, or shared admission system, [K50 Ventures](https://www.k50ventures.com/) portfolio company [Verto Education](https://vertoeducation.org/) combines guaranteed university admission to those who would like to attend a certain program.\n\nNewer startups popping up are attempting to enhance a formerly physical campus’ presence online, address [declining student retention](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-08-04-covid-era-brings-new-challenges-for-college-retention), and build allegiance including another K50 portfolio company, [EdSights](https://www.edsights.io/), an SMS chatbot to improve student wellness and keep them enrolled. At the end of the day, locality and home pride will live and be redesigned to be accessible and synchronous, without the classic college green to retreat to for lunch.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*F41kuLJz_IkbtGnu)\n\nThis structure does depend on the regions at hand and a localized support system, yet the concept of working for one employer your entire life is now an unheard-of reality for Americans. As economies globalize, students who remain in these regionally-focused education systems are excluded for higher-level positions outside their region and occupations in foreign sectors (especially if the student is from a low-performing region). I believe winners for the Sharing/Regional university structures will:\n\n* **Be localized**: Keep their ear to the ground and consistently reference where job creation will be local.\n* **Sense of belonging:** this may include reigniting college sports, extending networking opportunities to the virtual world, or any other opportunity to create community.\n* **Become more flexible:** These platforms need to compete with Global/Subscription university structures that have targeted audiences in lower socioeconomic statuses in this way. To regain local prominence, specific timing and synchronous work need to become less of a concern.\n\n## **Part 3: Married to Innovation**\n\nThis is the final piece of this 3 part deep dive on change drivers and themes in the slow-moving world of higher education that were jolted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the previous section, I dove deeper into the first two models, Global/Subscription and Regional/Sharing. This last article will explain my last model, the **Entrepreneurial/Corporate Partnership (CP) University**, which is a structure that is very dependent on the initial institution’s surroundings, whether in the Rust Belt or Silicon Valley. Universities are active in developing long-term efforts to promote local economies and regional development. In the post-COVID era, universities have more opportunities than ever to help drive economic recovery.\n\nThis construct is a ‘social contract’ between the university and society for creating economic and social enterprise. The **Entrepreneurial/CP university** model combines teaching and research academic structures for new development and was initially sparked by land grant universities, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford, who started the trend to address the large, complex problems that challenge the world and the ever-changing human condition by new innovations. This is seen in entrepreneurial education as well, as the study of both the liberal arts and social sciences is necessary for every industry’s great founders.\n\nBy aligning educational investments with student and state economic needs, this model supports an increase in peer-to-peer learning, cohort programs, and the emergence of new-age vocational training. As curriculum changes to be influenced through goals of the state and system, we see the rise of co-ops, on-campus accelerators, entrepreneurial dorms, and student venture funds. Programs on the forefront of this include Rice University’s angel investments in student companies and new degrees and certifications to mirror this change such as the University of Colorado Bachelor’s degree in Innovation. The University of Washington hosts a business plan competition throughout the year to push student ideas to market, and the nation’s first entrepreneurship-based academic residential community recently began at the University of Florida.\n\nOne university in this structure is [Minerva Schools](https://www.minerva.kgi.edu/) has taken the ecosystem by storm, flaunting a 3% acceptance rate and extensive waiting list. They are transforming the model for higher education and flipping it on its head with project-based cohort learning and 8 global campuses where students rotate courses. After speaking with a handful of students, their cohort model that travels together allows students to develop deep connections with peers from around the world. The disciplined structure is not as hyper-specialized as the average US university but still allows structure for learning as social sciences, computational sciences, and humanities are chosen as focus areas.\n\nAnother model not translating the traditional Western version of the university is the [African Leadership University](https://www.alueducation.com/), creating a system interweaving work experience and venture accelerators with two campuses in Rwanda and Mauritius. Curriculum and opportunities are flexible on current local needs with the purpose of socioeconomic progression for their families and communities.\n\nWith [new regulations](https://www.educationnext.org/bipartisan-bill-would-set-rules-income-share-agreements/) and income share agreements (ISA) concerns, I do believe that higher education costs will remain uncoupled to future income. For example, the models used by well-known [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/isa)\\*\\* \\*\\*will not become the “norm” for the majority of Americans. \\*\\*Student loan models \\*\\*will remain the primary go-to for students, with solutions such as [Mos](https://www.mos.com/), helping thousands navigate the world of financial aid and scholarships.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*YXAUhqxRMyuzIG_z)\n\nOn the other hand, some systems are leaning into \\*\\*corporate partnerships \\*\\*more so than internal innovation. Universities have long been tied to companies, but some are deepening engagement past the standard licensing and internship offerings. Some corporations are now going as far as providing insights on curriculum and financial assistance for equipment.\n\nThere has also been a recent trend of moving curriculum and training in-house, led by Google and followed by Microsoft, which recently also launched a retraining program. Amazon is also playing in this area, spending[ $700 million to retrain 100,000 employees](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/11/amazon-plans-to-spend-700-million-to-retrain-a-third-of-its-workforce-in-new-skills-wsj.html) by 2025. Other examples include ‘Motorola University’ and the Rand Institute focusing on air technologies and the next generation of employees in that sector, similar to the auto-technology program at Clemson University’s International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR). These programs directly bridge what an employer needs to the skills\n\nThe trend to focus on career skills is moving earlier and earlier. This model many under 18 to develop skills asynchronous to traditional degrees as well, especially as we see [tech giants](https://www.edweek.org/technology/what-does-big-tech-want-from-schools-spoiler-alert-its-not-money/2020/01) turning their heads to high school. We see this as employers are becoming more competitive in recruiting and developing top talent for fast-growing jobs. When parents were asked to consider a program in which employers hire talented students directly out of high school for full-time, paid jobs while the students pursue a bachelor’s degree, the majority wanted their children to apply. The visualization below is a part of [Kaplan’s “Go Pro Early”](https://uspto.report/TM/88579963) thesis, a main point surrounding the future of the university is the future of jobs coming first, education second.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Mzj8Sgw9XOUXNuf4)\n\nAs this trend continues, companies like [Pathstream](https://www.pathstream.com/), a startup that partners with leading technology companies to build branded digital skills career programs delivered through universities, will become crucial to propelling a closer corporate lens on education. These solutions are also built through company-enabled learning management integrations with companies like [Nexus](https://www.nexusedge.com/). This platform fits the build-your-own trend to education onto the education-as-usual platform of university.\n\nIn conclusion, the winners from the \\*\\*Entrepreneurial/CP University Structure \\*\\*will have\n\n* **Direct partnerships** with employers will overcome income share agreements or education models not in direct contact with local corporations.\n* **A sense of security** for students as early as possible to optimize performance.\n\nThe outlook of education as a [pipeline](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonbusteed/2019/04/30/this-will-be-the-biggest-disruption-in-higher-education/#67df7006608a) to an entry-level job is still a strong mindset in most households, particularly the bottom 99%. The convergence of the two spheres will continue to grow until industry and education are cohesive in the post-secondary space, cooperating on what, when, and where to teach 18–25-year-olds to support this rapidly changing economy. As you may have seen on Twitter, [OnDeck](https://www.beondeck.com/), a trending Series A-stage startup, is attempting to couple these new career trends into community-supported fellowships. As one of their investors, Packy McCormick, [wrote](https://www.notboring.co/p/whats-on-deck-for-on-deck), “On Deck doesn’t make programs, it makes organizations that make programs. And it does so incredibly quickly.”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*f5h0EZAs4clmD_UG)\n\nIn conclusion, the **Subscription/Global University**, the **Regional/Sharing University**, and the \\*\\*Entrepreneurial/CP University \\*\\*will all be dependent on how they adapt to one of the most volatile consumers, the post-secondary student. The main themes I see sticking for effective and long-lasting education models are **student retention safeguards.** Without in-person presence or a difference in assessments, students will have a steep learning curve to platform adoption. The ability to \\*\\*support the school-to-job pipeline \\*\\*that the middle class misses. With the gig economy growing and the future of work straying away from the corporate loyalty mindset, adaptability and career flexibility will become the most important factor in lifelong security. And last, higher education still targets young adults and adolescents at a key stage in development. The ability to \\*\\*create community and a sense of belonging \\*\\*to those in a program will be key to happiness while learning. With many motivating factors, I see a change of the 4-year university myopia of self-discovery into the next stage of how we view education: career preparation and community involvement.", "timestamp": 1635710138, "digest": "ZGQuiQx8_6dEkIGxmr9C0Lp2GsLTqWhHe6W9uCU7NmU", "contributor": "0xa0C3a5E5e25dDE1148296d8c3971e17009b45ccF"}

{"id": "j_H9fHFX_kAW_AUuFX5mFqFYTrBhogBosMeHGSIH0G8", "title": "Cypher Law", "body": "**Cypher law is layer 0.** \n\nCypher law supports internet-native property rights. It is an extension of international law that informs rulemaking and remedies in markets that run on autonomous code. It serves the practical trustless nature of such markets. It regards privacy as a fundamental right and consequence of public cryptography.\n\nAutonomous code consists of programs that resist intervention, such as the settlement of cryptographic assets. This is not to say intervention cannot be programmatic, but it will largely be consensual within the bounds of an agreement.\n\nCypher law informs the risks, crypto economically, as well as judicially, for engaging in autonomous agreements and validating them with software. It can be an aid in rationalizing such formation, execution and validation among strangers with diverse backgrounds.\n\nCypher law practitioners understand the code and traditional legal context of autonomous agreements and their markets.\n\n**Cypher law is leaderless.**\n\nCypher law has emerged organically on the internet, without edict, over the last decade to structure incentives over trillions in fiat. It is largely unspoken, self-regulated and guided by crypto economics and codified consensus rules, while remaining aware of intervention risks and related game theory.\n\nThese rules, or the cypher social contract, are formed and litigated among those that validate transactions and communities that give them value. \n\nDisputes may arise over the validity of the ledger, informed by notions of fairness or the threat of traditional legal systems, and in this manner, cypher law is an extension of “Law”, but ultimately, is determined by its own jurisdiction. \n\nLedger est lex. Ledgers may split their records, but the markets they serve will compete to resolve their state without “State” intervention, as that is most efficient. Cypher law accommodates such market competition. \n\n**Cypher law is coordination.**\n\nLike traditional legal systems, cypher law empowers coordination by rationalizing risk. It allows people to plan for the future and make agreements by streamlining settlement.\n\nIn cypher law, code is a fair representation of the intention of affected parties or their “promises”. \n\nUnlike traditional legal systems, human interpretation in cypher law is pushed to the far edges, replacing lawyers and judges with promissory code that executes on signatures. \n\nCoordination here is not concerned with nationality or personal background. In this way, cypher law is more tolerable to support markets among total strangers on the internet. \n\nThe communities that operate on cypher law are those that validate transactions for rewards and those who populate them. These communities do not rely on the enforcement remedies of legal systems, but largely, the incentives displayed by crypto economics. \n\nWhere rules are transparent and predictably applied to assets, cooperation becomes that much easier and powerful. \n\nAnyone can form an agreement on a cypher legal system and be reasonably sure that it will execute as expected. Anyone can mine or validate a transaction, adding to the memory of the market, its common law, and expect a reward. \n\n**Cypher law is property 2.0.** \n\nCypher law enhances property rights by allowing anyone to freely enter and exit their assets without bias. These assets are secured by the credible neutrality of cryptography. Cypher agreements are therefore ratified more by the validity of their terms than by their participants. \n\nCypher law will continue to advance to support an international market in p2p trading, company formation and more advanced financial primitives, like lending, by reconstructing remedies usually provided for agreement defaults in traditional legal systems, with internet-native enforcement mechanisms.\n\n**Cypher law is not anarchy.** \n\nCypher law is informed by the rules of other jurisdictions and their application to those maintaining ledgers. \n\nAutonomous agreements expedite execution but do not remove the consequences of their formation and state against other legal systems. \n\nThe cooperation of other legal systems with cypher legal systems, like the coordination among cypher communities, will be driven by rational incentives and rewards.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1635712023, "digest": "nu0A0GQlLf0a5KZDel8xdogGP6WCBIcPGhR472JiS5E", "contributor": "0x1C0Aa8cCD568d90d61659F060D1bFb1e6f855A20"}

Its goal is to protect its users from face recognition-based modes of surveillance.\n\nThe company’s blurb reads:\n\n> “Fed up with constant observation of your private life? Aware of modern surveillance and face recognition technologies? Not happy with thousands of cameras following your every step? Privatronics® Personal Security System™ will protect your privacy, will make you feel more secure in any situation of your everyday life.”\n\n![One of the examples of Privatronics' products](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PUUB0iqGJzRYQMEATrlZz.png?height=600&width=450)\n\nFor $99.99, one could create a mask to avoid the ever-watching gaze of surveillance technology. The project can be understood as an artist’s responses to the growing presence of surveillance in the early aughts. That period was a rich breeding ground for both actual implementations of CCTVs in public spaces but also for its cultural representation through an aesthetic named [Nokiawave](https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/notebook-primer-nokiawave) by graphic designer David Rudnick.\n\n![The Bourne Identity (2002) - an exemplar of Nokiawave and the growing cultural concerns surrounding perpetual surveillance](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tCLlgRdt0onTZsNw_o_lX.png?height=595&width=1400)\n\nIntentionally or not, this art piece also hinted at a specific shift in our common understanding of how to respond to surveillance and facial recognition technologies. Frequently, we speak of surveillance as something to be tackled on a structural level, through national legislation and policies. Privatronics anchors this fight in the domain of the individual providing through the piece a chance for every citizen to disencumber themselves from the heavy gaze of Big Brother.\n\nMaking every citizen the master of their own anonymity.\n\n### American Independence\n\nThe theme for this year’s MET Gala was “American Independence”. A rather loaded term. Vogue recommended coyly to wear one of Vaquera’s flag dresses, as a literal interpretation of the theme.\n\n![Look 18 from Vaquera's 2017 Fall Ready-to-Wear Collection](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/edZ-jc2d2qseLbaWyUEgm.png?height=739&width=470)\n\nBut what does it mean to be *American* and *Independent?*\n\nIf you had to distill the essence of Americanness to one look, what would it be?\n\n> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n>\n> *- American Declaration of Independence, July 4th, 1776*\n\nTo anyone looking at the foundational text of America, the afore-quoted “Declaration of Independence”, and being familiar with American culture, it is evident that this second unalienable Right is the crux of modern American identity. From the right to bear arms and no mask, individual freedom is front and center of the American self.\n\nWho then at the MET best represented those ideas?\n\nI believe Kim Kardashian wins this challenge, hands down.\n\n![Kim Kardashian West in her Balenciaga gown at the MET Gala 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8HMk6bdi-WLhhtg-oKWY7.png?height=1280&width=924)\n\nKim arrived at the ball clad in a night-black Balenciaga gown that hid her face and covered her entire body.\n\n![Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X and Rihanna, at the 2021 MET Gala](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ztqwOFbHJWMrbvey8I8sZ.png?height=576&width=857)\n\nCompared to the other guests, Kim’s outfit was modest, a sign of effacement, drawing attention away from her visage, hinting at the desire not to be seen. What can be made of this aesthetic gesture?\n\nToday’s celebrities are hypervisible. Their every move is tracked by the paparazzi and they are compelled to continuously share details of their lives. We live in a hypermediated age anchored on the abundant proliferation of information and images, which in turn increases the visibility of those who produce and disseminate those images. The overwhelming societal impetus seems to be “Everything must be exposed”. Celebrities, for all intents and purposes, trade the solace of a regular life and the freedom to engage in your daily deeds with little to no impediment for fame and wealth. Celebrities managed by agents and publicists, constantly surveilled, are not really *free*. They don’t really have a *life*. Everything has a price. *Life and Liberty for Money.*\n\nWhat is signified then in the renunciation of identity, in the refusal to show one’s self?\n\n## Opacity\n\n> We clamor for the right to opacity. - Édouard Glissant, “Poetics of Relation”, 1928\n\nOpacity is a concept adduced by Martinican writer Édouard Glissant who sought to question the possibilities of intercultural communication. To him, in a multi-relational world, noting differences does not imply understanding Otherness, thereby rendering it transparent, rather it leads to the acceptance of unintelligibility, impenetrability, and confusion that characterizes cross-cultural communication. Opacity seeks to overcome the danger of diminishing the idiosyncrasies of cultural differences by comprehension. I believe this concept can help us understand human interaction on an intrapersonal level. Through most interactions, we tend to diminish the Other through comprehension. To use the Sartrian existentialist vernacular, we reify the Other through our Gaze when we engage with them. No one is more gazed at than American celebrities.\n\nOpacity then can be understood as a form of resistance deployed by Kim and Demna Gvasalia, the Creative Director of Balenciaga, to overcome the assimilation to the sameness of the absorbed look. It is an invitation to difference. It proclaims individuality. Through it, she is becoming the master of her own anonymity. Through it, Kim regains her quintessential American characteristic, her Individual Freedom.", "timestamp": 1635718054, "digest": "r2g9STV1pSHFrZj4DTfhrCfnxslscDF0jCslvfdbog4", "contributor": "0x87fB7c717A4145095Eb076e239BC0F8Fba42cf49"}

それによって、2枚の古地図は、それぞれ、16枚の画像ファイルに分割されました。 （また、それに加えて、それぞれの古地図の、表表紙と裏表紙の写真も撮影されました。最終的に、2枚の古地図の画像ファイルは、それぞれ18枚になりました（合計36枚）。）\n\nぼくは、16枚ずつに分割された画像ファイルをつなぎ合わせて、この[『山門三塔坂本惣絵図』](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E9%96%80%E4%B8%89%E5%A1%94%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E6%83%A3%E7%B5%B5%E5%9B%B3)の第1鋪と第2鋪の古地図の全体図の画像ファイルをつくりました。\n\nぼくは、国立公文書館の[「デジタル画像等の二次利用についての利用規約」](https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/support/use.html)にもとづき、これらの古地図の画像ファイルを、ウィキメディア・コモンズのウェブサイトで、パブリックドメインとして公開しました。\n\n*

{"id": "-Byl4oP37l_RfBVH70QrHhcvigzAYrigkMvRdSY8adw", "title": "Introducing Boiler DAO", "body": "## Decentralized and Distributed Story Telling\n\nI created 10,000,000 $BOILD tokens on xDai blockchain.\n\n[https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0x9763eC3cc8eAb1687dd629489368b3e9E5B3fde2/transactions](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0x9763eC3cc8eAb1687dd629489368b3e9E5B3fde2/transactions)\n\nI want you to see what I’m going to do with them. The reason I made the tokens is to power a DAO for people to have access to a resource in creating a DAO from scratch.\n\nThere is another DAO I am a part of that has been without a token. There wasn’t really a need for it. Governance of the DAO is handled perfectly using moloch as implemented by [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/). Where the need for a token really presented itself, is in encouraging user engagement in the DAO. Practising token creation on an L2 sidechain (aka inexpensive) was a task I took on for the [DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xd8837c5bf792443edec94576e23450166dfd3ae8/proposals)\n\nThe more time I have spent working on and learning about DAO’s, I have encountered the same problem repeatedly. Teaching the fundamentals of DAO’s seems to be a front and centre issue for a lot of DAO start-ups. Resources have been thin and compiling information has been a task most have to deal with. The DAOists is a DAO, mostly located on Discord and airtable right now, that has taken this problem head on by collecting as much information as possible through it’s [resource list airbase](https://airtable.com/shrKgyx43sFvQE5lp/tblNQOw5j40sTBtPg), including a separate airbase for [DAO tools](https://airtable.com/shrrXaF1CvPdp94Y8/tblsy93cTWAhYiXOQ) and one for [articles](https://airtable.com/shrAyCIteuG6kB1H3) about the space.\n\nAs a disclaimer, a lot of what I do here, such as writing this article and the videos created, will be shared with DAOhaus to add to their own content if they choose. A side goal of my developing this DAO, is to put it in some work in aide of developing and supporting the documentaion of moloch DAOs as it is implemented through DAOhaus. It is also in aide of The DAOists in their mission of educating and converting the world into “DAOism.”\n\n[https://discord.gg/dEJFDKHvCp](https://discord.gg/dEJFDKHvCp)\n\nDAOhaus is playing a game. Every week, DAOhaus does their weekly “Haus Party” chat on their discord server. During this event there are [POAP](https://poap.xyz/)s distributed to attendees. If you are the owner of the POAP you are then able to enter the “War Games.” This game is a DAO and is about as open ended as possible. The direction of the game is decided by making proposals in the DAO, and holding votes. Basically, doing the thing that DAOs do. It truly is a wonderful way to teach about DAO’s and how to use a moloch DAO. So I’m stealing their idea.\n\n## German Art and Slaying Demons\n\n![Slaying Moloch requires Co-Ordination](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dry6Az1t194mgdoARFgE.png?height=719&width=721)\n\nIn [Scott Alexander’s](https://slatestarcodex.com/author/admin/) essay [Meditaions on Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) we learn of a powerful demon Moloch that represents a system humankind hates but lack the tools to co-ordinate and make the changes everyone knows needs to be made.\n\n> There’s [a passage](http://principiadiscordia.com/book/45.php) in the *Principia Discordia* where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. “Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.”\n>\n> The Goddess answers: “What is the matter with that, if it’s what you want to do?”\n>\n> Malaclypse: “But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!”\n>\n> Goddess: “Oh. Well, then stop.”\n>\n> The implicit question is – if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: “Moloch”.\n\nThe Moloch DAO framework seems to have been built around the ideas introduced in Alexander’s analysis of Ginsberg’s poem [Howl](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl). Aiming to create a set of tools humans can use, to address the issues of co-ordination failure and truly take the world into a new direction and slaying the moloch.\n\nDAOhaus brings a whole new level to the story of co-ordination. What they have done, is take the Moloch code and created a user interface in which anybody with a little knowledge of how to navigate [Web3](https://web3.foundation/), can create and/or be a part of a DAO.\n\n> [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/) was [born at ETHBerlin 2019](https://medium.com/odyssy/daohaus-bauhaus-b855cd9db19e), a hackathon project aiming to make it easier (or possible at all) to interact with the [Moloch DAO smart contracts](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch/blob/master/v1_contracts/README.md) in a human-readable way. After a days-long, Club Mate induced frenzy, the very first build of DAOhaus was born! Thus beginning the almost two year journey focused on bringing more open tools for financial coordination to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n[https://medium.com/daohaus-club/haus-launch-bd781bbbf13a](https://medium.com/daohaus-club/haus-launch-bd781bbbf13a)\n\nThe story that I’ve heard, (I was looking everywhere for where I’ve heard, so I may well be taking some artistic liberty here) is something about the original hack group in Berlin rocking out to a band called Bauhaus during EthBerlin 2019. Which, if true, is a very serendipitous event.\n\nIf we look a little deeper, into the history of the German bauhaus art scene, we learn it is built around a philosophy of creating functional art using multidisciplinary skillsets collaborating in new and innovative ways. This began in actual buildings in which the interiors were fitted with all the tools students required to work and collaborate together. In a digital Web3 format, DAOhaus is doing the same thing. Providing a haus of tools for people to collaborate and slay moloch.\n\n> The Bauhaus was founded in 1919 in the city of Weimar by German architect Walter Gropius (1883–1969). Its core objective was a radical concept: to reimagine the material world to reflect the unity of all the arts. Gropius explained this vision for a union of art and design in the Proclamation of the Bauhaus (1919), which described a utopian craft guild combining architecture, sculpture, and painting into a single creative expression. Gropius developed a craft-based curriculum that would turn out artisans and designers capable of creating useful and beautiful objects appropriate to this new system of living.\n\n[https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm)\n\nThe idea is, I am going to create a new DAO. As you may have already guessed, it will be called Boiler DAO. In this case, I put the cart before the horse. I made the token, named after my social media alias, then decided instead of it just taking up space, I might as well use it. The token is not swappable for anything on any exchange. It is a “pure” social token. It may not always be that way.\n\nThe goal of this DAO will be to tell a story. In both the literal sense and the figurative sense. I will begin this DAO and start some of the basic fundamentals. From there, I will let it grow or fade on it’s own.  Creativity in decentralized story telling, at the same time learning about DAO’s, provides a new tool to aide startups who would like to spend their time focusing on the product or service they intend to offer, instead of teaching fundementals of DAOs.\n\n## How the Story Will be Told\n\nHonestly, I don’t know. If I did, then I wouldn’t be honest in my intentions to have a decentralized project. I will start it. I will create videos. These videos will aide anybody who wants to view them in their own journey of creating or participating in a DAO. This will be a large part of the educational aspect of this DAO.\n\nI will do the basics and then the DAO will decide everything else through proposals, this article being the first part of the process. Obviously I’m not going to make a video of myself typing an article but the rest of it I will. I will create the DAO on xDai. I will then create a [safe minion](https://daohaus.club/docs/users/minion/), which will create a [gnosis safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/), controlled by the DAO. I will deposit 9 Million BOILD tokens into the DAO and from that point forward those tokens will be controlled by the DAO.\n\nI will then create a Discord server and a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjlcjNvqwUxRIma1_d05uYA) channel. Again, this will be as bare bones as possible but it is an opportunity to teach how to do this, as it is a pretty vital part of the *process for this DAO.* I say this because there are many ways to form a DAO and I don’t want anybody to come out of this thinking, ok, If I do every step I see here, I will have a DAO. This may very well be true, but you may not have the DAO you want. The point of this exercise, is to show a particular set of tools that I happened to learn about. All I want you to recognize is that they are tools, and you can use many different tools in different combinations to form your own DAO. If you click the link I provided above to The DAOists tools airtable you will get a good overview of some of the other tools available to you.\n\nThere certainly are other forms of social media at our disposal I could set up as well but it will be up to the DAO to decide how that goes. The one thing I will do, beyond the basics, is set up the collab.land bot on the discord. This will allow for distribution of the remaining tokens to people interested in the DAO. I will distribute 1000 tokens, through the bot to anybody that requests them, up until the point that the DAO decides to change that. Being the creator of the discord, I will be the mod there, until there are a few members of the DAO, then the DAO will decide. 500,000 tokens will be deposited into the collab.land bot for distribution purposes.\n\nThe remaining tokens I reserve to keep, as the creator of the token. It will be mostly used during the making of the tutorial videos but maybe one day I will use them to buy a lambo.\n\n![Who Knows?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RQlRj7T29gFxs02IdeBZl.gif?height=187&width=198)\n\nThe price for entry into the DAO will be: one share per one $BOILD token. The token will also be used as the currency to perform some actions within the DAO (so if you do propose membership, keep that in mind you will still need some later. You will also need a little wxdai and xdai in your wallet for proposals and gas on the xdai blockchain. You can wrap your xdai easily at [WrapEth.com]().  After everything is set up, with the basics, I will then make the first proposal for the beginning of the literal story and gamification of The Boiler DAO.\n\n## Gamification of Boiler DAO\n\nThe idea will be a fictional tale with distributed authorship and each part of the story told after being democratically decided upon by the DAO. A proposal can be a sentence, paragraph, chapter, word, haiku, an edit, a photo…. who knows. Perhaps to entries for the next part of the story are so good it creates a fork in the story, which may even cause a fork in the DAO itself, which would also be super interesting. The point being, the DAO will decide and grow (or fail) as it’s own organism set loose upon the Web3 space.\n\nMy original thought was that, after everything was set up, I would make a proposal for the first line or paragraph and *we* would take it from there. As I was working on this document and doing a few other tasks I was listening in on a Discord call for the Moloch DAO discord server.\n\n[https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth](https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth)\n\nFor the most part I was just enjoying the talk, I believe I could listen to [Travis Wyche](https://medium.com/@traviswyche) talk for hours. Eventually I could no longer concentrate on what I was doing and had to focus on the conversation until it actually lead to a point where I could jump in. It was interesting because the *first* act of collaboration for this “autonomous” organization still required some human to human collaboration. (He also suggested xdai as opposed to the “[broken](https://cryptobriefing.com/polygon-swerves-850-million-hack-ethereum-bridge/)” [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) as another successful virtual yet personal collaboration).\n\nThe point of Travis’ constructive questioning of decentralized story telling was the very valid concern that character development and plot is essentially the result of an authors imagination which leads to a narrative being told and there may be a fundamental problem in the story which could lead to a directionless jumble of words. That could also be interesting, but perhaps unreadable.\n\nSo now I have changed my mind about how to start this. Instead of starting the story, I will just leave a blank page. Perhaps the DAO will decide to spend time on character and plot development first and then “elect” writers to move the story forward. I really don’t know and I don’t want to know either. This \"game” could turn into a publishing powerhouse with multiple ongoing narratives, or it might produce a haiku and dissolve. Time will tell and democracy will decide.\n\nThere are many tools available to us in the Web3 space. This game/story/educational DAO will attempt to use as many tools as it can in order to be successful. It is meant as a seed and will grow if tended to. Hopefully it will take advantage of as many web3 tools as we can. We will start with youtube and hopefully transition that to a Web3 service WHEN one become available. We can use this DAO to experiment with new ideas and new tools, find out what works what doesn’t and offer suggestions to create things that don’t even exist yet.\n\n## Fictionalized Micro Economy\n\nAs this story unfolds, there will be opportunities within the DAO to earn tokens. Again, this will be up to the DAO how this is handled but there are many tasks that will need to be completed in order to make this successful. For example, there may not be a way for the DAO, after a proposal has passed for the next paragraph, to automate the text adding the text to the publishing service. A member of the DAO may be hired to perform that task and be rewarded by tips or even through a constant trickle of tokens, controlled by the DAO (yes this is possible). The direction is to be decided as we weave our way through [The Rise of The Micro-Economies](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/gWY6Kfebs9wHdfoZZswfiLTBVzfKiyFaIwNf2q8JpgI)\n\nThe DAO may even decide that there is a particular NFT on Rarible that would be an excellent part of the story. There are many different ways for the DAO to go about acquiring one and the fun part will be for the DAO to figure out which tools it will need to carry out the tasks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI think I have explained enough as far as the creation of this DAO goes. It is nearly impossible to start a DAO without the original creator or creators influence. I intend to minimize that as much as possible for the launch and then let it be an exercise in creative use of existing and future Web3 technologies. Let’s do it as an exercise in democracy in a micro-economy with no borders. Let’s use it as a foundational educational tool for an emerging technology that is more and more becoming the daily life of humans.\n\nLet’s make a cool story.\n\n## UPDATE\n\n \n There will be a separate article produced explaining the progress up until now. The Discord channel, youtube and the DAO itself is now set up. \n I have videoed the steps but have not edited them to the point they are postable on youtube. I will post the raw footage in Discord. \n If you would like to join the discord please follow the link. \n \n\n[https://discord.gg/AB6ExHx4Ee](https://discord.gg/AB6ExHx4Ee)\n\nGo here there first and ask for your 1001 $BOILD you can use to propose memebership.

You can check-out any time you like, but you can never leave.* *🎶*\n\nThe greatest inventions in history are the results of *someone*, *somewhere*, wanting *something* that has never before existed. In the process of going from [zero to one](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296), they manifest a new reality for themselves and the world around them. These historical inflection points are somewhat of a paradox, often arising from an individual or group solving a what seems to be a local problem that turns out to be inherently global in scale. After all, if I’m having an issue, odds are high that someone else on this giant blue and green sphere is experiencing the exact same problem. By solving our own problems, we often solve those of others.\n\nYet innovation is not merely about solving the problems of today - it is also about expanding the problem sets of the future. Progress is an accumulative phenomenon, such that innovation x leads to innovation y, which leads to innovation z, on and on, ad infinitum. The creators of today are building on the foundations of those before them, in turn adding their own layers that will be built on by those of the future. We truly [stand on the shoulders of giants](https://fs.blog/2020/04/shoulders-of-giants/#:\\~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20I%20have%20seen%20further,on%20the%20shoulders%20of%20giants.%E2%80%9D&text=Standing%20on%20the%20shoulders%20of%20giants%20is%20a%20necessary%20part,what%20you%20do%20less%20valuable).\n\nIn this equation of the future, time is the limiting reactant. Innovation y fails in a world where it is necessitated by innovation x, but where innovation x is yet to exist. Each innovation is thus a *spark* for innovations of the future, such that it acts as a branching point on a tree, each spawning many new innovations in its wake.\n\n![Ideas are the neurons of innovation - each idea creates the spark needed for the next.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7rT76-2KEESTJQftXgKx0.gif?height=262&width=455)\n\nTake for example the internet and its subsequent development track from Web 1.0 (read only) to Web 2.0 (read *and* write) to Web 3.0 ([read ](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/Basic-Definitions-Web-1-0-Web-2-0-Web-3-0)*[and](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/Basic-Definitions-Web-1-0-Web-2-0-Web-3-0)*[ write and ](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/Basic-Definitions-Web-1-0-Web-2-0-Web-3-0)*[execute](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/Basic-Definitions-Web-1-0-Web-2-0-Web-3-0)*)*.* Both Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 have spawned thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of new ideas and innovations. Web 1.0 was the spark needed for Web 2.0, providing the “read” functionality first and foremost so that the “write” functionality could later be added. Yet it was also the spark for many ideas, products, and companies built on the back of Web 1.0 itself.\n\nWhich brings us to crypto - the paradigm shift of paradigm shifts.\n\nFor years, open, permissionless networks unable to be hampered by gatekeepers or coerced by kings were but a figment of the imagination. For such a grand ambition to become reality, the world needed a spark. That spark came in 2008, when a pseudonymous cypherpunk named Satoshi Nakomoto solved the [Byzantine General’s problem](https://river.com/learn/what-is-the-byzantine-generals-problem/) and created a mechanism for decentralized consensus in absence of a trusted third party. Satoshi then applied their findings to create an electronic, peer-to-peer cash system dubbed Bitcoin and posted them online, for the world to see, in what will be remembered as one of the most revolutionary [white-papers](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) in all of human history.\n\nBut this is not an article on Bitcoin’s merits, per se - whether or not it is hard money, whether or not it is digital gold. This is an article about ideas and innovation and the places they take us. And the places that Satoshi has allowed us to go are merely in their infant stages of discovery.\n\n***We have walked into the digital Hotel California, and we will never leave.***\n\nAkin to the many great inventions of history, Bitcoin will be defined as much for the path it has paved for new innovations as it will be for the value it provides alone. And while Bitcoin is the seminal blockchain of the crypto ecosystem, the overwhelming majority of these new innovations will *not* be built on the backbone of Bitcoin the *blockchain*. But they will be built on the backbone of Bitcoin the *idea* - that consensus in absence of a third party is not only theoretically possible, but concretely possible. Today.\n\nIt is this idea that Vitalik Buterin expanded upon in his creation of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/). If Bitcoin is sound money backed by a blockchain, then Ethereum is programmable money backed by the same technology. In a sense, Ethereum is to Web 2.0 (read *and* write) as Bitcoin is to Web 1.0 (read only). It takes the Bitcoin idea and adds new functionality to it - a native programming language, a zero to one process in and of itself, such that new innovations can take the Ethereum idea and add new functionality to it.\n\n> ***The majority of future crypto innovations will not be built on top of Bitcoin the blockchain. But they will be built on top of Bitcoin the idea.*** \n\nYet it has not been all roses for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the crypto ecosystem. Doubt is a frequent companion of hope, and crypto is living this reality daily. For every problem that a crypto-technology purports to solve, there are hundreds (if not thousands) of naysayers and opponents standing in its path. Such obstacles range from ‘experts’ that pronounce Bitcoin’s time of death with each 20%+ drawdown - [90 ‘deaths’ in 2018 after 125 in 2017](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-died-90-times-2018-120041001.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJBWUoNs_qKwEMCDBSXyWqZ8JURon1S97rycSpY2hkF_6i-RqDPan8RUohmP95WoHHAGYplyltcDbOCH8ciJScJopFqobvp7jVzkDbAfBiTiacoqVBfHBWwzU60TsBGi0HYK_rq5baXUvcfnj7v0En6XtZvS4K_Bpp2a-0CbDvtE) - to nation states such as [China ‘banning crypto’ for the nth time in 'September of 2021.](https://techstory.in/twitter-breaks-into-a-riot-of-memes-as-china-bans-crypto-again/)\n\n![\"Crypto is dead\" is code for \"buy the dip\".](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zlNinb3zV_Qj3AHHv_-G8.png?height=578&width=1250)\n\nWhile intuition suggests we proceed with caution, history tells us that crypto technologies are in good company for a simple fact - the most revolutionary ideas in human history frequently face stark opposition in their infancy stages. Take the printing press, for example, invented in the mid 1400s by Johannes Gutenburg. It found a formidable critic at the turn of the 16th century in the Roman Catholic Church, who recognized the press’s power to democratize the spread of information and subvert the Church’s ability to control the flow of religious content. Or how about the internet, perhaps the most revolutionary technology in history? In 1998, during the early stages of its adoption, a Nobel-prize winning economist made the following quote: *“By 2005, or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”*\n\nThings are not until they are. And like the middle school recess bully, critics love to take shots at emerging technologies before problems of puberty are fleshed out.\n\nBut no matter. At the same time that skeptics are screaming into the wind, the market is speaking through a megaphone. In the past two weeks, the total [crypto market cap reached all time highs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-cap-hits-new-all-time-high-as-btc-eth-soar) as Bitcoin broke out to a new peak of $67K while Ethereum did the same to a tune of $4.4K.\n\nBitcoin is slowly (and programmatically) chipping away at the market cap of gold, while Ethereum, whose smart contract functionality provides a base layer infrastructure on which to create a decentralized financial system (‘De-Fi’, ie *Decentralized Finance*), just [surpassed the market cap of the world’s largest bank - JP Morgan](https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2021/ethereums-market-cap-jumps-to-513-billion-surpasses-visa-jpmorgan-chase/). What the critics mistake for fragility is in actuality its opposite. In an anti-fragile process, weaknesses brought to light quickly become strengths due to the velocity of information and creativity inherent in these open crypto networks. Constraints breed creativity, and each time crypto-networks are threatened the communities rally at lightening pace.\n\nThe immune responses inherent in crypto networks allow for the creation of a rock solid foundation upon which to build. We intuitively understand that a skyscraper is only as strong as its base, and those built on top of sand will inevitably succumb to the pressures of time. Yet with each [FUD](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=FUD) attack survived by Bitcoin and Ethereum, grains of sand morph to rock-solid concrete, enabling us to build higher - and see further -than we ever imagined.\n\n### Hotel Crypto-Fornia\n\nAs we stand today, it is as if each of us has been given all-access keys to the future. Each section of the crypto ecosystem represents a different room of the digital Hotel California, and you can choose the door through which you enter while having full autonomy of where you go once inside.\n\nFirst, on entry points. One of the great strengths of the crypto ecosystem it that it is inherently non-discriminatory. Bitcoin and Ethereum (and any other cryptocurrency, for that matter) care not how you got there. They operate in binary 1s and 0s - you either own or you do not. This is perhaps the simplest description of the manner in which they have bootstrapped themselves into dominance - BTC and ETH turn 0s into 1s by incentivizing new users with the strongest value proposition in the world - financial upside. Buy at x, and at some time in the future you’ll have x + y.\n\nViewed from inside the hotel, the manner in which you entered is irrelevant. Check in  at the front desk (*Bitcoin*)? Welcome! You’ll find there is much more to explore. Or perhaps you prefer to operate through the concierge (*Ethereum*)? *Benvenuto*, I love optionality myself. Did the DJ from the pool party (*Dogecoin*) show you in? Nice to see you, I can tell that roller coaster experiences are your idea of a good time. Oh, it was the art wing of the hotel (*NFTs*) that brought you in? You’ll find that we are just getting started.\n\nReality is such that most of the traffic entering the crypto-ecosystem comes via the same on-ramps - the same cryptocurrencies (BTC/ETH) and the same exchanges (Coinbase). But while the entry points may have high similarity, the interior of Hotel Crypto-fornia is anything but uniform. In fact, there is a massive “Under Construction” sign in the middle of the front lawn with a progress bar on that shows well below 1% completion.\n\n![We are still \\*very\\* early.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jxdwN9ygNfLTaCdobM67w.gif?height=844&width=1500)\n\nThe interplay between open for business and under construction is a key distinction for what makes crypto so unique in its early stages. Few other industries in history have [sold construction passes to the general public at a higher clip than what is happening in crypto right now.](https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1396837073202532357?s=20) Anyone, regardless of how old or how wealthy, can can grab a hard hat and get to work in the hotel due to the space’s permissionless nature.\n\nAnd as each new person walks through the door, the base layer of the crypto ecosystem continues to solidify like grains of sand being turned to rock solid concrete. Bitcoin and Ethereum are proxies for the strength of the foundation, and as they continue to assert their dominance the possibility set of future floor plans expands.\n\nHotel Crypto-fornia itself represents an intersection between the future and the present, a place that each of us inhabits by nature of walking through its doors. We can participate today in any number of ways - such as buying coins on exchanges like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com), browsing NFTs on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/%5C), or maybe even [sending Bitcoin via the Lightning Network](https://strike.me/en/). And while each of these actions are opportunities to participate in the *economy of now*, they are inherently shaping the *economy of the future* as well.\n\nWhat that economy of the future will look like, however, we can only guess. While each of us can gaze upwards from the ground floor to get an idea of what elevator stops we will be able to make, the clouds begin to obscure our vision the higher we look. In current state, we are merely re-designing the world’s pre-existing infrastructure. We are looking for the decentralized alternatives to Web 2.0 that are enabled by blockchain technology and Web 3.0. Take [BlueSky](https://twitter.com/bluesky?s=20), for example - Jack Dorsey and Twitter’s attempt to create a new standard for decentralized social media. Or [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz) (the site on which this article is published) - the first decentralized publishing platform that is built and run by its contributors.\n\nAs innovative as both of these platforms are, they are both following the same roadmap by leveraging crypto technology to reimagine a Web2 idea - “create the decentralized, Web3 version of the centralized, Web2 platform”. But what happens when we start building new floors of the hotel that have no pre-existing blueprint? Through this lens, the outline of the future becomes less clearly defined the higher we look.\n\nSo while the current construction of Hotel Crypto-fornia is nothing short of remarkable, we have much, much more to build. The Google and Facebook moments of the space have yet to arrive. And while I am not sure what they will look like, I am sure that they will change the world in ways that we have never before seen.\n\nBut in order to build the dreams of the future, we must deal with the realities of the present. And one such reality of where we currently stand is that in order for the crypto ecosystem to grow and create the future we dream of, more people must come through the door.\n\nThe beauty of Hotel Crypto-fornia is that it is permissionless in nature. It does not matter why you come, all that matters is that you do. Perhaps the doors through which you enter will shape your perceptions and experiences inside, but feel free to enter in any way you like. My personal path has been Bitcoin → ETH → NFTs → DeFi → Web3, but you can have any one you like. Because what matters isn’t the way in which the path winds, but simply that path itself exists. More 1s, and less 0s.\n\nSo come one come all - Hotel Crypto-fornia is open for business and will only continue to grow. Enter however you like, just don’t be afraid to explore once you are inside since you never know what you may find. The floor plan is currently under construction, but with each day you’ll better understand where everything is. Except for the exit, that is, because one does not exist. Technology is a one way street and Hotel Crypto-fornia is no exception. You can check in any time you like, but you can never leave.", "timestamp": 1635722208, "digest": "5f9dALnFQQX3PLNTNPCwMPSZ_15gdpC4kUxcT8FRnx8", "contributor": "0x5A8F66b24de24e1c829e03c9D3EFD3343064083c"}

This, combined with the resurgence of meme tokens such as $SHIB have led to network congestion, capital flight towards more optimistic assets, and an oversaturation of NFT projects launching in the last month or so have contributed to this precipitous drop in prices and volumes.\n\nSince this is the dominant story of the last week, I figured today was a good day to dive into some of the analytics to determine exactly what happened, where the money has gone, and if there’s any hope in the near-term for NFTs (there is, I promise).\n\n\n---\n\nFirst of all, let’s look at overall volume on OpenSea. Remember, even though plenty of other NFT platforms across various blockchains exist, OpenSea accounts for the overwhelming majority.\n\n![OpenSea daily volume is a the lowest point since July 2021. Credit to @rchen8 for the chart.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D17ucMwgGb4ZloL4stdKZ.png?height=557&width=1855)\n\nFirst of all, OS daily volume is at the lowest point since July 2021 indicating that even though awareness of NFTs is at an all-time high, the number of people speculating on their price is at a long-time low. The important question is, why is this? The first thing people often point to is ETH’s insane gas prices lately. Let’s take a look at recent ETH gas prices to see if this lines up.\n\n![ETH gas prices have slowly risen since August, with noticeable spikes in gas prices attributed to spikes in OS volume, with the exception of the past 15 days or so.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nCRR4apaVTCkuknjht-L_.png?height=876&width=2032)\n\nWe can see noticeable patterns between gas prices and OS volume since the beginning of August, but sometime around mid-October we start to see a divergence. Gas prices continued to climb during this period, but OS volume dropped off a cliff. However, we see that the second half of August experienced a massive rise in both gas prices *and* OS volume, so this indicates to me that gas prices alone can’t explain the massive selloff. People were obviously willing to pay hundreds of dollars for gas in August, so why aren’t they willing to do the same now?\n\nOne might postulate that the NFT world is oversaturated with mints, airdrops, and new drops that have led to less concentration of attention and therefore less concentrated volume around hyped projects. When there’s so much to choose from, as everybody diversifies into various projects there might not be enough volume to sustain the meteoric rises in prices that we saw in August and September. However, we’ve seen projects like CrypToadz, Jungle Freaks, Lazy Lions, CyberKongz, and numerous other projects sustain strong upwards price action, so obviously there is still appetite for risk in the market.\n\nHowever, are there fewer participants in the market? Is that why most projects are seeing massive declines in floor prices? Well, as you can see below, the number of monthly active traders on OpenSea is at an all time high, and the number of NFTs sold is roughly the same as it was 2 months ago, so this tells me a few things:\n\n1. There are still many new players entering the NFT space, so we’re not seeing a mass exodus from the market, and\n2. The number of transactions is still high, indicating that people are still flipping and participating in the exchange of NFTs in a speculative manner.\n\n![The number of NFTs sold is roughly at the same level as it was in August and September, so the market hasn't died down as some have suggested. Credit again to @rchen8 for making such great visualizations on dune.xyz](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hldbD8u5OsZIjX5o0LxGi.png?height=560&width=1855)\n\n![The number of monthly active traders still grew over August and September, but the rate of growth has slowed considerably. August was a very explosive month, and it appears that we're at an inflection point where the onboarding of new users is slowing down.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6BapMBJMIRCm6P61LozE8.png?height=563&width=1853)\n\nThe fact that the onboarding of new users has slowed down considerably since September tells me that we may have reached a local high in new users in the NFT market, and without new catalysts we could see a strong contraction throughout November as those who have risked too much money start to flee and sell their NFTs for rock bottom prices. I don’t think this will happen with every project, but for “speculative” projects, or projects that are new, unproven, or otherwise incapable of massive growth in the face of strong headwinds, I predict that these projects will likely see precipitous drops in floor prices over the coming weeks until some new NFT narrative emerges.\n\nNow, it’s important to state here that I don’t think most projects are going to die completely, but I do foresee a strong consolidation around the projects whose floor prices have held steady during the last few weeks. I could easily imagine lots of people selling off their riskier NFT bets and consolidating their ETH around more “proven” projects as stores of value, at least for the next several weeks.\n\n\n---\n\nOf course, this isn’t 2017 - crypto truly has gone mainstream. In the United States you cannot avoid crypto advertisement, and the growth of centralized exchanges such as FTX, Coinbase, and Crypto.com have proven that millions of new users are being onboarded into the crypto world, and oftentimes NFTs are their first destination. FTX.us has released a centralized NFT exchange that supports both Solana (their poster child blockchain project supported by the CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried) and Ethereum, however their collections and offerings are slim at this point. Go to [their website](www.ftx.com/nfts) and search for some of your favorite projects; you’re unlikely to find most of them, as I was. This, coupled with the regulatory uncertainty in the USA regarding the asset class of NFTs and tax implications could mean that fewer people are willing to speculate on them.\n\nIn my crypto social circle, we’ve all had the realization that spending 0.1 ETH sounds like a minor purchase, but spending $400 is a pretty major purchase. The fact that new users who have never held crypto before see the entry price to NFTs, and the thought of spending hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of dollars on an image (no matter how cool it looks) may sound absurd. Furthermore, the huge price tag combined with high gas fees may be the one-two punch needed to prevent new users from entering the space. And then, finally, those who have an appetite for risk may have found something a bit juicier to bite into. Let’s discuss the recent elephant in the room: memecoins.\n\n\n---\n\nDOGE has been around for almost 8 years now, and like clockwork it would start pumping from a floor of 15-25 satoshis up to anywhere from 50-300 sats, followed by a 100% retrace to find itself back on the floor between 15-25 sats. This has happened at least 10 times since its inception, but something changed in January during the GameStop short squeeze hype when Elon Musk started tweeting about memecoins. Huge numbers of small retail investors enabled by trading apps such as RobinHood were able to buy DOGE with their cell phones and watch it pump well over 1000x from the bottom. Elon did his part pumping the coin, but eventually stopped tweeting and the price plummeted (albeit not down to the original floor).\n\n![DOGE has had consistent reliable pumps for almost 7 years, until Elon Musk started tweeting about it regularly in January 2021.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4eVhzWdzU3ybUifDKfYUG.png?height=1840&width=3187)\n\nHowever, the appetite for memecoins didn’t disappear once DOGE crashed. Other coins - mostly named after types of dogs - started pumping in its wake. Retail investors hoping to catch another massive pump piled into the trade. Encouraged by Twitter and Reddit users, they drove the price of one coin in particular (SHIB) through the roof, resulting in a gain of nearly 115,000,000% in less than a year.\n\n![Shiba Inu (SHIB) has pumped over 115 million percent in 11 months. $1 invested in December 2020 is currently worth over $2 million right now. Yes, that math is correct.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RwGPijZghdt_8V_r0JWaT.png?height=86&width=607)\n\nSHIB started pumping again about a month ago, and the hype train kicked back into maximum gear and SHIB pumped over 1000% (a “mere” 9x return on investment) in the last month alone. Technical analysis on memecoins is often futile as the meme narrative and fomo render many technical indicators pointless, but it appears that SHIB has found a (local) top and is in the process of retracing. For a few days, people started chasing other dog and animal-related coins, but those seem to have fizzled out as of recently.\n\n![SHIB made a phenomental comeback but appears to have hit its upper limits, and will likely retrace significantly in the coming weeks unless some new meme narrative takes hold again.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_6sotFxMHMKZREv4N1hog.png?height=1840&width=3187)\n\nAll of this happened while people started to wonder if their NFTs were ever going to pump again, and we saw some massive fire sales across various NFT projects as people piled into the SHIB trade hoping to get a few extra multiples out of their investment.\n\nHowever, there was one MAJOR event in crypto that went virtually unnoticed in the last week that also likely has been playing a role (albeit in the background amidst the noise): Ethereum hit a new all-time high price of approximately $4450 before slightly retracing to test its former ATH at $4200 as support, where it sits now. The increase in price in Ethereum is also likely drawing people away from riskier bets such as NFTs and back into spot and future trades.\n\n![ETH is currently testing support at $4200 and could potentially see a big run if it breaks to the upside.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/casrQUxaHLEVrWEg_SYkP.png?height=1840&width=3187)\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty around the long-term viability of various NFTs that people blindly aped into chasing massive short-term profits, coupled with a new gamble for high multiples in SHIB, against a rising ETH price testing new all-time highs, has likely been a one-two-three punch to NFTs as they sit at historically high prices and volumes. At this point of a major asset rally, people start to wonder what’s going to happen next and look for various options “just in case,” which is what I suspect has happened here in the last few weeks.\n\n\n---\n\nSo as we’ve seen, NFTs are still at all-time high volumes and customer levels, but various other distractions, headwinds (gas prices), and uncertainties seem to have dissuaded people from continuing to gamble in the space for now. Therefore, I only have one piece of advice: decouple yourself emotionally from your NFTs. Be willing to cut them loose if you’re sitting on profits (or at a loss already) and regroup your funds and prepare for the next phase of the market, which could include an ETH breakout, or worse: an ETH ATH fakeout followed by a retest of earlier support and prolonged sideways ranging while the market decides how bullish it really is.\n\nStay safe out there, continuously take profits, and don’t get too emotionally invested in your NFTs. If you like looking at them that much, you can always right-click save for later! :)", "timestamp": 1635724336, "digest": "BWWmOmvR-mhKeuHmotFsYX_2-C_fRs9rX8kTuGK7U_w", "contributor": "0x940653d9C5076d2FDfd44F7BC8e66aeb5Fb598BE"}

The increase in price in Ethereum is also likely drawing people away from riskier bets such as NFTs and back into spot and future trades.\n\n![ETH is currently testing support at $4200 and could potentially see a big run if it breaks to the upside.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/casrQUxaHLEVrWEg_SYkP.png?height=1840&width=3187)\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty around the long-term viability of various NFTs that people blindly aped into chasing massive short-term profits, coupled with a new gamble for high multiples in SHIB, against a rising ETH price testing new all-time highs, has likely been a one-two-three punch to NFTs as they sit at historically high prices and volumes.

Therefore, I only have one piece of advice: decouple yourself emotionally from your NFTs. Be willing to cut them loose if you’re sitting on profits (or at a loss already) and regroup your funds and prepare for the next phase of the market, which could include an ETH breakout, or worse: an ETH ATH fakeout followed by a retest of earlier support and prolonged sideways ranging while the market decides how bullish it really is.\n\nStay safe out there, continuously take profits, and don’t get too emotionally invested in your NFTs.

{"id": "wv3erxi96YEPZwIy6PhviUuKNJ-NexpjWkU1WzXVNvs", "title": "NFT Summary Sunday - 31 October 2021", "body": "If you’ve been paying attention to NFTs in the last week, you might have noticed that… uh, well… people kind of aren’t buying anything and prices are either “dipping,” “dunking,” or in full-blown “collapse.” This is due to many factors, one of the more obvious being that ETH gas prices have remained extremely high (between $150-200 for a single ERC token transaction) for a long time, giving speculators and collectors few opportunities to mint or transact at an affordable price. This, combined with the resurgence of meme tokens such as $SHIB have led to network congestion, capital flight towards more optimistic assets, and an oversaturation of NFT projects launching in the last month or so have contributed to this precipitous drop in prices and volumes.\n\nSince this is the dominant story of the last week, I figured today was a good day to dive into some of the analytics to determine exactly what happened, where the money has gone, and if there’s any hope in the near-term for NFTs (there is, I promise).\n\n\n---\n\nFirst of all, let’s look at overall volume on OpenSea. Remember, even though plenty of other NFT platforms across various blockchains exist, OpenSea accounts for the overwhelming majority.\n\n![OpenSea daily volume is a the lowest point since July 2021. Credit to @rchen8 for the chart.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D17ucMwgGb4ZloL4stdKZ.png?height=557&width=1855)\n\nFirst of all, OS daily volume is at the lowest point since July 2021 indicating that even though awareness of NFTs is at an all-time high, the number of people speculating on their price is at a long-time low. The important question is, why is this? The first thing people often point to is ETH’s insane gas prices lately. Let’s take a look at recent ETH gas prices to see if this lines up.\n\n![ETH gas prices have slowly risen since August, with noticeable spikes in gas prices attributed to spikes in OS volume, with the exception of the past 15 days or so.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nCRR4apaVTCkuknjht-L_.png?height=876&width=2032)\n\nWe can see noticeable patterns between gas prices and OS volume since the beginning of August, but sometime around mid-October we start to see a divergence. Gas prices continued to climb during this period, but OS volume dropped off a cliff. However, we see that the second half of August experienced a massive rise in both gas prices *and* OS volume, so this indicates to me that gas prices alone can’t explain the massive selloff. People were obviously willing to pay hundreds of dollars for gas in August, so why aren’t they willing to do the same now?\n\nOne might postulate that the NFT world is oversaturated with mints, airdrops, and new drops that have led to less concentration of attention and therefore less concentrated volume around hyped projects. When there’s so much to choose from, as everybody diversifies into various projects there might not be enough volume to sustain the meteoric rises in prices that we saw in August and September. However, we’ve seen projects like CrypToadz, Jungle Freaks, Lazy Lions, CyberKongz, and numerous other projects sustain strong upwards price action, so obviously there is still appetite for risk in the market.\n\nHowever, are there fewer participants in the market? Is that why most projects are seeing massive declines in floor prices? Well, as you can see below, the number of monthly active traders on OpenSea is at an all time high, and the number of NFTs sold is roughly the same as it was 2 months ago, so this tells me a few things:\n\n1. There are still many new players entering the NFT space, so we’re not seeing a mass exodus from the market, and\n2. The number of transactions is still high, indicating that people are still flipping and participating in the exchange of NFTs in a speculative manner.\n\n![The number of NFTs sold is roughly at the same level as it was in August and September, so the market hasn't died down as some have suggested. Credit again to @rchen8 for making such great visualizations on dune.xyz](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hldbD8u5OsZIjX5o0LxGi.png?height=560&width=1855)\n\n![The number of monthly active traders still grew over August and September, but the rate of growth has slowed considerably. August was a very explosive month, and it appears that we're at an inflection point where the onboarding of new users is slowing down.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6BapMBJMIRCm6P61LozE8.png?height=563&width=1853)\n\nThe fact that the onboarding of new users has slowed down considerably since September tells me that we may have reached a local high in new users in the NFT market, and without new catalysts we could see a strong contraction throughout November as those who have risked too much money start to flee and sell their NFTs for rock bottom prices. I don’t think this will happen with every project, but for “speculative” projects, or projects that are new, unproven, or otherwise incapable of massive growth in the face of strong headwinds, I predict that these projects will likely see precipitous drops in floor prices over the coming weeks until some new NFT narrative emerges.\n\nNow, it’s important to state here that I don’t think most projects are going to die completely, but I do foresee a strong consolidation around the projects whose floor prices have held steady during the last few weeks. I could easily imagine lots of people selling off their riskier NFT bets and consolidating their ETH around more “proven” projects as stores of value, at least for the next several weeks.\n\n\n---\n\nOf course, this isn’t 2017 - crypto truly has gone mainstream. In the United States you cannot avoid crypto advertisement, and the growth of centralized exchanges such as FTX, Coinbase, and Crypto.com have proven that millions of new users are being onboarded into the crypto world, and oftentimes NFTs are their first destination. FTX.us has released a centralized NFT exchange that supports both Solana (their poster child blockchain project supported by the CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried) and Ethereum, however their collections and offerings are slim at this point. Go to [their website](www.ftx.com/nfts) and search for some of your favorite projects; you’re unlikely to find most of them, as I was. This, coupled with the regulatory uncertainty in the USA regarding the asset class of NFTs and tax implications could mean that fewer people are willing to speculate on them.\n\nIn my crypto social circle, we’ve all had the realization that spending 0.1 ETH sounds like a minor purchase, but spending $400 is a pretty major purchase. The fact that new users who have never held crypto before see the entry price to NFTs, and the thought of spending hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of dollars on an image (no matter how cool it looks) may sound absurd. Furthermore, the huge price tag combined with high gas fees may be the one-two punch needed to prevent new users from entering the space. And then, finally, those who have an appetite for risk may have found something a bit juicier to bite into. Let’s discuss the recent elephant in the room: memecoins.\n\n\n---\n\nDOGE has been around for almost 8 years now, and like clockwork it would start pumping from a floor of 15-25 satoshis up to anywhere from 50-300 sats, followed by a 100% retrace to find itself back on the floor between 15-25 sats. This has happened at least 10 times since its inception, but something changed in January during the GameStop short squeeze hype when Elon Musk started tweeting about memecoins. Huge numbers of small retail investors enabled by trading apps such as RobinHood were able to buy DOGE with their cell phones and watch it pump well over 1000x from the bottom. Elon did his part pumping the coin, but eventually stopped tweeting and the price plummeted (albeit not down to the original floor).\n\n![DOGE has had consistent reliable pumps for almost 7 years, until Elon Musk started tweeting about it regularly in January 2021.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4eVhzWdzU3ybUifDKfYUG.png?height=1840&width=3187)\n\nHowever, the appetite for memecoins didn’t disappear once DOGE crashed. Other coins - mostly named after types of dogs - started pumping in its wake. Retail investors hoping to catch another massive pump piled into the trade. Encouraged by Twitter and Reddit users, they drove the price of one coin in particular (SHIB) through the roof, resulting in a gain of nearly 115,000,000% in less than a year.\n\n![Shiba Inu (SHIB) has pumped over 115 million percent in 11 months. $1 invested in December 2020 is currently worth over $2 million right now. Yes, that math is correct.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RwGPijZghdt_8V_r0JWaT.png?height=86&width=607)\n\nSHIB started pumping again about a month ago, and the hype train kicked back into maximum gear and SHIB pumped over 1700% (a “mere” 16x return on investment) in the last 2 months alone. Technical analysis on memecoins is often futile as the meme narrative and fomo render many technical indicators pointless, but it appears that SHIB has found a (local) top and is in the process of retracing. For a few days, people started chasing other dog and animal-related coins, but those seem to have fizzled out as of recently.\n\n![SHIB made a phenomental comeback but appears to have hit its upper limits, and will likely retrace significantly in the coming weeks unless some new meme narrative takes hold again.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_6sotFxMHMKZREv4N1hog.png?height=1840&width=3187)\n\nAll of this happened while people started to wonder if their NFTs were ever going to pump again, and we saw some massive fire sales across various NFT projects as people piled into the SHIB trade hoping to get a few extra multiples out of their investment.\n\nHowever, there was one MAJOR event in crypto that went virtually unnoticed in the last week that also likely has been playing a role (albeit in the background amidst the noise): Ethereum hit a new all-time high price of approximately $4450 before slightly retracing to test its former ATH at $4200 as support, where it sits now.

**1、怎么翻墙?**\n\n——注意，翻墙只能用来学习研究，本教程内容来自公开网络，仅供学习参考。翻墙后如果做任何违法或违背公序良俗的事情，会被法律追究！\n\n在币圈，目前所有活动都需要翻墙，其原理就是通过访问一个中间商，来访问原本你不能访问的网站，因此必须格外注意信息安全，不要下载来源不明的翻墙软件链接——那很有可能是病毒木马。下面给出参考方案：\n\n首先，免费下载蓝灯：<https://github.com/getlantern/lantern>\n\n如果打不开就多试几次，在页面中有手机和电脑版下载，安装后可使用。免费版有500M流量，软件并不好用，不要付费！\n\n蓝灯作为一个过渡，让自己能上网，此时，可以访问我们真正需要的软件ASTRILL，大名鼎鼎，几百个不同国家的服务器，速度极快，大多数时候能达到100M的网速。同时功能强大、隐私性高、安全性好——不容易被追踪IP。其缺点是费用较高，一年120U。\n\n点击\\*\\*[ASTRILL](https://www.astrill.com/a/1aybs3uewtgc)\\*\\*访问，注意，必须翻墙才能打开。\n\n如果你嫌贵，可以直接翻看本文底部加入电报的方式，在电报群中向网友们询问他们使用的各类工具，其中很多很便宜，但是要谨慎点击陌生人的链接——这个我没有办法帮你分辨，请自己小心鉴别。\n\n                                                            **2、手机如何下载币圈APP？**\n\n下载币圈APP最好的方法是，访问所需要APP的官网，但如何找到正确的官网？请大家记下网址<https://www.coingecko.com/zh>\n\n上面的网址大家可以搜索访问你需要的任何交易所、币种等等，类似非小号，但更强大，更专业，更及时，推荐！\n\n打不开请翻墙。\n\n很多时候，一些官网没有放APK下载链接，只有去谷歌商店下载的提示，这时就会有一个问题，国内的手机，小米之类得安装谷歌框架才能访问，而华为手机直接无法安装手机框架，那么怎么办呢？\n\n直接访问<https://apkcombo.com/zh/> 或[apkpure.com](http://apkpure.com/)就可以搜索下载你需要的任何APK文件最新版了，两个网站我主要用前者。注意，仍然需要翻墙。\n\n注册完后，必备的软件先下载几个，比如：tradingview和Google 身份验证器。前者是世界第一的行情软件；后者是必备的安全令，注册各类交易所之类都需要用到。当然，还有twitter、telegram都是必备的了。\n\n苹果手机的话更麻烦一些，要么是注册一个香港APPSTORE的帐号，要么就是下载TESTFLIGHT版本，经常掉线；要么就是换手机了，混币圈还是得用安卓，苹果太不方便。\n\n**3.怎么注册google帐号？**\n\n在我们注册交易所和各类软件时，大多数时候都需要用到邮箱，而且往往国内邮箱已经无法注册，那么我强烈推荐GOOGLE邮箱。\n\n有了GOOGLE帐号可以方便地一键登录GOOGLE全线产品和N多网站，非常方便。包括谷歌的CHROME浏览器，都是一键登录，安装钱包插件，自动记录帐号密码等都非常棒，省心。\n\n注册网址是\\*\\*[mail.google.com](http://mail.google.com/)**，你也可以直接访问**[www.google.com](http://www.google.com)\\*\\*，都是一样的，邮箱无非是单独设置你想要的邮箱地址。\n\n注册方法可以参照[“这里”](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/180329217)。\n\nGoogle邮箱网友测试好像已经不支持国内手机，可以淘宝10元买一个国外的手机注册，注册后更换绑定后机号至国内手机！\n\n实在搞不定也可以尝试使用MSN邮箱，网址是：<https://outlook.live.com/owa/>\n\n**4、如何注册币安、OKEX和FTX**\n\n现在的世界第一、第二、第三交易所均可以一直继续使用，而且均在海外，不用担心数据被监管或泄露,三大所各有特点:\n\n\\*\\*币安：\\*\\*世界第一大所，最为均衡，我个人使用最多，也推荐所有人必备。（网址：<https://www.binance.com/zh-CN> 邀请码RWIMTPK2 永久省20%手续费）此处为简介，后方有详细方法。\n\n\\*\\*OKEX：\\*\\*老牌大所，出海之后会有更大发展，我一般出入金在OKEX，同时推荐关注OKB和OKT。（网址：<https://www.okex.com/>

APP，第二次再点就可以入群了。\n\n个别同学出现的提示说只能双向聊天之类，这主要是对中国手机号码的限制，可以点此阅读“[教程](https://www.mosq.cn/post-585.html)”解决。\n\n注意，我同步开通了电报的广播频道，类似于微信禁言群，但比禁言群高级：一是可以回看我的所有重要信息，二是还可以对我的信息进行评论。\n\n进禁言频道链接：**[0.puls/btcdayu2](http://0.puls/btcdayu2)**\n\n**第二种、翻墙后使用官方电报（推荐）**\n\n如果你是高阶用户，想体验原版电报，可以参考如下教程：\n\n第一步，翻墙，参照本文第一部分内容。\n\n第二步，访问电报官网，下载需要的客户端，我一般习惯用WINDOWS电脑使用，手机版也可以同样下载。\n\n[https://telegram.org/](https://telegram.org/)\n\n第三步，翻译电报。\n\n电报安装好之后是英文的，使用上多有不便，如果需要使用中文，则可以直接将下面链接复制到电报的聊天框——任何频道、任何人的聊天框均可，然后点击此链接即变换为纯中文：\n\ntg://setlanguage?lang=zhcncc\n\n如果无效，直接在搜索栏输入@zh_cn 按提示操作即可。\n\n官方电报进群，可以直接在浏览器打开以下网址，会自动切换到电报进群：\n\n[https://t.me/dayu222  （交流群）](https://t.me/dayu222)\n\n[https://t.me/BTCdayu2（禁言群）](https://t.me/BTCdayu999)\n\n[https://t.me/dayu999

{"id": "svHepoEU_oXTLSuFgc09Af4gvIhdtbGjTGWkVnv_m9k", "title": "Opinion: Don't Sleep on Polar Culture", "body": "Polar Culture Collective: created by Marshmello, an impressive roster of artists and its discreet branding attracts attention from the offset.\n\nThe collective appears to be more than just a record label when digging in. At first glance, you see a sold out merch line, discreet branding and links to all of its artists’ social media pages. Combined with making conclusions from Marshmello’s passion for pseudonymity and dabbling in crypto, you can begin to think there’s another play here.\n\nThe site’s discreetness and structure alludes that all members are equal vs Marshmello being the leader of group. The style of music members have produced in the past show a willingness to connect with their fanbases, and the ability to relate to struggles that many people are going through, but don’t have the confidence or an audience to share with.\n\nA voice for the voiceless. \n\n\n---\n\nModern hip-hop is blending between a variety of its past sub-genres. More and more, mental health is common theme that is found in many records. It is something that people are more comfortable sharing as the world moves forward. \n\nA few examples of this are popular artists’ associations (directly or indirectly) with Soundcloud’s emo-rap scene, Travis Barker’s resurgence, Chicago’s drill artists’ evolution into the mainstream, and a specific example, DaBaby’s recent record with Lil Wayne.\n\nWhether it’s taking a Xanax to calm down, remembering ones lost, or articulating the personal struggles artists have gone through, this message resonates with many who are still finding their way.\n\nThe thing that makes Polar Culture more interesting than the standard record label, is its potential to associate with its fanbase in a more powerful online community. \n\nOne of the definitions for polar is being directly opposite. Past methods of gathering online attention were based on passive consumer consumption, and creators developing massive amounts of content in hopes of being discovered on streaming platforms. This method of discovery is highly dependent on the platforms’ sharing algorithms, which are developed with the platform in mind, not the creator. \n\nWhile there were successful examples of artists building communities through these channels, Oliver Francis being a great one, this isn’t optimized for the future.\n\n\n---\n\nFuture methods of attention gathering are moving towards active consumer consumption, engagement and participation. This method enables the consumer to engage and discover new content more organically, and feel more in control of what they’re consuming on a regular basis.\n\nIt also gives the creators (especially those up and coming) more control, as they don’t feel the need to put out content to stay relevant on the various sharing platforms’ algorithms.\n\nSoundcloud was a massive platform for artists to connect, collaborate and eventually produce some of the groundwork the industry is building upon today. New community driven platforms provide artists a way to create meaningful communities online according to their own rules.\n\nSuch platforms, like Discord, can bridge the gap between artist-to-fan and fan-to-fan interaction. This interaction aggressively earns a consumer’s attention and produces more engagement within the collective. \n  \n With the future of online attention moving from passive to aggressive, groups like Polar Culture can leverage this to create even more relevancy than they would *solely* using traditional methods. \n\n\n---\n\nFor example, let’s say Lil Dusty G was releasing a song on December 31st. Members of the community could be invited to a listening party the night of December 30th. While there are risks associated with this, there are potential monetization methods the collective could employ to make this worthwhile. \n\nAs mentioned, in communities like Discord, [you create your own rules](https://discord.com/blog/best-practices-for-starting-a-great-community-on-discord). Let’s say there are 100,000 members of the community; a listening party for everyone involved wouldn’t be much different from announcing the song’s release on instagram.\n\nBut, let’s say the listening party was for members who have a participation level of X, and also have previously verified that they purchased Polar Culture merch. The reward for active engagement is access to the listening party. \n\nAs other members see this type of engagement being rewarded, they’re incentivized to give more attention to the group and participate more often. Let’s say participation can be defined as engaging in community message boards, sharing songs on social media, or pre-ordering merch. This results in merch drops being consistently profitable, organic artist promotion, and a stronger digital brand for the collective.\n\nNews then spreads about the strength of the community and then drives more community membership, participation and eventual revenue streams for the collective. Again, this is all done organically and independent of streaming platforms, and keeps the collective, its creators and its community first.\n\n\n---\n\nI don’t know if Polar Culture intends to go in this direction, and I believe they’ll be a success independent of any decision regarding this.\n\nBut, given the assumptions made earlier, it certainly could be a possibility. NFT’s, online communities and people’s desire to be a part of something in the digital world is creating an opportunity for groups to effectively earn their audience’s attention. This attention is much more valuable than it has been in the past.\n\nMy inclination to believe that Polar Culture has the ability and desire to provide this level of engagement stems from content in its members’ previous releases.\n\nExamples being Lil Dusty G’s latest release, [Preached](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Gox2FHWcB882eGsRIkdrt?si=90f3145634c049f0), Munk’s Crown The Empire’s first hit [Voices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyEO8wgsQBM), and Marshmello’s [collaboration](https://open.spotify.com/track/6VrCmhRBFnuGKmtNfk4jDs?si=502dc504550d4c36) with the late Lil Peep. People resonate with this type of music, especially in their darkest moments.\n\nAnd those are the moments we need community the most.", "timestamp": 1635728516, "digest": "lvFrac2dRxeSrG_C-5TNyOm1N-icKp96paYa01tnDZg", "contributor": "0xa32D089F144e613106072fE2Ec4FF2ff95b7606D"}

And the scariest. I know it sounds stupid and indulgent to say that, especially coming from another hetero-normative dude in black Christian Diors like me. (Whatever, they were knock-offs.) But given the extraordinary features of this interaction, along with its consequences for how people think of themselves, I really don’t think it’s an exaggeration. All of this is true by the way. I don’t have the time to make any of this up, and frankly I sucked pretty bad in Language Arts. My grade-school teachers will bug out if they read this.**\n\n**My band was doing a show in Salt Lake City–you know, Mormon utopia in the middle of the desert. Our next gig in Boise had been cancelled for reasons we didn’t entirely understand. When you’re on the road you just kind of run with things, I guess. We decided to hang out in Utah for a couple of days. Somebody said we could “backpack in the watercolor meadows of the Uintahs”. Sounded like a good time. We do retrowave electronica stuff, lots of synthy sounds with flashing lights and voice effects. Everyone’s into the eighties again, even the Mormons it turns out.**\n\n**I still don’t think of myself as a hook-up guy, even after all these years on the road. I’m serious. It’s not something I enjoy or even particularly like. I see hook-ups as one of the rites of being a traveling musician, or maybe even a curse. It’s like how prime ministers have to shake hands with people they don’t necessarily like. I’m a reluctant diplomat of the grunge scene. Everything that guys like David Bowie did make total sense to me. They turned their lives upside-down just to try and find something real. I wonder if they ever found it–when I did, it scared the crap out of me.**\n\n**The first Tinder girl I met in Utah was one of those “it’s for a good cause”-type chicks. I’m not trying to offend anybody, it’s just the only way I can think to describe her. What annoys me about those girls is that they all have the same personality. They’re almost breathless to prove how angry they are about all the *right* things. It makes me feel like everything I know is wrong or something. You just sit there and listen and drown in their syndicated outrage. I swiped right for shallow reasons, yes. The messed-up thing is that I anticipated my annoyance as I glanced at her pics. I was shamelessly undeterred.**\n\n**Her peach spaghetti-strap top swallowed most of my attention, even as she soliloquized about non binary love and dying pandas. (OK, I made that last one up.) Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail. It was less a conversation and more a kind of reciting on her part–anyone could’ve been sitting in front of her. I wonder if she would’ve acted differently if she knew who I was. A few hours later, I finished softly somewhere in the bobbing bramble of hair in my lap. It was depressing. She fixed her ponytail in the mirror, checked her phone, then quickly left.**\n\n**I don’t usually let people get to know me too well, not even my bandmates. I mean we drop acid together sometimes, bro-bonding stuff, that kind of thing. That’s about it. Even with girls, I’m a sex-in-the-dark kind of dude. They probably think I’m weird but I never ask. When the peach-top pedant was leaving I gave her one of our albums on cassette tape. It was awkward (“Uh, thanks…?”) but I feel like it’s the best I can do.**\n\n**Somewhere in the discussion of her saintly works, she had mentioned something her uncle had seen in a mall near downtown Salt Lake City. It was like an upright human with amphibian skin or something. Her uncle was a janitor who cleaned floors there late at night. The thing had come out of a basement stairwell, looked at him for a moment, then turned right back around and disappeared. The really crazy thing was that her uncle said he felt some kind of emotion deep in his chest that he never felt before, sort of like how you feel when you lock eyes with a stranger that looks inexplicably familiar. She reported all of this as a joke, rattling it off at blinding speed in her machine-gun dialogue of goodspeak. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, though, even when we started making out.**\n\n**The guys in our band like to joke about the golden thumb–it’s when you start a streak of matching with the city’s hottest women. That’s millennial serendipity at its finest. Isaac had the golden thumb in Topeka and we didn’t see him until Michigan, but in Michigan the algorithms failed him. It works in mysterious ways. When I matched with this Clarissa girl from Provo, I decided Salt Lake City *was* a promised land, or at least my own Topeka. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, nor has that condition of not-knowing changed. But let me back up...**\n\n**Clarissa was one of those one-pic profiles, which is risky. You’re betting that this single picture is so alluring that the opposite swiper needs no further proof of your hotness. In her case, it was a win. She was wearing a black romper striped orange, yellow, green; her hair was blue and cut boyishly short. The obligatory septum piercing made her nose look like a jewelled accessory. Style, attitude, cuteness. Bad-ass but delicate. The interesting part: the picture wasn’t a picture but actually a moving boomerang, one of those images perpetually repeating two seconds of movement.**\n\n**The boomerang showed Clarissa from behind, jogging in-place on a sidewalk with her face looking coyly back into the camera. I don’t need to mention the advantages such an angle affords those of the requisite affinities–but there was something else. Something *else.* There looked to be a kind of independent movement beneath the fabric around her tailbone, like an appendage that was rising and falling as she ran. You could *just* make out the outline. It couldn’t be…**\n\n**I put my phone away and started pumping some beat-mixes to get my mind straight. Things couldn’t be *that* freaky in Utah. My headphones weren’t loud enough to block out the image. The thing that bothered me most was that my attraction to her hadn’t waned; if anything, I felt *more* attracted. Had I been watching too many shapeshifter animes? That was probably the case regardless.**\n\n**Even so, there was no doubt that Clarissa’s festive romper was hiding a full-grown tail–like, none at all.  I watched the boomerang over and over again, turning my phone this way and that. There was no other conclusion. I considered calling my bandmates for brotherly support but in the end opted for privacy. Imagine if they heard I was seeing a girl with a *tail.* Literally a tail dangling down her rear. Her caption read: “Wyoming-raised, Utah-grown. I don’t want to go to Paris or Prague. Take me to a hidden place we can share secrets.” It was just too much.**\n\n**The first time I met Clarissa it was somewhere near State St. It’s hard for me to keep track of the roads because they’re all numbered on a grid based on their proximity to the Mormon temple. Clarissa told me that this system makes it easier to get around and not get lost. She laughed when I disagreed. We ate vegan wraps in one of those generic Salt Lake plazas made of Mexican eateries and Asian stores. Clarissa explained that she ate healthy when it suited her schedule and mood, which made her “a seasonal vegan”. It was summertime in Salt Lake; she wore a dirty-green tank-top and gray denim shorts ripped across the thighs; her hair was bluer than Freddie Mercury’s stage lighting.**\n\n**She was one of those girls who was easy to talk to, but from whom you couldn’t allow your attention to waver. Clarissa was no prolific talker. Instead I got a watchful loner vibe, someone you’d see walking along deserted railroad tracks, someone who considered Bjork their private therapist. I kept imagining how I could bring the topic up without coming across as a total creep. “I didn’t know people in Utah had tails...is that common here?” Gross. Maybe something more personal. “That romper you had on does a lot for your tail.” God, no. I settled on: “Can you show me that running move from your profile?”**\n\n**We were walking along the sidewalks in the glow of the street lamps; night had fallen on the strange city made of numbers. Clarissa’s hand was clasped softly in mine. I kept resisting the temptation to look behind her like an idiot. She was pressing me with questions somewhat absently. When I told her my band’s name was Nineteeneightyfornicate, she lost it and started going through all of our pictures on Instagram. That name was Isaac’s idea, not mine! It did have a nice ring to it.**\n\n**She stopped walking and turned on me suddenly.**\n\n**“You know, don’t you?”**\n\n**“Know–know what?” I stammered lamely.**\n\n**“Oh come off the bullshit, man. You’ve known this whole time.” Staring me frankly in the eyes, she took my hand and ran it along something long, firm, cylindrical on her backside. My heartbeat quickened and a soft moan emitted from my throat. Clarissa giggled and threw my hand away.**\n\n**“Any secrets you’d like to share with me?”**\n\n**I looked at her for a second, processing. “I already told you my dirty band name–”**\n\n**“Right,” she scoffed. “I hope you come up with something better by tomorrow.”**\n\n**She turned and began receding into the jasmine-bordered shadows. I realized that we had been surrounded by cats ever since we started walking. They now trailed her in unison like a row of ducklings down the sidewalk.**\n\n**“I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE A CAT PERSON!” I yelled hopelessly.**\n\n**She laughed and raised a long middle finger into the air without turning around. I sighed and began walking in the other direction back to my hotel. I opened my phone to a new text message from Clarissa. It didn’t say anything; she’d only sent three cat emojis with their tails in the air. I marveled at how little I knew what in the hell was going on. *I just stroked a human tail. That really happened.* And yet, perversely, I couldn’t wait for the next day.**\n\n***....Any secrets you’d like to share with me…***\n\n**I’ll come clean–that night wasn’t the first time I googled “humans with tails”. There had been drunken nights alone that I obsessed over the idea. My thoughts were ransacked by half-humanoids risen from primordial tetrapods, dripping with sea-foam and tails dragging in the sand. I told you I was a weird guy. To this point, the greatest harm all this had done was butcher my online algorithms–I would get ads for kinky Halloween costumes, which routinely raised some eyebrows.**\n\n***She could be a government spy on some troll-job,* I thought to myself. The idea tormented me for several hours. What was worse, I thought, the CIA using search history and store-bought accessories to play with my mind, or the possibility that I had met some kind of hybrid human with a rope of flesh swinging from her backside? The little bit of ganja I had left made my speculations thicker and more confusing. She had to be real. Why would the government waste time mind-fucking a guy from a band named Nineteeneightyfornicate? I went from that to wondering what she ate when she was stoned.**\n\n**Before I knew it, I was stepping out onto the curb in front of her house in my black knock-off Christian Diors. Who was this profane intruder in Provo? An agent *provo*cateur, I grinned to myself. I didn’t know there could be neighborhoods with trees in the desert. Seemed like the Mormons were pretty good landscapers when they weren’t busy granting all their wives eternal life. Who knew! Clarissa lived in a blue house with a quaint little front porch, one of those places that really has the picture-book mailbox with a perfect red lever pointed upwards.**\n\n**“Were you tailing me earlier?”**\n\n**Clarissa’s voice came out of nowhere, disembodied. I looked around me wildly, my unease ratcheting up several notches. A hand rested on my shoulder from behind; I wheeled around.**\n\n**“Chill out, freak,” Clarissa laughed. She looked at the tree next to her, brushing off some twigs. “My nest is up *there*.”**\n\n**“Your–nest?”**\n\n**“It’s a joke, heard of those before?”**\n\n**I suddenly noticed she was wearing a yellow Walkman cassette player. We always BS that if we meet a chick with a portable cassette player, we’ll automatically drop to one knee, no questions asked.**\n\n**“So you’re that much of a dork that you listen to cassette tapes in 2020?!”**\n\n**“And you’re telling me you don’t have one on you right now?”**\n\n**Wordlessly, I raised my band’s cassette tape out of my pocket.**\n\n**“Give me that,” she laughed, snatching it out of my hand. “Maybe we *are* a match!”**\n\n**I followed her inside.**\n\n**“My roommates are out for the weekend”–glancing at the couch–”you can just shove all that shit over, sorry. We have beer, lemonade, soda...or maybe you like the harder stuff?”**\n\n**I settled in and tried to relax, taking in what was around me. Nothing odd really. There was a crystal salt lamp whose warm glow looked afloat in the dim room. I could faintly sniff sage. A white cat met my gaze and darted out of sight, desperate to be forgotten.**\n\n**“You don’t get many visit–”**\n\n**The sentence was robbed from my throat. Clarissa was putting a glass of Jack Daniels on the table, naked beside the burgundy lingerie faintly interrupting her skin. I could see the thing in plain sight–it was moving from side to side in a sort of carefree, feline attitude, *curling* back on itself this way and that, hairless and freckled as it tapered to its tip. It was a magnificent tail, too magnificent to be an accident. I closed my eyes and took a shot of the Jack.**\n\n**“I know what you’re thinking,” Clarissa smiled. She sat down next to me, running her hand along my shoulder. “You’re thinking ‘it’s impossible, this can’t actually be happening.’”**\n\n**“You must be psychic,” I shot back dryly.**\n\n**“You’re thinking,” she pressed on, “that science eliminates the possibility of my existence.”**\n\n**I didn’t say anything.**\n\n**“What’s wrong, rock star, you don’t want to play along? I know that you know it all–how they say a human tail is only an abomination of the coccyx, a *vestige* of the behind that we all left behind...right?”**\n\n**“What are you getting at here, Clarissa?”**\n\n**She took a swig of lemonade and rolled the juice around her mouth, her gaze unbroken.**\n\n**“Nothing you haven’t already thought of ten thousand times, but I’ll humor you. If the only reason humans don’t have tails is because of some kind of disabled gene-signal, then the chances of more than one being on the planet is like one in billions. So if you realized there were *others like you*, that hypothesis would suddenly be on very thin ice.”**\n\n**My blood ran cold. I leaned all the way back on the sofa until my eyes were looking at the ceiling. The clustered nerve-endings were firing off in tingles that made it hard for me to resist the urge to let it squirm beneath me. All of my practiced methods for controlling the thing were failing. It was as if it somehow sensed another of its kind and now had license to awaken. She’d caught me by the tail.**\n\n**Clarissa leaned over me, her face close to mine. “Show it to me,” she whispered.**\n\n**No one had set eyes on it outside of my parents; I hadn’t seen them since they put me up for adoption. I sat up, pulled the back of my shirt up and leaned over. Her eyes felt like hot embers across its naked surface. She lifted it between her fingers, held it in her palm, caressed it. I suddenly noticed how heavily I was breathing.**\n\n**“There are many of us, you know,” she said softly.**\n\n**“How many?”**\n\n**Clarissa paused. “I don’t know, to be honest. But a lot. I met them in the genetic labs outside Salt Lake.”**\n\n**“Wait, genetic–”**\n\n**“Shhh!” She put a finger to my lips and straddled me, pulling my hands through her blue hair. “We’ll talk about it later.”**\n\n**I clutched her swaying tail and let its smoothness run through my fingers.**\n\n**“We’re a match,” she giggled, “a match made in some dirty heaven.”**\n\n**That evening, for the first time in my life, I surrendered fully to whatever it is that I am. Clarissa hasn’t left my side since; we’re in Cheyenne now. There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think: I’ve never been happier–or more deeply, inconsolably frightened.**", "timestamp": 1635732894, "digest": "56648re9YKSnaRoHNgg2OrkLba9o04K-E3bNS5Hdiqc", "contributor": "0xBbb538b84ED95aBa94585c6cE7C2f8790dBfE53B"}

科尔顿**\n\n`本期内容YouTube链接：`\n\nTBA\n\n`本期内容哔哩哔哩链接：`\n\nTBA\n\n链游经过一段时间的内卷，\n\n现在NFT、道具合成、物品租售、通证治理等要素，\n\n基本成了每个项目的标配。\n\n但与此形成鲜明对比的是，\n\n开心消消乐，微信跳一跳，飞机大战等休闲小游戏，\n\n总能填满人们公交地铁，排队等待的各种碎片时间。\n\n休闲手游之所以大行其道，\n\n原因在于其门槛低，易上手和无需了解任何复杂原理。\n\n这类游戏的生命力和商业模式也早已被市场验证。\n\n而今天我们要介绍的这款游戏：[Arc 8](https://arc8.gamee.com/)\n\n就是属于这一细分赛道。\n\n**通证：GMEE**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/md109P_Ve6o4XbUbJU-s6.png?height=250&width=512)\n\n## Arc8：一站式休闲小游戏平台\n\n### Polygon生态链游用户量排行TOP 1\n\nARC8的核心是一个集合多种休闲小游戏的一站式平台型APP，\n\n目前已上线苹果和谷歌应用商店。\n\n在我们介绍APP中的主要内容之前，\n\n不妨先看一看他在基本面上的数据表现。\n\n这款app高居Polygon的Dapp用户总量排行榜之首，\n\n并以巨大的优势领先于另一知名的赛车链游项目REVV。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2nU6qkFbq5pT8AvZVnxCm.png?height=698&width=1103)\n\n虽然以独立钱包地址总数计算用户量，\n\n存在一定的误差和水分，\n\n但是能做到某一生态中的佼佼者，\n\n就一定有我们不能忽视的过人之处。\n\n### 玩Arc8上的休闲小游戏，获得GMEE奖励\n\n玩家在应用商店下载Arc8后，\n\n就可以体验各种类型的休闲小游戏。\n\n这些休闲小游戏的具体形式我们不再逐一介绍，\n\n但它们都有共同的特点：\n\n**易于上手，目标唯一，机制简单，奖励明确。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uty9d9WTaPNQJgbwfCfku.png?height=579&width=1196)\n\n如其中的一个弹珠跑酷小游戏（上图最右），\n\n玩家手指在屏幕滑动，决定弹珠左右移动方向，\n\n躲避障碍物，吃掉增益道具，\n\n尽可能的在规定时间内让弹珠滚动更远的距离。\n\n**同时，这些游戏也有对应的奖励方式。**\n\n玩家可以选择某一游戏进行1V1对战，\n\n其中的胜出者，例如谁的弹珠滚动距离最远，\n\n就可以获得APP中的通证奖励：GMEE\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pAaeszYVRfoyds-bZ1Yb1.png?height=498&width=879)\n\n同时官方也会针对不同游戏开展锦标赛，\n\n玩家参赛需要支付GMEE，\n\n取得不同名次后会瓜分锦标赛奖金池中的GMEE。\n\n此外，对于自己游戏技术没有信心的玩家，\n\n也可以通过消耗游戏中的免费紫色水晶进行练习模式，\n\n待到熟练后也可以参与到正式的比赛中来。\n\n得益于**多样的小游戏 + 平缓的学习曲线+ 项目方的赛事运营**，\n\n玩家的实际游戏体验并不会觉得低幼和单调乏味。\n\n而当自己熟练以后再去挑战对手赢得GMEE时，\n\n这种成就感和盈利感的结合，\n\n也刺激着玩家熟悉下一款游戏并再次挑战，\n\n从而实现一种**休闲--上手--挑战--激励**的循环，\n\n也印证了Play to Earn模式的可行性。\n\n当然，对不愿意参与游戏的玩家，\n\n也可以将GMEE进行质押，从而获得一定的收益。\n\n> 当前质押活动已结束，需等待下次活动开启。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q9G3wTwugY74whKwOfk5-.png?height=705&width=1383)\n\n### NFT游戏G-BOT，独立于休闲游戏外的链游空间\n\nGMEE是Arc8的奖励通证，\n\n但却不只为Arc8这一款游戏而生。\n\n如果说上述休闲游戏主要面向非链游圈的玩家，\n\n那么除Arc8外，还有一款与NFT相关的游戏G-BOT，\n\n则是为链游圈的玩家量身定做。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AfTyTEgH4Gd4dO76-_b8e.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n这款游戏与其他NFT链游的玩法类似，\n\n玩家通过消耗GMEE购买G-BOT机器人。\n\n并通过PVE、PVP的形式完成各种任务和战役，\n\n从而获得机器人发展所需的能源通证：ET。\n\n消耗GMEE和ET能培育/升级和迭代自己的G-BOT。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q2MINsMa3X9SC9_xffwvi.png?height=1938&width=2160)\n\n同时需要注意的是，\n\n不持有NFT的玩家将无法参与该款游戏，\n\n持有G-BOT NFT的玩家也还将拥有其他Arc8内的游戏特权，\n\n比如更快的玩到新游戏和体验新功能等。\n\n虽然G-BOT游戏模式目前还没有成品，\n\n但G-BOT的NFT将于11月2日开启预售，\n\n感兴趣者也可以关注。\n\n参与链接：https://gbots.gamee.com/\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OrUQogHb2_A0U8n87S3Zx.png?height=881&width=1464)\n\n以上就是Arc8的全部内容，\n\n可以看出Arc8通过针对休闲用户和链游用户设计不同的游戏模式，\n\n从而吸收不同圈层的玩家，拓展自身的用户量。\n\n而这一策略的成功，\n\n也将仰赖于Arc8成熟的休闲游戏开发经验。\n\n## 入圈尝试，传统手游Play to Earn成功经验的复制\n\n### GAMEE+Animoca Brand, Arc8入圈的有力支撑\n\n在一些项目搜索引擎中，\n\n我们可以看到Arc8后面还有一个GAMEE字样。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/95g89jlp_ZTSq65gV-_uP.png?height=55&width=1078)\n\n**实际上GAMEE是一家成立于2015年的捷克游戏公司，**\n\n其开发的手机休闲游戏应用Prize已有3000万活跃用户。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/81702bCExeH9ebTMfHlNV.png?height=412&width=790)\n\n**该公司在2021年被Animoca Brand 以800万美金的价格收购**，成为其子公司。\n\n二者的结合，\n\n在保证游戏品质的情况下，\n\n也为Arc8注入了链游圈的资源和人脉。\n\n这也将成为Arc8后续发展的重要潜力之一。\n\n### PRIZE APP：传统手游市场Play to Earn的成功经验\n\nGAMEE在被Animoca收购之前，\n\n打造了一款名为Prize的边玩边赚型游戏平台，\n\n内容与Arc8大体相同。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SFNU2EsvAet0aZUJO5jyG.png?height=706&width=1556)\n\n在Prize中，\n\n玩家通过玩小游戏获取法币（如美元）奖励，\n\n而奖励的来源则是app 内的广告投放收入。\n\n通过将部分广告收入划为奖金池，\n\n激励用户游玩并赢得奖金，\n\n从而提升了APP的活跃度。\n\n而活跃度的提升，也将进一步让app获得更多的曝光量和广告收入。\n\n**Prize的这种循环形成了一种play to earn的良性商业模式。**\n\n虽然目前Arc8中将广告等收入去除，\n\n通过通证奖励的形式在拉新促活。\n\n但我们也有理由相信，\n\nGAMEE在传统手游市场的运营经验，\n\n也许未来也将在Arc8里有所施展。\n\n这种成熟的运营经验，\n\n也将成为Arc8的另一增长潜力。\n\n## 圈外引流，能否成为链游红海中的竞争利器\n\n目前的链游市场逐渐成为红海，\n\n同类型，同玩法的项目时常免不了相互PK。\n\n而Arc8的休闲游戏合集形式在链游圈内也不乏竞争者，\n\n大名鼎鼎的Mobox正是其中之一。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1BWS8kuj5DTK32nrM7QZc.png?height=440&width=424)\n\n但在对比游玩这两个平台之后，\n\n我们发现了两者的关键区别：\n\n**“由内而外”VS“由外而内”**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CVdPQOGl8QWIoin0U2yAE.png?height=234&width=679)\n\n这里的内外，我们特指链游圈的内和外，\n\n观察MOBOX上的游戏你会发现，\n\n游戏无论从简介到玩法，都存在着明显的\\*\\*「概念外显」：\\*\\*\n\n如质押，收益聚合器，流动性挖矿，DAI，\n\n等等圈外人难以理解的术语。\n\n而这也恰恰说明MOBOX实际上是面向区块链圈内人的游戏，\n\n并将圈内概念游戏化，友好化后进行呈现。\n\n而与之相反，Arc8则是明显\\*\\*「外水内引」：\\*\\*\n\n游戏界面和设计均不存在任何与区块链强耦合的功能，\n\n换言之，\n\n**即使不懂区块链的休闲玩家也不会对玩游戏有任何影响。**\n\n游戏的奖励通证 GMEE也仅与APP内钱包板块产生联系，\n\n转移和领取的学习成本并不高。\n\n更为重要的是，\n\n依托于GAMEE公司已有的3000w休闲游戏用户，\n\n项目方也可以通过在其成熟手游Prize App上发放GMEE奖励，\n\n从而将这3000w的休闲玩家进行外水内引，\n\n无缝导入到Arc8 app中。\n\n我们从官方信息中看到项目方也正打算这么做，\n\n这是多数圈内链游团队不具备的流量和生态资源，\n\n也是Arc8生态发展的重要护城河，\n\n毕竟得流量者得天下。\n\n而剩下的，\n\n则将依赖于团队的运营策略和节奏了。\n\n### \n\n从Thetan Arena到Acr8,\n\n我们可以看到越来越多的传统游戏公司入圈，\n\n它们在理解链游圈游戏规则的同时，\n\n也尽力保持着它们打磨已久的游戏品质。\n\n更为可贵的是，\n\n传统游戏公司的入圈，\n\n也可能会带来圈外海量的蓝海用户，\n\n从而为\\*\\*「区块链+游戏」**的结合提供更多**「真实的受众」\\*\\*。\n\n或许链游真正的出圈，是游戏公司们的先入圈，\n\n将用户引入，将经验输出，\n\n从而达到盈利性和游戏性的兼顾。\n\n**借用经验，比付出代价得到经验好得多。**\n\n也许这种传统游戏的「链改」，\n\n也将是未来的主流之一。\n\n>

I didn't know that until I read \"A Hundred Thousand Whys.\"\n\nIn plants, I was curious about this mimosa. People often say: \"stay composition https://Www.ZuoWEn8.Com/ if wood chicken, numb.\" Like \"wood\" -- plants don't move. This can be negated in mimosa. When you gently touch the leaves of the mimosa with your hand, it is like a shy little girl, closing the leaves and hanging down. When you touch it lightly, it moves slowly and folds less. If you hit it hard, it works very fast, and in less than 10 seconds, all the leaves are folded up. Mimosa's peculiar behavior is actually an adaptation to natural conditions. In the south, there is often violent wind and rain, if the mimosa did not just encounter the first drop of rain, the first gust of wind to gather up the leaves, then the plant may have been eliminated by nature millions of years ago.\n\nYes, if you don't have a strong point and skills to protect yourself, how can you survive in this predatory ecological environment? Everything in the world has its own ability and mystery, their physiological characteristics and growth rules are an interesting and profound knowledge. Only with special skills and ability, to survive, to foothold, so animals and plants, people are so. Do we try to survive? There is so much more to discover. So, let's start with a hundred thousand Whys!", "timestamp": 1635733596, "digest": "x9jngq2A-boTOpIxRHAh0u7g3z8Nx9s0vZpH87G5fOU", "contributor": "0x8fD87a84eCDCf6EC1550BC5acB3F9f6c2b27Caf5"}

After today, I summarize my reading experience.\n\nMany people complain that they are too busy at the end of the day to find time to develop their hobbies and skills. In fact, when we remove most of the major time, we leave a fragment of time that is of great use. This fragmented time is often ignored and not used well. Fragmented time includes leisure time, time to play, and time to be used, such as waiting for the bus, queuing for receipts, and commuting time. There are also smaller chunks of fragmented time, such as waking up early and going to bed.\n\nSo how do you make the most of fragmentation time? Time management book, summed up this sentence; This means getting things done while everyone else is asleep and doing a few more things while everyone else is asleep.\n\nGetting up early is a good living habit. There are many benefits to getting up early. In the book on effective learning, the human brain is most awake and efficient in the morning. So we can use this time to quietly and efficiently do what we love to do. It's best to split mental and physical exercise to start the day. Read, meditate, go for a run, write a morning journal, etc., instead of wasting time on your phone or sleeping in the comfy big bed.\n\nGoing to bed a little later is between 11:30 and 12:30, so when you're ready for bed, you can read a few more pages of a book, or listen to a favorite piece of music or listen to a foreign language. I now make it a point to do a daily review before I go to bed. I think about all the good things I did and the stupid things I did today. I also write down my to-do list for the next day and the good habits I want to stick to.\n\nIn my opinion, it is a waste of time to brush the mobile phone. Although the mobile phone has become an indispensable tool in our life, it is not only a simple communication tool, but also a medium to learn knowledge and expand the world. Even so, we shouldn't waste most of our day on our phones. The advice from the time management book is to turn your phone on silent when you're focused and check it every hour for about five minutes.", "timestamp": 1635733470, "digest": "T1utiEQwdjlPvWUcwpfwZLVlkyuyn29a2dODD_3bUdU", "contributor": "0xC075737f9C5037277F54eC74Bc8C4E7d4F235f7c"}

{"id": "_iZBJ9xQcH5OeCTbvTXeFvn448EUsPV2VWS9kjnSaL4", "title": "Experts predict five bitcoin Trends for 2021 The future promises to be more of a wild ride", "body": "For anyone investing in bitcoin, or even just following it, 2020 has been a thrilling year. As recently as December, the price of bitcoin, the world's most valuable virtual currency, hit an all-time high of more than $24,000. Bitcoin could be more mainstream accepted in 2021, market analyst James Ledbetter predicted on Dec. 22, but it could remain volatile in the face of competition from big tech companies and digital currencies from central banks, as well as tougher regulation from the Biden administration.\n\nExperts predict five major trends for bitcoin in 2021\n\nBack in early March 2020, when the United States first began responding to the outbreak, bitcoin was trading at less than $4,000. As bitcoin has soared, investors have reaped handsome gains. To onlookers, it is a market show tinged with envy and vertigo.\n\nWhile bitcoin's price has been volatile -- generally on the rise -- 2020 is also a relatively mature year for a currency that has only been trading for 10 years. Market analyst James Ledbetter says he sees five key bitcoin trends for 2021 from his perspective as editor of a fintech newsletter:\n\n① More acceptable to the mainstream\n\nBitcoin has always had a chicken-and-egg problem in its everyday use: very few people use or accept it.\n\nBut in 2020, bitcoin's adaptability has changed dramatically. Prominent fintech companies have endorsed bitcoin, from Square's $50 million investment to PayPal, which allows users to buy and sell bitcoins.\n\nIn 2021, we may see greater mainstream acceptance of bitcoin. At least one major BANK in the United States or Europe will announce some kind of bitcoin purchase system or agree to hold bitcoin for clients.\n\n② Competition from big tech companies\n\nWhatever bitcoin achieves in its 10 years of existence, it has forced a number of large global entities to consider offering an international digital currency.\n\nEvery company involved in the payments space knows there is still room for growth in the digital payments market, with payments involving different currency markets having the greatest potential. That's because such deals currently take days to resolve and often involve high fees.\n\nBitcoin has shown that a global digital currency can greatly simplify this process, albeit in its infancy. In 2020, Facebook and Google -- two companies with a global reach that Bitcoin can only dream of -- both rolled out big plans for digital currencies.\n\nTech products like Facebook's Diem aren't exactly the same as bitcoin, but they could have an impact if they start to catch on in 2021.\n\n③ Competition from central bank digital currencies\n\nIn 2020, the Bank for International Settlements published a report and survey showing that 80 percent of the world's central banks were working on some form of digital currency.\n\nThere are already attempts by Asian countries to push forward with digital currencies, which could undermine demand for Bitcoin and other standalone cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn 2021, it is likely that other countries will try to advance digital currencies, which is not good news for Bitcoin.\n\n(4) A new regulatory arena\n\nThe Biden administration will have bigger priorities in its first 90 days than regulating cryptocurrencies. Of course, it is hard to read the attitude and expertise of Congress on this issue.\n\nIt is natural to assume that a Democratic administration would be more tightly regulated than a Republican one, but some assert that a Biden presidency would be \"good for cryptocurrencies\".\n\nThat may be true, but bitcoin enthusiasts tend to overlook issues such as anonymity and its potential fraudulent uses. These are very serious problems for regulators.\n\nBiden's team is likely to come up with a more comprehensive and rational approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, but James Ledbetter doesn't think they'll be particularly partial to bitcoin.\n\n⑤ The price of bitcoin will continue to fluctuate\n\nBecause bitcoin's value is not directly tied to any obvious real-world phenomenon, like fiscal or monetary policy,\n\nIt can rise or fall in ways that are hard to predict or even explain\n\n.\n\nAs an investment, this is hard to recommend to anyone hoping to avoid big losses. Some say bitcoin could cost as much as $50,000 in 2021, and while that seems extreme, it's not out of the question if investors move money from other assets into bitcoin.\n\nOf course, bitcoin prices are also likely to move in the opposite direction in 2021.\n\nOne thing seems certain: Bitcoin's wild ride will be repeated in 2020 -- so buckle up", "timestamp": 1635733134, "digest": "PQ1fYpuE9-z4EKw1JDAXxw9YEfU3eLscfOHH6R-erpo", "contributor": "0x5B15c5FaC4c653a2D95Ad5FF017A95e6f6E2fD03"}

Think of the timid way you introduce yourself to successful people and they won't trust you.\n\nThis kind of socializing can only make you less and less confident, more and more impetuous, anxious.\n\nTherefore: your own level determines your level. You can only stay in the same circle with people on the same level. Instead of spending a lot of time trying to meet other people, try to improve yourself.\n\nWe are turning from seeking from outside to seeking from inside. Seeking from outside means seeking resources, channels, relationships and contacts, only to find that it is just drawing water out of a bamboo basket. Inward-seeking is to focus your energy on what you should be doing, give full play to your strengths, and naturally attract others to meet your needs.\n\nThis is the true meaning of \"seeking others is better than seeking oneself\".\n\nSometimes, in order to expand the so-called connections, we swallow our pride on the stage, blindly to please and comply, so that the result is that we give others the best temper, the worst mood to family and parents.\n\nOffend others, will let oneself lose interests, so we dare not; If you offend your loved ones, they won't hurt you, and the cost is close to zero, we do what we want.\n\nYour family knows the hardships of your life, so they endure you, let you, and manipulated your insolence and insolence. There are countless kinds of failure in life, this is the most sad and desolate one.\n\nThis society will only be more and more realistic, talk about feelings too false, it is better to directly talk about interests. If everyone's here for what they want, why can't we just call a spade a spade? Get to the point. If you agree, if you disagree.\n\nBesides, a hedge between keeps friendship green. Really successful, smart people and others will maintain a certain distance, this distance can attack, retreat can defend, can be sent, hidden can be seen.\n\nBecause one of the weaknesses of human nature is that when you open up to someone, he thinks he has everything in front of you, and he takes you in. For your seven inches have been laid bare.\n\nThis is really a no-no. Many of the emperor's favorites were beheaded by the emperor or beheaded by others. Leaders often change their favorite people, either to take the blame for the leader, or to offend a group of colleagues; Those who call a lot of brothers and sisters friends, once involved in the interests of the fight; Love a lot of lovers, most of their respective end.\n\nAll the beauty in the world is actually a sense of strangeness and remoteness. Everything in a glance will only lead to boredom. Therefore, the most beautiful distance in the world is in the place that will be reached but not yet reached.\n\nTherefore, the society of the future will not need to be social. All the existing distance, are reasonable, we do not need to deliberately approach or go away, just do their own, the approach will approach sooner or later.\n\nThe most precious thing in the future is time, do not waste others' time casually, also do not waste your time casually. Have a little leisure time, do not go to socialize: for many years do not see suddenly contact, must be used to think of you; There is no prior appointment, suddenly invite you to have a meal, that you are just a meal to make up the number of people. Remember: no one is worth socializing with!\n\nHave some time to read more, spend more time with your family, make your body and mind happy, rich and colorful life. Cultivate one's morality and cultivate one's nature.\n\nOne last reminder: please put your extra time and energy on the things or people you love, do what you should do, good at doing the best, your world will be much more wonderful!", "timestamp": 1635733272, "digest": "MxZvfru_R9dj6LSI7rC19M5M9ndCt85Klcse7fvvgls", "contributor": "0xB919640b97A79Ccb594f9e16Ac9370c32A33a1F8"}

科尔顿**\n\n`本期内容YouTube链接：`\n\n[https://youtu.be/9nYFlTj0gHw](https://youtu.be/9nYFlTj0gHw)\n\n`本期内容哔哩哔哩链接：`\n\nTBA\n\n链游经过一段时间的内卷，\n\n现在NFT、道具合成、物品租售、通证治理等要素，\n\n基本成了每个项目的标配。\n\n但与此形成鲜明对比的是，\n\n开心消消乐，微信跳一跳，飞机大战等休闲小游戏，\n\n总能填满人们公交地铁，排队等待的各种碎片时间。\n\n休闲手游之所以大行其道，\n\n原因在于其门槛低，易上手和无需了解任何复杂原理。\n\n这类游戏的生命力和商业模式也早已被市场验证。\n\n而今天我们要介绍的这款游戏：[Arc 8](https://arc8.gamee.com/)\n\n就是属于这一细分赛道。\n\n**通证：GMEE**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/md109P_Ve6o4XbUbJU-s6.png?height=250&width=512)\n\n## Arc8：一站式休闲小游戏平台\n\n### Polygon生态链游用户量排行TOP 1\n\nARC8的核心是一个集合多种休闲小游戏的一站式平台型APP，\n\n目前已上线苹果和谷歌应用商店。\n\n在我们介绍APP中的主要内容之前，\n\n不妨先看一看他在基本面上的数据表现。\n\n这款app高居Polygon的Dapp用户总量排行榜之首，\n\n并以巨大的优势领先于另一知名的赛车链游项目REVV。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2nU6qkFbq5pT8AvZVnxCm.png?height=698&width=1103)\n\n虽然以独立钱包地址总数计算用户量，\n\n存在一定的误差和水分，\n\n但是能做到某一生态中的佼佼者，\n\n就一定有我们不能忽视的过人之处。\n\n### 玩Arc8上的休闲小游戏，获得GMEE奖励\n\n玩家在应用商店下载Arc8后，\n\n就可以体验各种类型的休闲小游戏。\n\n这些休闲小游戏的具体形式我们不再逐一介绍，\n\n但它们都有共同的特点：\n\n**易于上手，目标唯一，机制简单，奖励明确。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uty9d9WTaPNQJgbwfCfku.png?height=579&width=1196)\n\n如其中的一个弹珠跑酷小游戏（上图最右），\n\n玩家手指在屏幕滑动，决定弹珠左右移动方向，\n\n躲避障碍物，吃掉增益道具，\n\n尽可能的在规定时间内让弹珠滚动更远的距离。\n\n**同时，这些游戏也有对应的奖励方式。**\n\n玩家可以选择某一游戏进行1V1对战，\n\n其中的胜出者，例如谁的弹珠滚动距离最远，\n\n就可以获得APP中的通证奖励：GMEE\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pAaeszYVRfoyds-bZ1Yb1.png?height=498&width=879)\n\n同时官方也会针对不同游戏开展锦标赛，\n\n玩家参赛需要支付GMEE，\n\n取得不同名次后会瓜分锦标赛奖金池中的GMEE。\n\n此外，对于自己游戏技术没有信心的玩家，\n\n也可以通过消耗游戏中的免费紫色水晶进行练习模式，\n\n待到熟练后也可以参与到正式的比赛中来。\n\n得益于**多样的小游戏 + 平缓的学习曲线+ 项目方的赛事运营**，\n\n玩家的实际游戏体验并不会觉得低幼和单调乏味。\n\n而当自己熟练以后再去挑战对手赢得GMEE时，\n\n这种成就感和盈利感的结合，\n\n也刺激着玩家熟悉下一款游戏并再次挑战，\n\n从而实现一种**休闲--上手--挑战--激励**的循环，\n\n也印证了Play to Earn模式的可行性。\n\n当然，对不愿意参与游戏的玩家，\n\n也可以将GMEE进行质押，从而获得一定的收益。\n\n> 当前质押活动已结束，需等待下次活动开启。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q9G3wTwugY74whKwOfk5-.png?height=705&width=1383)\n\n### NFT游戏G-BOT，独立于休闲游戏外的链游空间\n\nGMEE是Arc8的奖励通证，\n\n但却不只为Arc8这一款游戏而生。\n\n如果说上述休闲游戏主要面向非链游圈的玩家，\n\n那么除Arc8外，还有一款与NFT相关的游戏G-BOT，\n\n则是为链游圈的玩家量身定做。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AfTyTEgH4Gd4dO76-_b8e.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n这款游戏与其他NFT链游的玩法类似，\n\n玩家通过消耗GMEE购买G-BOT机器人。\n\n并通过PVE、PVP的形式完成各种任务和战役，\n\n从而获得机器人发展所需的能源通证：ET。\n\n消耗GMEE和ET能培育/升级和迭代自己的G-BOT。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q2MINsMa3X9SC9_xffwvi.png?height=1938&width=2160)\n\n同时需要注意的是，\n\n不持有NFT的玩家将无法参与该款游戏，\n\n持有G-BOT NFT的玩家也还将拥有其他Arc8内的游戏特权，\n\n比如更快的玩到新游戏和体验新功能等。\n\n虽然G-BOT游戏模式目前还没有成品，\n\n但G-BOT的NFT将于11月2日开启预售，\n\n感兴趣者也可以关注。\n\n参与链接：https://gbots.gamee.com/\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OrUQogHb2_A0U8n87S3Zx.png?height=881&width=1464)\n\n以上就是Arc8的全部内容，\n\n可以看出Arc8通过针对休闲用户和链游用户设计不同的游戏模式，\n\n从而吸收不同圈层的玩家，拓展自身的用户量。\n\n而这一策略的成功，\n\n也将仰赖于Arc8成熟的休闲游戏开发经验。\n\n## 入圈尝试，传统手游Play to Earn成功经验的复制\n\n### GAMEE+Animoca Brand, Arc8入圈的有力支撑\n\n在一些项目搜索引擎中，\n\n我们可以看到Arc8后面还有一个GAMEE字样。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/95g89jlp_ZTSq65gV-_uP.png?height=55&width=1078)\n\n**实际上GAMEE是一家成立于2015年的捷克游戏公司，**\n\n其开发的手机休闲游戏应用Prize已有3000万活跃用户。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/81702bCExeH9ebTMfHlNV.png?height=412&width=790)\n\n**该公司在2021年被Animoca Brand 以800万美金的价格收购**，成为其子公司。\n\n二者的结合，\n\n在保证游戏品质的情况下，\n\n也为Arc8注入了链游圈的资源和人脉。\n\n这也将成为Arc8后续发展的重要潜力之一。\n\n### PRIZE APP：传统手游市场Play to Earn的成功经验\n\nGAMEE在被Animoca收购之前，\n\n打造了一款名为Prize的边玩边赚型游戏平台，\n\n内容与Arc8大体相同。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SFNU2EsvAet0aZUJO5jyG.png?height=706&width=1556)\n\n在Prize中，\n\n玩家通过玩小游戏获取法币（如美元）奖励，\n\n而奖励的来源则是app 内的广告投放收入。\n\n通过将部分广告收入划为奖金池，\n\n激励用户游玩并赢得奖金，\n\n从而提升了APP的活跃度。\n\n而活跃度的提升，也将进一步让app获得更多的曝光量和广告收入。\n\n**Prize的这种循环形成了一种play to earn的良性商业模式。**\n\n虽然目前Arc8中将广告等收入去除，\n\n通过通证奖励的形式在拉新促活。\n\n但我们也有理由相信，\n\nGAMEE在传统手游市场的运营经验，\n\n也许未来也将在Arc8里有所施展。\n\n这种成熟的运营经验，\n\n也将成为Arc8的另一增长潜力。\n\n## 圈外引流，能否成为链游红海中的竞争利器\n\n目前的链游市场逐渐成为红海，\n\n同类型，同玩法的项目时常免不了相互PK。\n\n而Arc8的休闲游戏合集形式在链游圈内也不乏竞争者，\n\n大名鼎鼎的Mobox正是其中之一。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1BWS8kuj5DTK32nrM7QZc.png?height=440&width=424)\n\n但在对比游玩这两个平台之后，\n\n我们发现了两者的关键区别：\n\n**“由内而外”VS“由外而内”**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CVdPQOGl8QWIoin0U2yAE.png?height=234&width=679)\n\n这里的内外，我们特指链游圈的内和外，\n\n观察MOBOX上的游戏你会发现，\n\n游戏无论从简介到玩法，都存在着明显的\\*\\*「概念外显」：\\*\\*\n\n如质押，收益聚合器，流动性挖矿，DAI，\n\n等等圈外人难以理解的术语。\n\n而这也恰恰说明MOBOX实际上是面向区块链圈内人的游戏，\n\n并将圈内概念游戏化，友好化后进行呈现。\n\n而与之相反，Arc8则是明显\\*\\*「外水内引」：\\*\\*\n\n游戏界面和设计均不存在任何与区块链强耦合的功能，\n\n换言之，\n\n**即使不懂区块链的休闲玩家也不会对玩游戏有任何影响。**\n\n游戏的奖励通证 GMEE也仅与APP内钱包板块产生联系，\n\n转移和领取的学习成本并不高。\n\n更为重要的是，\n\n依托于GAMEE公司已有的3000w休闲游戏用户，\n\n项目方也可以通过在其成熟手游Prize App上发放GMEE奖励，\n\n从而将这3000w的休闲玩家进行外水内引，\n\n无缝导入到Arc8 app中。\n\n我们从官方信息中看到项目方也正打算这么做，\n\n这是多数圈内链游团队不具备的流量和生态资源，\n\n也是Arc8生态发展的重要护城河，\n\n毕竟得流量者得天下。\n\n而剩下的，\n\n则将依赖于团队的运营策略和节奏了。\n\n### \n\n从Thetan Arena到Acr8,\n\n我们可以看到越来越多的传统游戏公司入圈，\n\n它们在理解链游圈游戏规则的同时，\n\n也尽力保持着它们打磨已久的游戏品质。\n\n更为可贵的是，\n\n传统游戏公司的入圈，\n\n也可能会带来圈外海量的蓝海用户，\n\n从而为\\*\\*「区块链+游戏」**的结合提供更多**「真实的受众」\\*\\*。\n\n或许链游真正的出圈，是游戏公司们的先入圈，\n\n将用户引入，将经验输出，\n\n从而达到盈利性和游戏性的兼顾。\n\n**借用经验，比付出代价得到经验好得多。**\n\n也许这种传统游戏的「链改」，\n\n也将是未来的主流之一。\n\n>

{"id": "76DOFNQZzPLKgRtZ-dbE6o92uaY9fM0fDTNv3Bwszl0", "title": "Cardano 调研", "body": "## 概览\n\n简而言之，Cardano 是一个第三代区块链，使用POS共识机制，以建立一个去中心化的区块链世界。\n\nCardano的目标是成为一个开发具有多种资产和整合智能合约的去中心化应用的平台。由于Cardano的愿景是雄心勃勃的，与其他现有的区块链相比，其发展进度相对缓慢。\n\nCardano是由[以太坊](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BB%A5%E5%A4%AA%E5%9D%8A)共同创始人[查尔斯·霍斯金森](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9F%A5%E7%88%BE%E6%96%AF%C2%B7%E9%9C%8D%E6%96%AF%E9%87%91%E6%A3%AE)(Charles Hoskinson)于2015年创立的区块链研发公司IOHK（Input Output Hong Kong）开发的。\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. 目前超过70%供应量的ada用于质押维护节点。\n2. 在世界各地的许多卡尔达诺社区和组织正在支持卡尔达诺生态系统，以便对全世界产生深远的影响\n3. 使用最先进的技术，例如 PoS 共识机制和多层解决方案（L2-Hydra），Cardano 可以在不牺牲安全特性的情况下可持续地进行扩展。\n4. Project Catalyst （去中心化基金-DAO）让 Cardano 社区决定生态系统增长的重要优先事项。ADA 越高，财政部将拥有更多的资金。因此，Cardano 拥有一个强大的去中心化启动平台，其治理系统用于分配宝贵的资金。\n\n### ADA Token\n\n* Ticker: ADA.\n* Blockchain: Cardano.\n* Consensus: Proof of Stake (PoS).\n* Algorithm: Ouroboros.\n* Token Type: Coin.\n* Smallest unit: 1 Lovelace = 10^-6 ADA.\n* Max Supply: 45,000,000,000 ADA.\n* Circulating Supply: 32,143,026,588 ADA.\n* All-time low ATL: $0.017 (1/10/2017).\n* Exchanges: Binance, Huobi, Kucoin, Gate, Coinbase, etc.\n\n### \n\n### Cardano 区块链\n\n* TPS: 250-1000, 可以通过Hydra 提升到 1 million。\n* Blocktime: 20s.\n* Total Tx: 13,100,000 Tx (updated 16/09/2021).\n* Avg. Tx fee: $0.2.\n* Total stake pools: 2975 (updated 16/09/2021).\n\n### Cardano 路线图\n\n在整个 Cardano 的路线图中，共分为 5 大步，分别是拜伦（Byron）、雪莱（Shelley）、古根（Goguen）、芭蕉（Basho）和伏尔泰（Voltaire），它们分别代表了公链技术基础、质押激励、智能合约、优化性能和链上治理，而我们目前所处的就是代表了智能合约时代的古根（Goguen）。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VsmtmMw5jyNSTeSKcPiEC.png?height=1406&width=2500)\n\n### 合作伙伴和资助人\n\n1. Cardano Foundation\n2. Emurgo\n3. IOHK\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zS2YzNw9tmwTTcfPYPyxE.png?height=1406&width=2500)\n\n### Cardano 的公链模型\n\nCardano 的模型通过创建扩展的 UTXO 模型（eUTXO）回归到行业的根源。它本质上是一个 UTXO，但具有两个附加功能——维护合约状态的能力和用于整个事务序列上的执行相同合约代码的能力。eUTXO 为交易添加了自定义数据和值，这允许任意逻辑与这些交易进行交互并打开智能合约的大门。\n\n### 共识机制\n\n#### 权益证明\n\nOuroboros 是一种基于权益证明 (PoS) 的加密货币免许可共识机制。它在 Cardano 区块链上实现，并带有一种称为 ADA 的加密货币。PoS 中的验证者不使用像 BTC 的 PoW 这样的矿工网络，而是使用他们的 ADA 股份参与验证和验证交易。\n\n所有做出贡献的验证者都会获得 ADA 奖励，而那些将其 ADA 代币委托给权益池的验证者也会获得与其权益相关的奖励。ADA 持有者可以参与对未来功能的投票，例如 Project Catalyst 投票。\n\nHydra(二层扩容方案) 是 Cardano 改变游戏规则的可扩展性解决方案，这意味着每秒交易 (TPS) 可高达 100 万。它借助 UTxO 技术使 Cardano 成为一个稳定的全球系统。\n\nCardano 量子证明使用 Sha-256 加密哈希函数，它允许任意长度的输入成为固定长度的输出。此外，输入是不可能从输出哈希中导出的。\n\n特别是，为了针对其他区块链上的速度和扩展问题提供最佳解决方案，Cardano 区块链分为两个主要层：\n\n* 结算层：该层的工作原理类似于包含由 Cardano PoS 协议验证的所有历史交易的分类帐。\n* 计算层：在卡尔达诺上运行的 DApp 层，实施智能合约。\n\n## 一些相关名词解释\n\n### Haskell\n\nHaskell是一种函数语言，对比于常用的 C/C++/Java/Python等 Imperative Langauge。 Imperative Language是以statement为主，把要做的工作描述在程序里，由电脑按步就班的执行。 Functional Language 是以构建函数为主，就像是数学证明一样，每一个函数会回复一些值（或函数），而函数可能参考到其他函数，由此组成完整的功能。\n\n### Plutus\n\nPlutus 是 Haskell 加上区块链和Smart Contract 的功能。\n\n## 生态系统\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EusR4HAlrkMXbeebKwVJt.png?height=1406&width=2500)\n\n### 基础设施\n\nAdapools 是一个基于网站的工具，用于监测池和分析卡尔达诺区块链的数据。ADApools 集成在 Yoroi Wallet 和 Daedalus Wallet 中，以方便用户。\n\nBlockfrost 是一个在 Cardano 区块链上提供 API 服务的基于 web 的平台。它消除了复杂性，因此客户可以在 Cardano 上创建自己的分散式应用程序。\n\n### 钱包\n\n* **Daedalus** ADA的开源钱包。目前，**Daedalus**是最流行的 ADA 存储方式。\n* **Yoroi Wallet** 是一款轻便的钱包。它是由 Emurgo 和 IOHK 设计和开发。此外，Yoroi 可以安装在许多网络浏览器上，iOS 和安卓。\n* **GeroWallet** 是一个运行在 Cardano 区块链上的钱包，允许用户交易，质押，利用合成资产，并直接用法定货币购买加密产品。2021年5月，GeroWallet 在 Cardstarter 上有一个成功的 IDO，该 IDO 的起始价格为0.008美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0qn5GND08d7dy958FzWPs.png?height=1406&width=2500)\n\n### 去中心化交易所\n\n**[Minswap](https://minswap.org/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：2021 年 9 月 1 日，Cardno 测试网首先进行了阿朗佐硬分叉。不久之后，一个崭露头角的去中心化交易所「Minswap」于 9 月 3 日推出了他们的测试网，成为第一个部署在 Cardano 上的 Dapp。\n\n**[Cardaswap](https://cardaswap.finance/)**\n\n简介：在 Cardano 区块链上交换、赚取和构建下一代 DEX。在对所有人开放且可访问的金融市场中进行交易、搭建桥梁并成为流动性提供者。\n\n**[Cardax](https://cardax.io/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：Cardax 是一个去中心化交易所，允许用户用 ADA 交易任何 Cardano 链上的原生代币。\n\n**[Yayswap](https://yayswap.io/)**\n\n跨链桥测试网：<https://yayswap.io/bridge/>\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第四季度\n\n简介：Cardano 区块链上的第一个高性能去中心化交易平台。\n\n**[Ergodex](https://ergodex.io/)**\n\n测试网：<https://beta.ergodex.io/>\n\n简介：ErgoDEX 是一个非托管的、去中心化的交易所，允许在 Ergo 和 Cardano 网络之间快速、轻松和安全地转移流动性。\n\n**[Adax](https://adax.pro/)**\n\n简介：ADAX 是一种自动化流动性协议，以完全去中心化和非托管的方式促进 Cardano 生态系统内的交易。\n\n**[Sundaeswap](https://www.sundaeswap.finance/)**\n\n主网上线时间：2021 年第三季度\n\n简介：Cardano 区块链上的原生、可扩展的去中心化交易所\n\n### IDO平台\n\n* Cardstarter 是一个去中心化的加速器和swap平台，也是启动项目的启动平台。例如，Oracle Charli3 C3在 Cardstarter 上就是一个成功的 IDO。目前，许多突出的项目正在等待Cardstarter准备推出。\n* **OccamFi** 是一个为项目筹集资金的 IDO 平台。\n* TrustPad 是一个为初创公司提供的多链式筹款平台，支持各种区块链，如 Ethereum、 Binance Smart Chain、 Polygon、 Polkadot 和 Cardano。\n* 对于初创公司来说，Vent Finance 是一个理想的融资平台，它有一个易于使用的界面，无论用户之前在加密世界的经验如何。\n\n### 借贷\n\n**[Meld](https://www.meld.com/)**\n\n发布时间：预计 2021 年第三季度\n\n简介：MELD 是 Cardano 上第一个用于借贷法定货币和加密货币的去中心化、非托管协议\n\n**[Aada](https://medium.com/@aada.finance)**\n\n简介：Aada 是 Cardano 上的加密资产借贷平台。智能合约允许存入资产并收取利息或借入资产并执行财务操作。\n\n**[Liqwid Finance](https://www.liqwid.finance/)**\n\n简介：个基于流动性提供者供应和借款人需求的利率曲线算法和非托管流动性协议。\n\n### 稳定币\n\n不同于其他区块链，stablecoin 是在 Cardano 区块链上发布的**原生代币**，而不是通过智能合同。在不久的将来，虚拟货币市场将会有许多新型的用户需求的稳定币\n\n* **AgeUSD** 是一个稳定币，由 Emurgo、 Ergo 和 IOHK 在 Ergo 区块链上联合创建\n* **Ardana** 是一个 AMM DEX 专注于稳定币，它将发行加密货币支持的稳定币 dUSD，dEUR 等。它利用区块链技术应用于外汇市场。\n* **STASIS** Occam.Fi 上启动的一个项目，在 Cardano 区块链上为欧洲发行一种新型的稳定币。\n\n### 合成资产平台\n\n**[Indigo Protocol](https://indigoprotocol.io/)**\n\n上线时间：2021 年 10 月\n\n简介：Indigo 是一种基于 Cardano 的算法、自主合成协议，用于对现实世界资产进行链上价格敞口。\n\n### 衍生品市场\n\n**[Matrixswap](https://www.matrixswap.io/)**\n\n简介：是一个部署在 Polkadot、Cardano、Polygon 上的去中心化多链永续合约平台。\n\n### 去中心化保险\n\n**[Ensuro](https://ensuro.co/aboutus.html)**\n\n简介：未有更多进展。\n\n### NFT/ 链游\n\n* **[Bondly （多链）](https://www.bondly.finance/default)**\n\n简介：Bondly 将通过加密项目、品牌和艺术家为下一代数字收藏品提供动力。\n\n* **[Adazoo NFT](https://www.adazoo.com/)**\n\n上线时间：预计第三季度末\n\n简介：ADAZOO 是在 Cardano 区块链上运行的首批基于 NFT 的游戏之一。\n\n* **[Cnft](https://cnft.io/)**\n\n简介：是 Cardano 上的 NFT 交易市场。\n\n* **[Sushibytes](https://www.sushibyte.io/)**\n\n上线时间：预计 2021 年秋季\n\n简介：是在 Cardano 区块链上运行的首批基于 NFT 的游戏之一。\n\n* **[Artano](https://artano.io/)**\n\n简介：是 Cardano 区块链上的一个全球社区驱动的 NFT 市场。\n\n* THEOS 是一家初创公司，为客户提供创建自己的 NFT 的服务;\n\n参考资料：\n\n> 1.

A generation of hustlers flooded the Internet with junk mail. They were farming for clicks.\n\nThere was way to make unsolicited junk-mail more expensive.\n\nIt was a proposal \"to throttle systematic abuse of un-metered internet resources such as email, and anonymous remailers\". There were other ideas, like a \"CPU pricing function\" to fight junk mail. If you wanted to send an email, you had to \"require a user to compute a moderately hard, but not intractable function.\"\n\nProof of Work.\n\nComputation to solve a math problem, not money, was the toll to send an email.\n\nHistory went a different way. Walled Cities built on advertising rose. We still get spam. Something happened years later - 2008.\n\nHashcash would be used with a different kind of message: money. HashCash's creator was one of the first two to get an email from Satoshi Nakamoto.

Why aren’t you on the next transport back?”\n\n**I paused a moment and repeated what I wanted to the Inspector.**\n\n”Inspector, I’m going to get her back. She is caught in the middle of this, she didn’t ask for this. The only family I have left are those who served with me in the War. They’re helping me protect this woman’s family, back on Mars.\n\nI had a good wife. Her family was one of the “100”, the first settlers, when “Old Musk” was new. She married me against her parents’ wishes, and she gave me a son. I lost her when my son was born. I lost my son right before the War ended.\n\nI almost lost myself too. Then I got this second chance for a new life.\n\nI couldn’t save the most important people in my life but I can try here. She’s the ‘most important person’ in someone’s family. I got to know her on the transport, on the trip here. I got to know her...\n\nInspector, that’s my mission. I’m doing it.”\n\nThe Inspector scanned the street, then he spoke.\n\n“Commander, I want to stop this crew. I’ve been after them for years. These parasites killed good people who gave their lives to watch over this place during the War.\n\nMy guess is they’re like the shadow Co-op on your world, the ones that stole this thing, who knows what they did to get it? You told me they threatened this woman’s family.\n\nSo, I can help draw them out, but how do me make it look like they’re going to get this damn thing everyone around us wants?”\n\n[https://audius.co/thespoiltvotes/money-471381](https://audius.co/thespoiltvotes/money-471381)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Pz9OHsjOg1d34mOj25ASl.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E9gBHTnJkNSVyJLF8Hrzy.png?height=1600&width=1200)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1Gn96wd84v59ZtiBZ-R0Z.jpeg?height=1296&width=916)\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1635735354, "digest": "yuSg_-W-tFGEaBG8ikftCDYhWeTWrex2BwHZykjGK9M", "contributor": "0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f"}

{"id": "rm5wvqFsFid6AEwAR2SCUy_XsIVVTwdGM7cGzrI6E1c", "title": "狮说 - 光明顶季度市场总结", "body": "### 一、元宇宙\n\n元宇宙个人认为就是，将现实世界的东西，凭借硬件和技术手段映射在一个虚拟世界，同时用户能够拥有沉浸的体验感，并且未来现实世界受制于物理条件不能做到的事情，都可以在元宇宙世界中做到。目前，市场上的元宇宙概念项目，主要就是看这几天谁涨的狠了就知道了（MANA，AXS，SAND为首）。元宇宙整个大的概念是包括，社交，Gamefi，NFT，AR/VR这些都应该被囊括在内。\n\n \n\n元宇宙投资可分为：\n\n* **元宇宙世界虚拟资产**\n\n元宇宙虚拟资产的例子，就比如sandbox里面的LAND土地，大家可以买了土地打造自己的虚拟世界，开发游戏啊，过虚拟人生之类的。当然，现在整个元宇宙虚拟资产价格随着代币价格上涨，也变得非常贵了。      \n\n* **代币投资**\n\n就是平时投资者的购买加密货币\n\n \n\n整个元宇宙概念，目前应该处于一个刚启动的状态，短期内价格被推升的非常很高，那么还会不会有机会呢。答案是yes。对defi和NFT市场往期表现的复盘，可以发现，第一阶段吃肉的人可能对其自身的要求（市场敏锐程度等等）很高，但是后续热门概念是会持续有新的模式，玩法和项目出来的，没必要短期去大仓位最高已经涨了很多的项目。\n\n \n\n同时，对于最近Facebook改名字这个事情。meta应该是为了未来至少3-5年内，甚至10年的发展去做了改名字这么一个比较大的举动，毕竟Facebook也是全球top级别的公司。所以，对元宇宙这个概念，建议就是：短期不追高，保持学习，关注新的概念里面出来的项目，比如最近ksm拍卖的Bit.Country这些可能都是兴起的一些项目。对于元宇宙虚拟资产和项目代币投资，都能有一个简单的判断，为了10x，20x，甚至100x的投资回报率。\n\n \n\n### 二、波卡平行链生态\n\n目前，整体波卡生态比较确定的是KSM最新一轮拍卖和11-12月上线的波卡主链平行链拍卖。整体平行链概念项目，可能在未来3个月内会有一个不错的预期（但是不知道市场会不会配合）。\n\n \n\n现在整个波卡生态的情况是：\n\n* 数量众多。\n* 发展的很好的波卡项目想要摆脱自己波卡生态的标签。\n* 很多所谓估值很高的波卡生态项目迟迟还未上所 。\n* 资金热点大概率会围绕宣布参加平行链拍卖的项目中来。\n\n \n\n对于波卡生态的参与方式：\n\n* 用KSM/DOT参与质押众贷，白嫖平行链项目的代币，开盘高溢价卖出。\n* 持有平行链概念项目代币。\n* 参与波卡生态的一些NFT投资。\n\n \n\n随着波卡平行链的即将上线，很多项目大概率会在近期进行一系列公募/IDO，大家可以看到信息，能参加的大概率都能参加，最近三个月个人感觉波卡平行链概念还是一个市场资金关注点。\n\n \n\n### 三、NFT\n\nNFT资产目前可以分为土狗和蓝筹两个大类, 土狗NFT简单来说就是mint以后没跑起来的，然后逐渐floor price就破发、归零，再慢慢团队开始不做事了，运营也开始水了。蓝筹指的是，项目基本上扛过了第一阶段价格繁荣泡沫和泡沫破灭后，项目团队持续做事，floor price和交易量突破第一阶段的那些项目。市场资金共识强，持有NFT被动空投代币/空投新的NFT，团队为NFT持续赋能（空投、游戏、社交Club等），持有蓝筹NFT能够享受一系列被动收入。\n\n \n\n如何参与NFT投资\n\n* 项目初期Mint铸造。\n\n现在目前常见的都是Discord中获得白名单，然后mint，二级市场开盘高溢价后卖出止盈。\n\n这种方式的困难在于，目前discord白名单也卷的不行，项目方会要求为项目社区运营提高活跃度，或者给社交平台账号提高活跃度等等，要求水涨船高。好项目获取白名单的难度越来越高，需要达成的要求也越来越高。\n\n \n\n*  二级市场接盘。\n\nNFT二级市场接盘的风险非常的高。在第一阶段价格极速增长阶段，可能一个mint价格0.02E的会在短期内到0.2甚至0.5，然后价格泡沫破灭后，会重新跌回mint发行价格，甚至归零，这是NFT二级市场中非常常见的。\n\n \n\n那么，如果一定想玩NFT二级市场接盘的呢。主要可以从几个维度看项目：\n\n* 项目社区发展情况；\n* 项目NFT市场热度 \n* 创始人和核心团队对于项目未来半年到1年的规划图；\n* NFT的价值赋能和应用场景\n\n \n\n对于短线投机者，更好的介入阶段是刚上线后，买入后3-5x短期价格溢价然后卖出；对于长线投资者，比较好的介入时机是第一阶段泡沫破灭后，观察项目对于后续发展的规划和社区的共识，然后在成交量和价格相对低靡的时机买入，长线持有。当然，整个NFT市场基本上不是一发冲天，就是直接归零，最稳妥的还是去刷方式1）的白名单，上线就高溢价卖掉。\n\n \n\n### 四、衍生品赛道\n\n衍生品主要关注的是，期权和杠杆交易之类的项目。这个其实，跟我们这几个月一直在做的产品测试是有非常大的关联的。\n\n \n\n首先，参与前期beta测试后，就会发现哪个项目产品是OK的，哪个项目产品是非常不好用的。那么，对我们后续这个项目的代币投资判断也有比较大程度的参考意义。\n\n \n\n目前，整个衍生品发展阶段对比其他细分领域的DeFi项目而言，我认为还是处于一个早期阶段。龙头项目跑出来了一些，dydx，perp。但是，具体产品的发展阶段还存在很大的问题，ETH链上的交互成本太贵，期权平台的使用门槛较高等等，我认为未来整个衍生品平台的交易门槛会跟DEX的Swap，和CEX的现货交易一样低，产品体验非常丝滑，angle是一个不错的产品丝滑例子。\n\n \n\n对比去年到现在的DeFi生态牛市而言，目前衍生品应该是defi在去年底，今年初的阶段，第一阶段基本结束，调整期后，第二阶段会继续爆发，ETH链上的可能等一手ETH2.0正式上线？目前，整体的GAS太高，把很多基础用户都放在门外。\n\n \n\n对于衍生品，我们能够参与的是：\n\n* 使用产品交互，获得空投；\n* 屯低市值代币；\n* 使用产品开杠杆合约和使用期权盈利。\n\n \n\n**五、交互空投**\n\n对于交互空投，我们应该秉承一个原则是，在合理的精力和资金消耗的前提下，抱着对项目产品的了解和自我研究去进行。\n\n \n\n因为上面也说了，在我们使用一个项目产品的时候，同类型的产品是能够直接对比出优劣的，包括产品使用丝滑度，用户使用友好度，产品功能性等等，那么基于产品使用体验感，对于我们投资代币的方面是能够非常的借鉴参考的，优质的产品，是一定会进行市值回归的（年初的WOO类似），因为资金炒作和价格拉升，可能也就是几周或者几天的事情，只要筹码足够集中。99%的上涨都是在1%的时间完成的。\n\n \n\n所以，之后的交互，可能会参考几个判断维度进行：\n\n* 融资情况。\n* 投资机构。\n* 是否用重大团队变更（如招募法律顾问等）\n* 市场热度。\n\n \n\n同时，未来的交互空投可能会变成何种方式呢：1）参与项目产品正式版本发布后的资金投入（包括提供流动性，质押等），可能会跟投入的资金量和参与方式挂钩。现在看到的很多追溯性空投，大概就是这种。2）参与项目Beta版本测试，不空投代币，而是空投NFT。NFT不一定会进行代币空投，可能只是一个纯纯的NFT。3）交易竞赛。现在已经有一部分项目采用的空投方式是，进行测试网或正式版交易竞赛，只对交易量或者盈利额排名前列的用户进行奖励。4）问卷quiz。通过问卷提问的方式，对回答正确率较高的高玩用户进行空投。5）白嫖用户，不空投，或者恶心人空投。\n\n \n\n所以我们参与交互时候，还是要秉承在合理的精力和资金消耗的前提下，抱着对项目产品的了解和自我研究去进行这个原则，不然很可能就做了无用功。对项目产品有个很好的判断后，即使没有空投，也可以对后期市场代币的投资和持有时间有帮助。", "timestamp": 1635738546, "digest": "s-fXXyImIR-1X_zGHnJRlYT-uIHNrJedZPJTkER9BZ0", "contributor": "0x72D6960AAe3C90e2de304f6fb89263a7FCca14bB"}

Massias, X.S. Avila, and J.-J.

{"id": "cKfC6VSHYQwo_rda7hsiM2lEWXu9Q7d6LIWnuNFL92k", "title": "Opinion: Don't Sleep on Polar Culture", "body": "Polar Culture Collective: created by Marshmello, an impressive roster of artists and a sleek branding message attracts attention from the offset.\n\nThe collective appears to be more than just a record label when digging in. At first glance, information is limited. You see a sold out merch line and links to all of its artists’ social media pages. Combine this with making conclusions from Marshmello’s passion for pseudonymity and dabblings in crypto, you begin to think there’s another play here.\n\nThe site’s discreetness and structure portrays that all members are equal vs Marshmello being the leader of group. The style of music members have produced in the past show a willingness to connect with their fanbases, and the ability to relate to struggles that many people are going through, but don’t have the confidence or an audience to share with.\n\nA voice for the voiceless.\n\n\n---\n\nModern hip-hop is blending between a variety of its past sub-genres. More and more, mental health is common theme that is found in many records. It is something that people are more comfortable sharing as the world moves forward.\n\nA few examples of this are popular artists’ associations (directly or indirectly) with Soundcloud’s emo-rap scene, Travis Barker’s resurgence, Chicago’s drill artists’ evolution into the mainstream, and a specific example, DaBaby’s recent record with Lil Wayne.\n\nWhether it’s taking a Xanax to calm down, remembering ones lost, or articulating the personal struggles artists have gone through, this message resonates with many who are still finding their way.\n\nThe thing that makes Polar Culture more interesting than the standard record label, is its potential to associate with its fanbase in a more powerful online community.\n\nOne of the definitions for polar is being directly opposite. Past methods of gathering online attention were based on passive consumer consumption, and creators developing massive amounts of content in hopes of being discovered on streaming platforms. This method of discovery is highly dependent on the platforms’ sharing algorithms, which are developed with the platform in mind, not the creator.\n\nWhile there were successful examples of artists building communities through these channels, Oliver Francis being a great one, this isn’t optimized for the future.\n\n\n---\n\nFuture methods of attention gathering are moving towards active consumer consumption, engagement and participation. This method enables the consumer to engage and discover new content more organically, and feel more in control of what they’re consuming on a regular basis.\n\nIt also gives the creators (especially those up and coming) more control, as they don’t feel the need to put out content to stay relevant on the various sharing platforms’ algorithms.\n\nSoundcloud was a massive platform for artists to connect, collaborate and eventually produce some of the groundwork the industry is building upon today. New community driven platforms provide artists a way to create meaningful communities online according to their own rules.\n\nSuch platforms, like Discord, can bridge the gap between artist-to-fan and fan-to-fan interaction. This interaction aggressively earns a consumer’s attention and produces more engagement within the collective.\n\nWith the future of online attention moving from passive to aggressive, groups like Polar Culture can leverage this to create even more relevancy than they would *solely* using traditional methods.\n\n\n---\n\nFor example, let’s say Lil Dusty G was releasing a song on December 31st. Members of the community could be invited to a listening party the night of December 30th. While there are risks associated with this, there are potential monetization methods the collective could employ to make this worthwhile.\n\nAs mentioned, in communities like Discord, [you create your own rules](https://discord.com/blog/best-practices-for-starting-a-great-community-on-discord). Let’s say there are 100,000 members of the community; a listening party for everyone involved wouldn’t be much different from announcing the song’s release on instagram.\n\nBut, let’s say the listening party was for members who have a participation level of X, and also have previously verified that they purchased Polar Culture merch. The reward for active engagement is access to the listening party.\n\nAs other members see this type of engagement being rewarded, they’re incentivized to give more attention to the group and participate more often. Let’s say participation can be defined as engaging in community message boards, sharing songs on social media, or pre-ordering merch. This results in merch drops being consistently profitable, organic artist promotion, and a stronger digital brand for the collective.\n\nNews then spreads about the strength of the community and then drives more community membership, participation and eventual revenue streams for the collective. Again, this is all done organically and independent of streaming platforms, and keeps the collective, its creators and its community first.\n\n\n---\n\nI don’t know if Polar Culture intends to go in this direction, and I believe they’ll be a success independent of any decision regarding this.\n\nBut, given the assumptions made earlier, it certainly could be a possibility. NFT’s, online communities and people’s desire to be a part of something in the digital world is creating an opportunity for groups to effectively earn their audience’s attention. This attention is much more valuable than it has been in the past.\n\nMy inclination to believe that Polar Culture has the ability and desire to provide this level of engagement stems from content in its members’ previous releases.\n\nExamples being Lil Dusty G’s latest release, [Preached](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Gox2FHWcB882eGsRIkdrt?si=90f3145634c049f0), Munk’s Crown The Empire’s first hit [Voices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyEO8wgsQBM), and Marshmello’s [collaboration](https://open.spotify.com/track/6VrCmhRBFnuGKmtNfk4jDs?si=502dc504550d4c36) with the late Lil Peep. People resonate with this type of music, especially in their darkest moments.\n\nAnd those are the moments we need community the most.", "timestamp": 1635740457, "digest": "lvFrac2dRxeSrG_C-5TNyOm1N-icKp96paYa01tnDZg", "contributor": "0xa32D089F144e613106072fE2Ec4FF2ff95b7606D"}

{"id": "7sv7F-PnF0mk6hnUFWNUF3NZx9gkSeAjHdhCAmLEkEg", "title": "Connext Deep Dive", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RCz-QYspmuHrsopy-Mozu.png?height=512&width=1024)\n\n## Overview\n\n* Connext presents the opportunity to bet on a multi-chain, multi-layer world through a capital infrastructure play\n* At its core, Connext is an L2<>L2 / L1 bridging solution, allowing users to move capital between chains / layers in a trustless and efficient manner\n* With a strong team and a very competitive product, Connext will be able to capitalize on winner-take-all economics and, through its SDK-based business model, will become the backbone to dApp cross-chain operations. Overall, Connext’s value lies in its future abstraction — it is ‘behind the scenes’ financial plumbing\n* Finally, Connext presents great opportunities for value add as well as multiple avenues to exit\n\n## Protocol\n\nConnext is an interoperability protocol for interacting between L1s and L2s. Without introducing any new trust assumptions or external validators, Connext’s NXTP (the protocol technology) lets users swap assets across L1s and L2s in an efficient and timely manner.\n\n* Note that the emphasis is on the word ‘swap’ and not ‘port’ or ‘migrate’. The current version of Connext cannot be used to pass arbitrary event data between chains; therefore, one cannot use the protocol to migrate a token from Chain A to B\n* Albeit, users will not become frustrated at this inability, as swapping USDC on BSC to USDC on Optimism is basically the same as migrating, except that it is cheaper and faster than using migrating-based bridges\n* NXTP is a lightweight, simple contract that uses a locking pattern, a network of off-chain routers that participate in pricing auctions and pass ‘calldata’ between chains, and a user-side SDK that finds routes and prompts on-chain transactions\n\nEcosystem Players:\n\nUsers\n\n* Interact with a front end that is powered by NXTP. Best example right now is [xPollinate](https://www.xpollinate.io/?fromChain=56&fromToken=0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955&toChain=100&toToken=0x4ecaba5870353805a9f068101a40e0f32ed605c6)\n* Undergo the transaction process (discussed below) to fulfill the need of swapping one asset from one chain for it on another chain / rollup\n\nRouters\n\n* These are the liquidity providers, which set up a pool of assets on two chains / rollups and link up with NXTP to provide liquidity for swaps\n\ndApps\n\n* Integrate with NXTP by using the SDK. They then can manage front ends that channel assets to the NXTP contract for swapping to occur\n\nTransaction Process:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_uRxvWuNNW1GUz-KSlIiX.png?height=228&width=640)\n\nThe process can be broken down into three phases:\n\n* Route action: the user broadcasts a message signaling their desired use of a specific bridging route. Routers respond with sealed bids containing commitments to fulfilling the transaction within a certain time and price range\n* Preparation of transaction: once a bidder is selected, the user submits a transaction containing the router’s signed bid to the contract on the user’s side. This consequently locks up their funds on the user chain. The router detects an event (sealed chosen bid message) and the contract locks up the assets on their side. This lock up is incorporative of their fees\n* Fulfillment: the user’s side will then receive a confirmation message of funds locked and it will send a signed message for a relayer to claim. This relayer (typically another router) will submit the transaction and receive a submission fee\n* Note that transactions can be cancelled unilaterally by the person owed funds on that chain (router for sending chain, user for receiving chain) prior to expiry\n\n## Adoption Metrics\n\nDaily Volume\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FlyC_C1ydjYsQZs6y_MXV.png?height=252&width=552)\n\nDaily Transaction Count\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/byd3GxNtuGob7a93riwKk.png?height=252&width=552)\n\nImplied Average Transaction Value\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R-sA5iAgVxCmuAUSgdEYk.png?height=252&width=552)\n\n## Team\n\n[Arjun Bhuptani](https://twitter.com/arjunbhuptani)\n\n* Connext, Co-founder & Project Lead (May 2017 — today)\n* Moloch DAO, Co-founder (Oct 2018 — today)\n* Colgate University, B.S. in Physics and B.A. in Philosophy\n\n*Notes:*\n\n* In the space since 2017, great experience and recognition\n* Known for a strong grasp of state channel mechanics and inter-chain flow of value and information\n* Previously, Connext used to focus on payments infrastructure within crypto and consequently solving for scalability became key\n\n[Layne Haber](https://twitter.com/LayneHaber)\n\n* Connext, Co-founder & Protocol Lead (Jun 2017 — today)\n* Arctica Health, Founder & CEO (May 2016 — Jun 2017)\n* UCLA, B.S. in Chemistry and Materials Science\n\n[Rahul Sethuram](https://twitter.com/RHLSTHRM)\n\n* Connext, Co-founder & CTO (Jun 2017 — today)\n* Lone Wolf Partners, Partner (Jan 2016 — today)\n* ColorTokens, Core Engineer (Jun 2015 — Apr 2017)\n* Tip’d Off, Co-founder (May 2014 — Jun 2015)\n* Tesla, Senior Test Engineer (Sep 2010 — May 2014)\n* Element Energy, Engineering Manager (Jun 2010 — Sep 2010)\n* UC Santa Cruz, B.S.

Also included investments from staking service providers (i.e. Blockdaemon, Figment, Stakefish) and ecosystem players (i.e. Edge and Node, Loopring, Arbitrum founders)\n\n## Competitive Analysis\n\nThere are three ways to approach interoperability between chains:\n\nNarrow Competition\n\n*Hop Protocol*\n\n* A locally verified mechanism for sending tokens across rollups. Hop leverages existing arbitrary messaging bridges (“AMBs”) to send funds between chains, with a bonder (liquidity provider) fronting the capital to make the process fast. To incentivize rebalancing, the protocol also utilizes AMMs on both sides to swap between the “canonical” asset for a chain and hTokens, a representative asset used by the bonder\n* Since the proof of transfer is passed between chains using an AMB, Hop doesn’t need users to run off-chain code like Connext\n\nPresents the following tradeoffs:\n\n* Hop is less economically secure than Connext. It depends on AMBs, which means that if chains don’t have them, they need to be created. This introduces new security risks. Hop’s design also cuts corners like optimistic rollups’ seven day exit periods for settlement\n* Hop is less capital efficient. It requires both entry and exit liquidity given its AMM model on both sender and receiver chains. In contrast, Connext LPs only need exit liquidity and incur no liquidity lockup, “achieving 10x+ better capital usage”\n* Limitations to bonding. Bonders must pay gas costs based on Ethereum mainnet. Connext can have transactions go directly from L2 to L2 without touching the base layer\n* Bonders are exposed to MEV and transaction submission races, according to the Connext team. Transactions cannot be front run on Connext as the users negotiate route and pricing off-chain\n\n*Synapse*\n\n* Synapse conducts integral blockchain activities such as asset transfers, swaps, and generalized messaging with cross-chain functionality. The Synapse network is secured by cross-chain multi-party computation (“MPC”) validators operating with threshold signature schemes (“TSS”). The network is leaderless and maintains security by each validator running the same process upon receiving on-chain events. Once two-thirds of all validators have collectively signed the same transaction using their own individual key, the network achieves consensus and issues a transaction to the destination chain\n* Currently, validators are selected based on community governance and consensus. Upon reaching a certain project milestone, validators on the Synapse Network will have to stake $SYN to secure the network\n\nPresents the following tradeoffs:\n\n* While it can enable fast and efficient swaps, it introduces significant new trust primitives that can lead to increased security risk. With a whole new group of validators (currently selected by the community, which can be worrying) and game theory, Synapse adds complexity, whereas Connext bypasses it. Both can do the same thing when it comes to swaps, except that right now, Synapse can use its protocol ($SYN) to increase yields for pool deposits, creating increased liquidity in the short term\n* When compared to Connext, certain swapping routes are relatively complicated and involve several more swaps than needed. This may introduce issues pertaining to higher fees in the long run, as well as increased risks along the way\n\nRepresentative screenshot from Synapse Docs\n\nWide Competition\n\n*Ren*\n\n* Not necessarily trustless\n* Lacks scalable way to integrate with other chains / layers given its security configurations\n* Great for porting over assets, not necessarily moving value fast\n\n*Cosmos*\n\n* Works when all chains run on Tendermint / are a parachain\n* Expensive in terms of time and fees. Like Ren, the focus isn’t on moving value fast and efficiently\n\n*THORChain*\n\n* Positioned more as an L1<>L1 exchange that seeks to establish permissionless swapping between L1 native assets, using RUNE as a medium of exchange as well as for security collateral. There is a future where THORChain releases pools for rollup swaps, however, this is not within the project’s current core focus\n* Leads to increased security risk, whereas Connext inherits the security of the base chains it works on top off\n* If THORChain’s decentralized swapping capabilities prove successful and scalable, this could be a threat to Connext’s offerings pertaining to L1<>L1 swaps\n\n*Bridges*\n\n* Examples: Optimistic bridge, Near Rainbow bridge, Avalanche bridge\n* These lack the time and cost benefits that Connext offers, and in many ways, are the worst choices presented to users. They are crucial in the infrastructure they provide, but their use should be minimized to significant capital movements (in order to set up swapping pools and liquidity on the other side) as well as batch-settlement capital flows\n\n## Potential Investment Theses\n\n\\#1 If one underwrites the thesis of a multi-chain, multi-layer world, Connext offers a ‘project-neutral’ way to bet on it. At its essence, it is an infrastructure play and wins no matter which L1s and L2s prevail.\n\n* Competition in the L1 and L2 space can intensify, developing commodity-like market traits\n* The cross-chain bridging space, on the other hand, is indicative of [winner-take-all economics](https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/rne.2007.6.issue-1/rne.2007.6.1.1108/rne.2007.6.1.1108.pdf). With L1s or L2s, it makes sense for a user / dApp to use multiple ones (as they have different offerings); however, for a bridge aggregator technology, it makes more sense to use the best one that covers all ecosystems, rather than multiple ones\n* Location within the value chain can emerge as a value sap: Connext is a group of capital superhighways and generates revenue through tolls\n\n\\#2 Value lies in the SDK. Connext is a B2B protocol that will behave like abstracted infrastructure within the logic of dApps. It strategically makes sense for dApps to have inter-chain functionality built into their ops as dApps will want to maintain users on their site for the whole cross-chain process, otherwise they risk losing the user to another competing dApp. Therefore, Connext’s capital plumbing will be of value.\n\nThis is not a long-term prediction; rather, dApp integration with cross-chain liquidity infrastructure is becoming a priority. Several takeaways from ETH Lisbon have discussed dApp teams needing to focus on solving for cross-chain capabilities.\n\n\\#3 Sizable TAM. The value of transactions going through bridges will be in the billions, and eventually trillions, assuming the multi-chain, multi-layer world develops. With some tweak-able conservative assumptions, Fee TAM is in the low billion single digits:\n\n\\#4 Great team with deep sub-sector expertise\n\n* Known amongst the *right* circles for their leadership in cross-chain bridging\n* Rich dev experience suitable for the complexity of the team’s goal\n* Past track record highlights ability to execute. Specifically, recent releases have been well received, and in circumstances of bugs, they were corrected and updated in a timely manner\n\n\\#5 Opportunities for value add combined with multiple exit strategies\n\n* Leverage network as integration opportunities for the Connext team\n* Assist with team hiring and community growth. Currently, the community is somewhat small as evidenced by experience on Discord. Achieving a community like Index Coop, where several BD strategies can be led by members, could formulate part of the go-to-market\n* Offer expertise on token economics design\n\nValue add is complemented by multiple paths to exit:\n\n* M&A: Can be acquired by another bridging solution, wallet provider (i.e. Metamask), or infrastructure company\n* Token (much more likely): Can go liquid via a token drop, with lockup expiry probably lying between 1–4 years\n\n## Catalysts\n\n\\#1 Growth of L2 ecosystems\n\n* Once more dApps onboard and bring transaction-intensive ops to L2s, ecosystem growth will really hit full tilt\n* Progress with development at [Arbitrum](https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1432817424752128008), [Optimism](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC/status/1453058217991229445), and other chains / rollups point to the imminence of this catalyst\n\n\\#2 High gas environment on Ethereum\n\n* Drives capital to other ‘cheap’ chains: Avalanche, Binance, and Fantom\n\n\\#3 Connext’s integrations with other frontends and applications\n\n* This will drive transaction flow to Connext and will lead to recognition of its cheap and fast cross-chain swapping mechanism. Progress with integrations is going well according to the team\n\n\\#4 Progress with liquidity expansion\n\n* Team recently selected the first cohort of routers\n\n## Risks\n\n\\#1 Smart contract risk\n\n* Cross-chain swapping attracts smart contract and game theory risks across the board. Part of the allure of being able to pull this infrastructure design off is matched by the higher burden of risk. Given that state channel-based bridging at scale hasn’t been done before, several *unknown unknowns* are present. Additionally, it is still early, and while the Connext team has made respectable progress to date, scalability and growth can introduce several issues that may not exist at this point in time\n\n\\#2 Execution risk\n\n* While the team has great experience, significant execution risk exists. It has yet to be seen whether this team can adequately scale a platform and turn it into an infrastructure layer provider like Chainlink or the Graph. Team hires and community growth will be key, a possible area of value add\n\n\\#3 PMF risk\n\n* Assuming PoS / MPC-based cross-chain swapping applications work at scale (in light of the aforementioned security tradeoffs), and dApps desire the ability to do more than swap cross-chain (i.e. general information delivery), then Connext will be at a disadvantage to protocols like Synapse and THORChain. These protocols would be able to bundle swapping with cross-chain data delivery in one offering\n\n\\#4 Aggregators win out over protocols\n\n* Several great minds in the space see value accrual power moving over to app-based aggregators. These will plug in and provide multiple services to users. If fee compression were to start hitting DeFi (some signs of this already), then aggregators would sit on top and find different revenue opportunities while bridge protocols could be commoditized\n\n## Potential Model\n\nDrivers:\n\n* Transaction Count\n* Average Transaction Value\n\nAssumptions:\n\nProjections:\n\nValuation:\n\n**Disclosure:** This blog series is strictly personal/ educational and is not investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell any assets.

He briefed the basic situation of the machi Khanate's military action against its southwest neighbor, and explained the reasons for the military action, hoping to win the understanding and support of the Tang Empire.\n\nEmpire just also know horse the khanate large-scale military action against its neighbours, to the specific situation is not clear, surrey, on the one hand, the khanate of horses expressed strong indignation, an opposition openly defy the existence of the empire, on the one hand, also the khanate of horses that defy international convention, trample the sovereign state related agreements, take the despicable means to implement the sneak attack behavior strongly protest,He demanded that the Khanate stop its military aggression immediately, return to the original boundary lines of each country and settle the disputes between the two countries through political and diplomatic means.Nottingham, on the other hand, said it could not accept it and sincerely expressed that it would not affect the healthy development of bilateral relations.Saridden said the matter is big, must report to the Emperor, to determine, two people broke up.\n\nOn October 27, the Kingdom of Milan, the states of the South Atlantic Alliance, the Grand Duchy of Mahad, and the Duchy of Andako, through their own diplomatic departments, lodged the strongest protest to the ambassadors of the Machi Khanate in their own countries, demanding that the Machi Khanate immediately cease military operations and adopt other means to resolve the contradictions between states.King Louis XI of the Kingdom of Milan issued a national mobilization order, declaring a national state of emergency, called up reservists to join the army, and sent the royal 1st cavalry mixed regiment to move quickly to the border area with the Maki Khanate, and the royal 2nd infantry regiment also quickly entered a state of war to the capital.At the same time milan's foreign minister made an urgent visit to the Don Empire to discuss the deteriorating situation in the southern part of the continent.\n\nAnd horse the khanate neighbors to the west of the country is in a panic, they dare not openly to protest against the khanate, afraid so angered the khanate, and direct the war to their country, so have sent envoys to Tang He empire and sanjiang county and south county, on the one hand, seeking empire through diplomatic means to stop the horse the khanate of aggression,On the other hand, they also hope to enlist the help of other regional powers with strong military capabilities close to them.\n\nOn October 28, the central government of tang River Empire held an emergency meeting to discuss the south neighboring Maki Khanate's invasion of Ankun city and The Kingdom of Jemeluo.\n\n\"At present, The Lord of Ankon, Lopez, has surrendered, and the Army of the Khanate of Machi has occupied all the territory of the Kingdom of Jemel except the capital, jemel, and is attacking jemel. It is estimated that jemel will not be able to hold much longer.\"Ma Zhengfeng, director of the intelligence bureau of the General Military Administration, is a little timid and his voice is hoarse.", "timestamp": 1635744852, "digest": "0cHNIF1VAIo46-7ZCvYCke2DJxg1a4MybgBT2lqmqlM", "contributor": "0x9FB1c8b6196E5dEAC9ABb2A59CccB4e3D08DE271"}

Overall, Connext’s value lies in its future abstraction — it is ‘behind the scenes’ financial plumbing\n* Finally, Connext presents great opportunities for value add as well as multiple avenues to exit\n\n## Protocol\n\nConnext is an interoperability protocol for interacting between L1s and L2s. Without introducing any new trust assumptions or external validators, Connext’s NXTP (the protocol technology) lets users swap assets across L1s and L2s in an efficient and timely manner.\n\n* Note that the emphasis is on the word ‘swap’ and not ‘port’ or ‘migrate’. The current version of Connext cannot be used to pass arbitrary event data between chains; therefore, one cannot use the protocol to migrate a token from Chain A to B\n* Albeit, users will not become frustrated at this inability, as swapping USDC on BSC to USDC on Optimism is basically the same as migrating, except that it is cheaper and faster than using migrating-based bridges\n* NXTP is a lightweight, simple contract that uses a locking pattern, a network of off-chain routers that participate in pricing auctions and pass ‘calldata’ between chains, and a user-side SDK that finds routes and prompts on-chain transactions\n\nEcosystem Players:\n\nUsers\n\n* Interact with a front end that is powered by NXTP. Best example right now is [xPollinate](https://www.xpollinate.io/?fromChain=56&fromToken=0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955&toChain=100&toToken=0x4ecaba5870353805a9f068101a40e0f32ed605c6)\n* Undergo the transaction process (discussed below) to fulfill the need of swapping one asset from one chain for it on another chain / rollup\n\nRouters\n\n* These are the liquidity providers, which set up a pool of assets on two chains / rollups and link up with NXTP to provide liquidity for swaps\n\ndApps\n\n* Integrate with NXTP by using the SDK. They then can manage front ends that channel assets to the NXTP contract for swapping to occur\n\nTransaction Process:\n\nThe process can be broken down into three phases:\n\n* Route action: the user broadcasts a message signaling their desired use of a specific bridging route. Routers respond with sealed bids containing commitments to fulfilling the transaction within a certain time and price range\n* Preparation of transaction: once a bidder is selected, the user submits a transaction containing the router’s signed bid to the contract on the user’s side. This consequently locks up their funds on the user chain. The router detects an event (sealed chosen bid message) and the contract locks up the assets on their side. This lock up is incorporative of their fees\n* Fulfillment: the user’s side will then receive a confirmation message of funds locked and it will send a signed message for a relayer to claim. This relayer (typically another router) will submit the transaction and receive a submission fee\n* Note that transactions can be cancelled unilaterally by the person owed funds on that chain (router for sending chain, user for receiving chain) prior to expiry\n\n## Adoption Metrics\n\nDaily Volume\n\nDaily Transaction Count\n\nImplied Average Transaction Value\n\n## Team\n\n[Arjun Bhuptani](https://twitter.com/arjunbhuptani)\n\n* Connext, Co-founder & Project Lead (May 2017 — today)\n* Moloch DAO, Co-founder (Oct 2018 — today)\n* Colgate University, B.S. in Physics and B.A. in Philosophy\n\n*Notes:*\n\n* In the space since 2017, great experience and recognition\n* Known for a strong grasp of state channel mechanics and inter-chain flow of value and information\n* Previously, Connext used to focus on payments infrastructure within crypto and consequently solving for scalability became key\n\n[Layne Haber](https://twitter.com/LayneHaber)\n\n* Connext, Co-founder & Protocol Lead (Jun 2017 — today)\n* Arctica Health, Founder & CEO (May 2016 — Jun 2017)\n* UCLA, B.S. in Chemistry and Materials Science\n\n[Rahul Sethuram](https://twitter.com/RHLSTHRM)\n\n* Connext, Co-founder & CTO (Jun 2017 — today)\n* Lone Wolf Partners, Partner (Jan 2016 — today)\n* ColorTokens, Core Engineer (Jun 2015 — Apr 2017)\n* Tip’d Off, Co-founder (May 2014 — Jun 2015)\n* Tesla, Senior Test Engineer (Sep 2010 — May 2014)\n* Element Energy, Engineering Manager (Jun 2010 — Sep 2010)\n* UC Santa Cruz, B.S.

Also included investments from staking service providers (i.e. Blockdaemon, Figment, Stakefish) and ecosystem players (i.e. Edge and Node, Loopring, Arbitrum founders)\n\n## Competitive Analysis\n\nThere are three ways to approach interoperability between chains:\n\nNarrow Competition\n\n*Hop Protocol*\n\n* A locally verified mechanism for sending tokens across rollups. Hop leverages existing arbitrary messaging bridges (“AMBs”) to send funds between chains, with a bonder (liquidity provider) fronting the capital to make the process fast. To incentivize rebalancing, the protocol also utilizes AMMs on both sides to swap between the “canonical” asset for a chain and hTokens, a representative asset used by the bonder\n* Since the proof of transfer is passed between chains using an AMB, Hop doesn’t need users to run off-chain code like Connext\n\nPresents the following tradeoffs:\n\n* Hop is less economically secure than Connext. It depends on AMBs, which means that if chains don’t have them, they need to be created. This introduces new security risks. Hop’s design also cuts corners like optimistic rollups’ seven day exit periods for settlement\n* Hop is less capital efficient. It requires both entry and exit liquidity given its AMM model on both sender and receiver chains. In contrast, Connext LPs only need exit liquidity and incur no liquidity lockup, “achieving 10x+ better capital usage”\n* Limitations to bonding. Bonders must pay gas costs based on Ethereum mainnet. Connext can have transactions go directly from L2 to L2 without touching the base layer\n* Bonders are exposed to MEV and transaction submission races, according to the Connext team. Transactions cannot be front run on Connext as the users negotiate route and pricing off-chain\n\n*Synapse*\n\n* Synapse conducts integral blockchain activities such as asset transfers, swaps, and generalized messaging with cross-chain functionality. The Synapse network is secured by cross-chain multi-party computation (“MPC”) validators operating with threshold signature schemes (“TSS”). The network is leaderless and maintains security by each validator running the same process upon receiving on-chain events. Once two-thirds of all validators have collectively signed the same transaction using their own individual key, the network achieves consensus and issues a transaction to the destination chain\n* Currently, validators are selected based on community governance and consensus. Upon reaching a certain project milestone, validators on the Synapse Network will have to stake $SYN to secure the network\n\nPresents the following tradeoffs:\n\n* While it can enable fast and efficient swaps, it introduces significant new trust primitives that can lead to increased security risk. With a whole new group of validators (currently selected by the community, which can be worrying) and game theory, Synapse adds complexity, whereas Connext bypasses it. Both can do the same thing when it comes to swaps, except that right now, Synapse can use its protocol ($SYN) to increase yields for pool deposits, creating increased liquidity in the short term\n* When compared to Connext, certain swapping routes are relatively complicated and involve several more swaps than needed. This may introduce issues pertaining to higher fees in the long run, as well as increased risks along the way\n\nRepresentative screenshot from Synapse Docs\n\nWide Competition\n\n*Ren*\n\n* Not necessarily trustless\n* Lacks scalable way to integrate with other chains / layers given its security configurations\n* Great for porting over assets, not necessarily moving value fast\n\n*Cosmos*\n\n* Works when all chains run on Tendermint / are a parachain\n* Expensive in terms of time and fees. Like Ren, the focus isn’t on moving value fast and efficiently\n\n*THORChain*\n\n* Positioned more as an L1<>L1 exchange that seeks to establish permissionless swapping between L1 native assets, using RUNE as a medium of exchange as well as for security collateral. There is a future where THORChain releases pools for rollup swaps, however, this is not within the project’s current core focus\n* Leads to increased security risk, whereas Connext inherits the security of the base chains it works on top off\n* If THORChain’s decentralized swapping capabilities prove successful and scalable, this could be a threat to Connext’s offerings pertaining to L1<>L1 swaps\n\n*Bridges*\n\n* Examples: Optimistic bridge, Near Rainbow bridge, Avalanche bridge\n* These lack the time and cost benefits that Connext offers, and in many ways, are the worst choices presented to users. They are crucial in the infrastructure they provide, but their use should be minimized to significant capital movements (in order to set up swapping pools and liquidity on the other side) as well as batch-settlement capital flows\n\n## Potential Investment Theses\n\n\\#1 If one underwrites the thesis of a multi-chain, multi-layer world, Connext offers a ‘project-neutral’ way to bet on it. At its essence, it is an infrastructure play and wins no matter which L1s and L2s prevail.\n\n* Competition in the L1 and L2 space can intensify, developing commodity-like market traits\n* The cross-chain bridging space, on the other hand, is indicative of [winner-take-all economics](https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/rne.2007.6.issue-1/rne.2007.6.1.1108/rne.2007.6.1.1108.pdf). With L1s or L2s, it makes sense for a user / dApp to use multiple ones (as they have different offerings); however, for a bridge aggregator technology, it makes more sense to use the best one that covers all ecosystems, rather than multiple ones\n* Location within the value chain can emerge as a value sap: Connext is a group of capital superhighways and generates revenue through tolls\n\n\\#2 Value lies in the SDK. Connext is a B2B protocol that will behave like abstracted infrastructure within the logic of dApps. It strategically makes sense for dApps to have inter-chain functionality built into their ops as dApps will want to maintain users on their site for the whole cross-chain process, otherwise they risk losing the user to another competing dApp. Therefore, Connext’s capital plumbing will be of value.\n\nThis is not a long-term prediction; rather, dApp integration with cross-chain liquidity infrastructure is becoming a priority. Several takeaways from ETH Lisbon have discussed dApp teams needing to focus on solving for cross-chain capabilities.\n\n\\#3 Sizable TAM. The value of transactions going through bridges will be in the billions, and eventually trillions, assuming the multi-chain, multi-layer world develops. With some tweak-able conservative assumptions, Fee TAM is in the low billion single digits:\n\n\\#4 Great team with deep sub-sector expertise\n\n* Known amongst the *right* circles for their leadership in cross-chain bridging\n* Rich dev experience suitable for the complexity of the team’s goal\n* Past track record highlights ability to execute. Specifically, recent releases have been well received, and in circumstances of bugs, they were corrected and updated in a timely manner\n\n\\#5 Opportunities for value add combined with multiple exit strategies\n\n* Leverage network as integration opportunities for the Connext team\n* Assist with team hiring and community growth. Currently, the community is somewhat small as evidenced by experience on Discord. Achieving a community like Index Coop, where several BD strategies can be led by members, could formulate part of the go-to-market\n* Offer expertise on token economics design\n\nValue add is complemented by multiple paths to exit:\n\n* M&A: Can be acquired by another bridging solution, wallet provider (i.e. Metamask), or infrastructure company\n* Token (much more likely): Can go liquid via a token drop, with lockup expiry probably lying between 1–4 years\n\n## Catalysts\n\n\\#1 Growth of L2 ecosystems\n\n* Once more dApps onboard and bring transaction-intensive ops to L2s, ecosystem growth will really hit full tilt\n* Progress with development at [Arbitrum](https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1432817424752128008), [Optimism](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC/status/1453058217991229445), and other chains / rollups point to the imminence of this catalyst\n\n\\#2 High gas environment on Ethereum\n\n* Drives capital to other ‘cheap’ chains: Avalanche, Binance, and Fantom\n\n\\#3 Connext’s integrations with other frontends and applications\n\n* This will drive transaction flow to Connext and will lead to recognition of its cheap and fast cross-chain swapping mechanism. Progress with integrations is going well according to the team\n\n\\#4 Progress with liquidity expansion\n\n* Team recently selected the first cohort of routers\n\n## Risks\n\n\\#1 Smart contract risk\n\n* Cross-chain swapping attracts smart contract and game theory risks across the board. Part of the allure of being able to pull this infrastructure design off is matched by the higher burden of risk. Given that state channel-based bridging at scale hasn’t been done before, several *unknown unknowns* are present. Additionally, it is still early, and while the Connext team has made respectable progress to date, scalability and growth can introduce several issues that may not exist at this point in time\n\n\\#2 Execution risk\n\n* While the team has great experience, significant execution risk exists. It has yet to be seen whether this team can adequately scale a platform and turn it into an infrastructure layer provider like Chainlink or the Graph. Team hires and community growth will be key, a possible area of value add\n\n\\#3 PMF risk\n\n* Assuming PoS / MPC-based cross-chain swapping applications work at scale (in light of the aforementioned security tradeoffs), and dApps desire the ability to do more than swap cross-chain (i.e. general information delivery), then Connext will be at a disadvantage to protocols like Synapse and THORChain. These protocols would be able to bundle swapping with cross-chain data delivery in one offering\n\n\\#4 Aggregators win out over protocols\n\n* Several great minds in the space see value accrual power moving over to app-based aggregators. These will plug in and provide multiple services to users. If fee compression were to start hitting DeFi (some signs of this already), then aggregators would sit on top and find different revenue opportunities while bridge protocols could be commoditized\n\n## Potential Model\n\nDrivers:\n\n* Transaction Count\n* Average Transaction Value\n\nAssumptions:\n\nProjections:\n\nValuation:\n\n**Disclosure:** This blog series is strictly personal/ educational and is not investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell any assets.

Otherwise, the prestige of our country will be greatly damaged and the arrogance of the Majikhans will be encouraged.\"Ning's words immediately won the approval of most of the ministers present, who all nodded in support of ning's opinion.\n\nSitu Mingyue also nodded, \"Lu Aiqing, talk about your views.\"\n\n\"My minister's view is similar to Lord Ning's.The maqichan people had made thorough preparations for this military operation in advance, and not only the target country but also the neighboring countries including Our country were kept in the dark, which shows the degree of secrecy.Despite its small size, Anchun city is rich in copper resources, and the possession of it by the Majikhans would be a great boost to its industrial development, as well as an inestimable boost to its state finances.The kingdom of Jemelow, however, was largely flat and flat, suitable not only for horse movements by the Maki Khans, but also as an important breadbasket in the southern East Continent.Although everyone knows their sweat horse is a descendant of the nomads, but the considerable number of people had gradually adapted to the farming life, the country's demand for food is quite large, and its central is desert, desert steppe and forest around it, only near the northern China and southern border area in the east they are arable land,In the past ten years, their population has increased rapidly and their economy has developed rapidly, but the food problem cannot be solved all the time. Every year, they have to import a large amount of food from Our country and other neighboring countries. This is the main reason why the Maki Khanate has been eyeing Up Five Lakes in Our country.\"\n\nAfter a pause, he continued: \"Importing food is expensive and easy to control, as Pishli and Ray Kyaw Tin, both men of foresight, must have seen.The only way to solve this difficult problem is to find another way.Besides my own kingdom and the kingdom of Milan, the kingdom of Jemelow is the only one in the region that produces food, not to mention mine, which is growing fast, but is far from being able to compete with mine;The power of the Kingdom of Milan is not as strong as theirs, but it is not to be underestimated, and the kingdom of Milan and my country are close, if the use of troops against Milan, our country will not sit idly by, so the only target is the kingdom of Gemelo.We don't have a border with the Kingdom of Jemelot, and our relations are not so good. If we take special measures to solve the problem quickly, and make it a fait accompli, the Makhans probably think that we won't fight for it, and that no other country can threaten them at all.\"\n\nFinally, Lu Wenfu sighed and said, \"MY minister thinks that according to the actual situation of our country, we should take various ways and means to negotiate with the Majihan people and force them to withdraw.\"These last few words, Lu Wenfu oneself feel too weak, may is there the empire of the actual situation, the southern army military area command, though there are more than 20, but didn't prepare for war, let alone inside the empire and sanjiang county, Lin this menace, day south lang home also dishonest, an elusive, but their sweat horse with four hundred thousand troops,In addition to the two hundred thousand troops that had been sent to war, two hundred thousand troops, including one hundred thousand elite Royal guards, were stationed there.", "timestamp": 1635744890, "digest": "r-LpBj1mdmUPs09uDz-mS8cZPq3bFFFBR56_qVdWigg", "contributor": "0x9FB1c8b6196E5dEAC9ABb2A59CccB4e3D08DE271"}

Overall, Connext’s value lies in its future abstraction — it is ‘behind the scenes’ financial plumbing\n* Finally, Connext presents great opportunities for value add as well as multiple avenues to exit\n\n## Protocol\n\nConnext is an interoperability protocol for interacting between L1s and L2s. Without introducing any new trust assumptions or external validators, Connext’s NXTP (the protocol technology) lets users swap assets across L1s and L2s in an efficient and timely manner.\n\n* Note that the emphasis is on the word ‘swap’ and not ‘port’ or ‘migrate’. The current version of Connext cannot be used to pass arbitrary event data between chains; therefore, one cannot use the protocol to migrate a token from Chain A to B\n* Albeit, users will not become frustrated at this inability, as swapping USDC on BSC to USDC on Optimism is basically the same as migrating, except that it is cheaper and faster than using migrating-based bridges\n* NXTP is a lightweight, simple contract that uses a locking pattern, a network of off-chain routers that participate in pricing auctions and pass ‘calldata’ between chains, and a user-side SDK that finds routes and prompts on-chain transactions\n\nEcosystem Players:\n\nUsers\n\n* Interact with a front end that is powered by NXTP. Best example right now is [xPollinate](https://www.xpollinate.io/?fromChain=56&fromToken=0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955&toChain=100&toToken=0x4ecaba5870353805a9f068101a40e0f32ed605c6)\n* Undergo the transaction process (discussed below) to fulfill the need of swapping one asset from one chain for it on another chain / rollup\n\nRouters\n\n* These are the liquidity providers, which set up a pool of assets on two chains / rollups and link up with NXTP to provide liquidity for swaps\n\ndApps\n\n* Integrate with NXTP by using the SDK. They then can manage front ends that channel assets to the NXTP contract for swapping to occur\n\nTransaction Process:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_uRxvWuNNW1GUz-KSlIiX.png?height=228&width=640)\n\nThe process can be broken down into three phases:\n\n* Route action: the user broadcasts a message signaling their desired use of a specific bridging route. Routers respond with sealed bids containing commitments to fulfilling the transaction within a certain time and price range\n* Preparation of transaction: once a bidder is selected, the user submits a transaction containing the router’s signed bid to the contract on the user’s side. This consequently locks up their funds on the user chain. The router detects an event (sealed chosen bid message) and the contract locks up the assets on their side. This lock up is incorporative of their fees\n* Fulfillment: the user’s side will then receive a confirmation message of funds locked and it will send a signed message for a relayer to claim. This relayer (typically another router) will submit the transaction and receive a submission fee\n* Note that transactions can be cancelled unilaterally by the person owed funds on that chain (router for sending chain, user for receiving chain) prior to expiry\n\n## Adoption Metrics\n\nDaily Volume\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FlyC_C1ydjYsQZs6y_MXV.png?height=252&width=552)\n\nDaily Transaction Count\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/byd3GxNtuGob7a93riwKk.png?height=252&width=552)\n\nImplied Average Transaction Value\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R-sA5iAgVxCmuAUSgdEYk.png?height=252&width=552)\n\n## Team\n\n[Arjun Bhuptani](https://twitter.com/arjunbhuptani)\n\n* Connext, Co-founder & Project Lead (May 2017 — today)\n* Moloch DAO, Co-founder (Oct 2018 — today)\n* Colgate University, B.S. in Physics and B.A. in Philosophy\n\n*Notes:*\n\n* In the space since 2017, great experience and recognition\n* Known for a strong grasp of state channel mechanics and inter-chain flow of value and information\n* Previously, Connext used to focus on payments infrastructure within crypto and consequently solving for scalability became key\n\n[Layne Haber](https://twitter.com/LayneHaber)\n\n* Connext, Co-founder & Protocol Lead (Jun 2017 — today)\n* Arctica Health, Founder & CEO (May 2016 — Jun 2017)\n* UCLA, B.S. in Chemistry and Materials Science\n\n[Rahul Sethuram](https://twitter.com/RHLSTHRM)\n\n* Connext, Co-founder & CTO (Jun 2017 — today)\n* Lone Wolf Partners, Partner (Jan 2016 — today)\n* ColorTokens, Core Engineer (Jun 2015 — Apr 2017)\n* Tip’d Off, Co-founder (May 2014 — Jun 2015)\n* Tesla, Senior Test Engineer (Sep 2010 — May 2014)\n* Element Energy, Engineering Manager (Jun 2010 — Sep 2010)\n* UC Santa Cruz, B.S.

Also included investments from staking service providers (i.e. Blockdaemon, Figment, Stakefish) and ecosystem players (i.e. Edge and Node, Loopring, Arbitrum founders)\n\n## Competitive Analysis\n\nThere are three ways to approach interoperability between chains:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S3Z4zaz20vbVMFdb1k7fP.png?height=319&width=640)\n\nNarrow Competition\n\n*Hop Protocol*\n\n* A locally verified mechanism for sending tokens across rollups. Hop leverages existing arbitrary messaging bridges (“AMBs”) to send funds between chains, with a bonder (liquidity provider) fronting the capital to make the process fast. To incentivize rebalancing, the protocol also utilizes AMMs on both sides to swap between the “canonical” asset for a chain and hTokens, a representative asset used by the bonder\n* Since the proof of transfer is passed between chains using an AMB, Hop doesn’t need users to run off-chain code like Connext\n\nPresents the following tradeoffs:\n\n* Hop is less economically secure than Connext. It depends on AMBs, which means that if chains don’t have them, they need to be created. This introduces new security risks. Hop’s design also cuts corners like optimistic rollups’ seven day exit periods for settlement\n* Hop is less capital efficient. It requires both entry and exit liquidity given its AMM model on both sender and receiver chains. In contrast, Connext LPs only need exit liquidity and incur no liquidity lockup, “achieving 10x+ better capital usage”\n* Limitations to bonding. Bonders must pay gas costs based on Ethereum mainnet. Connext can have transactions go directly from L2 to L2 without touching the base layer\n* Bonders are exposed to MEV and transaction submission races, according to the Connext team. Transactions cannot be front run on Connext as the users negotiate route and pricing off-chain\n\n*Synapse*\n\n* Synapse conducts integral blockchain activities such as asset transfers, swaps, and generalized messaging with cross-chain functionality. The Synapse network is secured by cross-chain multi-party computation (“MPC”) validators operating with threshold signature schemes (“TSS”). The network is leaderless and maintains security by each validator running the same process upon receiving on-chain events. Once two-thirds of all validators have collectively signed the same transaction using their own individual key, the network achieves consensus and issues a transaction to the destination chain\n* Currently, validators are selected based on community governance and consensus. Upon reaching a certain project milestone, validators on the Synapse Network will have to stake $SYN to secure the network\n\nPresents the following tradeoffs:\n\n* While it can enable fast and efficient swaps, it introduces significant new trust primitives that can lead to increased security risk. With a whole new group of validators (currently selected by the community, which can be worrying) and game theory, Synapse adds complexity, whereas Connext bypasses it. Both can do the same thing when it comes to swaps, except that right now, Synapse can use its protocol ($SYN) to increase yields for pool deposits, creating increased liquidity in the short term\n* When compared to Connext, certain swapping routes are relatively complicated and involve several more swaps than needed. This may introduce issues pertaining to higher fees in the long run, as well as increased risks along the way\n\n![Representative screenshot from Synapse Docs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GsOHus8w7JgJgo69xWVzu.png?height=379&width=362)\n\nWide Competition\n\n*Ren*\n\n* Not necessarily trustless\n* Lacks scalable way to integrate with other chains / layers given its security configurations\n* Great for porting over assets, not necessarily moving value fast\n\n*Cosmos*\n\n* Works when all chains run on Tendermint / are a parachain\n* Expensive in terms of time and fees. Like Ren, the focus isn’t on moving value fast and efficiently\n\n*THORChain*\n\n* Positioned more as an L1<>L1 exchange that seeks to establish permissionless swapping between L1 native assets, using RUNE as a medium of exchange as well as for security collateral. There is a future where THORChain releases pools for rollup swaps, however, this is not within the project’s current core focus\n* Leads to increased security risk, whereas Connext inherits the security of the base chains it works on top off\n* If THORChain’s decentralized swapping capabilities prove successful and scalable, this could be a threat to Connext’s offerings pertaining to L1<>L1 swaps\n\n*Bridges*\n\n* Examples: Optimistic bridge, Near Rainbow bridge, Avalanche bridge\n* These lack the time and cost benefits that Connext offers, and in many ways, are the worst choices presented to users. They are crucial in the infrastructure they provide, but their use should be minimized to significant capital movements (in order to set up swapping pools and liquidity on the other side) as well as batch-settlement capital flows\n\n## Potential Investment Theses\n\n\\#1 If one underwrites the thesis of a multi-chain, multi-layer world, Connext offers a ‘project-neutral’ way to bet on it. At its essence, it is an infrastructure play and wins no matter which L1s and L2s prevail.\n\n* Competition in the L1 and L2 space can intensify, developing commodity-like market traits\n* The cross-chain bridging space, on the other hand, is indicative of [winner-take-all economics](https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/rne.2007.6.issue-1/rne.2007.6.1.1108/rne.2007.6.1.1108.pdf). With L1s or L2s, it makes sense for a user / dApp to use multiple ones (as they have different offerings); however, for a bridge aggregator technology, it makes more sense to use the best one that covers all ecosystems, rather than multiple ones\n* Location within the value chain can emerge as a value sap: Connext is a group of capital superhighways and generates revenue through tolls\n\n\\#2 Value lies in the SDK. Connext is a B2B protocol that will behave like abstracted infrastructure within the logic of dApps. It strategically makes sense for dApps to have inter-chain functionality built into their ops as dApps will want to maintain users on their site for the whole cross-chain process, otherwise they risk losing the user to another competing dApp. Therefore, Connext’s capital plumbing will be of value.\n\nThis is not a long-term prediction; rather, dApp integration with cross-chain liquidity infrastructure is becoming a priority. Several takeaways from ETH Lisbon have discussed dApp teams needing to focus on solving for cross-chain capabilities.\n\n\\#3 Sizable TAM. The value of transactions going through bridges will be in the billions, and eventually trillions, assuming the multi-chain, multi-layer world develops. With some tweak-able conservative assumptions, Fee TAM is in the low billion single digits:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ja967WGTTxrAcUD8VfNH_.png?height=120&width=640)\n\n\\#4 Great team with deep sub-sector expertise\n\n* Known amongst the *right* circles for their leadership in cross-chain bridging\n* Rich dev experience suitable for the complexity of the team’s goal\n* Past track record highlights ability to execute. Specifically, recent releases have been well received, and in circumstances of bugs, they were corrected and updated in a timely manner\n\n\\#5 Opportunities for value add combined with multiple exit strategies\n\n* Leverage network as integration opportunities for the Connext team\n* Assist with team hiring and community growth. Currently, the community is somewhat small as evidenced by experience on Discord. Achieving a community like Index Coop, where several BD strategies can be led by members, could formulate part of the go-to-market\n* Offer expertise on token economics design\n\nValue add is complemented by multiple paths to exit:\n\n* M&A: Can be acquired by another bridging solution, wallet provider (i.e. Metamask), or infrastructure company\n* Token (much more likely): Can go liquid via a token drop, with lockup expiry probably lying between 1–4 years\n\n## Catalysts\n\n\\#1 Growth of L2 ecosystems\n\n* Once more dApps onboard and bring transaction-intensive ops to L2s, ecosystem growth will really hit full tilt\n* Progress with development at [Arbitrum](https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1432817424752128008), [Optimism](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC/status/1453058217991229445), and other chains / rollups point to the imminence of this catalyst\n\n\\#2 High gas environment on Ethereum\n\n* Drives capital to other ‘cheap’ chains: Avalanche, Binance, and Fantom\n\n\\#3 Connext’s integrations with other frontends and applications\n\n* This will drive transaction flow to Connext and will lead to recognition of its cheap and fast cross-chain swapping mechanism. Progress with integrations is going well according to the team\n\n\\#4 Progress with liquidity expansion\n\n* Team recently selected the first cohort of routers\n\n## Risks\n\n\\#1 Smart contract risk\n\n* Cross-chain swapping attracts smart contract and game theory risks across the board. Part of the allure of being able to pull this infrastructure design off is matched by the higher burden of risk. Given that state channel-based bridging at scale hasn’t been done before, several *unknown unknowns* are present. Additionally, it is still early, and while the Connext team has made respectable progress to date, scalability and growth can introduce several issues that may not exist at this point in time\n\n\\#2 Execution risk\n\n* While the team has great experience, significant execution risk exists. It has yet to be seen whether this team can adequately scale a platform and turn it into an infrastructure layer provider like Chainlink or the Graph. Team hires and community growth will be key, a possible area of value add\n\n\\#3 PMF risk\n\n* Assuming PoS / MPC-based cross-chain swapping applications work at scale (in light of the aforementioned security tradeoffs), and dApps desire the ability to do more than swap cross-chain (i.e. general information delivery), then Connext will be at a disadvantage to protocols like Synapse and THORChain. These protocols would be able to bundle swapping with cross-chain data delivery in one offering\n\n\\#4 Aggregators win out over protocols\n\n* Several great minds in the space see value accrual power moving over to app-based aggregators. These will plug in and provide multiple services to users. If fee compression were to start hitting DeFi (some signs of this already), then aggregators would sit on top and find different revenue opportunities while bridge protocols could be commoditized\n\n## Potential Model\n\nDrivers:\n\n* Transaction Count\n* Average Transaction Value\n\nAssumptions:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jtAzAfnwQG-us4m0My0L8.png?height=127&width=351)\n\nProjections:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VLMrHFNpwDHlRUuWgCt4S.png?height=106&width=640)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m_M2MspCha5pSPb_3gO_n.png?height=209&width=640)\n\nValuation:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7yzHMVRfLnnR6686z9fle.png?height=214&width=552)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7NQt2ZuIpLOrPOY0Sa5S8.png?height=296&width=365)\n\n**Disclosure:** This blog series is strictly personal/ educational and is not investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell any assets.

The current version of Connext cannot be used to pass arbitrary event data between chains; therefore, one cannot use the protocol to migrate a token from Chain A to B\n* Albeit, users will not become frustrated at this inability, as swapping USDC on BSC to USDC on Optimism is basically the same as migrating, except that it is cheaper and faster than using migrating-based bridges\n* NXTP is a lightweight, simple contract that uses a locking pattern, a network of off-chain routers that participate in pricing auctions and pass ‘calldata’ between chains, and a user-side SDK that finds routes and prompts on-chain transactions\n\nEcosystem Players:\n\nUsers\n\n* Interact with a front end that is powered by NXTP. Best example right now is [xPollinate](https://www.xpollinate.io/?fromChain=56&fromToken=0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955&toChain=100&toToken=0x4ecaba5870353805a9f068101a40e0f32ed605c6)\n* Undergo the transaction process (discussed below) to fulfill the need of swapping one asset from one chain for it on another chain / rollup\n\nRouters\n\n* These are the liquidity providers, which set up a pool of assets on two chains / rollups and link up with NXTP to provide liquidity for swaps\n\ndApps\n\n* Integrate with NXTP by using the SDK. They then can manage front ends that channel assets to the NXTP contract for swapping to occur\n\nTransaction Process:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_uRxvWuNNW1GUz-KSlIiX.png?height=228&width=640)\n\nThe process can be broken down into three phases:\n\n* Route action: the user broadcasts a message signaling their desired use of a specific bridging route. Routers respond with sealed bids containing commitments to fulfilling the transaction within a certain time and price range\n* Preparation of transaction: once a bidder is selected, the user submits a transaction containing the router’s signed bid to the contract on the user’s side. This consequently locks up their funds on the user chain. The router detects an event (sealed chosen bid message) and the contract locks up the assets on their side. This lock up is incorporative of their fees\n* Fulfillment: the user’s side will then receive a confirmation message of funds locked and it will send a signed message for a relayer to claim. This relayer (typically another router) will submit the transaction and receive a submission fee\n* Note that transactions can be cancelled unilaterally by the person owed funds on that chain (router for sending chain, user for receiving chain) prior to expiry\n\n## Adoption Metrics\n\nDaily Volume\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FlyC_C1ydjYsQZs6y_MXV.png?height=252&width=552)\n\nDaily Transaction Count\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/byd3GxNtuGob7a93riwKk.png?height=252&width=552)\n\nImplied Average Transaction Value\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R-sA5iAgVxCmuAUSgdEYk.png?height=252&width=552)\n\n## Team\n\n[Arjun Bhuptani](https://twitter.com/arjunbhuptani)\n\n* Connext, Co-founder & Project Lead (May 2017 — today)\n* Moloch DAO, Co-founder (Oct 2018 — today)\n* Colgate University, B.S. in Physics and B.A. in Philosophy\n\n*Notes:*\n\n* In the space since 2017, great experience and recognition\n* Known for a strong grasp of state channel mechanics and inter-chain flow of value and information\n* Previously, Connext used to focus on payments infrastructure within crypto and consequently solving for scalability became key\n\n[Layne Haber](https://twitter.com/LayneHaber)\n\n* Connext, Co-founder & Protocol Lead (Jun 2017 — today)\n* Arctica Health, Founder & CEO (May 2016 — Jun 2017)\n* UCLA, B.S. in Chemistry and Materials Science\n\n[Rahul Sethuram](https://twitter.com/RHLSTHRM)\n\n* Connext, Co-founder & CTO (Jun 2017 — today)\n* Lone Wolf Partners, Partner (Jan 2016 — today)\n* ColorTokens, Core Engineer (Jun 2015 — Apr 2017)\n* Tip’d Off, Co-founder (May 2014 — Jun 2015)\n* Tesla, Senior Test Engineer (Sep 2010 — May 2014)\n* Element Energy, Engineering Manager (Jun 2010 — Sep 2010)\n* UC Santa Cruz, B.S.

Also included investments from staking service providers (i.e. Blockdaemon, Figment, Stakefish) and ecosystem players (i.e. Edge and Node, Loopring, Arbitrum founders)\n\n## Competitive Analysis\n\nThere are three ways to approach interoperability between chains:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S3Z4zaz20vbVMFdb1k7fP.png?height=319&width=640)\n\nNarrow Competition\n\n*Hop Protocol*\n\n* A locally verified mechanism for sending tokens across rollups. Hop leverages existing arbitrary messaging bridges (“AMBs”) to send funds between chains, with a bonder (liquidity provider) fronting the capital to make the process fast. To incentivize rebalancing, the protocol also utilizes AMMs on both sides to swap between the “canonical” asset for a chain and hTokens, a representative asset used by the bonder\n* Since the proof of transfer is passed between chains using an AMB, Hop doesn’t need users to run off-chain code like Connext\n\nPresents the following tradeoffs:\n\n* Hop is less economically secure than Connext. It depends on AMBs, which means that if chains don’t have them, they need to be created. This introduces new security risks. Hop’s design also cuts corners like optimistic rollups’ seven day exit periods for settlement\n* Hop is less capital efficient. It requires both entry and exit liquidity given its AMM model on both sender and receiver chains. In contrast, Connext LPs only need exit liquidity and incur no liquidity lockup, “achieving 10x+ better capital usage”\n* Limitations to bonding. Bonders must pay gas costs based on Ethereum mainnet. Connext can have transactions go directly from L2 to L2 without touching the base layer\n* Bonders are exposed to MEV and transaction submission races, according to the Connext team. Transactions cannot be front run on Connext as the users negotiate route and pricing off-chain\n\n*Synapse*\n\n* Synapse conducts integral blockchain activities such as asset transfers, swaps, and generalized messaging with cross-chain functionality. The Synapse network is secured by cross-chain multi-party computation (“MPC”) validators operating with threshold signature schemes (“TSS”). The network is leaderless and maintains security by each validator running the same process upon receiving on-chain events. Once two-thirds of all validators have collectively signed the same transaction using their own individual key, the network achieves consensus and issues a transaction to the destination chain\n* Currently, validators are selected based on community governance and consensus. Upon reaching a certain project milestone, validators on the Synapse Network will have to stake $SYN to secure the network\n\nPresents the following tradeoffs:\n\n* While it can enable fast and efficient swaps, it introduces significant new trust primitives that can lead to increased security risk. With a whole new group of validators (currently selected by the community, which can be worrying) and game theory, Synapse adds complexity, whereas Connext bypasses it. Both can do the same thing when it comes to swaps, except that right now, Synapse can use its protocol ($SYN) to increase yields for pool deposits, creating increased liquidity in the short term\n* When compared to Connext, certain swapping routes are relatively complicated and involve several more swaps than needed. This may introduce issues pertaining to higher fees in the long run, as well as increased risks along the way\n\n![Representative screenshot from Synapse Docs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GsOHus8w7JgJgo69xWVzu.png?height=379&width=362)\n\nWide Competition\n\n*Ren*\n\n* Not necessarily trustless\n* Lacks scalable way to integrate with other chains / layers given its security configurations\n* Great for porting over assets, not necessarily moving value fast\n\n*Cosmos*\n\n* Works when all chains run on Tendermint / are a parachain\n* Expensive in terms of time and fees. Like Ren, the focus isn’t on moving value fast and efficiently\n\n*THORChain*\n\n* Positioned more as an L1<>L1 exchange that seeks to establish permissionless swapping between L1 native assets, using RUNE as a medium of exchange as well as for security collateral. There is a future where THORChain releases pools for rollup swaps, however, this is not within the project’s current core focus\n* Leads to increased security risk, whereas Connext inherits the security of the base chains it works on top off\n* If THORChain’s decentralized swapping capabilities prove successful and scalable, this could be a threat to Connext’s offerings pertaining to L1<>L1 swaps\n\n*Bridges*\n\n* Examples: Optimistic bridge, Near Rainbow bridge, Avalanche bridge\n* These lack the time and cost benefits that Connext offers, and in many ways, are the worst choices presented to users. They are crucial in the infrastructure they provide, but their use should be minimized to significant capital movements (in order to set up swapping pools and liquidity on the other side) as well as batch-settlement capital flows\n\n## Potential Investment Theses\n\n\\#1 If one underwrites the thesis of a multi-chain, multi-layer world, Connext offers a ‘project-neutral’ way to bet on it. At its essence, it is an infrastructure play and wins no matter which L1s and L2s prevail.\n\n* Competition in the L1 and L2 space can intensify, developing commodity-like market traits\n* The cross-chain bridging space, on the other hand, is indicative of [winner-take-all economics](https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/rne.2007.6.issue-1/rne.2007.6.1.1108/rne.2007.6.1.1108.pdf). With L1s or L2s, it makes sense for a user / dApp to use multiple ones (as they have different offerings); however, for a bridge aggregator technology, it makes more sense to use the best one that covers all ecosystems, rather than multiple ones\n* Location within the value chain can emerge as a value sap: Connext is a group of capital superhighways and generates revenue through tolls\n\n\\#2 Value lies in the SDK. Connext is a B2B protocol that will behave like abstracted infrastructure within the logic of dApps. It strategically makes sense for dApps to have inter-chain functionality built into their ops as dApps will want to maintain users on their site for the whole cross-chain process, otherwise they risk losing the user to another competing dApp. Therefore, Connext’s capital plumbing will be of value.\n\nThis is not a long-term prediction; rather, dApp integration with cross-chain liquidity infrastructure is becoming a priority. Several takeaways from ETH Lisbon have discussed dApp teams needing to focus on solving for cross-chain capabilities.\n\n\\#3 Sizable TAM. The value of transactions going through bridges will be in the billions, and eventually trillions, assuming the multi-chain, multi-layer world develops. With some tweak-able conservative assumptions, Fee TAM is in the low billion single digits:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ja967WGTTxrAcUD8VfNH_.png?height=120&width=640)\n\n\\#4 Great team with deep sub-sector expertise\n\n* Known amongst the *right* circles for their leadership in cross-chain bridging\n* Rich dev experience suitable for the complexity of the team’s goal\n* Past track record highlights ability to execute. Specifically, recent releases have been well received, and in circumstances of bugs, they were corrected and updated in a timely manner\n\n\\#5 Opportunities for value add combined with multiple exit strategies\n\n* Leverage network as integration opportunities for the Connext team\n* Assist with team hiring and community growth. Currently, the community is somewhat small as evidenced by experience on Discord. Achieving a community like Index Coop, where several BD strategies can be led by members, could formulate part of the go-to-market\n* Offer expertise on token economics design\n\nValue add is complemented by multiple paths to exit:\n\n* M&A: Can be acquired by another bridging solution, wallet provider (i.e. Metamask), or infrastructure company\n* Token (much more likely): Can go liquid via a token drop, with lockup expiry probably lying between 1–4 years\n\n## Catalysts\n\n\\#1 Growth of L2 ecosystems\n\n* Once more dApps onboard and bring transaction-intensive ops to L2s, ecosystem growth will really hit full tilt\n* Progress with development at [Arbitrum](https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1432817424752128008), [Optimism](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC/status/1453058217991229445), and other chains / rollups point to the imminence of this catalyst\n\n\\#2 High gas environment on Ethereum\n\n* Drives capital to other ‘cheap’ chains: Avalanche, Binance, and Fantom\n\n\\#3 Connext’s integrations with other frontends and applications\n\n* This will drive transaction flow to Connext and will lead to recognition of its cheap and fast cross-chain swapping mechanism. Progress with integrations is going well according to the team\n\n\\#4 Progress with liquidity expansion\n\n* Team recently selected the first cohort of routers\n\n## Risks\n\n\\#1 Smart contract risk\n\n* Cross-chain swapping attracts smart contract and game theory risks across the board. Part of the allure of being able to pull this infrastructure design off is matched by the higher burden of risk. Given that state channel-based bridging at scale hasn’t been done before, several *unknown unknowns* are present. Additionally, it is still early, and while the Connext team has made respectable progress to date, scalability and growth can introduce several issues that may not exist at this point in time\n\n\\#2 Execution risk\n\n* While the team has great experience, significant execution risk exists. It has yet to be seen whether this team can adequately scale a platform and turn it into an infrastructure layer provider like Chainlink or the Graph. Team hires and community growth will be key, a possible area of value add\n\n\\#3 PMF risk\n\n* Assuming PoS / MPC-based cross-chain swapping applications work at scale (in light of the aforementioned security tradeoffs), and dApps desire the ability to do more than swap cross-chain (i.e. general information delivery), then Connext will be at a disadvantage to protocols like Synapse and THORChain. These protocols would be able to bundle swapping with cross-chain data delivery in one offering\n\n\\#4 Aggregators win out over protocols\n\n* Several great minds in the space see value accrual power moving over to app-based aggregators. These will plug in and provide multiple services to users. If fee compression were to start hitting DeFi (some signs of this already), then aggregators would sit on top and find different revenue opportunities while bridge protocols could be commoditized\n\n## Potential Model\n\nDrivers:\n\n* Transaction Count\n* Average Transaction Value\n\nAssumptions:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jtAzAfnwQG-us4m0My0L8.png?height=127&width=351)\n\nProjections:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VLMrHFNpwDHlRUuWgCt4S.png?height=106&width=640)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m_M2MspCha5pSPb_3gO_n.png?height=209&width=640)\n\nValuation:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7yzHMVRfLnnR6686z9fle.png?height=214&width=552)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7NQt2ZuIpLOrPOY0Sa5S8.png?height=296&width=365)\n\n**Disclosure:** *This blog series is strictly personal/ educational and is not investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell any assets.

Overall, Connext’s value lies in its future abstraction — it is ‘behind the scenes’ financial plumbing\n* Finally, Connext presents great opportunities for value add as well as multiple avenues to exit\n\n## Protocol\n\nConnext is an interoperability protocol for interacting between L1s and L2s.

With L1s or L2s, it makes sense for a user / dApp to use multiple ones (as they have different offerings); however, for a bridge aggregator technology, it makes more sense to use the best one that covers all ecosystems, rather than multiple ones\n* Location within the value chain can emerge as a value sap: Connext is a group of capital superhighways and generates revenue through tolls\n\n\\#2 Value lies in the SDK. Connext is a B2B protocol that will behave like abstracted infrastructure within the logic of dApps. It strategically makes sense for dApps to have inter-chain functionality built into their ops as dApps will want to maintain users on their site for the whole cross-chain process, otherwise they risk losing the user to another competing dApp. Therefore, Connext’s capital plumbing will be of value.\n\nThis is not a long-term prediction; rather, dApp integration with cross-chain liquidity infrastructure is becoming a priority. Several takeaways from ETH Lisbon have discussed dApp teams needing to focus on solving for cross-chain capabilities.\n\n\\#3 Sizable TAM. The value of transactions going through bridges will be in the billions, and eventually trillions, assuming the multi-chain, multi-layer world develops. With some tweak-able conservative assumptions, Fee TAM is in the low billion single digits:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ja967WGTTxrAcUD8VfNH_.png?height=120&width=640)\n\n\\#4 Great team with deep sub-sector expertise\n\n* Known amongst the *right* circles for their leadership in cross-chain bridging\n* Rich dev experience suitable for the complexity of the team’s goal\n* Past track record highlights ability to execute. Specifically, recent releases have been well received, and in circumstances of bugs, they were corrected and updated in a timely manner\n\n\\#5 Opportunities for value add combined with multiple exit strategies\n\n* Leverage network as integration opportunities for the Connext team\n* Assist with team hiring and community growth. Currently, the community is somewhat small as evidenced by experience on Discord. Achieving a community like Index Coop, where several BD strategies can be led by members, could formulate part of the go-to-market\n* Offer expertise on token economics design\n\nValue add is complemented by multiple paths to exit:\n\n* M&A: Can be acquired by another bridging solution, wallet provider (i.e. Metamask), or infrastructure company\n* Token (much more likely): Can go liquid via a token drop, with lockup expiry probably lying between 1–4 years\n\n## Catalysts\n\n\\#1 Growth of L2 ecosystems\n\n* Once more dApps onboard and bring transaction-intensive ops to L2s, ecosystem growth will really hit full tilt\n* Progress with development at [Arbitrum](https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1432817424752128008), [Optimism](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC/status/1453058217991229445), and other chains / rollups point to the imminence of this catalyst\n\n\\#2 High gas environment on Ethereum\n\n* Drives capital to other ‘cheap’ chains: Avalanche, Binance, and Fantom\n\n\\#3 Connext’s integrations with other frontends and applications\n\n* This will drive transaction flow to Connext and will lead to recognition of its cheap and fast cross-chain swapping mechanism. Progress with integrations is going well according to the team\n\n\\#4 Progress with liquidity expansion\n\n* Team recently selected the first cohort of routers\n\n## Risks\n\n\\#1 Smart contract risk\n\n* Cross-chain swapping attracts smart contract and game theory risks across the board. Part of the allure of being able to pull this infrastructure design off is matched by the higher burden of risk. Given that state channel-based bridging at scale hasn’t been done before, several *unknown unknowns* are present. Additionally, it is still early, and while the Connext team has made respectable progress to date, scalability and growth can introduce several issues that may not exist at this point in time\n\n\\#2 Execution risk\n\n* While the team has great experience, significant execution risk exists. It has yet to be seen whether this team can adequately scale a platform and turn it into an infrastructure layer provider like Chainlink or the Graph. Team hires and community growth will be key, a possible area of value add\n\n\\#3 PMF risk\n\n* Assuming PoS / MPC-based cross-chain swapping applications work at scale (in light of the aforementioned security tradeoffs), and dApps desire the ability to do more than swap cross-chain (i.e. general information delivery), then Connext will be at a disadvantage to protocols like Synapse and THORChain. These protocols would be able to bundle swapping with cross-chain data delivery in one offering\n\n\\#4 Aggregators win out over protocols\n\n* Several great minds in the space see value accrual power moving over to app-based aggregators. These will plug in and provide multiple services to users. If fee compression were to start hitting DeFi (some signs of this already), then aggregators would sit on top and find different revenue opportunities while bridge protocols could be commoditized\n\n## Potential Model\n\nDrivers:\n\n* Transaction Count\n* Average Transaction Value\n\nAssumptions:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jtAzAfnwQG-us4m0My0L8.png?height=127&width=351)\n\nProjections:\n\nValuation:\n\n**Disclosure:** This blog series is strictly personal/ educational and is not investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell any assets.

It's a validation. \" \n  \n With her signature bob haircut and dark sunglasses, Wintour is considered the most powerful figure in fashion. \n  \n When asked what a good cover should do, Wintour replied, \"A cover's a poster. It has to look like Vogue. It has to be a strong image. It has to be seductive.\" \n  \n \"Can being on the cover of Vogue change a model's career?\" asked Altschul. \n  \n \"It certainly will make everybody take notice of you in a way that they haven't before.\" \n  \n Now the magazine is taking note of its famous covers for its 120th anniversary in 2012. \n  \n Wintour, contributor Dodie Kazanjian and international editor-at-large Hamish Bowles have compiled a book of the magazine's most famous covers. \n  \n Started as a weekly magazine for high society New Yorkers, early Vogue covers featured well-polished young women known as \"Gibson girls,\" named after the illustrator who created the look. \n  \n \"A Vogue cover really holds a mirror up to its time,\" said Bowles. \n  \n In 1909, publishing big shot Conde Nast bought Vogue, and used the cover to reach a wider upscale audience. \n  \n \"Suddenly you see a totally different atmosphere,\" said Bowles. \"You have this explosion of color for a start - really wonderful world-class illustrators start to produce covers which become kind of abstract and fanciful, and certainly aspirational.\" \n  \n Art deco and the jazz age inspired covers in the coming years, but the real change came in 1932 with the first color photo cover by photography pioneer Edward Steichen. \n  \n Since then, legendary photographers like Cecil Beaton, Irving Penn and Annie Liebovitz have shot the most famous cover in the fashion. \n  \n CBS \"I like to think they all have the Vogue stamp, but I don't like the idea of them all looking identical,\" Wintour said. \n  \n By the '70s and '80s, many covers had come to look identical. It was time for a change. \n  \n So when the British-born mother of two took over American Vogue in 1988 after running the U.K. version, Wintour turned the fashion world upside-down . . . starting with her very first cover. \n  \n \"It was totally unplanned,\" she said. \n  \n Wintour used an image never intended for the cover, featuring an Israeli model wearing jeans. \n  \n \"And I just said, 'Well, let's just try this.' And off we went. It was just very natural. To me it just said, 'This is something new. This is something different.' And I remember the printers called us up because they thought we'd made a mistake - just wanting to check that that actually WAS the cover!\" \n  \n \"It was really radical,\" said Bowles. \"In every way, it broke every kind of prescribed boundary and rule that had existed up 'til then.\" \n  \n Wintour continued to push boundaries by putting celebrities on the cover instead of supermodels - a revolutionary move at the time. \n  \n \"I remember getting quite a bit of criticism for my first Madonna cover - you know, 'She's not in vogue, she'll never sell,'\" recalled Wintour. \"It was a little bit risky.\" \n  \n But sales on newsstands shot up, Wintour said. \"Something extraordinary, like 40 percent. So that was an eye-opener to all of us.\" \n  \n \"But you knew something? Or you just followed your instinct?\" asked Altschul. \n  \n \"I didn't know anything,\" Wintour said. \"I never pay any attention. I'm sure it's not such a good way to be, but I don't really follow market research. And in the end I do respond to my own instincts. Sometimes they're successful, and obviously sometimes they're not. But you have to, I think, remain true to what you believe in.\"", "timestamp": 1635748827, "digest": "RypuqYg7Wo86nane3Ml840oso4JU4gFKTzcUZCrv8lA", "contributor": "0x528F2AbCD700ba6CD101050a12c87D3CD0dBC4bf"}

{"id": "f_VBmjHC3qWPwYUfzF5_WiY8dJhCKec8ekwiO3TZA-Y", "title": "Various problems that may appear in the process of computer information management\n\n", "body": "1\\.1 the network security problem of the computer itself, the so-called network security, refers to the computer on the basis of the construction of communication network, protect computer hardware, operating systems, databases, and applications from sabotage or theft with a number of security techniques. The protection of these information resources constitutes the traditional protection of network security. The factors that can interfere with the computer’s own network security are as follows. The first is subjective. Because the professional quality of the computer network managers themselves has not reached a qualified standard, so the computer’s own network security management has not been given enough attention, at the same time, its own information protection technology on the computer has not reached a qualified standard. Next is the objective factor. Here also includes several important aspects, first of all is the limitation which the network resource sharing produces. Because of the network, the earth is shrinking from the vast expanse of the planet to a global village, the sharing of resources between the Internet can provide us with great convenience, but it also leaves plenty of room for hackers to disrupt the system. It is based on this situation, resulting in the difficulty of network security information management in the form of an exponential rise. The third point is the network system’s own design flaw. This is a complex issue, which includes many aspects, such as network equipment selection errors, such as the network protocol itself is not reasonable, or improper operation may cause unimaginable hidden trouble to the whole computer network. And the last one is a man-made attack. Hackers often seize some weak links in the network system to attack, and this kind of high-tech malicious attack is the most difficult to guard against, for the network security threat is the greatest. 1.2 disclosure of computer information computer information security has been around since the rise of the computer internet. In spite of the continuous development of computer technology and the exponential growth of computer functions, the problem of computer information security has always been a major problem. The technical progress of the computer goes hand in hand with the information encryption and cracking technology of the computer. The two sides have never stopped fighting in the computer field. At the same time, with the continuous improvement of computer equipment, people’s knowledge reserve of the corresponding computer security technology is becoming more and more insufficient. The hardware and functions of the computer are improving, but people’s knowledge about the leak is still in the same place, which directly causes the computer users’consciousness of self-protection to become weaker and weaker. At the same time, the constant updating of computer hardware and software makes the corresponding security information security system more and more complex, more and more loopholes, so its media information protection function also appears to be very imperfect. 2 on the Information Management Link, we improve the security policy thought discussion 2.1 under the non-network structure to solve the problem thought construction first is that we should start from the system foundation, evaluate the security and confidentiality of the whole system, and protect the system accordingly. Secondly, we try not to repair the original internal network on a large scale, but to maintain the inherent characteristics of the original network. Only in this way can we minimize the secondary vulnerability caused by refixing. Third, the system should be easy to operate and maintain, while maintaining the idea of automated management. This can greatly reduce the energy cost of manual operation. In addition, the additional action should be as much as possible to reduce, to avoid the “Do more wrong”situation, reduce the chance of misoperation. Fourth, in the use of the system to choose a higher security performance of the system operation, to avoid the basic selection errors caused by the vulnerability of intrusion. 2.2 the construction of the security policy of the network security itself is to deepen the network management of the computer. If you want to protect the computer information from external forces to steal and damage, it is necessary to take action from the beginning of network management, to verify the identity of the visitors on the computer, to determine the identity of the computer administrator, at the same time, the computer-related network system is clearly improved. Identify yourself before you go online, check and verify the information you use after you go online, and delete any information that might be harmful to the Internet. For those who have been identified on the network security damage to the information will be reported in a timely manner, the management to deal with the timely. Next is carries on the standard and the consummation to the computer operator’s operation, carries on the enhancement to the computer information own defense consciousness. The first step is to determine the level of confidentiality of the corresponding documents. Users of the computer can not transfer confidential documents to the Internet for transmission or storage, it is necessary to develop a good idea of information protection under the premise of good information security. In the case of the use of confidential information to first check the current network security, to ensure that there is no Trojan horse and vulnerabilities in the current use of confidential documents. In the process of operating these information, we should protect and purify the operating environment, close the network window or the software which has nothing to do with the operation, and enable the safe and reliable antivirus software to process. After the information transmission processing is finished, must carry on a thorough investigation against the virus to kill. The information can be encrypted for storage and processing when it is determined that there is nothing wrong with the environment. The third point, must carry on the unceasing revision and consummation to the information security management system. All kinds of anti-virus auxiliary measures are temporary measures, the real source is the strict system. In order to protect the security of computer information more effectively, it is necessary to ensure the establishment of strict and systematic management system, and to perfect and standardize the computer security prevention system, to prevent unauthorized users on the system’s illegal operation and access, while ensuring the normal and safe operation of the computer system. Of particular note is the need to protect the external input equipment of the computer as well as the part of the network line output and input, carry out regular arrangement and inspection of the whole running environment of the computer and the running conditions of the computer, deal with the problems found in time and solve them effectively, ensure that the database security problem of the computer is handled in time. The problem of computer electromagnetic leakage must be solved, on the basis of which the security and protection of internal information must be carried out, and the practice of high-level encryption technology for network information must be carried out, to the data also must carry on the high-end confidentiality processing mentality construction. Only in this way can guarantee the efficient operation of computer information while improving network security management. The fourth point, must carry on the reasonable and the security design to the computer operation system. The embodiment of high-efficiency security of computer is a security system. If the running system of the computer is reasonably optimized and improved to ensure the scientific and confidential nature of the computer itself, and the information is processed efficiently by means of non-single subsection processing, at the same time through the physical and logical segmentation of the local area network control and security precautions. The construction of the computer firewall to strengthen, access control aspects should also be optimized, only in this way to ensure the overall security of the computer. Conclusion the application of computer information management in network security is a very important topic, the computer information management has been paid more and more attention. Only by optimizing and perfecting the management of computer information from many aspects can we ensure the safety of computer network and serve the people’s production and life.\n\n[ \n ](javascript:;)", "timestamp": 1635749232, "digest": "38Pg9_l5ELS0HIyeT0draIkdNanyHp_vdNvPLvQmBho", "contributor": "0x528F2AbCD700ba6CD101050a12c87D3CD0dBC4bf"}

{"id": "-HxwEAWK-oGWbch3BcC79e28BvgOXKg33i9qIot2lsY", "title": "Firewall; Network security; Technology", "body": "A, based on computer network security firewall technology (a) the concept of firewall technology is refers to between two network simple barrier erected a safety protection network, in the ordinary users is reflected in the user between the network and the Internet, in order to block the external network to the user the threat of mesh belt and control the invasion of the virus. It \u0003 about the computer network security problem based on firewall technology upgrade this graduation thesis The biggest role is to protect the security of the computer, improve the effective control of network communication, in the allowed case to accept the allowed packets, and reject and reject all the non-accepted packets. In essence, the essence of the firewall function is effective to control data flow and cloud data transferring between the zin, limit the unauthorized access external network, makes the external data can be in accordance with the requirements of the users and set of solutions to ensure that the data and information flow into and outflow, itself has the stronger ability to resist external attack, can ensure the safety of the user to use a computer network Network, to protect the user computer to avoid being attacked by hackers and achieve computer network and information security. (2) the working principle and main function of the firewall (1) the working principle of the firewall. Firewall technology is used to control the flow of data connected between networks. In practice, the main work of firewall technology in computer network is a group of routers between the protected network and the external Internet. Simply put, in computer network security, the firewall plays a gatekeeper role and is the most critical step, that is, in general only authorized data is allowed through. The firewall basically has the following properties, as long as it is through the internal network and the external Internet between all data flows must go through the firewall. Data flows that want to enter a computer through a firewall must and must comply with the security policy. The security performance of the firewall must have the following attributes: Data must pass through the firewall; Second, only authorized data can pass through the firewall under the security policy of the protected network. Finally through the above steps can be through the firewall. (2) the main role of the firewall. At present, firewall technology has been mature and effective should be carried to realize the computer network security protection above, and is very widely applied to the Internet. The role of the firewall is mainly reflected in three aspects: first, to protect the internal network system from infringement; Second, control the external network access to the internal network system; Third, to prevent information leakage of the internal network system. The preferred firewall can improve the security of the computer network and reduce the risk of the internal network by filtering out insecure network services. Therefore, through strict firewall to control the guarantee, can make the internal network environment by less external risk, and will not be used by hacker attacks, also in this case can use some more secure network services. For services such as NFS or DIS that cannot be missed in the LAN, the public mode can be adopted to reduce the burden and ensure the normal operation of the internal network management system. Of course, the firewall has its own ability to effectively limit the access of external networks to internal networks. Finally, the firewall is used to divide the internal information into grids, and the key grids are isolated and protected, which can limit the mutual access of different departments in the internal network and ensure the security of the internal network information so that it will not be leaked. For individual users, personal privacy is a very important issue in the internal network. An insignificant internal network can attract the attention of hackers, which can cause the leakage of personal privacy in the internal network, and even expose some security loopholes in the internal network. Therefore, the use of firewall can effectively protect those important privacy content. A firewall can hide a lot of information, such as the user name, information displayed on Finger and DNS information of the internal network, so that the IP address or domain name of a computer will not be known to the outside world, and the internal system will not be easily attacked by hackers to lose these important information. Two, the main technical ways and means of the firewall (1) packet filtering technology, in simple terms, is to intercept all the FLOW through the IP packet, generally from its IP head to the transmission protocol head, in this to obtain the information filtering. (2) Shielding router technology, which is a very popular technology at present, mainly plays an effective role in the network layer and adopts packet filtering technology. The physical network interface is first reached, followed by the original IP address, and then the target IP address, source port, and target port. (3) firewall technology based on proxy, generally speaking, firewall technology based on proxy usually has two network interface cards, access to the internal network and external network at the same time. Because the gateway can communicate with both networks, it can choose an ideal location when installing the data transfer software. That's why we call the software \"agent,\" which is basically software customized for the service it provides. In this technology, the proxy service does not allow direct communication with the real service, but through the proxy server, in fact, the default gateway of the user is determined in the proxy server, so that the hacker can not effectively attack the user network, which is very effective against known or unknown attacks. With the rapid development of the network, firewall technology is constantly updated progress, in short, in the future development of the firewall operation and structure will have great improvement and progress. In the future, we will vigorously develop firewall technology and anti-intrusion, anti-virus and other ways to combine, and strive to establish a perfect computer network protection system.\n\n[ \n ](javascript:;)", "timestamp": 1635749617, "digest": "G4Ns24luWOjadkIax31N7PCZtp5t6pvreCi3hvPii4g", "contributor": "0x528F2AbCD700ba6CD101050a12c87D3CD0dBC4bf"}
{"id": "XMB2A1B2tsOoBRtw3nphjEBtLuVVojCaZWbUtWMPDIY", "title": "Network Security; Preventive Measures; Vulnerability; Antivirus; encryption\n\n", "body": "In recent years, threats to network security have been occurring constantly, especially in countries and departments where computer and network technology are developing rapidly. A number of countries and departments continue to be hacked together, the main threats against network security are: (1) software vulnerabilities. Every operating system or network software can not be free of flaws and vulnerabilities, which puts our computers in a dangerous situation, once connected to the network, will become a target. (2) misconfiguration. Security vulnerabilities, such as firewall software that is not configured correctly, are ineffective. For a specific web application, when it starts, it opens a series of security gaps, and many of the applications that are bundled with the database of web articles will also be enabled. Unless the user disables the program or configures it correctly, security concerns persist. (3) lack of safety awareness. Careless choice of user’s password or transferring or sharing your account with others will threaten the network security. The virus. The current number one enemy of data security is the computer virus, which is the insertion of a computer program by its creator that destroys a computer’s function or data, a set of computer instructions or program Code that affects the normal operation of computer software and hardware. The computer virus is infectious, parasitic, covert, triggering, destructive and so on. Therefore, to improve the prevention of virus without delay. (5) hacking. Another aspect of the threat to computer data security comes from hackers. The computer hacker uses the security flaw in the system to enter others ‘computer system illegally, its harm is very big. In a sense, hackers do more harm to information security than ordinary computer viruses. Computer network security threats and preventive measures reference attribute evaluation 2. Computer network security preventive measures (1) software anti-virus technology. Strengthen the security awareness of internal network managers and users. Many computer systems use passwords to control access to system resources. This is one of the easiest and most economical ways to prevent viruses. Good antivirus software can be easily installed on every NT server in your organization in a matter of minutes, and can be downloaded and distributed to all purpose machines, centrally set up and managed by Network administrator, it will be closely integrated with operating systems and other security measures, become part of network security management, and automatically provide the best protection against network viruses. When the computer virus attacks the applications of online resources, such viruses exist on the network media for information sharing, so it is necessary to set up security in the gateway, in the network front-end antivirus. (2) Fire Wall Technology. Firewall is a kind of special network interconnection equipment which is used to strengthen the access control between networks, to prevent the external network users from entering the internal network by illegal means, to access the internal network resources, and to protect the internal network operating environment. It checks packets such as links between two or more networks according to a certain security policy to determine whether communication between networks is allowed and to monitor the running state of the network. It is predicted that the world firewall demand growth rate will reach 174% in 5 years. Although the firewall is an effective means to protect the network from hackers at present, it needs to be explained that the firewall can only resist the intrusion from the external network, but can not do anything to the security of the enterprise’s internal network. To ensure the security of intranet, it is necessary to control and manage it effectively. Secure data encryption technology. Data encryption technology is a kind of technology means to recode the information, so as to hide the content of the information and make it impossible for the illegal user to get the true content of the information. The emergence of encryption technology to the global E-COMMERCE, thus enabling Inter-based electronic trading systems, so that the perfect symmetric encryption and public-key cryptography technology is still the mainstream of the 21st century. Symmetric encryption is a conventional password-based technique in which encryption and decryption operations use the same key. Asymmetric encryption, that is, the encryption key is different from the decryption key, the encryption key is public, anyone can use it, only the decryption key knows. Operating System Security and physical security measures for network hosts. In order to ensure the physical security of information network system, it is necessary to prevent the diffusion of information in space. Usually in the physical to take certain protective measures to reduce or interfere with the spread out of space signals. In order to ensure the normal operation of the network, the following measures should be taken in the area of physical security: First, in the area of product security, mainly refers to the security measures in the areas of product procurement, transportation, installation, etc. ; second, in the area of operational security, the equipment in the network, in particular, safety products must be able to receive prompt technical support services from the manufacturers or suppliers in the use process, and backup systems should be installed for some key equipment and systems, all important equipment involved in secret need to install anti-electromagnetic radiation products, such as Radiation Jammer; fourth, security, mainly against theft, fire and so on, but also includes the network system of all network equipment, computers, security equipment security protection.\n\n[ \n ](javascript:;)", "timestamp": 1635749436, "digest": "gOUFC-dR8RnGFJ7p6_yJ73IpdlKawI2x5luL6PtpBho", "contributor": "0x528F2AbCD700ba6CD101050a12c87D3CD0dBC4bf"}

However, the computer has a weak resistance to malicious attacks, and the user’s unintentional wrong operation will bring trouble to the computer, causing problems such as abnormal operation, crash or even paralysis. So this article will strengthen the computer operating system in the restoration of technology is discussed. 1. At present, there are mainly two kinds of reduction technologies in computer system, namely, software reduction and hardware reduction. 1.1 software restoration there are many software restoration techniques in computer systems on the market, but the most influential one is ghost. Ghost software’s main function is to back up data, but in the process of using it, it is more dependent on the system and more troublesome to use, so there are a lot of ghost316; as the core of the software restore technology. Because these technologies are made according to GHOST, so in design ideas and functions are not very different, GHOST is an improved version. In practice, most people use restore software called restore wizard. It is a hardware restore tool, but it is a software version. The restore sprite is very powerful internally, but the best part is that you don’t have to install any other devices before using it. The restore sprite has many other advantages, such as the principle of work is relatively simple but the design idea is very scientific, it uses the technology is a new kernel, when installing the restore sprite, you can use the dynamic allocation of software to reserve storage space, without pre-allocation of memory size and location, not only can make full use of hard disk space, but also free allocation of hard disk space. The use of the restore wizard can effectively protect the computer from the invasion of malicious viruses, can be damaged software can be completely eliminated, can restore the deleted data, thus effectively protects the data damage and the loss caused by the computer breakdown. The principle of the restore technique can be explained as the first step in using a new computer is to partition the hardware and format it, the computer operating system can then be installed on the machine for normal use. After partition management, the hardware can be divided into five parts: Data area, operating system boot sector, Primary boot sector, directory area and file allocation area. In the hard disk, the main function of the data area is to store data. During the installation of the software, the original zero-channel, zero-face and zero-region data must be transferred to the ninth region in the hidden track, in addition, the block data must be encrypted to make it into a logical lock state, also modify the boot block data in the currently active block. The program that restores the inside of the wizard is complete. It can inspect the program itself and repair it automatically if it is found damaged. During the use of the restore wizard, if the code in the primary boot area is found to be corrupted, the host can be controlled by rebooting the computer and restoring the code in the primary boot area of the wizard, to check for damage and integrity; if the contents of the currently active block have been modified, the data in this block can be changed to restore wizard code, the process of modification is the repair of the system. The restore sprite itself has some disadvantages, such as it can not resist the virus, when the computer is attacked by the virus, it can only be in a passive state; it supports very few file formats, it doesn’t protect files it doesn’t support; it takes up a relatively large amount of memory when restoring sprites and generates a lot of garbage that slows your computer down. 1.2 hardware restore technology hardware restore technology is the process of solidifying a piece of software onto a chip that can be restored. It can also be used as a plug-in card. There are a variety of popular hardware recovery products, but they can be divided into two types: motherboard integrated and independent network card. Motherboard integration is mainly used in large computer manufacturers. In this way, chips that can be restored are integrated on the motherboard. Independent Network Card type is the chip on the Ethernet Card for integration. Now the hardware recovery card in a variety of forms, its main body is the hardware chip. Although the main board integration type and independent network card type are quite different in form, the overall design idea and application function are the same. 2. The application of restore technology in the computer operating system maintenance 2.1 software restore technology in the computer operating system maintenance application GHOST is a powerful restore software, it can complete partition, cloning, backup, restore and other functions. When using GHOST to clone hard disk, we need to pay attention to a few points: (1) to set up a suitable size partition. If the partition is too large, it will inevitably lead to a waste of memory, but if the partition is too small, then the memory required by the software will not be enough to support the operation, will have an adverse impact on the speed of the computer. (2) when creating file system, NTFS format is needed to ensure the system has good stability. (3) in the actual operation, we should reduce the load of non-essential software, which can effectively reduce the number of large image files, so as to ensure that the system can recover quickly. The system must be created in such a way that the computer is free from viruses. You can use the master optimizer to optimize the system to ensure that the software data is intact, the program patches are complete, but also to clean up the registry of junk information, thoroughly clean the disk, to ensure that the cloned content is intact. (5) if the cloned image file will be used in various hardware environments, all hardware data will need to be uninstalled during system installation. In this way, the cloned image file can be used to recover the hardware environment of the machine, and the computer can look for the configuration information by itself, thus the stable operation of the sub-machine can be ensured when the information of the master machine is recovered. 2.2 The application of hardware recovery technology in computer operating system maintenance mainly includes the following two kinds in hardware recovery technology, namely the Independent Network Card type and the motherboard integrated type. The two types differ greatly in hardware form, but the principles of reduction used internally are the same. Both of these restore techniques run the load driver in a manner similar to that of the DOS boot virus in that the terminal manages INT13 in the BIOS, at the same time, the interrupt vector table, the boot area, the FAT information and so on will be saved in the hidden block or the temporary storage block, but also will replace the original interrupt vector table, the FAT data will be saved in the temporary storage block, to make data modification more secure, and finally to modify the data in a continuous empty disk. When performing a hardware restore, make sure that the hardware restore technology has gained control of the system before the computer’s operating system starts. When the user operates the hard disk, he is actually operating the virtual space in the recovered hardware, not changing the original data. This way can effectively protect the data in the computer system. But in practice, if the card is used to perform the original operation, the hardware conflict will probably occur at runtime. 3. Recovery instructions when restoring a hard disk that is booting by managing four partitions, first turn off the boot manager, then start the recovery process, and then turn on the boot manager when the process is normal. This method is mainly because the boot management area is in the active block. Once the backup block is also the active block, two active blocks will appear after the recovery, which will easily cause the “Crash”phenomenon of the computer. Sometimes after the partition is rewritten, the files will all become gibberish, at the same time the files are under the root directory, the tree structure will disappear. When this occurs, the user simply restarts the computer from\n\n[ \n ](javascript:;)", "timestamp": 1635749939, "digest": "blGir8OclAIOqND5f7ys7P6_wXHaijTp9wpKrq40Hrc", "contributor": "0x528F2AbCD700ba6CD101050a12c87D3CD0dBC4bf"}

{"id": "CjDKY1l0EM3WZYKJQCRQ1M7igybOwMIRqUC5yo-G10I", "title": "Software Development; Layering technology; Application effect\n\n", "body": "With the continuous development of computer application technology, the computer using the environment more and more complex, in the use of computer software development process simple structure on the second floor already cannot satisfy the needs of users for the software, on the basis of a multilayer structure mode of development, the development of multilayer structure model, shows the application of modular, and make the software development process more smoothly, the software system The system structure is clear, while increasing the maintainability and expansibility of the system. Meaning of Layering in Computer Software Development Layering techniques used in computer software development refers to the processing of solutions to different processes in different conceptual layers to form a vertical system in which each layer is equal. The USES of the layered reflected in the architecture of software development, software architecture from the original single architecture development to double architecture, however, in the process of software development using double layer architecture also has some defects, so that the architecture can't meet the needs of the development of computer software application, can not meet the needs of the user. Therefore, stratification technology has its inevitability. Because of the advantages of layering technology, it is a general trend to use layering technology in the process of computer software development. Computer software development is mainly to develop high quality, user satisfaction, good expansibility of software products, in order to reduce the time of software development, improve the efficiency of software development, can use related components to develop. Through the use of layered components in this process, the relationship between the underlying components and physical hardware can be established, and the quality and performance of products can be improved. From the perspective of the development process of computer software development, the use of layered technology, the abstract development of the software system has been promoted, and the relatively complex parts of the software system are integrated into the software development process, so as to improve the stability of the whole system, but also make the development process more structured. With layering, if one layer is changed, the overall structure of the software will not be affected. The application of layering, on the other hand, makes the software development process reusable, and developers only need to ensure that the interfaces between the layers have a uniform standard. Analysis of application effect of Layered Technology in Computer software development 2.1 Application of two-layer technology and three-layer Technology In the two-layer technology used in computer software development process mainly refers to the client and server. The user interface is mainly provided on the client side, and the related logical processing is also done by the client side. When the client sends a request, the server will perform corresponding operations according to the user's request and return the request result to the client. In the use of two-layer technology, a large amount of logic processing will be involved, if the client access request is too much, the system will continue to increase the load, thus affecting the performance of the system, and errors occur. In order to further meet the requirements of software system, three layers of technology appear in software development. Three-layer technology is based on two-layer technology, adding application server to realize its functions. The client mainly realizes human-computer interaction, the data server accesses and stores data, and the application server mainly realizes the business logic of the software system, improves the efficiency of information access, and reduces the burden of the client. The specific working process of the three-layer technology is as follows: Client user interface layer, the demand for the user to sort and then sends the user's needs to the business process layer, business process layer to the user's access request is analyzed, and the request to extract data, thus the request to the data layer, data layer to query the request of the business process layer, and return the results to the business layer, business layer handles returned to the user interface, after that The client. Three-layer technology improves the disadvantages of two-layer technology to a certain extent, but it also has certain defects, so the layered technology needs to be further improved.2.2 Application of four-layer technology Neither two-layer technology nor three-layer technology can well adapt to the variability and uncertainty of computer application environment. In order to better meet the needs of users on the software system and improve the stability, maintainability and scalability of the software system, in the process of software development, it is necessary to separate the related functions of user interface, database server and business logic processing, so as to improve the independence of each module. Because the three-layer technology is difficult to achieve the independence of the functional modules of the software system, but through the encapsulation of the database interface can realize the interaction between the logical layer and the database, at this time, the four-layer technology appears in the development of computer software. The four - layer structure mainly includes web layer, business logic layer, data persistence layer and data storage layer. The Web layer has two modes for development. The process of mode 1 is simple, mainly with JSP pages to complete the corresponding, and the controller and view in this mode are completed with JSP pages. The logic control and presentation functions are mixed, and the code reuse rate is low, and the system scalability is low. Pattern 2 uses MVC structure to realize,Servlet as controller and client interaction,Java code to complete logical processing,JSP page to display the user's request results, this pattern makes each structure related separation, mainly applied to large projects. The business logic layer is primarily responsible for returning the results of the data persistence layer to the Web layer for users to browse. The data persistence layer mainly hides the code parts involved in data access and provides the function of mapping between relational databases and objects. And data storage layer is mainly responsible for data definition, storage and maintenance of related operations, in order to complete the software demand for data and information. 2.3 the middleware technology of middleware technology is mainly used in the distributed computing environment, using middleware can realize resources sharing and communication software system, and the ability to integrate heterogeneous and distributed details hidden in the process of from Reduce the burden of computer software development process, improve the efficiency of software development. Middleware can be reused in the process of computer software development, so as to simplify the development process and reduce the development time. At the same time, because of the use of middleware technology, it can greatly reduce the risk in the process of software development. Middleware includes message-oriented middleware, remote procedure call middleware and object-oriented middleware. Middleware technology has been applied effectively in computer software development.\n\n[ \n ](javascript:;)", "timestamp": 1635749768, "digest": "fCAnrq7MCz81SHSOs7efe0LR73jc28vVcRVDP1CyOBY", "contributor": "0x528F2AbCD700ba6CD101050a12c87D3CD0dBC4bf"}

　　上海的街上午夜后仍然热闹，就是这么个偏僻小街也还是不时的人来人往。 \n  \n 　　不远处一个摆茶叶蛋的老太婆的一声吆喝唤起他饥饿的反应，特别是那飘过来的五香味，实让他流口水。不过他从不在这种摊子上买吃的，这种鸡蛋自己回家煮煮便宜得可是太多了，而且家里的也卫生得多。赵岚做的卤鸡蛋决不比这差。 \n  \n 　　一边这么想着，他一边拉下后厢的车门。 \n  \n 　　就在这时，他听见一个操着山东口音的外地人在向那个卖茶叶蛋的老太婆问路。 \n  \n 　　“哎，你们这附近哪有旅馆？那种可以按钟点开房间的旅馆？” \n  \n 　　警觉的他立刻听出这里可能又是一个机会来了。他赶紧绕过车子向那边看去，只听见一男人对着坐在小矮凳上扭过头去的老太婆生气地提高了嗓门：“嘿，你这老太婆，不说就不说呗，跟俺白什么眼哎。早就听说你们上海人对俺们外地人态度差，果然不假。” \n  \n 　　庄建海瞟见男人边上的树影下正站着一个苗条的女人，职业嗅觉灵敏的他当然明白他们想干什么。 \n  \n 　　他立刻冲过去，一把拉着那个男子，笑着说道：“嘿呀大哥，您还问巧了。您不是要找睡觉的地方吗？我这就有。来来来。” \n  \n 　　“嗷。你开店呢？那正好。在哪儿？远不远？” \n  \n 　　“哈。就在这。弩，来来来，我带您来看。包您满意。您是要一间按钟点算的吧？这个车厢如何？又便宜又实惠。我还可以拉到任何地方。您睡一觉起来就到地方了，多好？” \n  \n 　　“什么？就这啊？” \n  \n 　　山东人吃惊地发现庄建海给他介绍的“房间”竟是这面包车的后车厢，怎么也不能相信还有这种“房间”。不顾一旁翻着白眼的老太太，庄建海把他拉到车门旁，为他打开车门，赶紧继续向他推销：“您看，大哥，这里可是一应俱全，床垫又厚又舒服，比那旅馆可干净多了。那是毛巾手纸，还有……还有……嘿，反正您需要的都有了。我一边开车您一边睡觉，多浪漫啊。” \n  \n 　　庄建海看见还在发愣的山东人，估计这桩生意八成有戏。他故作神秘地压低声音，对他耳边悄悄的说：“现在上海扫黄正在风头上，旅馆常被扫黄队搜查，哪有这里安全？在旅馆被抓住了，罚款起码三千，还要通知您工作单位。” \n  \n 　　这最后一把火显然打动了这人。他露出笑意，连说“好！好！” \n  \n 　　“你们还真会做生意，这点子也亏你们上海人能想得出来。好！好！俺就租你这流动……呵呵。包两个小时算多少钱？哎，小姐，俺说你过来呀，你看这里如何？” \n  \n 　　他一边问庄建海价钱，又对着阴影里的女人招呼了一声，一边探头到车里面，两手使劲按按垫子，似乎在看看这里经不经得起他的块头。 \n  \n 　　庄建海心下一动，两个小时，真是笔不错的买卖。他还很少遇到开这么长时间的客人。正在琢磨该斩个什么价钱，一眼看到树阴下的小姐似乎在对他摇着手。 \n  \n 　　他定睛仔细一看，惊得他合不上嘴。 \n  \n 　　这个小姐竟是他的妻子赵岚。 \n  \n 　　他大吃一惊。简直难以相信自己的眼睛。赵岚？怎么会是赵岚？她…… \n  \n 　　他突然想起昨天跟赵岚说过的，如果遇到肯出高价的客人，就是出去干也成。 \n  \n 　　天啊。难道自己真要像那段沪生那样，自己开车拉着自己的老婆让人搞？ \n  \n 　　赵岚好像在拚命向他摆手。似乎她也不愿在这样一个尴尬的情形下出售自己的第一次。这太让人难堪了。 \n  \n 　　庄建海心下也大感不妥。他实在没有这个思想准备。不行，还是推掉算了。唉，好不容易才拉到的这么个肥客，只能白白地看着溜掉。他刚刚的兴奋心情一扫而空。代之的是无限的失落困惑和惆怅。他再也想不到自己会在大街上接客时会接到自己的老婆。 \n  \n 　　他很想知道为何赵岚会这么晚陪客人出来做。为何不就在“海市豪”里的包厢里做？不是说那里的客人一般都是包包厢的吗？ \n  \n 　　不容他多想，山东人再次催问他价钱。 \n  \n 　　他脑子飞转了一下，知道话都说成这样了，要不接这桩生意，就只能出个天价把他气走了事。他扭过头，失望而又茫然地看着车轮，淡淡地说：“两个小时啊？那要两百，外加里程费。” \n  \n 　　果然，山东人一听就火了。 \n  \n 　　“什么？两百？你……你们他奶奶的也太会宰人了吧？你……你开始不是说便宜吗？怎么都赶上人家的包厢钱了？” \n  \n 　　“这么晚了，现在就这个价。你要不要？” \n  \n 　　“你……他妈的俺算服了你们上海人。一百五，就一百五。我一块也不会多给。一百五两个小时。怎么样？” \n  \n 　　这下轮到庄建海惊住了。一百五啊。再加上里程费，这实在太诱惑人了。本来随便出的一个无理价钱，这人竟当真的来砍价。 \n  \n 　　天啦，干不干？不宰白不宰。 \n  \n 　　但是……庄建海对拉着自己的老婆让人玩实在是没有心里准备，虽说对让赵岚去做妓女他自从去了“新得来”后就想通了的。做三陪都做到那种程度了，还有什么可保留的？自己又不是那种特别保守的人。而且自己每天干的就是开车拉人搞，那事可不是见得多了。 \n  \n 　　但是……毕竟是让自己的老婆任人搞啊。这和三陪毕竟还是不一样。最近以来每当他脑海中出现赵岚被赤裸地压在男人身下抽插的幻影，心中就涌起一股莫名的烦燥。 \n  \n 　　他知道这一步他们迟早要走。既然要走，就得抓紧时间趁着赵岚还年轻姿色尚存的现在，否则她还能挣几年的钱？他必须克服这种不成熟的心理状态。他知道自己对这事潇洒不起来是很幼稚的，也反覆地告诫自己不要太感情用事。都这么个年龄了还有什么啊？不就是做那事吗？ \n  \n 　　但是……虽然他能想通这事，但现在真要让他当面看着赵岚被人搞，这就太超出他的心理承受能力了。他自己也把握不住自己。他能把握住自己吗？ \n  \n 　　他不知道。也许以后时间长了他就会不在乎了，但刚开始时，他不敢说他能无动于衷。恰恰相反，他从现在内心的感受来看，他发现自己不仅不像他想像的那样潇洒那样拿得开放得下，反而对这事内心是非常的冲动。难道自己真的脆弱到了不能面对这事？那还让老婆出去接客？不如让她回家算了，三陪也别做了。 \n  \n 　　他狠狠地捏了一下拳头。手心里已开始出汗。 \n  \n 　　一百五啊。怎么能不赚？这简直就像是捡个皮夹子。怎么能将捡到手的皮夹子再扔掉？按上海人的说法，“有赚勿赚猪头三”。而且可是双份钱啦！这笔生意太合算了。 \n  \n 　　他越来越难以抗拒这个诱惑。也许自己经过这次之后就更能彻底坦然地面对赵岚卖淫，以后就可以像段沪生那样常常赚这种双份钱。就算他今天不拉他们，这人不是还要将赵岚带到不知什么样的小旅馆的肮脏的床上？由自己开车载着他们才是最安全的呀。他要是万一有什么暴力举动自己还可以干预。而且，也是最重要的，肥水不流外人田。这不正是段沪生说的吗？ \n  \n 　　山东人不耐烦地催促他：“怎么样啊？不行我就走人了。” \n  \n 　　他斜瞄了赵岚一眼，一狠心，咬牙说道：“好！上车吧！快上车吧。” \n  \n 　　他眼光转向空空的马路，说最后一声“快上车吧”时加重了语气，似乎是专门对赵岚说的。说完后转身走向驾驶员的车门。 \n  \n 　　现在轮到赵岚脑子一片空白。 \n  \n 　　自打被这个男人拉出“海市豪”时她整个人就处于一种混乱状态，即将等待她的会是什么样的经历？这可是她第一次出售自己最宝贵的贞操啊。虽然平常的三陪时自己也被人摸尽身子几乎每一寸肌肤，但今天将是彻底开放自己全身，让客人在身上尽情享受，或许客人还要让自己主动做各种服务去满足他的性欲。她的心一直就不停地砰砰地猛跳，一颗心像是悬在空中。 \n  \n 　　而现在突然遇到丈夫的情形就更让她难堪的无以复加。她怎么也没预料到他们出了“海市豪”会在这里撞上自己丈夫。如果早知道是这样她再怎么也不会陪他出来。 \n  \n 　　第一次和别人做这事就要让丈夫在边上，他怎么能接受得了？而且他还是昨天刚刚想通让她跨越三陪的界线去做这种性服务。第一天就要让他坐在边上，他如何能抹过这个面子？怎么也不能上他的车啊。 \n  \n 　　当然自己还是有主动权的。她尽可以对这个男人说自己不愿上这种车。理由多得很。 \n  \n 　　可是……丈夫却说“上车吧”。这话明显是对她说的。一百五。加上自己卖身的四百就是五百五。这确实太诱人了。 \n  \n 　　昨天丈夫不是说过的吗？不宰白不宰。既然丈夫都愿意了，自己怎么能不干呢？而且如果不坐丈夫的车，会跟这个男人到哪里去呀？还不知道会是个什么不干不净的地方。 \n  \n 　　但是……在丈夫身边这么近的地方和别人做这事，还是太让人难堪了。 \n  \n 　　山东人看她愣在那里不动，过来一把抓住她的胳膊就往车子拉，嘴里还说这个车厢真不错，比他见过的旅馆都要干净。 \n  \n 　　这时庄建海从驾驶室里的窗户探出头来，对着她说话道：“小姐，上这车吧。这里很安全的。” \n  \n 　　听到丈夫的暗示，看来丈夫是真的不在乎。赵岚知道自己没有可选择的了，在山东人的搀扶下爬上了面包车。 \n  \n 　　庄建海习惯地将后视镜扭开，像往常一样镜子的一角正好覆盖了后车厢的全部角度。他轻轻地启动了车子，感觉到自己转动钥匙的手都有点发抖。他突然想起自己忘了向这人推销安全套。真是没用，怎么慌乱到这种程度。 \n  \n 　　他一边暗骂自己，一边将车子息了火。 \n  \n 　　他探身从车前的柜子里拿出了几个彩色的套子，举在肩膀上，头也不回地说道：“老板，要不要来两个套子？水果味的，进口货。” \n  \n 　　“不要不要。我从来不用这玩艺儿。” \n  \n 　　庄建海心中暗骂。但还是不动声色的继续说道：“现在外面病多，还是保险点好。” \n  \n 　　“啊？啊，这个小姐还是……我看没问题。不用不用。带那玩艺儿没劲。” \n  \n 　　庄建海更加来气。心里话小姐没问题你保不齐还有问题呢。他干脆转向向赵岚暗示：“小姐，要不要来几个？别弄大肚子耽误生意。” \n  \n 　　赵岚还一直处于紧张慌乱的心态中，竟没有意识到这是丈夫想让她说服客人用安全套。她居然以为丈夫真是怕她会怀孕，就老实地回答说：“啊？不用了，我已吃过避孕药了。” \n  \n 　　她确实是吃了药。现在在舞厅里搞不好男人就会把精液涂进她体内，为了安全她都是每天坚持吃的，倒是从未告诉过丈夫。 \n  \n 　　听了赵岚这话庄建海心中腾的就火了，可怎么也无法发作出来，只能憋在心里在前面咬牙切齿地暗骂：“侬哪能嘎港？还帮外宁讲话。一只套子起码能赚五块。嘎好的机会。港！” \n  \n 　　他再次启动起车子，心中为失去能稳赚的额外收入有些郁郁不乐。还好，十来块钱毕竟只是一个零头，他很快就将心思转回到那一百五十快钱上。不过他很快就发现他第一次载着自己的妻子的生意和平常是大不一样，他的两腿不知为何有些紧张的发抖。 \n  \n 　　真是没用。他在心里暗骂自己。两手紧紧握住方向盘，开始慢慢开动起车子。 \n  \n 　　不管他怎么努力，也无法将自己冷静下来。心跳的速度显然太快，有好一会他几乎都不能像平常那样稳定地控制住车子，车轮都压过了路中间的线上，直到开到交叉路口，他才将车子开进自己的车道。 \n  \n 　　后面传来几声清晰的噗噗亲嘴声，接着就是山东人嘻嘻哈哈的爽朗的笑声。他催促着赵岚赶快脱去衣服，自己同时也开始将全身的衣服脱净。 \n  \n 　　夜晚的上海开始变得宁静，不用看庄建海也能清晰地听出来他们开始在脱衣服。 \n  \n 　　他的脑子里印出赵岚白斩的身子在闪过的灯光下暴露出来的画面。他的心一阵抽紧。 \n  \n 　　“真他奶奶的滑哎。上海女人真是不假。”这个山东人根本不顾前面开车的司机，一边在赵岚光滑的身子上摸着，一边还露骨地大声评论。 \n  \n 　　赵岚紧张得大气也不敢出，在这微热的夜晚慢慢退下裙，又乖乖地解开乳罩，将上身一丝不挂地裸露在这个男人面前，在男人的摸索下一阵冷颤，好像全身都起了一层鸡皮疙瘩。 \n  \n 　　“你别紧张嘛，还真是没接过客。” \n  \n 　　男人一手托起她的下巴，低头吻住她的嘴，另一只手开始用劲地摸捏起她的乳部。 \n  \n 　　庄建海的心还在砰砰地猛跳，后面亲嘴的声音是如此清晰地传来，让他更加难受。 \n  \n 　　“你这里真有弹性。呵呵。躺下吧。” \n  \n 　　庄建海接过的大多数客人都是默默无声地干，许多人还尽量将自己的呻吟声憋住，不好意思让司机听到。很少有人会像这个山东人这样总是露骨地说些淫荡的话，在庄建海听来实在刺耳，每一句都像是刻意对他和赵岚发出的侮辱。 \n  \n 　　庄建海竭力克制住自己的情绪，将注意力尽量集中到方向盘上。他的理智告诉自己这人是无心说这些话的。就当是对自己老婆的奉承吧。 \n  \n 　　他两眼直盯着前方。夜晚的上海街道车子已经稀少，对他来说又都是非常熟悉的街道，无需用心就凭直觉他就能随心所欲地开来开去。 \n  \n 　　虽然眼睛没有向后视镜偷看半下，他的耳朵还是不自觉地又注意起背后的的动静。 \n  \n 　　山东人一边用嘴从赵岚脖子开始在她上身吻着舔着，一边退去她内裤。内裤还只脱到她的小腿上时，那只大手就迫不及待地从她的大腿处摸向了她的隐私。 \n  \n 　　赵岚的身子被上下同时攻击，立刻不自觉地发出一声娇呼。赶紧咬住嘴唇，不想让丈夫在前面听见她被玩弄时的反应。但为时以晚。庄建海清晰地听见了她那如此熟悉的声音，脑海里马上就映出她被自己搂着抚摸时的娇态。心中的幻影刚一浮现，立刻被山东人呼呼的喘息声惊醒，脑海里的镜头立即切换成妻子的玉体被这个男人粗鲁地玩弄的画面。 \n  \n 　　他猛的抛了一下头，想将画面从脑海里抹去。一阵阵的酸楚涌上心头。现在她的身体已完全成了一件商品，供人随意享用。这个念头怎么也挥之不去。 \n  \n 　　更糟糕的，这个男人嘴里还一个劲地在胡说八道：“呵，真他奶奶地肉嫩嘿……奶子还真不赖，嘿呀……”“真过隐……肉球还真软……呵呵，上海女人……真来劲。”“皮真白。跟你们这卖的白斩鸡似的。” \n  \n 　　庄建海再次努力将自己的精神转移开来。他想起刚上车时这人指定让他最后开到江湾去。他开始盘算起这两个小时的路线该怎么走才能挣最大的车程费而又尽量省油。虽然时间长的根本不需他计算路线，随便怎么走都可以。但这么一想，他还真的分散了注意力，心中郁闷大减。 \n  \n 　　“嗷……你别……嗷……慢点慢点……嗷……” \n  \n 　　后面赵岚一声轻微的尖叫，然后是求饶似的哀告。原来这个男人的一个手指突然插入她紧闭的阴户，突如其来的侵入让她疼痛难当。平常三陪时自己总会有许多时间和客人周旋和推脱，哪像现在这样，他说插就插进来了，阴户里面还干燥的很。 \n  \n 　　“呵呵，没怎么被插过啊？还真的很紧……你紧张个啥？我不用手弄开点，待会你可不更吃苦？你腿张开点……对。这不就好了？呵呵……真他奶奶的，跟处女似的。” \n  \n 　　赵岚是太紧张了，否则在他开头的玩弄下阴户早就会湿润张开了。现在被他外力强行捅开，她不得不张开腿，尽力配合他的手指。她知道他说的是对的。这么紧的阴户要被他的肉棒插进去真会被插破的。她已看到了他巨大的阳具，比她在舞厅里曾见到过的个头都要大，比起丈夫的那活儿更是又粗又长。而且就这他好像还没有完全挺起来。第一次就遇上个这么粗大的，让她懊悔不已。恐惧更加剧了她的紧张。 \n  \n 　　她想起自己曾听见其他有经验的姐妹聊天时曾说过，再大的家伙女人都能对付。她希望她们的经验是对的。 \n  \n 　　正在这么胡思乱想时，听见山东人说了一句“我要开始操了噢”，阴户里的手指唰地退了出去，还没等她吸一口气，一个粗大的肉团就抵到了她的阴唇上磨蹭。 \n  \n 　　她知道该来的就要来了。像往常和丈夫做爱一样，她抬起臀部，让他的阳具可以以最佳的角度进入。同时深深地吸了口气。然而，她还未完全准备好，一个粗大的肉棍竟直直地猛地灌进体内，像一个凶器直捣她的内脏。 \n  \n 　　“啊啊啊啊……” \n  \n 　　来自下体的突然的冲击一下将她击中，下体被强行插入时带来的巨大痛苦，让她撕心裂肺地叫了出来，再也无法顾及不让前面的丈夫听见。 \n  \n 　　她竟没有料到这个男人可不会像她丈夫那样体贴地慢慢插入，拿着那么个大家伙就毫不怜惜地直筒筒地一插到底。 \n  \n 　　“别……痛啊……别动……啊……啊啊啊啊……” \n  \n 　　男人嘿嘿地淫笑着，早就怒涨的淫欲不可能让她的哀求阻止，他开始疯狂地在她稍稍湿润但仍然干涩的阴户里连续抽插，紧紧的阴道吸紧他的阳具让他立刻得到无比的刺激和快乐。他呼呼地在她身体上作乐。 \n  \n 　　她死死地咬紧了牙关，眼泪水夺眶而出，整个身子痛苦地扭曲起来。男人将身子完全压下来，将她压住无法躲避。这山东汉子魁梧的身躯在她胸部产生了巨大压力，让她几乎喘不过气来。 \n  \n 　　这简直就像是在强奸——其实就是在强奸。她本来还以为这种事不过就是让陌生男人和自己做爱，只要克服心理上的反感就可以了。再也没有料到这男人可不都会像她丈夫那样，她要暂停就可以暂停，而是将身子完全交给对方，再痛苦也得由人控制。 \n  \n 　　山东人趴在她身上一口气连续插了十几下，从未有过的畅快从肉棒上传遍全身。他深深地连呼几下气，将插入了一大半的阴茎暂时留在她的温暖的阴户里，体会着女人包裹着的感受，也让身下这个痛苦得不行的女人稍稍缓口气。 \n  \n 　　“呵呵，真他奶奶的过瘾。看来真是第一次让人搞，嘿嘿，里面真紧，跟处女似的……不常让人搞吧？” \n  \n 　　他一边戏弄地胡说着，一边稍稍抬起身子，用手捏玩着她的乳房，对着她的脸喘着粗气。 \n  \n 　　她也一动不动地躺在那里喘息，在这个男人给她的宝贵的短暂休息中慢慢消化下体深处的痛楚，聚集起勇气等待他下一轮的攻击。 \n  \n 　　庄建海在前面完全是靠本能在控制着车子。虽然他一直未曾瞄过后视镜一下，但后面发生的一切就好像全是在他眼前发生的一样，他一点不漏地将妻子受难的过程全“看”在了脑子里。他两手紧紧地纂住方向盘，指甲都扣进了上面的皮套子里，胸口象被压上了一块巨大的石头，憋闷得几乎喘不过气来。他也是没有料到自己的老婆会被人这么折磨。赵岚痛苦的叫声就像是一把把刀子一下下划在他的心口。 \n  \n 　　在这个男人抽插的每一下，他都像是自己在承受那种刺骨的痛楚的冲击，紧紧地咬住下唇，整个身子僵硬地坐在椅子上用力抓紧方向盘，两眼紧张的盯着前方，和妻子一起忍受这种极度的痛苦的煎熬。 \n  \n 　　他的脑子也变成一片空白。 \n  \n 　　这个男人当然没有体会到前面司机的感受。他把玩了一会赵岚丰满的乳房，身子再压下去，屁股一上一下开始继续刚才停下的抽插。阴道中紧紧包裹着的感觉让他的肉棒一直坚挺无比，现在比较润滑的热道可以更加用力地抽插起来。 \n  \n 　　“呵呵，真他奶奶的舒服。呵呵……” \n  \n 　　随着他每一下的抽插，他都要相当大声地呵叫着，似乎正在极度地享受其中的快感。 \n  \n 　　经历了开始的强烈痛苦，赵岚对他现在的抽插有了思想准备。阴道里的挤迫的感觉大为减轻，痛苦也在一点一点的减少，她的嗷叫渐渐变成了微弱的呻吟。 \n  \n 　　最痛苦的时候总算过去了。 \n  \n 　　赵岚的嘴被男人粗糙的双唇封上，他用粗野的动作在她嘴上揉着。 \n  \n 　　她惊奇地发现她的下体的感觉开始发生变化。那种刺骨的疼痛渐渐变成了一种她曾相当熟悉的刺激——那种只有和丈夫做爱时才曾出现过的性的刺激。 \n  \n 　　天啊，刺激竟随着男人动作的加快越来越强烈。自己的丈夫就在前面啦。她咬住牙强忍住不让自己漏出任何欢娱的声音，但从鼻子里发出的沉重的喘息声就像做爱做到愉快时的淫荡的呻吟，无论如何也掩盖不了。 \n  \n 　　男人的舌头强行伸入她的嘴里，她依顺地让他侵入，似乎他的粗鲁也让她很是受用，在他的热吻下她竟有些飘飘然然的眩晕起来，两手自然地勾住他的脖子，就像和丈夫做爱时常做的那样，将身体向他完全放开，渐渐地竟沉浸到一片欢快的性交之中。 \n  \n 　　庄建海已经慢慢地从开始的混乱中一点一点恢复起理智，妻子被折磨的声音也渐渐小下去。他相信这是赵岚为了不让他感到痛苦而有意不发出声音，在默默地承受她身体的痛苦。没有准备的阴道第一次被这么强行抽插怎么能不痛苦呢？ \n  \n 　　不过他相信她会适应的。刚结婚时她还不是一样疼得死去活来？说是怎么也受不了？后来还不是很快就适应了？女人的适应能力总是很强的。 \n  \n 　　山东汉子早已憋久的性欲很快就到了发泄的边缘。他毫不保留地开始在丰满的赵岚身上用劲，搂住她的肩膀，开始快速的做最后的冲刺。 \n  \n 　　随着这个男人开始啊啊啊地猛烈冲刺，整个车子也随之抖动起来。庄建海很熟悉这种时刻。在平常他总是非常平静，心里还常常会默默数着男人抽插的次数，无聊地比较不同男人的强弱。 \n  \n 　　但这回他怎么也平静不下来。相反，他刚刚好受了一点的内心感觉又被不由自主地被搅起，心里又像被人揪住了一般绞痛。更让他大感尴尬的，是他下体在不知不觉中竟竖立了起来，肿胀的感觉让他不知所措。 \n  \n 　　在后面的抽插正在推向高潮的同时，他的心情也跟着紧张到了高点。他的心不知不觉地加剧了跳动，血一个劲地快速往脑袋里涌，下体更加肿胀，体内的血脉好像越来越难以控制，似乎到处乱窜在寻找发泄的通道。他无法相信自己会在这种妻子被人奸淫的时刻居然还会高涨昂奋。但下体的坚硬肿胀象铁一般的事实告诉他自己的身体确实背叛了他的意志。 \n  \n 　　他憋紧了气，强力抵抗着这种恼人的性欲的折磨。 \n  \n 　　后面的声音越来越大，好像是这个男人故意夸张地表现出来给他听似的，没有丝毫收敛的啊啊的呻吟声越来越强烈地震撼着庄建海的心。他强迫着自己不要去记数男人的每一下抽插，但心中却根本无法回避这一下下清晰地插入妻子体内的如此震撼人心的动作，特别是从男人粗鲁的声中夹杂的她娇嫩的一下下喘息，让他实在无法控制自己的强烈的感受。 \n  \n 　　“啊…啊…啊…啊……” \n  \n 　　男人的节奏越来越快，动作也越来越有力，下体的快感急剧加强，很快就达到了射精的不归路。 \n  \n 　　好像是为了得到最大的快乐，他猛地往下插入，第一股热液直射入赵岚的身体深处。然后他就是一连串的快速抽插，一下下将精液发泄出来，畅快的感觉强烈地刺激着他的全身，让他浑身都达到了一种快感的顶点。 \n  \n 　　庄建海的紧绷的身体也像是达到了极点，一股股强烈的脉冲一下一下地冲击着他的脑袋。他猛地大舒一口气，肿胀的下体似乎稍有些舒缓。男人在他妻子体内射完精结束之后，他才慢慢将体内膨胀的感觉压下来，心中好像一块石头落了地。 \n  \n 　　他吹出几口气，将失魂的情绪一点点收回来。 \n     \n\n（四）\n\n随着男人的最后几声嗷叫结束后，后面突然一下安静了许多。庄建海体内激荡的欲火也好像是从高潮上一下跌了下去，紧张的心总算松弛下来。想到自己的妻子最终被人压在身下完成了整个性交射精过程，一种晕晕乎乎的麻木感让他渐渐迷失。 \n  \n 　　这么就结束了，不就是如此么？又有什么难的了？ \n  \n 　　庄建海在心里苦笑。他脑海里一会儿想到花花的钞票，一会儿又想到妻子的雪白的肉体；一会儿想到“新得来”里的云红在他怀里的柔软的感觉，一会儿想到在那丝质的内裤里射精的销魂快感。 \n  \n 　　突然，一个想再回到“新得来”的念头强烈地冲击着他的大脑。不就是钱吗？老子现在挣了钱，再他妈的花一点去玩玩别人的老婆。妈的，谁赚谁呀？ \n  \n 　　他的心情一下变得非常轻松。想起那丝质的女人内裤，下体又立刻蠢蠢欲动地肿胀起来。他心虚地从后视镜向后瞄了一眼，只能瞥见男人宽阔的脊背裸露地趴在赵岚身上象死了一般一动不动。 \n  \n 　　看上去挺魁梧的样子，这么快就泄了，真是没用。庄建海在心中轻蔑地暗笑：这才多久就不行了，真不知道他还怎么玩两个小时。他看了一下表，这还不过半个钟头。他很高兴自己已经闯过了心理这一关。不就这么回事吗？如此简单，难怪段沪生要载着老婆接客收双份钱。只要看开了，真是很容易挣钱。他为自己到今天才想通感到有些遗憾。以前自己还觉得自己放得开，现在看来真是太幼稚了。 \n  \n 　　赵岚在男人的身下暗暗喘气。刚才男人的猛烈抽插让她感受到一种异样的兴奋。这是她从未经历过的一种体验，好像这个男人的肉棒伸入到了她体内她丈夫从未曾达到的深度。那里的感受让她说不出是一种强烈的快感还是一种异样的痛楚。她相信那是一种痛苦。但这种“痛苦”似乎很好受。她是在紧咬住牙关才能止住下体被刺激起来的兴奋所引起的呻吟。 \n  \n 　　男人肉棒在她体内慢慢地滑出，一丝虚空让她感到非常轻松。刚才男人粗壮的肉棒在阴户里的摩擦到最后全变成了快感的刺激，她心里是完全清楚的。但她宁愿不要这种性快感。太让她难堪了。她内心中升起一种罪过的感觉，内疚和羞愧的感受比开始时那种直接的痛苦更加让她难以忍受。 \n  \n 　　总算结束了。但这个男人要玩两个小时。他还能再玩得动吗？丈夫可从来未曾连着玩两次的。她倒是经常听其他小姐讲包钟点的男人常常会打两炮。她倒是真想见识一下这个男人怎么还能再硬起来。想到这里她发觉自己的下体竟有些骚劲。 \n  \n 　　男人翻身从她身上侧躺到一边。一只手在她的阴户上又摸了一把。刚刚回过劲来的他又开始不干不净在嘴里胡说起来，让她尴尬无比：“哈。好久没玩过像你这么紧的女人了。跟他奶奶的处女似的。真来劲……你怎么样？也很来劲吧？里面出的水可真不少。你可是觉得很来劲吧？待俺再来，一定要把你的淫水全都操出来。哎，别浪费时间了，你来把俺清理干净。” \n  \n 　　赵岚脸唰地红到了耳根，自己的秘密被这个男人在丈夫耳边说穿，羞得她简直无地自容。她刚刚体内确实开始出了淫水，但被他这么一说，丈夫会怎么想？好在黑暗中丈夫不会回头看见，否则看到她脸红的表情他肯定会相信这人说的是实情。 \n  \n 　　她不敢坑声，赶紧坐起来，找到车上放手巾的地方，拿出一张湿润的纸巾在这个男人的阴茎上温柔小心地擦拭。这是她所熟悉的工作，她做的显然很好，他躺在那里舒服地哼哼着。她一边帮他擦着，他的一只大手沿着她的小腹摸了上来，在她的乳房上捏揉着，甚至将她的乳尖捏住粗鲁地向外拉来拉去。虽说不很疼痛，但在她乳部的刺激让她大为紧张。那里是她最敏感的部位，稍稍一摸她就开始大口地喘气。可是在这种情形下她不知如何躲避这种攻击，只能憋住气强行抵御上面传来的刺激。 \n  \n 　　“嗷……行了，你擦的可以了。你给俺吹一会喇叭吧。会不会？就是含进嘴里吸。要将它吸到最大。” \n  \n 　　什么？赵岚和前排的庄建海同时大吃一惊。 \n  \n 　　赵岚没有料到第一天就遇到这种要求。其实她从其他小姐那里早就知道全套服务时常常会有客人要求小姐为他们吹喇叭。但她在真的遇到这种要求时还是没有很好的思想准备。毕竟她还从未做过这种事，即使是丈夫也未让她含过。她真后悔平常没有在家里练习练习。最让她难堪的，还是就在丈夫座位背后做这种事。他肯定已经听见这个男人的要求了。她这样为客人吹喇叭，他会怎么想？ \n  \n 　　但现在她已没有办法回避了。 \n  \n 　　看着又慢慢翘起的巨大阳具在眼前晃动，在一闪一闪的灯光下湿漉漉地反射着星光，她有些后悔刚才为了节省没有多用一张纸巾将它擦得再干净一些。 \n  \n 　　庄建海本来已经相当轻松平静，但突然听到这个男人对妻子提出了的这种要求，心中猛地再次紧缩，心又开始急剧地快速跳动起来。他从未要求过让妻子为自己用嘴做那事。每天看到她从舞厅疲惫地回来，怎么也不忍心再让她为自己做这种“服务”。没想到现在自己的妻子要将别的男人的那个东西含进嘴里。虽然他拉过的生意里不少小姐都会为客人吹喇叭，自己对这种事也有些司空见惯，但真的轮到自己的妻子做这事，内心的震动还是非常大。他就奇怪自己为何从来未想到这一点。既然想好了让赵岚去接客，迟早会要被客人要求做这种事。 \n  \n 　　不行。赵岚应该拒绝做这事。这也太过吃亏了。从直觉他就觉得这是吃亏的。要做起码也得再加钱。对。至少可以跟他讨讨价。他就常常听见有的小姐为客人的这种特殊要求让客人加钱的。他不知该如何提示妻子，就拚命地连着咳了三声，希望她能领悟过来。 \n  \n 　　但赵岚没有一点反应。只是默默地坐在那里好像不知所措。 \n  \n 　　庄建海一阵焦虑，却只能干急，又咳了两声。他知道赵岚太过老实。在上海老实就意味着吃亏。这是所有人都知道的常识。 \n  \n 　　山东男人躺了一会发现赵岚没有动静，也有点不高兴。 \n  \n 　　“怎么啦？不是讲好四百块全套的吗？快点含进去。真没做过？那就学呀。你就拿俺这个当个实验吧。快快快。” \n  \n 　　“四百块？”，庄建海心中却是猛的一震。这回却是惊喜的一震。四百？两个小时？再加租车费里程费，一共还不要六百多？两个小时就挣六百多？太合算了。他心中惊喜交加。他怎么也没有想到平常看上去很软弱的妻子能砍出个这么好的价钱。 \n  \n 　　唉，早知道这样好赚钱真该早就让赵岚干了。刚才心中的不忿一扫而空。妈的，六百多，至少可以让云红用内裤打五六次手枪。 \n  \n 　　他一想到云红清香的肉体，心中就开始有种飘飘乎乎的感觉。 \n  \n 　　赵岚跪坐起来，弯下头去，慢慢靠近男人有些萎缩的阴茎。她知道要拿人家的钱不做是不行的。但内心本能的反感还是太强烈。而且她也真不知道吹喇叭该怎么做。她只知道要含进嘴里。只好试试看了。她的嘴唇刚刚触摸到他的龟头，一股说不出的感觉袭来，将她吓了一大跳，马上逃了开去，好像是要逃避一个追赶她的怪物。 \n  \n 　　她看到龟头还在那里发着光，并不十分可怕，心下稍安，将头再次靠近。 \n  \n 　　这一次她张开嘴包住了龟头的上半部份，轻轻的含住没敢再动。而她的这种举动却刺激得这个男人一阵颤抖。他高兴地抖动了一下大腿，将阴茎向上一挺，想让她再多含一点。 \n  \n 　　她的嘴唇慢慢适应了肉棒软乎乎的感觉，心中的反感稍减。 \n  \n 　　她的生疏的动作反而让这个男人大感美妙。他一手抄起她悬吊着的乳房，一边捏摸玩弄一边哼哼哈哈地躺在那里享受着肉棒在她温暖的嘴里热呼呼的感觉。 \n  \n 　　“不错……就这样。对……再用你的舌头舔舔，多舔舔。对了。慢慢可以含深点……嗷……” \n  \n 　　被男人如此命令指使，赵岚知道自己从此真正成了一个不折不扣的用身体各个部位去服务男人的妓女。心中的酸楚无以描述。 \n  \n 　　她开始将他的龟头含在嘴里吸缀着，舌头笨拙地在上面舔着，尽量按他指导的去做。她的注意力全放在嘴上，乳房受到攻击传来的刺激反而不那么强烈了。她更加卖力地含裹住他的肉棒。很快她就发现他的阴茎竟奇迹般地跳直了起来。她暗暗高兴。再加把劲或许就会将它舔到最大完成任务。她更大地张开嘴，将肉棒含进嘴里。不知为何，她的每个动作都让他兴奋无比。他更快乐地捏摸着她的乳房和光滑的背部，阳具上传来的连续不断的温热稣痒的感觉让他完全沉浸在极其舒适的陶醉之中。 \n  \n 　　庄建海一边像在做梦一样地开着车子，脑海里不断闪现变幻云红的肉体和赵岚的肉体。她们俩真是何其相似。 \n  \n 　　山东人的大声喧哗让他清楚地知道自己妻子为这个客人做的几乎每一个动作。脑海中就像在放映电影一样不断显现着赵岚为男人口交的画面，强烈地刺激着庄建海每一根神经。想到那即将到手的六百多块钱，他心下没有多少怨言。既然人家肯出这个钱，让他得些便宜当然是天经地义。不过想到这是赵岚在为客人做这种服务，庄建海的身体还是不由自主地燥热起来，下体在裤子里相当膨胀。以前看到小姐在后面为客人吹喇叭时他也会有些反应，但像现在这样如此刺激他还是从未有过的。 \n  \n 　　他忍不住暗自瞄了后视镜一眼，清晰地看到赵岚雪白的身子正背对着自己，趴跪在男人毛绒绒的大腿旁边将头埋在他的阴部上下动着。 \n  \n 　　看到的画面强烈地刺激起他的感官。刚刚冷酷下去的欲火又剧烈地在下体勃然兴起。在这么近的距离里看到自己的妻子跪在另一个男人身旁弯下去一下一下地含进他的粗大的肉棒的上半部，乳房还被男人任意地摸捏玩弄着，他心中突地涌起一股激昂的欲火，在体内上下冲撞。 \n  \n 　　他咬紧牙，开始紧握方向盘，默默地抗拒体内被刺激起来的欲火。 \n  \n 　　赵岚将男人的阴茎含吸得湿漉漉的，很快就彻底让他竖立了起来。忙抬头将它吐出，觉得可以交差了，就对他轻笑着说道：“先生，它已经大起来了。” \n  \n 　　“啊，别吐出来，继续吹，继续吹，你吹得不错，学得真是很快。俺就在你嘴里打一炮好了。含进去，快。” \n  \n 　　赵岚有些发呆。没想到给他含得太舒服了他反而要在她嘴里打炮。她有些后悔刚才太卖力了。没有办法。不过，这样也许更好，省得他还要插进下面。她下体已经感到一丝丝的搔痒，内心里似乎有种被填入的期待。这样下去她真害怕自己会管不住自己的身体。在丈夫身边被人激发出高潮那就太让她难堪了。不过，男人射出的那种东西直接射进嘴里会好受吗？心下又是踌躇又是无奈。 \n  \n 　　她刚要再回头将他的家伙含进去，他将她推开了一点，自己躺靠地将头依靠在车壁上，指示她让她反向地跪到他的身上，一边为他口交，一边让他方便地用两个手玩弄她的身子。这种姿势必然要将自己的阴部对着男人的脸，这让她感到非常羞耻，但她还是无言地照办了。 \n  \n 　　庄建海听见这个家伙竟要在自己妻子嘴里发泄，心中又升起一团说不清是怒火还是欲火的热潮。虽说是很生气，但他又毫无办法阻止。他最后悔的是自己不曾享用过自己的妻子的口交，否则让他怎么占便宜都会好受许多。不知为什么，一想到自己妻子口含男人射出的精液的画面，他的下体竟越发膨胀起来。 \n  \n 　　赵岚跪骑在这个男人的胸膛上，裸露的身子完全被男人肆意地摸弄着，他两手摸到哪哪就传来一阵阵的强烈的刺激。这是她以前从未有过的感受。 \n  \n 　　庄建海再次忍不住向后视镜里瞄了一眼，瞥见妻子跪坐在男人身上一边为他吹喇叭一边被他淫辱性地玩弄的画面。这一看让他心中的欲火和怒火同时勃发到了难以忍受的地步。他清晰地看到男人的大手摸捏着妻子乳房的淫邪的动作，也看到妻子将他的阴茎深深地含进嘴里主动地上下摆动着头部为其服务的刺激性场面。 \n  \n 　　庄建海感到体内一股股的热火在全身骚动难耐，坚硬的下体几乎要撑破裤子挤出来。他忍不住用手握了握裤子里的阳具，不知道如何才能将这股越来越强大的欲火压制下去。他努力不去再想后面的刺激场面，将头转向车外，将注意力尽量放在车外上海美丽的夜景上，脚下却不由自主地用力踩着油门，车子在空旷的街道上呼呼的急速行驶。 \n  \n 　　赵岚的口腔已张到了最大，但这个男人的肉棒才只能进去一半。她不再温柔地含裹，而是加速上下的头部运动。她相信这就像是在手淫一样，只有快速用力摩擦才能将他刺激起来。 \n  \n 　　她的想法是对的。果然男人经受不起她的刺激，开始粗声地大口喘气。他的手更加紧捏她的乳房，很快就显示他又一次接近射精的高潮。 \n  \n 　　山东人在她嘴里的感受的不断加强，他开始大声嗷嗷地喘叫起来。这个男人讨厌的叫声不断刺激着庄建海的感官，让他坐在前排越发难以忍受。 \n  \n 　　庄建海再也受不了了。 \n  \n 　　他右手握紧方向盘，左手按住下体，好像是要防止下面爆炸似的，开始隔着裤子用手揉摸安慰自己的肉棒。他知道在这种时候用手去摸简直是疯了。但他已无法控制自己体内的反应。他心虚地注视着前方，越来越快地安慰自己的下体。他下体是如此坚硬，再不发泄他觉得自己真会爆炸。 \n  \n 　　男人突然放开用手捏着的赵岚的乳房，将两手都虚按在她上下动着的头上面，开始顺着她的动作在她头上加力，嘴里呼呼地发出近似吼叫的声音。男人在赵岚的头上用的力渐渐加大，到后来她的头几乎全是被男人按住往下压，粗大的阳具更深深地插入嘴里的口腔后部，直抵她的咽喉。她被动地剧烈呕吐，大声地咳起来。但男人一点都不管她的难受，继续按着她的头强迫她往下含，他已完全陶醉在她温湿的嘴里的抽插带给他的强烈快感，不愿来自她嘴的快感停下被打断。 \n  \n 　　现在赵岚的头已被他完全控制着在他的肉棒上上下快速猛烈的抽动，她在他疯狂的按动下不住地咳嗽呕吐，但却无法逃脱。 \n  \n 　　庄建海在前面完全听到了自己妻子的反应，自己却无助地在前面开着车，一边拚命隔着裤子抚摸自己的阳具，心中的感受真是难以形容。他控制不住自己地向后瞥去，一眼看见男人口中呼呼地叫着，在赵岚嘴里疯狂抽插。只见她的头被他一下下用力按下，越来越快，然后一下突然的用力，将她的头紧按在胯下停顿住，似乎正是射出了他今夜第二次精液，正深深地射在了赵岚的口腔深处。然后一切好像是突然归于停顿，后面一片寂静，只有赵岚被堵上的嘴里发出一些含糊不清的声音和男人越来越小的喘息声。 \n  \n 　　随着他们的结束，庄建海也从一片眩晕中回过神来，这时才突然发现车速已超过限速，正在向前方的一个红灯驶去。他立刻踩下闸，将车速控制下来。一身冷汗将他的理智拉回来，虽然下体仍然还肿胀发热，体内即将膨胀的欲火总算压了下来。 \n  \n 　　他大舒一口气，蓬蓬的心跳慢慢趋于平静。 \n  \n 　　赵岚在男人疯狂的按压下几乎喘不过气来，直到他射精后好一会他才放开她的头。一股股浓液直接射进她口腔深处，更是让她混乱的狼狈不堪。她一旦得到自由，立刻转身拿到纸巾，将满嘴的精液吐出来。不过已有不少精液已被她无可奈何之下咽进肚里。她大口大口地喘息了很久才回过劲来。 \n  \n 　　山东人又开始胡说起来：“啊，真是不错。第一次吹喇叭就吹得这么好，真是有潜力。以后你还要学会含深点。来，再含进去给它吸干了。那玩艺儿也别吐出来，都是高蛋白，有营养的。”她默默地跪着将头转过去再次面对上面还带着白色精液的肉棒。她忍住心中的厌恶将它再含进去，开始慢慢地裹吸。 \n  \n 　　根据她经常为客人手淫的经验，她知道这时男人的阳具都很敏感，太用力反而不舒服。她小心地温和地吸吮着，轻轻地用舌头舔弄他的肉棒。挺立的阴茎开始在她嘴里发软变小，很快她就吸清了上面的液迹。 \n  \n 　　她转头看时，他正舒适地靠在车上享受着她的善后服务。赵岚心内稍感快慰，为结束了这一生从未做过的口交感到松了口气。 \n  \n 　　现在才刚过了一个小时，她不知他还要如何进行下去。正在思考如何消磨下面的时间，他将她推开，对她说道：“嗯，很舒服。还挺会做的。你再含进去，别吐出来。俺要睡一会，你就一直这么含着。对了，就像刚才那样，别用力就行。” \n  \n 　　说着他真的躺下闭上眼开始睡觉。 \n  \n 　　赵岚心中倒是一阵轻松，只要这么含着那还不容易，最好你一觉睡过这一个小时。她跪在他旁边，摆好一个放松的姿势，开始将他软软的阳具含进嘴里。 \n  \n 　　庄建海裤子下仍然鼓鼓的，但膨胀的欲火总算渐渐地消下了不少，现在可以安心地好好开车了。 \n  \n 　　高耸的东方明珠在窗外的夜空中移动着，他的心情也渐渐飘乎起来。毕竟这么好的生意他还是头一回遇到。一想到六百多块的进帐，妻子的第一次卖淫已不再让他有何心理上的阴影。听见这个男人说要睡在这里，他心下大喜。想到这人已经连射两次，要是还能玩可不就是怪事了。他估计这个男人会一直睡到时间结束。这么一想，心中无限轻松起来。 \n  \n 　　他悠闲地在驾着车子在空旷的道路上奔驰。 \n  \n 　　赵岚一直跪在那里，用嘴轻含着肉棒，几乎不怎么动弹。让她惊喜的是这个男人真的睡了，还开始发出了呼呼的鼾声。赵岚更加小心地含住肉棒，不敢乱动怕将他弄醒。 \n  \n 　　时间一分分地过去，庄建海在各个路上转着开着。他专捡开阔平坦的大路走，让车子尽可能的平稳，好让这个山东人多睡一会。已经过去快一个半钟头了。他不时地看着时间，只恨这时间过得太慢。 \n  \n 　　赵岚发现嘴里的肉棒在不知不觉中又开始发硬变大。男人的呼噜声还是时兴时断地响着。她有点麻木的舌头不由自主地搅动了几下，都舔在了他的肉柱上。他要是醒来还会再来一次吗？赵岚发觉她下体竟有些燥热。毕竟嘴里含着异性的身体，要想没有一点反应是不可能的。当初她开始给客人手淫时也常常会有这种感觉。 \n  \n 　　正在赵岚胡思乱想之际，一个大手突然捏住了她的乳房。她吓了一大跳，才发现他已经醒来，正一边享受她的嘴，一边摸捏起她的身子。 \n  \n 　　他不紧不慢地摸玩了好一会，然后用手将她的头压了压。赵岚领会他是想她开始用点劲吸。 \n  \n 　　她挪了挪有些麻木的身子，将阳具更深地含进嘴里，开始加力舔弄刺激他的性器官。果然他很快就在她的含弄下兴奋起来，她能感到嘴里的东西越变越大。他的手摸到了她的阴部，手指竟扣摸着慢慢进入她已湿润的阴道。 \n  \n 　　赵岚极力克制着下面从他手指传来的强烈刺激，继续专心地吸吮着嘴里的肉棒。但她的身体开始不听使唤地做出了令人难堪的反应，阴户里渗出了相当多的淫水。 \n  \n 　　赵岚嘴里的阳具再次茁壮地竖立起来。男人又开始发出兴奋的轻哼。 \n  \n 　　他推开她的头，将她身子拉起来，指示着她跨坐到他小腹上。她有些不解地看着他，不明白他要干什么。他一边捏住她的乳房，一边用手抬起她的屁股，对她说：“你真不会做啊？来，坐进去。对，就是坐在俺上面。然后上下动。先慢点，对。对。就这样搞。” \n  \n 　　赵岚迷惑了。她还从未试过以这样的方式做爱的。不过她很快就掌握了动作，按照他的指引，面对着他跨在他的阴部上方，一手小心地扶着他的肉棒，将龟头对准自己的阴户，慢慢坐下去。一个巨大的阳具在这样的角度下进入她的体内，她不禁一阵颤抖。 \n  \n 　　这真是太刺激了。她下体坐到男人的阳具上，将龟头插入自己业已湿润的体内，一股强烈的刺激立刻传上全身。她还从未体会过女方主动式的性交方式所产生的如此异样的感受，被唤起的性欲驱使着她主动地向下深入，以便获得更大的快感。 \n  \n 　　赵岚不自觉地发出了“啊……”的一声深沉的低吟。她立刻被自己如此失态的淫声弄得羞愧万分，心中暗自祈祷汽车轰轰的声音能盖住她的声音，同时用力咬紧嘴唇。 \n  \n 　　庄建海吃惊地听见这个男人在后面又开始向他妻子的身体发起了进攻，似乎是要连着玩三次，心下暗暗为赵岚叫苦。他还从未见过在这么短的时间里能第三次勃起的人。赵岚第一次接客就遇到这么一个性欲高昂的人，真是难为她了。 \n  \n 　　赵岚的一声低呼让庄建海心烦意乱。这是那种只有非常淫荡的妓女才会发出的呻吟，他太熟悉这种声音了。他知道很多妓女都会装模作样地发出这种他平常最烦的发情声。他很难相信自己的妻子会如此做作，在这第一次接客时就去迎合客人的欢心模仿性欲高潮时的淫声。 \n  \n 　　但赵岚的声音是如此清晰，让他简直无法否认。她不会真的在这种时候还能感受到性快感吧？庄建海心中一阵酸溜溜的难受，紧握方向盘的手开始出汗。 \n  \n 　　赵岚有节奏地上下运动自己的身子，控制着角度让男人的阴茎直直地在阴户里抽插，整个身子完全被体内聚集的性欲驱使控制着。赵岚突然感到一双大手用力地握住了她的双乳，上下同时产生强烈的刺激，让她再也憋受不住，通过紧闭的牙关里，她的喉咙深处发出了近似哭泣的呜呜声。 \n  \n 　　男人的大手在赵岚的乳房上姿意地摸捏着，强烈的刺激一波波袭向赵岚的全身，她着魔似的开始加快身体的动作，在男人的阳具上用劲摩擦她的阴户，以不断加强体内的快感，女人的羞耻心已在不知不觉中被抛到九霄云外。 \n  \n 　　车厢里剧烈晃动的男女组成了一幅疯狂的画面。 \n  \n 　　庄建海的脚开始不自觉地用力下踩，分明是感受到了后面淫邪的气氛。他又一次禁不住地从后视镜中向后面偷看了一眼。看入眼里的强烈的画面立刻让他血海翻腾：赵岚正以一种陶醉的神情微睁着眼紧闭着嘴，赤裸的身子前倾着主动地在男人身上猛烈地一上一下，两个乳房在一双黝黑的大手的握捏下随着身体的动作而变形。 \n  \n 　　他再也无法料到平时保守稳重的妻子竟会在丈夫身边与一个陌生的男人以这种如此浪荡的方式疯狂主动做爱。虽然他平常对这种镜头早就司空见惯，但第一次亲眼见到自己的妻子如此放荡，一种说不出的强烈感受充满全身，内心的血液止不住地在全身上下奔腾不息，内裤里刚刚软下去的阴茎又马上挺立起来。 \n  \n 　　庄建海强忍住内心的翻腾，极力不在脑子里回忆后车厢里淫乱的一幕。但他已无法完全控制身体的反应，体内的欲火勃然升起。他左手再次摸到下面，隔着裤子开始摩擦耸立的肉棒，极力消解燃起的欲火。 \n  \n 　　赵岚的身子越来越热，也越来越向前倾，下巴就快要碰到这个山东人的胸膛。 \n  \n 　　她实在未曾这样享受过由自己主动控制的性交方式。她不断地扭动着屁股，体会下体的刺激在她如愿地调节下越来越猛。渐渐地她已完全投入到一波波强烈的快感的浪涛中，对前座开车的丈夫能否听见她制造出来的呻吟的担心也全忘到了脑后。 \n  \n 　　赵岚完全迷失在一浪浪的性快感的冲击中。 \n  \n 　　山东人靠坐在车厢里一边揉捏着赵岚的肉球，一边享受着肉棒在她的阴户里上下进出时不断增强的刺激。看着眼前进入了忘我的境界的女人努力地取悦于他，心下大为高兴，在嗷嗷的呻吟声中夹杂着含糊不清的胡言乱语：“嗷…嗷…痛快。嗷…再…嗷…操，嗷……真她奶奶，嗷…来嗷…操…真…嗷嗷…捏死…嗷……” \n  \n 　　赵岚也开始忘乎所以地呻吟起来，全然忘记自己正在丈夫的车里在另一个男人的身体上尽情地做爱求欢。 \n  \n 　　车速在不知不觉中越来越快。 \n  \n 　　听见妻子越来越大的呻吟声，庄建海脑子里一片空白。他只觉得心象受到外力压迫一样开始猛跳，就像一座无形的大山迎面压下来。难道自己的妻子这么快就开始享受和这个男人如此淫荡的粗野的性交快感？ \n  \n 　　这时，山东人猛地将赵岚推开，指示她对着车前方四肢地地趴着，然后他从后面分开了她的两腿，挺着翘的高高的肉棒从后面猛地一下深深地插入赵岚湿漉漉的阴户。 \n  \n 　　赵岚被后面如此突如其来的刺激一下激起，啊地大叫出来。 \n  \n 　　赵岚哪里经受得起这么一种极其强烈的性刺激，性欲一下就被激到了顶点，阴道内立刻渗出了大量的淫液。然而这才只是开始，随着男人接下来的疯狂的抽插，一波波的热浪滚滚袭来，让她在每一次的抽插下达到一个又一个高潮。 \n  \n 　　赵岚彻底疯狂了。她还从未经历过如此持续和激烈的性高潮，这个男人粗壮硕大的肉棒直达她体内的深处，远不是庄建海曾进入的地域。伴随着她嗷嗷的叫声，她的阴户紧紧包裹住男人的肉棒开始连续抽挛。 \n  \n 　　山东人也在这时越来越激昂，他两手抓紧赵岚雪白的屁股用力猛操，已射过两次的阳具在赵岚紧紧的阴户里越插越快，越抽越猛。 \n  \n 　　赵岚的浪叫激得庄建海再也坐不住了。那是她在性高潮时也很少会有的神态。他心中已说不出是怒火还是妒火，还是强烈的刺激性场面激起了他本能的欲望，他的手在裤子外越来越快地摩擦自己挺立的阳具，火热的感觉通过大脑充满全身。他实在无法接受赵岚在别的男人的抽插下达到如此强烈的性欲高潮。就是妓女也很少会在卖淫的时候体会到这样的快感。但赵岚无疑正在性高潮的顶峰。 \n  \n 　　庄建海脑子里开始浮现杂乱的画面，云红裸露的乳房和赵岚的身子交替在脑海里出现，下体在手指的摩擦下渐渐感受到那种被丝质的女性内裤包裹着销魂的刺激。他不知不觉地又瞄了一眼后视镜，看到的场景让他再次大吃一惊：赵岚正像狗一样趴在车里，被男人从后面猛烈地抽插，整个身子前后来回地晃动。庄建海的下体聚集的欲火在这样激烈画面的刺激下更加膨胀，他实在无法想像自己的妻子竟和男人以如此淫溅的方式做爱。 \n  \n 　　他不自觉地加快了左手在胯下的动作，右手抓紧了方向盘，底下踩在油门的脚也下意识地用上了力，车子猛地开始加速，好似伴随着他体内欲火寻求宣泄的出口。 \n  \n 　　山东人这时又再一次达到了他的顶点，一连串的精液伴随着他的每一次前杵深深地射入赵岚的体内，他张大的嘴只是发出呼呼的出气声，紧闭双眼进入快乐的极地。 \n  \n 　　赵岚紧闭着双眼，两颊潮红，喉咙里已沙哑地发不出声了，身子完全不受支配地抖动起来，整个人漂浮在源源不断的高潮之中。这种销魂的感受是她从来未曾体会到的。 \n  \n 　　庄建海左手的动作越来越快，脚下车子的速度也跟着越来越快，就在这个男人仍然在赵岚的身体里一下下的射精的同时，他紧咬牙关将浓浓的精液勃然喷发在自己内裤里。 \n  \n 　　赵岚像是进入了梦幻中，趴在飞速的车里微抖着身子，在这一刻达到了她的性高潮的顶峰。 \n  \n 　　山东人闭目仰着头，肉棒还深深地插入赵岚的阴户，享受着那今夜第三次射精的持久的极乐。 \n  \n 　　庄建海也同时进入了高潮后的极度舒适的感受中，再次体会出那夜在“新得来”里的最销魂的一瞬。 \n  \n 　　车速也在这时达到了顶点。 \n  \n 　　庄建海对着路灯一张张地检查完山东人给他的钱，确信无疑都没有问题，平静地和山东人说了再见。内心中说不出的复杂心情一点也未显露出来。赵岚仍然在车厢里默默地用纸巾擦着身子下体，白嫩的身上渗出的汗珠在幽暗的灯光下闪烁。 \n  \n 　　庄建海目送着山东人的离去，喃喃地对着他的背影说道：“侬刚刚满好要伊给侬一些回程的车费的咯。” \n  \n 　　远处的霓虹灯映红了夜色下的上海的轮廓。 \n ",

{"id": "PBCsTvCnD05QTzlqk8s-tsdFBPjRQLjJdMCtXKwRa4s", "title": "公链的爆发 2：以太坊", "body": "如果说比特币是区块链的始祖，那么以太坊可以说是区块链2.0的开端。比特币的出现，让人们第一次知道了价值是如何通过网络来传输，而以太坊智能合约的创造，打开了区块链发展的大门。 \n\n2013年19岁的v神带着他的黄皮书（以太坊白皮书）问世。在这之前，他曾向比特币核心开发小组提出过这个构想，但是没有得到支持，于是自己开始单干。\n\n \n\n### 简介\n\n以太坊，去中心化的拥有智能合约功能的区块链平台。当前市值第二大的区块链平台，仅次于比特币。 \n\n和比特币不同的是，比特币可以认为是去中心化的货币，它只有价值交换的功能，没有其他应用或功能。最新的消息是比特币开发小组，在考虑给比特币加入智能合约的功能。多久或者说是否能实现，还需时间来等待。\n\n**平台代币**：ETH\n\n**发展阶段**：边境、家园、都会、宁静四个阶段，目前处于宁静阶段。\n\n**官网**：<https://www.ethereum.org/>\n\n \n\n### 智能合约\n\n智能合约可以说是以太坊最伟大的发明，也是有了智能合约的加入，敲开了区块链2.0的大门，让整个生态发展起来。\n\n智能合约并没有名字听起来那么智能，可以理解成一种固定的程序，用户输入数据通过智能合约能够得到相应的结果。可以参考现实世界中的ATM取款机来理解，你输入固定数额的金额，机器给你吐出相应的纸币。\n\n \n\n### DApp\n\n从名字就能看出来，这是一个和App很像的名字。DApp是运行在区块链世界上的App，D代表着去中心化的意思，是decentralization的简写。\n\n目前运行在区块链世界上的程序种类繁多，但大多数都是和金融相关，包括DEX（去中心化交易所）、借贷、衍生品、保险、聚合交易、跨链等，另外还包括行情软件、NFT、游戏等领域。\n\n今年游戏领域gamefi发展飞快，paly to earn成为新的热点。\n\n \n\n### 以太坊生态\n\n目前以太坊上的生态，已经无法能用准确的数量统计清楚。如今加密世界里耳熟能详的龙头项目，大多是出自以太坊的平台。\n\nUniswap、AAVE、Compound、Sushiswap、Opensea…\n\n### 以太坊虚拟机EVM\n\n以太坊想要成为世界计算机，打造一个各种DApp都可以运行的系统，需要有虚拟机的支持。 \n\nEVM的功能是处理智能合约的部署和执行。目前主流的公链基本上都兼容EVM，很多还没有智能合约的公链，在考虑设计智能合约的时候，也会把兼容EVM考虑进去，比如Filecoin。\n\n \n\n### 预言机Oracle\n\n预言机可以理解成沟通现实世界和区块链世界的桥梁。以太坊通过预言机获得外部世界的数据，通过虚拟机执行智能合约。\n\n预言机只涉及外部数据的真实获取，并不会直接参与的交易执行中来。 \n\n预言机作为一种辅助区块链的工具，有中心化的和去中心化的。中心化的需要由第三方公司、或者其他有信用的主体做背书，保证采集数据的真实性。去中心化的预言机和区块链一致，采用分布式算法来保证可信，实现难度更高。目前行业内去中心化预言机的代表是Chainlink。\n\n \n\n### 共识机制\n\nPOW和POS。\n\n#### POW\n\n目前以太坊依旧采用的是POW（工作量证明），出块时间15秒左右，而且在设计共识算法的时候做了调整，市面上用来挖比特币的专业ASIC矿机不能用来挖以太坊，让更多的普通计算机能够公平参与到挖矿中来，避免挖矿出现中心化的现象。 \n\n由于以太坊的出快周期短，所以出现分叉的情况会更加频繁。鉴于15秒左右一次的出块，很多时候上一个的结果并不能给广播给全网。以太坊引入了ghost协议，对于那些挖到矿但最终没能成为最长合法链的7个以内区块的矿工们，给予一定的奖励。 \n\n只有分叉的第一个区块有奖励，其他没有。\n\n#### POS\n\n以太坊目前的出块还是POW共识机制，不过正处于向POS（权益证明）的方向转变。 \n\n以太坊权益证明要求用户质押32个以太坊成为节点，由系统随机选择节点后打包区块。当以太坊转变为POS后，以前的挖矿将不复存在，在环保方面确实减少了更多的能耗。 \n\n关于更多的权益证明，有想了解更深入的，可以阅读附件中以太坊官方的资料。\n\n \n\n#### POW和POS比较\n\nPOW十几年的实践已经证明，是一种非常有效的共识算法。POS目前还没有开始采用，在理论上更安全且更去中心化，具体的情况还需要经过时间的检验来证明。 \n\n关于哪种共识机制才是最好或者最有效的，争吵从未停止。可能这个问题永远也不会有答案，只有未来的历史会告诉我们结果。\n\n \n\n### 代币经济\n\n以太坊是一个通胀的经济模型，即它的代币没有总量的上限，通胀的比例已经设定好写在合约中，不能人为更改随意增发ETH。\n\n在今年8月初，执行了EIP-1559伦敦升级，引入了代币的燃烧机制。截止到目前为止已经燃烧掉71万多的ETH，平均每分钟燃烧5.64个。 \n\n代币燃烧的引入，降低了ETH每日的总产量。虽然是燃烧减少的，目前来看还是每日的总产出量大于燃烧量，所以整体的经济模型依旧是保持通缩。当每日燃烧量大于产出量，整体的经济模型就会变成通缩的模型。\n\n \n\n### 以太坊分叉 \n\n分叉是区块链世界中很常见的一种现象。分叉分为软分叉和硬分叉。软分叉是暂时性分叉，硬分叉是永久性的。\n\n以太坊历史中发生最出名的硬分叉事件是“The DAO”事件，由于这个组织被大量盗币，为了保护资产以太坊被迫进行了硬分叉。社区对于这次硬分叉有些成员不同意，坚持在老的链上进行维护工作，随后出现了以太经典（ETC）。\n\n以太坊2.0共识机制的转变，未来也是通过硬分叉来实现。\n\n \n\n### 未来展望\n\n公链项目越来越多，每一个出现都号称以太坊杀手。这么多年过去，所谓的以太坊杀手们轮换了一批又一批，只有以太坊一直在区块链的世界里不断发展壮大。\n\n以太坊作为公链之王，依旧会面对越来越多的挑战者，高昂的gas费已经劝退很多开发者和用户进入参与。是否有人能够挑战成功以太坊的地位，还是以太坊自身升级完成，形成对其他公链的降维打击，留给时间来告诉我们答案。\n\n \n\n附参考阅读：\n\n1、以太坊白皮书：<https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/>\n\n2、什么是权益证明：<https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-proof-of-stake/>\n\n3、How to DeFi：Advanced：<https://nigdaemon.gitbook.io/how-to-defi-advanced-zhogn-wen-b/>\n\n4、为什么早期的公链项目应该从 PoW 开始：<https://www.chainnews.com/articles/816811049492.htm>\n\n5、PoS 的攻击成本远高于 PoW？两者的根本区别与局限何在：<https://www.chainnews.com/articles/143271655621.htm>\n\n6、Staking Economy：一文读透 PoS 机制、哲学、远大前程和现实挑战：<https://www.chainnews.com/articles/362961647008.htm>\n\n7、V神公开地址：0xab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b\n\n8、V神转出shib交易哈希：0xfccd3aec3c5bb9afa7114bb713a2da1c29c4a962afbb86b86e1baf95b69e3114\n\n9、EIP-1559提案：<https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md>\n\n10、查看ETH燃烧数据：<https://ultrasound.money/>", "timestamp": 1635756425, "digest": "zzZ5Nm-oNnXm8TRAhmg3WMdpMXpfuZ-wIeHHD2JvDXw", "contributor": "0x8A9800738483e9D42CA377D8F95cc5960e6912d1"}

We were not ready for it. We were all ready for the bitcoin move, but we were never ready for shiba inu.”\n\nMenon suspects that there is some amount of unit bias at play. That’s where a novice trader is prone to buy a lot of one kind of cryptocurrency because the price of one unit of it is relatively small compared with, say, bitcoin even though one can buy the same dollar amount in bitcoin as the low-priced coin.\n\nFor investors who are dipping their toes in the water with a relatively small amount of money, a low-priced coin can make one feel a little richer.

On the other hand, it buys about 10 million SHIB.\n\n# What the data show\n\nAnd while some “smart money” is starting to appear to be[ trading shiba inu and dogecoin](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/27/shib-flippened-doge-with-160m-in-smart-money-backing-latest-pump-blockchain-data-shows/), “whales,” or large investors, remain in the more familiar seas of bitcoin and ether.\n\nThat can be seen in average trading volume.\n\nBitcoin and ether average trade sizes are larger than those of dogecoin and shiba inu on almost every exchange. On Coinbase, bitcoin’s average trade size is hovering at around $2,000, while ether trades average $1,600. On the other hand, the exchange sees average trades for dogecoin and shiba inu of roughly $800.\n\n“This suggests price action is mostly retail-driven,” said Clara Medalie, strategic initiatives and research lead at digital asset data provider Kaiko, adding that on Binance, the average trade for bitcoin and ether is about $2,000. That figure is $1,200 for dogecoin and $900 for shibu inu.\n\n“While average trade size isn’t a perfect gauge for institutional investment – most large traders break apart their orders into smaller sizes – we can still observe clear trends that correspond with waves of interest,” she said.\n\n# Dog days\n\nYet the data shows that meme coins face their own cycle, Medalie noted.\n\n“It is interesting to note that average trade size for nearly all assets has increased considerably since the start of the bull run last November,” Medalie said. “With meme tokens such as DOGE and SHIB, we can observe spikes during the initial fervor and then sharp declines once the excitement wears off.”\n\nAnd all crypto moves at least somewhat together, including how large trades get. “We can also observe that bitcoin, ethereum and doge seem to have similar trend lines for average trade size, strongly correlated to mini-bull runs,” Medalie said, pointing out that trade sizes for all assets spiked right before the May crash.\n\nMeanwhile, meme coins serve another purpose.\n\nRetail traders test out the experience of buying, holding and selling a small amount of cryptocurrency on new platforms by placing different types of orders and seeing how they get filled – or not. While holding $100 worth of bitcoin can be bought just the same, if not more easily, than $100 of dogecoin or shiba inu, it may take newbies a little bit of time to wrap their heads around that concept. What’s more, their experience with wild swings in meme coins will prime them for the volatile, though relatively “safer,” major cryptos like bitcoin or ether.\n\nAnd when those novice traders finally realize that a single, low-priced meme coin will never surpass the price of bitcoin or ether as they currently trade (if shiba inu traded near bitcoin’s at around $62,000, its total market cap would be $36.5 quintillion, or 7,313 times the value of the earth’s estimated [$5 quadrillion price tag](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/636789/how-much-is-earth-worth)), they may finally gain a little perspective, rid themselves of unit bias and use those meme coins instead to develop proper trader discipline.\n\nMeme coins thus can be seen as the gateway for retail investors to become more experienced crypto traders.\n\nAn obedience school, if you will.\n\nDISCLOSURE\n\n*The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a [strict set of editorial policies](https://www.coindesk.com/ethics/).

This is as true in a basic Excel file as it is in the most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems.\n\nA key element to the ongoing development of these AI systems is the labeling of vast troves of data, which must be done largely by humans. The costs of this labeling can be immense in terms of the time it takes and the large number of people needed to collaborate on these projects. But a new way is emerging that combines the decentralization of blockchain with the incentive structures of crypto that can take data labeling for AI to the next level.\n\nEpiK Protocol reduces the costs of labeling AI data via a sharing economy platform based on blockchain technology. Since the launch of the EpiK Protocol mainnet on Aug. 15, 2021, the EpiK Protocol ecosystem has been rapidly adopted. There are four core components in this innovative platform: the incentive model, the governance model, an AI data storage system and an AI data labeling system.\n\nIn the two months since the mainnet went live, EpiK Protocol has proven three of the four components are working well.\n\n* [The stable mainnet](https://www.epik-protocol.io/countdown) and growing global community can prove the feasibility of the EPK incentive model.\n* [EPIP-1](https://www.epik-protocol.io/predao), the first IPFS ecological proposal passed through DAO governance, proves the strong consensus brought by the governance model.\n* [More than 30,000 knowledge nodes](https://explorer.epik-protocol.io/#/) joining the network to contribute idle storage resources prove the success of the AI data storage system.\n\nIn order to complete the last component of decentralized storage protocol for AI data, EpiK Protocol started the first round of domain experts elections on Oct. 15, 2021. These domain experts will lead all EPK holders to label the most valuable AI data to prove the value of the EpiK Protocol network.\n\nEpiK Protocol offered two domain expert candidates from the emotion AI and finance fields, each with achievements and rich industry experiences in their respective domains. Pending the votes of EPKers in the next 30 days, these candidates will be nominated as active domain experts on Nov. 15, 2021.\n\nSince its inception, EpiK Protocol has always been based on an open, sharing economy network for AI data. With the participation of the domain experts, EpiK Protocol can not only build larger and more comprehensive graph databases in different domains, but also can develop smarter AI with these valuable AI data.\n\nMore domain experts are wanted in the EpiK Protocol network. If you have rich experience in AI development and a clear understanding of what kind of data is needed in a specific AI domain, you can follow this [guideline](https://epikprotocol.medium.com/epik-domain-expert-campaign-guideline-a93f96946779) to apply to be a domain expert with the incentive to collect high-quality AI data in the EpiK Protocol network.\n\nThe era of cognitive intelligence depends on the participation of an increasing number of experts and data labelers. In the near future, AI will gradually learn human knowledge and replace human work in various fields.

Immediately, she took a screenshot, fearing that her data would be used for illicit purposes.\n\n*\"This document number is already registered.\" The message, in Spanish, that Gutierrez received when she tried to activate her wallet (Cynthia Gutierrez)*\n\nGutierrez’s case is one of the hundreds that Salvadorans have reported on social media and to local advocates since September, when bitcoin was established as legal tender and Chivo started being [massively used in the country](https://www.google.com/search?q=sheldon+coindesk+bukele&oq=sheldon+coindesk+bukele&aqs=chrome..69i57.3050j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).\n\nBetween Oct. 9 and Oct. 14, Cristosal, a human rights organization in El Salvador, received 755 notifications of Salvadorans reporting identity theft with their Chivo Wallets, Rina Montti, the group’s director of human rights research, told CoinDesk.\n\nIn the majority of those cases, the affected Salvadorans tried to activate their wallets after they learned of the large number of people reporting that their identities had been stolen.\n\nThe hackers had an incentive: Each wallet came loaded with $30 worth of bitcoin, provided by the administration of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to encourage citizens to use the cryptocurrency.\n\nEl Salvador’s government did not respond to a request for comment about claims of identity theft involving the wallets by press time.\n\nWith the adoption of bitcoin, Bukele positioned his Central American country at the center of a global discussion about the future of money. The process was not without its [critics](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/08/vitalik-buterin-calls-mandatory-use-of-bitcoin-in-el-salvador-counter-to-cryptos-ideals-of-freedom/), such as those made against Article 7 of the law, which stipulates that all merchants must accept bitcoin as a form of payment when customers offer it.\n\nThe president later [denied](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/23/el-salvador-will-not-require-bitcoin-acceptance-president-bukele-confirms/) that bitcoin acceptance would be mandatory. Salvadorans were baffled by the discrepancy between what the president said and what the law stated.\n\nIn August, polls [showed](https://apnews.com/article/48c28c287a849f82eac7126c7d33c2c9) that 65% to 70% of Salvadorans opposed the adoption of bitcoin, and several protest marches took place in the streets. According to the latest official [data provided by Bukele](https://www.google.com/search?q=sheldon+coindesk+bukele&oq=sheldon+coindesk+bukele&aqs=chrome..69i57.3050j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) at the end of September, more than 2 million people downloaded the Chivo Wallet, as part of an aggressive agenda that also included bitcoin mining with [volcanic energy](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/01/el-salvador-mines-first-bitcoin-with-volcanic-energy/).\n\n## Easy to fool\n\nAccording to Chivo’s official website, opening an account requires scanning the DUI front and back, and then performing facial recognition to check the registrant’s identity. But several Salvadorans reported evidence that the system is flawed.\n\nWhen Adam Flores, a Salvadoran YouTuber who runs the channel [La Gatada SV](https://www.youtube.com/c/LaGatadaSv), heard about the hacks, he remembered that his grandmother had not opened her Chivo Wallet and decided to use the case as a test. Even though he only had a photocopy of her DUI, he tried it anyway and, to his amazement, the application accepted the document as valid.\n\nFlores followed through with the verification process, which then asked for real-time facial recognition. The YouTuber snapped a photo of a poster on his wall of Sarah Connor — a character from the “Terminator” movie series.\n\nSeconds later, Chivo Wallet welcomed his grandmother and released the $30 incentive, according to a video Flores sent to CoinDesk as evidence.\n\n0 seconds of 59 secondsVolume 90%\n\n \n\nOther cases [uploaded](https://twitter.com/mas_sv89/status/1444105230665359360?s=21) to social media directly showed how just a random photo — in one case, of a coffee mug — was enough to replace the DUI and then fool the face recognition test.\n\nSalvadorans do not always try to open their accounts themselves. According to Montti, of Cristosal, most of the 700 Salvadorans who reported identity theft asked acquaintances to try to transfer money through Chivo by putting their DUI numbers in the recipient field. They discovered the addresses were ready to receive transfers. In other words, the ID numbers were already registered, by someone other than the rightful owner.\n\nWorried about impersonation, Ramón Esquivel asked an acquaintance to send money to a wallet with his DUI on Oct. 11. To his surprise, the transfer was successful, even though he had never activated his account.\n\n“With anger, I realized that they had used my DUI,” Esquivel told CoinDesk, adding that after the episode he filed a complaint in the attorney general’s office. “I’m exposed to being used to commit acts of money laundering that would be registered under my identity, compromising my integrity,” he stated.\n\nOther cases showed that the fraudsters diverted the money to accounts that were not even their own, but those of other hacked people.\n\n## Customer support\n\nTwo weeks ago, Gabriela Sosa, a Salvadoran media host, tried to activate a Chivo Wallet with her DUI, but an error message jumped up on the screen informing her it was already registered.\n\nAs soon as it happened, she called the official support number for Chivo, 192. “I kept calling for several days until they told me I had to go to a Chivo point,” Sosa told CoinDesk. Last Saturday, she went to that help center and her account was finally recovered, but the money was not.\n\nOn her Twitter account, Sosa released details of the account to which the $30 had been directed. The owner’s name was Michael Santacruz.\n\nDays later, co-workers and university colleagues sent screenshots of that tweet to Santacruz, who had never activated his Chivo account until then, according to private chat messages he sent to Sosa that [she posted](https://twitter.com/GabrielaSosa_sv/status/1453462479598653443).\n\nHe tried, then, to open his account but a notification said his DUI had already been registered. Like Sosa, Santacruz approached a Chivo help center, and after recovering his account, he realized that it had been used to receive money from five hacked accounts, he said. (Attempts to reach Santacruz for comment were unsuccessful.)\n\n*Transactions made from Michael Santacruz's wallet. (Gabriela Sosa)*\n\nCristosal was not the only nongovernmental organization (NGO) to tackle the problem. Acción Ciudadana, a non-profit specializing in social auditing, filed a notice to the Attorney General’s Office (FGR) on Oct. 12 after the group’s President Humberto Sáenz and Director Eduardo Escobar found hackers had registered their Chivo Wallets.\n\nAcción Ciudadana told CoinDesk that up to now, two weeks after the filing, there was no response from the FGR.\n\nLaura Nathalie Hernández, a tech lawyer at the Salvadoran firm Legal Novis, has been receiving requests for help from victims of identity theft regarding their Chivo Wallets. The first recommendation she gave to the affected people was to post the incident on social media to make it public and also file a report with the attorney general’s office.\n\nAccording to Hernández, the entity that manages the application should be the first place to turn to. “But we don’t have much information about who is responsible either,” she said, adding: “We don’t know who manages it, if there is a third company. There has been no transparency.”\n\n## Unclear accountability\n\nAccording to Chivo’s terms and conditions, the authorization of an account is conditioned on a know-your-customer (KYC) process carried out by CHIVO S.A. de C.V., a [private company](https://www.eleconomista.net/economia/El-Salvador-miembros-de-Nuevas-Ideas-al-frente-de-empresa-que-administra-Chivo-Wallet-20210909-0001.html) created by the government to launch the wallet. This verification process “includes the provision of the information and documents required for full compliance with the process.”\n\nThe company’s accountability is unclear. According to the [terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20211020080957/https://chivowallet.com/politica-de-privacidad.html), users agree “not to disclose or divulge to third parties any information, DUIs, passwords or any code used to access the site.” But the terms also state that it “will not be liable for any loss or damage that the user may suffer as a result of unauthorized third party access to your account as a result of hacks or lost passwords.”\n\nChivo’s support staff did not answer CoinDesk’s questions about who is responsible for a hack where the real account owner does not provide information.\n\nThe wallet adds that the verification services will be provided by the company directly and/or through a third party contracted by the company for such purpose. But by press time, it had not answered CoinDesk’s question about what other third party provides identification services to the platform.\n\nSosa, the Salvadoran media host, told CoinDesk that she eventually got her money back and emphasized that her complaint is not against the application or Bukele’s government, just that she wants to raise awareness of the problem.\n\nGutierrez has not yet recouped her money. “I tried to contact customer service, and they did not give me an answer, nor is there an institution that is clear about the process to follow in this case,” she said.\n\nEsquivel said he is not interested in either the $30 incentive or the government app.", "timestamp": 1635756908, "digest": "fqPIdT2Z7xejNuzIz0LjGLZ1KQdDDRZNbDqNL1389ag", "contributor": "0x9fEBE8Fef2023A1471822697F2EE016e30D61953"}

{"id": "XerQIa2M6IbpMaJygLO5hGzqyvFGe1sGbki0_zb6oxo", "title": "Jack Dorsey Is Right About Inflation – Partly", "body": "Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey caused a stir among mainstream economic and political commentators when he tweeted last week about a threat to society from hyperinflation.\n\nMSNBC’s Chris Hayes called it an [“incredibly revealing tweet,”](https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/1451742395146686472?s=20) later suggesting it was self-servingly motivated by Dorsey being [“heavily into crypto.”](https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/1451752754628677633?s=20) Calling the United States’ current bout of rising prices “hyperinflation,” Hayes said, is akin to promoting the antiparasitic drug Ivermectin as a cure for COVID-19. Wired columnist Virginia Hefferman called Dorsey’s tweet [“insanely reckless,”](https://twitter.com/page88/status/1452383306251702281?s=20) suggesting that someone with his reach can deliver a self-serving prophecy.\n\nMany in the Bitcoin community, on the other hand, applauded the Twitter CEO. Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation argued that Hayes’ perspective was too narrow and that [Dorsey was referring to people’s experience with inflation around the globe.](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1451745395252490248?s=20)\n\n***You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter [here](https://www.coindesk.com/newsletter/money-reimagined).***\n\nFor the record, I tend to agree with the [more measured view of another Bitcoiner, Cathie Wood](https://twitter.com/CathieDWood/status/1452492766936772610?s=20), who disputed that there is any sign of hyperinflation in the data. The term is typically reserved for cases where inflation of more than 50% per month, which when compounded results in an almost 13,000% annualized increase. (The latest U.S. consumer price index readout was up 5.4% from a year ago – the highest rate in 30 years, but nothing like [Weimar Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic) or [Zimbabwe in the 2000s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe).)\n\nBut what I really want to focus on is how this episode reveals two different world views of inflation’s origins and, by extension, on how to keep it under control. I also argue that the Bitcoiner perspective offers a valuable framework for understanding the biggest risk factor in all this: a decline in public trust in policymakers. This loss of trust challenges the incumbent financial system and is a key reason why bitcoin, which stands as a hedge against that system’s outright failure, hit new all-time highs last week and is now up 20x since March 2020.\n\n## Balancing act\n\nTo break down how traditional central bankers’ see inflation risks, it’s useful to dissect Wired columnist Hefferman’s assertion that “the word @jack tweeted should not be uttered unless you’re trying to bring it into being.” As Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter [pointed out](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1452658012120928262?s=20), Hefferman was expressing Federal Reserve dogma: that inflation is derived from “expectations.”\n\nThe idea is that if people expect inflation, they will preemptively protect their purchasing power by asking for higher prices, or wages, for their goods or services, which reinforces other people’s inflationary expectations and prompts them to do the same, creating an upward spiral.\n\nAs Carter notes, this makes central bankers obsessed with their own messaging.\n\nWe’ve seen this concern with messaging take on special significance over the past decade, although throughout that time the Federal Reserve’s concerns were not with the psychology of inflation but with the opposite: a deflationary spiral, where expectations of falling prices lead people to postpone spending, which lowers demand for goods and services, which in turn pushes prices lower. To manage that, the Fed’s 12 voting members had to try to manipulate the thinking of the bond market.\n\nWith interest rates at virtually zero for over a decade, the Fed and other central banks instead tried to charge up a still-sluggish global economy via “quantitative easing,” printing money to purchase trillions of dollars in bonds and other assets to drive down market interest rates and keep credit flowing. That led to an increasingly complex psychological relationship between the Fed and the market.\n\nOn the one hand, the Fed worried that bond traders were overly worried that it was getting overly worried about inflation. If traders thought the central bank was going to prematurely stop bond purchases to let market rates rise to slow growth and curtail inflation, then there was a risk those traders would prematurely sell bonds, which would have the unwelcome self-fulfilling effect of driving up rates before a sustained recovery could take root.\n\nOn the other hand, the Fed also worried that if it was too overt in telling the market not to worry, it could drive asset prices too high, fostering a dangerous bubble.\n\nAs it performed this delicate balancing act, Fed policy became more about what was said – that it would tolerate above-target inflation for an indeterminate period in the future, for example – than about what was actually done.\n\nThink about it: A group of just 12 people, with discretionary power to set the monetary policy for the world’s reserve currency, try to guess and manage the fears and hopes of billions of people worldwide, and then implement that policy via a meta-level mind game with Wall Street’s notoriously egotistical trading community. It seems kinda nuts.\n\nYet, in some respects this is the unavoidable outcome of a fiat monetary system created after the collapse of the gold-pegged, hard-money system in which monetary policymakers had no such discretion.\n\n## The bitcoin standard\n\nWith bitcoin there is, in theory, no capacity for this kind of mind game to arise. There is no uncertainty. Whether or not consumers, producers or bond market vigilantes like it, new bitcoins are created at a predictable rate that no one can alter, with total supply destined to top out at 21 million by the year 2140.\n\nIn a predictable system like this, the theory goes, no harm can come from what people say, whether it’s Dorsey spouting off or a central banker uttering the wrong choice of words, because the defining factor behind inflation – money supply – is predictable.\n\nThis perspective is framed by the famous maxim from monetarist economist Milton Friedman that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.”\n\nNote: Friedman did not mean that, absent a change in monetary conditions, prices won’t change. Prices will always be impacted by demand and supply conditions. But without monetary distortions, one-off price changes provide a mechanism for attaining stability because demand and supply for the good or service in question will adjust accordingly until market equilibrium is reached.\n\nWhat Friedman was referring to was not these one-off price increases but inflation, which he defined as a “steady and sustained rise” in the economy’s general price level. This, he argued, can occur only with monetary expansion, which, all things being equal, leads to a cycle of higher prices from a larger supply of money in circulation.\n\n## Trust\n\nFew central bankers would dispute that monetary conditions contribute significantly to inflation. But because they’re not naturally inclined to find blame for inflationary pressures in their policies, they tend not to focus on their own role in creating those conditions and instead try to correct the behavior of everyone else: the consumers, producers and investors whose decisions dictate demand, supply and pricing expectations.\n\nCentral bankers are right to point to frequent examples where suboptimal market behavior, especially irrational herd-like behavior, leads to financial crises. This includes the practice of hoarding hard money such as gold – or potentially bitcoin – which exacerbates the currency’s scarcity, reduces transactions and fosters deflation.\n\nBut the bigger risk, one that they fail too frequently to recognize, is that these policymakers can lose the public’s trust. This is especially a concern when inflation starts to appear in fiat-based economies. Without people’s trust, all that carefully calibrated signaling and messaging is meaningless.\n\nMonetary systems tend to act like a pendulum. They swing between rigid, hard-money conditions to offset the loss of trust in discretionary policymaking and then break free of those rigidities to give a monetary boost to growth.\n\nRight now, after a decade of uneven growth where sharp asset inflation has coexisted with stagnant median incomes for the general public, we may be entering the former phase. There is a greater risk than perhaps at any time since the 1970s that trust in government leadership of the economy will drop to untenable levels.\n\nThat’s why even this modest pickup in inflation has people legitimately worried that it could grow into something bigger. It’s why it should be okay to mention the “H word” – if only to put it on the table, as a risk to consider.\n\nDISCLOSURE", "timestamp": 1635757187, "digest": "bI8G2x3On0oFYJmKn2NBL8WcvdlvgYg7G8nrpQmiQ20", "contributor": "0x901C4828494a1780e0ACF1A285d1C48558758FD3"}

Climate leaders and experts are calling it the world's last best chance to address the climate crisis.\n\n[G20 agrees on key climate goals around global warming limits and coal financing, but lacks firm commitments](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/31/politics/g20-climate-communique/index.html)\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose government is hosting the talks, will warn Monday that humanity has run down the clock on climate change.\n\n* \n\n\"It's one minute to midnight, and we need to act now,\" he will say in an opening speech, according to remarks sent to journalists.\n\n* \n\n\"We have to move from talk and debate and discussion to concerted, real-world action on coal, cars, cash and trees. Not more hopes and targets and aspirations, valuable though they are, but clear commitments and concrete timetables for change.\"\n\nThe G20 leaders' meeting that ended in Rome on Sunday suggests that leaders are finally listening to the science, but they still lack the political unity to make the ambitious decisions required to meet the moment.\n\nCOP26 convenes about 25,000 people for one of the biggest international events since the pandemic began, and it comes after a year of extreme weather that claimed hundreds of lives in unexpected places that caught even climate scientists off guard.\n\nThe [latest UN climate science report published in August](http://www.cnn.com/2021/08/09/world/global-climate-change-report-un-ipcc/index.html) made clear what needs to happen: Limit global warming to as close to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures as possible to avert worsening impacts of the climate crisis. To do that, the world must halve emissions over the next decade and, by mid-century, reach net zero -- where greenhouse gas emissions are no greater than the amount removed from the atmosphere.\n\nAll of this language was in the G20 leaders' communiqué, including an acknowledgment that to meet net zero by mid-century, many member nations will need to lift their emissions-reductions pledges, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), over this decade.\n\nG20 leaders perform the traditional coin toss in front of the Trevi Fountain at the G20 summit in Rome on Sunday.\n\nBut their failure to put an end date on the use of coal -- the single biggest contributor to climate change -- and to get all countries to firmly commit to net zero by 2050 (as opposed to 2060, as China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have pledged) shows that the countries that use and produce fossil fuels still have a huge amount of sway in global deals on climate.\n\nIndeed, China's long-awaited new emissions pledge submitted last week was just a fraction higher than its previous one. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Sunday it wouldn't be strong-armed into net zero by 2050. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison showed no interest in consigning coal to history. India has made no net-zero pledge and, as European lawmaker Bas Eickhout told CNN, it was one of a handful of nations against putting a date on phasing out coal.\n\nMichael Mann, a leading scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said it is promising that leaders have acknowledged they need to do more on emissions this decade, but what is important is making sure all big emitters have plans that are consistent with keeping warming below 1.5 degrees.\n\n\"And also a closing of the 'implementation gap' -- that is to say, the gap between what heads of state have nominally committed to, and what they're actually doing,\" Mann said.\n\n[What is COP26? How the pivotal UN conference could avert global climate 'catastrophe'](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/23/world/what-is-cop26-glasgow-un-climate-conference-cmd-intl/index.html)\n\nMann warned that COP26 must not be a summit for delay tactics and said he still had hope that countries could agree to a phaseout of coal at the talks, even if the G20 leaders failed to agree on that point.\n\n\"The rather conservative International Energy Agency itself has said there can be no new fossil fuel infrastructure if we are to avert dangerous warming. And the G7 nations committed to phasing out coal and ending support for new coal projects earlier this summer,\" Mann said.\n\n\"We need to see similar commitments from the G20 countries, including an accelerated schedule for phasing out coal.\"\n\nThe G20 statement did commit to an end to coal financing abroad by the end of this year. Chinese President Xi Jinping at the UN General Assembly in September announced an end to Chinese financing of international coal, taking the biggest global financier of coal projects out of the mix.\n\nStay informed on the climate\n\n* [Why wildfires happen](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/11/world/wildfires-climate-change-arson-explainer-intl/index.html?utm_source=factbox)\n* [What does 'net zero' mean?](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/15/world/climate-cop26-glossary-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html?utm_source=factbox)\n* [Latest climate news and explainers](https://www.cnn.com/specials/world/cnn-climate?utm_source=factbox)\n\nHelen Mountford, vice president of climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, said the agreement and current emissions pledges are not ambitious enough to avoid the most dangerous levels of warming and many were unlikely to actually get countries on track for their own net-zero plans.\n\n\"To keep the 1.5°C goal within reach, countries need to set 2030 climate targets that chart a realistic pathway to deliver these net-zero commitments,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"Currently, a number of G20 countries are not on a credible trajectory to reach their net-zero goals, including Australia, Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Turkey.\"\n\n### 'This isn't nearly enough'\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres said Sunday that he was leaving Rome \"with my hopes unfulfilled — but at least they are not buried.\" He was hopeful that Glasgow could still \"keep the goal of 1.5 degrees alive.\"\n\nHis comments reflect the mood of many at COP26. If the G20 couldn't put an end date on coal and make a firm net-zero commitment, there is a sense that getting the whole world on board with those key issues simply won't happen.\n\n[Flooding destroyed his home four times in three years. This is the reality of climate change for India's poor](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/30/india/india-flooding-climate-displacement-intl-hnk-dst/index.html)\n\nThere is also an issue of trust. The developed world promised more than a decade ago it would transfer $100 billion a year to the Global South to help it transition to low-carbon economies and to adapt to the new world of the climate crisis.\n\nThat target was not met last year, and a report from the COP26 presidency published last week showed it wouldn't be met until 2023, with the current pledges in hand.\n\nMohamed Nasheed, Maldives' former President who leads the Climate Vulnerable Forum, lamented the lack of action in the G20's statement, particularly on the failure to phase out coal. Maldives is a frontline nation in the climate crisis and risks being submerged by sea level rise by the end of the century.\n\n\"This is a welcome start,\" Nasheed said in a statement. \"But it won't stop the climate from heating more than 1.5 degrees and devastating large parts of the world, including the Maldives. And so, clearly, this isn't nearly enough.\"\n\nNet zero, the phaseout of coal and delivering on climate finance will still be a priority for negotiators. Other areas that could prove successful are an agreement on ending and reversing deforestation by 2030 and movement around speeding up the transition to electric vehicles globally.\n\nTom Burke, co-founder of climate think tank E3G, was more optimistic, saying the G20 statement showed a change in thinking among leaders around the urgency of the climate crisis.\n\n* \n\n\"The big win is this shift in the focus from 2050 to 2030. I think that's an important big win,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"It sends it off to a better start than we had been expecting. The political agreement achieved at the G20 will create political impetus as leaders meet to start the COP.\"", "timestamp": 1635757324, "digest": "w__uYn6s-auN10iGA272jqXTXZdtXsAQo_DrxaMTRJs", "contributor": "0xF701458E2D6717439ED97C778745d2D489b00797"}

His fallback strategy is a bill that would provide $555 billion in clean energy tax credits and incentives. It would be the largest amount ever spent by the United States to tackle global warming but would cut only about half as much pollution.\n\nAnd that proposal is still pending; Mr. Biden was unable to bridge divisions between progressives and moderates in his own party to cement a deal before leaving for Glasgow. If the legislation passes, he hopes to pair it with [new environmental regulations,](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/us/scotus-epa-carbon-emissions.html) although they have yet to be completed and could be undone by a future president.\n\nThe president traveled to Glasgow from Rome, where the world’s 20 largest economies met and decided on Sunday that they would no longer finance new coal operations overseas.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Continue reading the main story](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/31/climate/climate-change-biden-cop26.html#after-story-ad-1)\n\nBut they failed to agree to set a date for ending the use of the dirtiest fossil fuel at home, with China, India and Australia especially resistant. And that did not bode well for significant progress at the climate talks in Glasgow.\n\nThe leaders of the wealthy nations did say they were committed to the goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement to keep the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to preindustrial levels. That’s the threshold beyond which scientists say the dangers of global warming grow immensely. But the world is on track to heat up 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100, and the G20 leaders were unable to agree on concrete steps to change that.\n\nMr. Biden has made climate action a central theme of his presidency, winning praise from diplomats and other leaders, who expressed relief after former President Donald J. Trump had scoffed at climate science and had withdrawn the United States from global efforts to address the crisis.\n\nBut they remain skeptical, having seen other American presidents promise ambitious action to confront climate change, only to fall short.\n\n“Every country has its own challenging legislation process, but ultimately what matters is the outcome,” said Lia Nicholson, a senior adviser to the Alliance of Small Island States, a bloc of vulnerable island nations.\n\n## Editors’ Picks\n\n### He Won the Nobel.

Putin of Russia attended a summit on climate virtually in April.

The climate provisions would promote wind and solar power, electric vehicles, climate-friendly agriculture and forestry programs, and a host of other clean energy programs. Together, those programs could cut the United States’ emissions up to a quarter from 2005 levels by 2030, analysts say.\n\nThat’s about halfway to Mr. Biden’s goal of cutting the country’s emissions 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels. “We go in with a fact pattern that is pretty remarkable, as well as real momentum,” Ali Zaidi, the deputy White House national climate adviser, told reporters.\n\nMr. Biden plans to [release tough new auto pollution rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/climate/biden-tailpipe-emissions-electric-vehicles.html) designed to compel American automakers to ramp up sales of electric vehicles so that half of all new cars sold in the United States are electric by 2030, [up from just 2 percent](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/07/todays-electric-vehicle-market-slow-growth-in-u-s-faster-in-china-europe/) this year. His top appointees have also promised new restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants. And earlier this year, Biden administration officials said they would roll out a draft rule by September to regulate emissions of methane, a powerful planet-warming gas that leaks from existing oil and natural gas wells.\n\nSo far, the administration has not offered drafts of any of those rules. Several administration sources said that [delay has been due in part to staff shortages](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/01/climate/biden-scientists-shortage-climate.html), as well as an effort not to upset any lawmakers before they vote on Mr. Biden’s legislative agenda.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Continue reading the main story](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/31/climate/climate-change-biden-cop26.html#after-story-ad-4)\n\nBut time is running out. It can take years to complete work on such complex and controversial government policies, and several are likely to face legal challenges. On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority, said it would review the E.P.A.’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, potentially complicating Mr. Biden’s plans.\n\nImage\n\nSenator Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, has been one of the main holdouts on Mr. Biden’s ambitious climate legislation, and negotiations are ongoing.Credit...Al Drago for The New York Times\n\n## The U.S. track record\n\nFor three decades, American politics have complicated global climate efforts.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, joined the first global effort to tackle climate change, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. His Republican successor, President George W. Bush, renounced the treaty. Mr. Obama, another Democrat, joined the 2015 Paris Agreement and rolled out dozens of executive orders to help meet his promises to cut emissions. His Republican successor, Mr. Trump, abandoned the accord, [repealed more than 100](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html) of Mr. Obama’s regulations and took steps to expand fossil fuel drilling and mining.\n\nMr. Biden is facing similar resistance. No Republicans in Congress back his current climate effort. Representative Frank Lucas of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the House science committee, said the international community should be skeptical of the Biden administration’s promises. “I think they’ll roll their eyes just as people will continue to do in the United States,” Mr. Lucas said.\n\nThe president has also struggled to win over two pivotal players within his own party. Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, has been [steadfastly opposed](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/climate/biden-clean-energy-manchin.html) to a [central feature of Mr. Biden’s climate plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/22/climate/clean-electricity-climate.html): a program that would have rapidly compelled power plants to switch from burning coal, oil and gas, to using wind, solar and other clean energy. Mr. Manchin’s state is a top coal and gas producer, and he has [personal financial ties](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html) to the coal industry. He was able to kill the provision. Senator Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat of Arizona, has also withheld her support, saying she wants a more modest spending bill.\n\nEnvironmental leaders said America’s past inconsistency on climate action makes it more important for Mr. Biden to succeed now.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Continue reading the main story](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/31/climate/climate-change-biden-cop26.html#after-story-ad-5)\n\n“The U.S. has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the climate table and has slowed down action that was needed to tackle the climate crisis,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based environmental think tank. “That is the legacy Biden has to deal with.”\n\nImage\n\nFlooding in Wihui, central China, in July, one of several record-breaking catastrophes linked to climate change this past year.Credit...Chinatopix, via Associated Press\n\n## What’s at stake\n\nAverage global temperatures have already risen about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared with preindustrial levels, locking in an immediate future of rising seas, destructive storms and floods, ferocious fires and more severe drought and heat.\n\nAt least 85 percent of the planet’s population has already begun to experience the effects of climate change, according to research published in the journal Nature Climate Change. This summer alone, more than 150 people died in [violent flooding in Germany and Belgium](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/climate/germany-floods-climate-change.html). In central China, the [worst flooding on record displaced 250,000 people](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/22/world/asia/china-flood.html).

Clearly, we need to address it,” Patricia Espinosa, head of the U.N. climate agency, said Sunday as she welcomed delegates to Glasgow. “Clearly, we need to support the most vulnerable to cope. To do so successfully, greater ambition is now critical.”\n\nIf the planet heats even a half-degree more, it could lead to water and food shortages, mass extinctions of plants and animals, and more deadly heat and storms, scientists say.\n\nSara Noordeen is the chief climate envoy for the Maldives, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean. Most of the country comprises coral islands that sit only about three feet above sea level. Rising seas as a result of climate change mean the Maldives, which has been inhabited for thousands of years, could be submerged within a few generations.\n\nMr. Biden’s election has brought “a lot of hope” to countries like hers, Ms. Noordeen said. But, she added, “he needs that legislation to go through as well.”\n\nLisa Friedman reports on federal climate and environmental policy from Washington.

With the world's eyes on the crucial UN climate summit, the Guardian will bring you the facts, negotiations, news and science. For years, climate experts have stressed that Guardian reporting - independent, rigorous, persistent and open to all - is a critical tool to confront the climate crisis, which is intensifying around the world. Leaders, influenced by powerful lobbies, are now set to make decisions that will determine our future.\n\nWe have no shareholders and no billionaire owner. Just the determination and passion to deliver high-impact reporting for the world, always free from commercial and political influence. Reporting like this is vital for democracy, for fairness and to demand better from the powerful. And we provide all this for free, for everyone, regardless of their ability to pay for it.\n\nAs such, tens of millions have placed their trust in us for the last 200 years, turning to us in moments of crisis, uncertainty, solidarity and hope. With more than 1.5 million supporters in 180 countries, our model for open access journalism is better sustained, meaning we can reach more people. This helps everyone keep track of global events like the climate summit, understand their impact on people and communities, and become inspired to take meaningful action.\n\nWe take this emergency seriously as a news organisation: two years ago, we pledged to prioritise the climate crisis, and we've published some 6,000 pieces of environmental journalism since. We set ambitious targets to green our business, and have turned away from fossil fuel investments and advertising as a result.

He attended a prayer breakfast, a worship service, a barbecue at the home of a powerful state lawmaker, a meet-and-greet in the state’s farthest-flung corner and an evening get-out-the-vote rally.\n\nMcAuliffe, who served as the state’s governor from 2014 to 2018, has struggled in an election that many presumed would be a Democratic cake-walk after President Biden beat Donald Trump in the state by over 10 points last November.\n\nYoungkin’s campaign has been boosted by outrage over a variety of issues [related to schools and education](https://nypost.com/2021/10/30/republican-glenn-youngkin-has-edge-as-education-takes-center-stage-in-virginia-governor-race/), including whether parents should get a say in what books are or are not assigned to their children.\n\nYoungkin spent time in the far southwest corner of the state after campaigning in vote-rich northern Virginia on Saturday.\n\nAP\n\nDuring an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press” on Sunday, McAuliffe dismissed concerns about schools as a “racist dog whistle.” He claimed critical race theory was not taught in the state’s school — [despite a presentation](https://nypost.com/2021/10/30/va-education-department-boosts-critical-race-theory-despite-mcauliffe-claim/) on the Virginia Department of Education’s website urging teachers to “embrace” the theory.\n\nThe former advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton claimed “everyone clapped” after his [controversial comments](https://nypost.com/2021/10/15/virginia-parents-say-they-should-tell-schools-what-to-teach-poll/) in a debate last month that, “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.”\n\nVirginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger spoke and endorsed gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe.\n\nAP\n\n“The question should be, should parents be allowed to take books off of shelves? Should that be left to parents or left to school boards and others who do this every single day?” he asked. “Everyone clapped when I said it.”\n\n*With Post wires*\n\n### SHARE THIS ARTICLE:\n\n* [Facebook](https://nypost.com/2021/10/31/glenn-youngkin-terry-mcauliffe-make-final-pitch-to-virginians/?share=facebook&nb=1)\n* [Twitter](https://nypost.com/2021/10/31/glenn-youngkin-terry-mcauliffe-make-final-pitch-to-virginians/?share=twitter&nb=1)\n* [Flipboard](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Glenn%20Youngkin%2C%20Terry%20McAuliffe%20make%20final%20pitch%20to%20Virginians&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2021%2F10%2F31%2Fglenn-youngkin-terry-mcauliffe-make-final-pitch-to-virginians%2F&t=1635759815903&utm_campaign=tools&utm_medium=article-share&utm_source=nypost.com)\n* \n* [Email](https://nypost.com/2021/10/31/glenn-youngkin-terry-mcauliffe-make-final-pitch-to-virginians/?share=email&nb=1)\n* [Copy](https://nypost.com/2021/10/31/glenn-youngkin-terry-mcauliffe-make-final-pitch-to-virginians/)\n* \n\nFILED UNDER\n\n* [ELECTIONS](https://nypost.com/tag/elections/)\n* [GLENN YOUNGKIN](https://nypost.com/tag/glenn-youngkin/)\n* [TERRY MCAULIFFE](https://nypost.com/tag/terry-mcauliffe/)\n* [VIRGINIA](https://nypost.com/tag/virginia/)\n* [10/31/21](https://nypost.com/2021/10/31/)\n\n[READ NEXTPress secretary Jen Psaki tests positive for COVID-19](https://nypost.com/2021/10/31/jen-psaki-tests-positive-for-covid-19/)\n\n*SPONSORED STORIES*\n\n* [Cara and Poppy Delevingne List Whimsical Los Angeles Home for $3.75 MillionMansion Global](https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/cara-and-poppy-delevingne-list-whimsical-los-angeles-home-for-3-75-million-223596?reflink=outbrain_condo_$section_id$&obOrigUrl=true)\n* [Seeking future world opportunities in medical techFunds by J.P.

Marjorie Taylor Greene and like-minded lawmakers who support former President Donald Trump's debunked election theories aren't playing political games and are \"legitimately nuts.\"\n\n[During an episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tucker-carlson-is-doing-it-for-the-fish-sticks-w-adam-schiff/id1508202790?i=1000540089661) of \"The New Abnormal\" featuring editor-at-large Molly Jong-Fast, Schiff reflected on the state of the nation, expressing that \"we're at a very tenuous point in the history of our democracy\" and blasting \"people running around the country still pushing the Big Lie\" as they seek to remove officials across the country from administering elections independently.\n\n\"Are they pretending to be crazy or are they genuinely crazy?\" Jong-Fast asked Schiff.\n\n\"I think the MTGs are legitimately nuts, but most of the Republican conference that's pushing the Big Lie understands it's a big lie,\" he said. \"They're not stupid. They know exactly what they're doing. And then it is just craven capitulation to Donald Trump because they fear a primary, because they want to advance within the party.\"\n\n\"For every one Liz Cheney, there are at least five willing to say, 'If you're not willing to push the Big Lie, I volunteer. You know, nothing's more important to me than my ambition. And if it means tearing down one of the pillars of our democracy … then sign me up.'

Still, it might not be the miracle everyone was hoping for.\n\nAfter rising over 110,000% in less than a week, reports of “investors” who have been unable to sell their tokens after astronomical gains are starting to pop up all over the internet.\n\nThe token is ranked #2905 among the cryptocurrencies listed on Coinmarketcap, but the price aggregator itself has already [put up a banner](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/squid-game/) warning about the high risk of investing in the token because it might be blocking the posterior sales -something ubiquitous in several crypto scams.\n\n> We have received multiple reports that users are not able to sell this token in Pancakeswap. Please do your own due diligence and exercise caution while trading! This project, while clearly inspired by the Netflix show of the same name, is unlikely to be affiliated with the official IP.\n\n## Squid Game Token: Too Good To Be True?\n\nAs Cryptopotato[ reported earlier](https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-squid-game-squid-and-why-is-it-up-110000-in-5-days/), SQUID is just a week old. The token took inspiration from the Netflix series “Squid Game” – a show featuring a group of 456 financially broken contestants who face off in childish but deadly games with the goal of winning a juicy cash prize.\n\nThe project promises a sort of crypto adaptation for the game, requiring contestants to participate in several games before walking away with a substantial cryptocurrency prize. To participate, each player had to pay approximately half a million dollars in fees and take home a significant jackpot in case of being the only winner.\n\n```\nADVERTISEMENT\n```\n\nBut some people simply invested in the token to speculate without entering the game and apparently found it impossible to collect their winnings. The tactic could be a sort of anti-dump protection, but the game’s somewhat poorly written whitepaper makes no mention of any market control mechanism.\n\nThis is simply the validation of a series of red flags for the project. Cryptopotato warned that the project’s site promoted tweets from Elon Musk supposedly supporting the project, which was utterly false.\n\nSource: Squid.cash\n\nIn addition, the development team members have no known background —and it is hard to tell whether they really exist or not.\n\n## Social Media: An Invisible Power That Gives Value to the Worthless\n\nBut despite all of the above, meme cryptocurrencies are a global trend. Many people are willing to buy tokens just for the sake of participating in a sort of global joke.\n\nFrom tungsten cubes to tokens like [ElonSperm](https://www.coinbase.com/price/esperm) or [FuckElon](https://wccftech.com/fuckelon-coin-tags-a-new-all-time-high-as-elon-musk-again-trolls-the-crypto-community-via-a-series-of-tweets/) —depending on the sentiment of Crypto Twitter towards The Dogefather— the trend of driving up the price of a token by means of a community effort is something that has cemented itself in the foundations of the crypto-verse over the years.\n\nThe trend started with [Dogecoin](https://cryptopotato.com/doge-is-young-peoples-middle-finger-to-the-system-says-mike-novogratz/), a meme cryptocurrency that made it all the way to the top 10. Shiba Inu also reached a spot on this prestigious list. Other tokens such as Safemoon, Cumrocket, Floki Inu have also enjoyed their five minutes of fame.\n\nAnd NFT collectors are keeping up with the trend. [Rocks](https://cryptopotato.com/what-are-ether-rocks/), Kittens, and [numbers on black backgrounds](https://cryptopotato.com/nft-bubble-randomized-numbers-on-a-black-background-selling-at-starting-price-of-6-5k-each/) have been traded for hundreds of thousands – and even millions of dollars.\n\nSo it’s no wonder that many don’t feel ripped off by holding worthless tokens from a popular TV show. While some despair at the loss of money, others happily throw away their fortune “for the lols.”\n\n```\nSPECIAL OFFER (Sponsored)Binance Futures 50 USDT FREE Voucher: Use this link to register & get 10% off fees and 50 USDT when trading 500 USDT (limited offer).\n\nPrimeXBT Special Offer: Use this link to register & enter POTATO50 code to get 50% free bonus on any deposit up to 1 BTC.\n```", "timestamp": 1635759620, "digest": "5jc8jSHUwYFcbrKvQxvbMTVpSCtngsBekTgrfElAs8s", "contributor": "0x8B618F70Ab9b48034d51dD2B87eFEf243B118980"}

Their aim was to use these three levers to jolt the Japanese economy out of decades of slow-to-no growth mode.\n\nDuring these two leaders' tenure they had some success - the country's stock market has more than doubled in value. When Mr Abe became the country's prime minister for the second time in December 2012, the Nikkei 225 was below 10,000 yen. In February this year, it topped 30,000 for the first time since 1990.\n\nThe Nikkei has taken three decades to recover from the crash of the late 1980s which resulted in decades of economic decline for the country.\n\n## Salaries not keeping pace\n\nHowever, there are some harsh critics of the Abe strategy - including Mr Kishida - who argue Abenomics only made the rich in Japan richer. They want to see wealth shared out among the population more widely.\n\nDespite all the hype and international attention surrounding Abenomics, ordinary citizens have not felt much benefit from the policy. Some say it's even caused the wealth gap between the rich and poor to widen. (That's despite one metric, the Gini coefficient - which measures inequality in income distribution - narrowing slightly in the past decade.)\n\nOne of the reasons people don't feel they have more money in their pockets is because the average salary has hardly grown over the last three decades.\n\nImage caption,Japanese workers' take-home pay has improved very little over the last three decades\n\n[Average wages in Japan have stagnated](https://data.oecd.org/chart/6uGm) versus countries like the US and Germany over the last three decades, according to The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data.\n\nThere has been limited progress in productivity metrics too, Japan's gross domestic product per capita - which is a country's economic output per person - has fluctuated but it is at the same level today as it was in 1994.\n\nImage caption,Productivity rates have remained relatively static\n\nIn his first policy speech in parliament, Mr Kishida repeated the word \"bunpai\" or \"distribute\" 12 times. In comparison, Mr Abe used \"seicho\" or \"growth\" 11 times and Mr Suga said \"kaikaku\" or \"reforms\" 16 times.\n\nBut there are economists and investors who believe that Mr Kishida's sharp criticism of Abenomics was just a ploy to win over voters' support ahead of the general election and that there will be no radical changes.\n\n\"I doubt he has fully explained his economic policies. But by looking at who he appointed - Ms Takaichi as the policy chief and Mr Amari as the Secretary General - it indicates that Abenomics will likely continue under Mr Kishida,\" says investor, Aya Murakami.\n\nSanae Takaichi was a contender in the ruling party's leadership race, backed by former prime minister Shinzo Abe, while Akira Amari was an economy minister under Mr Abe and one of the architects of Abenomics. Mr Amari was a controversial appointment as he was embroiled in [a corruption scandal in 2016](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-35427563) and after losing his constituency seat in this weekend's election has reportedly offered to resign from his post.\n\nIMAGE SOURCE,GETTY IMAGES\n\nImage caption,When Mr Abe became PM in December 2012 the Nikkei 225 was below 10,000 yen in February it hit 30,000 for the first time since 1990\n\n## Delivering for workers\n\nWhether Japan returns to Abenomics or not, now that Mr Kishida is in office the most pressing question will be how should he handle growing discontent among Japanese workers?\n\nSeveral listed Japanese companies have posted record profits in recent years, leading to criticism for failing to pass back any of those gains to their hard-working employees with commensurate pay rises.\n\n\"Japan's growth hasn't been strong enough to distribute wealth,\" according to investor, Ms Murakami. \"They made profits abroad, not at home, so it is very difficult for companies to distribute \\[this money\\] when the profits weren't generated domestically,\" she adds.\n\nShe supports the party's policy chief Ms Takaichi's recent proposal to tax companies which are hoarding cash. \"At the moment, there are 2,500 companies that are listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange but over 10% of them have cash and deposits that are bigger than their market capitalisation, or they have cross-shareholdings,\" says Ms Murakami. \"They should be encouraged to invest that money to boost growth at home through taxation policies.\"\n\nWhen Kishida was elected as leader he vowed to \"listen to the voices of the people\" but backtracked on his plan to raise capital gains tax less in just a couple of weeks. So, it remains to be seen whose voices now - those of the investors or the workers - he will choose to listen to most closely, to set the tone for his policymaking.\n\n## Related Topics", "timestamp": 1635760406, "digest": "QpNQgYpGgW3Jpfv6gBo58QqbUDgOXzEQyCyeK5HiMdw", "contributor": "0xeeF8d0F4c1D7Cd87B0d7D9eb5cDe356985B922Ce"}

The tech tipster has frequently offered details about Apple hardware and processors and has often been close to the mark with many posts. This time around, the next iMac Pro is under the spotlight, and unsurprisingly it will be powered by either the [M1 Pro or M1 Max](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-M1-Pro-and-M1-Max-announced-with-vast-improvements-over-M1-take-the-fight-to-Tiger-Lake-H-CPUs-and-RTX-3080-GPUs-while-being-up-to-70-more-power-efficient.573818.0.html) SoCs – or maybe even a multiple CPU configuration for that unrivalled performance that will be expected from a 2022 iMac Pro all-in-one desktop PC.\n\n[ProMotion](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-iPhone-13-Pro-is-slated-to-boast-an-always-on-feature-for-its-120Hz-ProMotion-display.521527.0.html) technology will be available to deliver variable refresh rates to the Mini-LED screen, which will be surrounded by dark bezels. The base model of the purported 2022 iMac Pro will feature just 16 GB RAM and 512 GB storage although there will undoubtedly be numerous configuration options to beef these key components up. The overall look of the M1 Pro or M1 Max iMac Pro will allegedly resemble the 24-inch iMac and the Pro Display XDR. An HDMI port will be onboard along with an SD card reader and USB Type-C.\n\nThe power brick for the M1xxx Apple iMac Pro will also copy that of the [2021 iMac](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-iMac-24-M1-2021-in-review-Does-Apple-s-M1-SoC-also-convince-in-the-desktop.573710.0.html) by having an Ethernet connection incorporated into it. In addition, the leaker states that Face ID was tested but has not been confirmed. The iMac Pro should arrive in “1H 2022”, possibly at an Apple event in March if this leak ties in with other [rumors](https://www.notebookcheck.net/March-Apple-event-claim-sparks-product-launch-speculation-involving-iPhone-SE-2022-M1-Pro-Mac-mini-and-refreshed-iMac-computers.574869.0.html). The starting price for all this tech in a 27-inch shell? “At or over” US$2,000. There are hopes for 30-inch or 32-inch models, and although only 27 inches is mentioned there is still some production time left for Apple to surprise its fans again.\n\n[Buy the 24-inch Apple M1 iMac on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-24-inch-8%E2%80%91core-7%E2%80%91core-256GB/dp/B0932HVSYM?tag=nbcnewsnet-20)\n\n### Source(s)\n\n[@dylandkt](https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1454461506280636419)\n\n**Top 10 Laptops** \n [Multimedia](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Multimedia-Notebooks.98608.0.html), [Budget Multimedia](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Budget-Multimedia-Notebooks.281362.0.html), [Gaming](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Gaming-Notebooks.98628.0.html), [Budget Gaming](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Budget-Gaming-Notebooks.262742.0.html), [Lightweight Gaming](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Thin-Light-Gaming-Notebooks.126456.0.html), [Business](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Business-Notebooks.98925.0.html), [Budget Office](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Budget-Office-Notebooks.98853.0.html), [Workstation](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Mobile-Workstation-Laptops.65537.0.html), [Subnotebooks](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Ultra-Portable-Notebooks.98632.0.html), [Ultrabooks](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Ultrabooks.91067.0.html), [Chromebooks](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Chromebooks.150594.0.html)\n\n[under 300 USD/Euros](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Bargain-Laptops.124349.0.html), [under 500 USD/Euros](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Bargain-Laptops.124349.0.html), [1,000 USD/Euros](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Notebooks-For-Less-Than-1-000-Euros.139358.0.html), [for University Students](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Notebooks-for-School-Aged-Kids-and-College-Students.125653.0.html), [Best Displays](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Notebooks-with-the-Best-Displays.120541.0.html)\n\n**Top 10 Smartphones** \n [Smartphones](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Smartphones.101858.0.html), [Phablets](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Smartphones-with-Large-Display.161654.0.html), [≤6-inch](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Compact-Smartphones.161694.0.html), [Camera Smartphones](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Camera-Smartphones.283106.0.html)\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[March Apple event claim sparks product launch speculation involving iPhone SE 2022, M1 Pro Mac mini, and refreshed iMac computers 10/24/2021](https://www.notebookcheck.net/March-Apple-event-claim-sparks-product-launch-speculation-involving-iPhone-SE-2022-M1-Pro-Mac-mini-and-refreshed-iMac-computers.574869.0.html)\n\n[Concept renders imagine a new Apple iMac patent with a curved glass case 09/08/2021](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Concept-renders-imagine-a-new-Apple-iMac-patent-with-a-curved-glass-case.559161.0.html)\n\n[Next-generation Apple iPad mini coming this fall;

这些数字代币的限制为零，我会告诉你我的意思…… (I太兴奋了，不能早点分享这个），在过去的几个月里，我一直在通过许多 dApp 努力尝试不同的 NFT，试图推动“规范” ， 作为内容创作者，我在这里遇到了相当大的困境： 我想要一种在不牺牲我的核心价值观的情况下通过某些工作获利的方法， 我不想牺牲任何收入、互操作性、去中心化或혰호혯혦혳혴혩혪혱到中心化平台 我需要以“web 3.0”原生方式来做。 那么，我做了什么？ 这是事情开始变得非常有趣的地方…… 我创建了一个网站，上面有关于 DeFi 各种主题的文章，然后开始探索我的不同货币化选择。 首先是广告。 但正是在这里，我很快了解到除了 Google Adsense 之外别无选择…… Google Adsense 还从他们的创作者那里获得了 32% 以上的收入，所以这对我来说不是一个可行的选择。 我什至不会继续提及他们在新发布的文件中揭示的道德无能，详细说明他们从垄断中获得了多少…… 广告在经济上也没有多大意义。他们根据获得的眼睛数量向创作者支付任意低的利润；而不是基于其内容的质量。 这就是为什么点击诱饵是一个问题。 我的内容还针对特定的受众……这些问题给我留下了一个明显的障碍，我必须弄清楚如何克服 。 解决方案？会员资格。 但不仅仅是任何会员资格，这些会员资格将在区块链上表示 ， 我发现这随后打开了一个充满令人兴奋的可能性的新世界，还记得我在上一条推文中描述的网站吗？ 在解锁协议的帮助下，我已经做到了只有特定 NFT 的持有者才能查看网站上的特殊页面 ， 连接后，将显示文章的其余部分。 看一看，NFT 持有者还可以在网站上发表评论以及许多其他功能\n&您只需购买一次。 烘焙 NFT 可以通过以下方式购买$ETH， 或者$USDC ， 它们甚至可以用信用卡购买，在后端进行稳定币交易，但它变得更加有趣。 由于这些会员资格是区块链上的代币，因此它们不受任何特定平台的约束才能发挥作用。 它们可以在二级市场上自由交易、买卖、甚至借出！ （哦，每个人都有自己的糕点眨眼脸)， 例子： ——>鲍勃从朋友那里听说第 222 集的羊角面包播客上有 alpha ， ——> Bob 购买 Bakery NFT 并获得访问权限 ， ——> Bob 在查看内容后在二级市场上出售 Bakery NFT，说到其他平台，如果这个 Bakery NFT 不是平台可互操作的，它就不会正确地展示新的 web 3.0 技术的功能 ， 所以......让持有者可以访问网站上的特殊研究的同一个 NFT 也授予了私人不和谐的角色！ 还是没有印象？好吧，NFT 还将提供时事通讯访问权限，以及我很高兴稍后分享的许多其他内容： （采访、分析、讨论、推文等） ， NFT 只需几行代码即可集成。 即使是合作伙伴网站也可以在他们的网站上使用我的 NFT！ 担心煤气？没问题！ Bakery NFT 将部署在 Optimism、Arbitrum、Polygon 和许多其他第二层网络上 ， 除了购买之外的交互只需要消息签名（无燃料） ， 每次购买时也会退还一定比例的gas，并使用代币，不喜欢我的内容？ 在特定时间范围内，用户可以通过销毁 NFT 获得即时、按比例退款。 会员将分为两层： Tier 1 - 独享、无时间限制、有限供应、VIP 访问、支付Tier 2 的红利(TBD) ， 第 2 层 - 基本访问、无限供应、30 天订阅 ， 我会尽快发布更多关于 Bakery NFT 的信息，请留意更新！ 我在这些方面非常努力，希望在创造者经济中开始一场更伟大的运动。 我不是一个阴暗的超级编码员，但基础设施可以用 Web 3.0 构建和开始更大的事情。 我在这里提供的是真正的所有权。 让我们看看有影响力的人少说些话，多些行动。 为什么我们如此忙于发布关于区块链的推文，而不是在现实世界中使用它？ 我厌倦了这个空间是骗局和模因硬币的代名词。 NFT 赋予创作者终极权力。 它们将带来有趣的协同作用，使社区与经济激励措施保持一致。 我将被激励写出更好的内容，我的追随者也将被激励分享它， 这些是一些强大的网络效应。 内容创作者以前从未能够以这种可编程 + 平台无关的方式直接与他们的粉丝联系。 & 我才刚刚开始触及这种技术可以制造的东西的表面 ， 然而没有人谈论它......让我们改变它！\nFloot & Familiars (for Adventurers)，@FlootFamiliars，Loot derivative project including $FLOOT tokens and Familiars

Chainlink Community Ambassador\n1/#Chainlink以其将真实世界数据传送到区块链（例如价格信息）的能力而广为人知 ， 然而，它的能力远远超出了执行信任最小化的预言机计算 ， 这开辟了很多可能性，2/ Oracle 计算是使用去中心化预言机网络 (DON) 代表智能合约执行链下计算，同时锚定到区块链以生成信任最小化的过程，3/ 就像数据交付如何通过增加连接来扩展智能合约的功能一样，oracle 计算扩展了智能合约的可扩展性、成本效率、隐私性以及在区块链本身上无法实际实现的附加功能，4/ 区块链是一个非常强大的工具，利用链上计算为更新智能合约的状态（例如转移代币）提供最终结算层 ， 关键属性是它们具有高度的防篡改能力，因此值得信赖，5/ 然而，这并非没有限制 ， 为了达成强有力的共识，区块链将其功能限制在验证交易所需的范围内 ， 区块空间通常也受到限制以确保去中心化，6/ 这意味着高度分散的网络是防篡改的，但通常具有更高的交易成本和更低的速度 ， 高速链具有更高的吞吐量，但在隐私、自动化、随机性和互操作性等功能方面仍然受到限制，7/ 代替区块链为 dApp 执行所有可能的计算，大部分计算可以移到链下，结果在链上中继 ， 这是使用区块链作为最终解决方案的模型（他们擅长什么），同时避开他们的局限性，8/ 传统中心化 Web 2.0 平台提供区块链所需的丰富功能 ， 但是，它们没有提供用户对 dApp 所期望的信任最小化保证，9/ 没有端到端的去中心化、透明性和抗篡改计算驱动的 dApp，就没有理由首先使用区块链 ， 因此，需要一个中间地带的解决方案，介于 Web 2.0 和区块链之间，10/ 这就是 oracle 计算发挥作用的地方 ， 如前所述，预言机计算是在锚定到区块链的去中心化预言机网络 (DON) 上执行的信任最小化的链下计算，11/ DON 可以以与 Web 2.0 服务相当的可扩展且功能丰富的方式执行任何链下计算 ， 同时通过利用区块链技术和依赖性来实现正确性、正常运行时间和透明度，从而更加分散和最小化信任，12/ 预言机计算的信任最小化不仅仅是去中心化和链上服务协议的结果 ， DON 也可以使用多方计算、密码学证明、欺诈证明、重新执行等方法向区块链证明他们的计算，13/ 信任最小化是一个必要的属性，但与在链上做任何事情相比，这里的主要优势是预言机计算更加灵活 ， 区块链计算是高度标准化的，而预言机计算可以包含任何设计模式，14/ -任意数量的预言机节点， - 任意选择的节点， - 定制的执行计划， - 任何级别的加密经济安全， -任何验证技术， - 任何纵深防御技术， - 任何级别的隐私， - 任何级别的许可， - 任何外部依赖， -多得多，15/ 用户可以根据他们的预算、信任假设和一般需求优化他们喜欢的安全和性能级别 ， Oracle 计算不是一个理论概念，而是已经在#Chainlink今天的网络以支持现有和未来的服务，16/ Chainlink Keepers， 一种交易自动化解决方案，可在满足预定义条件时触发区块链计算运行 ， Oracle 计算通过链下执行智能合约代码来检查条件，结果在链上得到完全验证，17/ Keepers 不能是恶意的，因为他们正在触发预先编写的链上函数，以验证是否是时候执行所需的操作 ， 这可以被认为是链上重新执行，这里的关键优势是功能的触发是自动化的，18/ Chainlink 可验证随机函数（VRF）游戏骰子 ， VRF 是安全的随机数生成器，它产生一个随机值和一个加密证明，在被 dApp 消费之前在链上进行验证 ， 生成的 RNG 无法在不破坏密码证明的情况下进行操作，19/ Oracle 计算用于根据区块数据和节点的私钥生成密码证明 ， 这意味着它不是从外部来源获取，而是实际生成随机性本身，20/ Chainlink 链下报告 (OCR)包裹 ， OCR 是一种协议，可以实现数据的链下聚合，因此每个报告只在链上提交一个事务（包含每个预言机的观察和签名） 这是oracle计算增强数据交付，21/ Chainlink 外部适配器 (EA)插头 ， EA 是模块化软件包，可扩展 Chainlink 节点的功能，使它们能够访问付费 API 并执行任何链下计算，如统计分析、价格指数创建或机器学习过程，22/ 跨链互操作协议（CCIP）， CCIP 是一种开源标准，用于实现区块链网络之间的互操作性，包括资产和命令的传输，实现安全的令牌桥和跨链应用，23/ Chainlink Fair 测序服务 (FSS)天平 ， FSS是一种去中心化的交易排序解决方案，可以接收用户加密的交易，按照先进先出等预定义的策略排序，然后解密交易 ， 这有助于减轻有害形式的 MEV，24/ Chainlink DECO 锁 ， DECO 是一种基于零知识证明的预言机协议，它使用户能够以隐私保护的方式向预言机节点证明有关其 TLS Web 会话的事实 ， 这使得在不泄露数据的情况下在智能合约中使用私有数据成为可能，25/二层验证， Chainlink 节点可以引导第 2 层汇总（optimisic、zero-knowledge、valdium、volition）的验证器集，从而直接在链下执行智能合约，并使用欺诈证明和 ZKP 在链上提交和验证结果，26/ 最终，oracle 计算显着增强了区块链网络和在其上运行的智能合约的能力，同时保持了分散应用程序所需的信任最小化水平 ， 我们只看到了冰山一角，27/ 混合智能合约可以利用链下数据和预言机计算来实现更高级的应用 ， 因此，应扩展预言机的定义，以捕获其数据交付和信任最小化计算能力\n我不认为人们理解模块化区块链范式的含义 ， 不仅缓解了可扩展性三难困境，而且还创建了可扩展性的正反馈循环 ， 这不仅是以太坊的扩展方式，还是一个链不可知模型， 最大限度去中心化的 L1 区块链，以实现低硬件要求和健康的可持续发展费用市场的共识 ， 数据分片以存储汇总生成的所有压缩 TX 数据 ， Rollup 锚定在上面，以 Web2 的速度执行 TX，逃生舱口到 L1，凭借 Chainlink

分析可能适用于分析一家独立餐厅，但在分析该餐厅的品牌价值和特许经营/扩张能力时就更糟糕了。为此，您需要了解社区、模拟、病毒式传播， 我有一个理论，即 DCF 分析在学校中被过度教授，因为它为市场提供了一定的知识能力，它让学生认为经济学 + 金融学教授是聪明的科学家（而不是规避风险的官僚）。它更喜欢模型精度而不是结构精度，FB 更名为 Meta 是承认 FB

The alliance forms a key part of Sega’s mid to long-term strategy, allowing it to move forward with its “Super Game” initiative to develop new and innovative titles focused on “global,” “online,” “community,” and “IP utilization.”\n\nThe companies have agreed upon the foundation for this alliance and will look to build further technological evolutions through mutual cooperation, with areas such as ‘network infrastructure and communication tools required for global online services’ being a key priority. And by shifting to a next-generation development platform, Sega can effectively adapt to diversifying work styles and potential infrastructural changes.\n\n“With the world now more connected than ever following the widespread deployment of 5G and cloud services in recent years, consumers can more easily enjoy high-quality entertainment content at any time,” Sega said in a press release. “Within this highly connected environment, the ecosystem surrounding the games industry continues to evolve and expand as more sophisticated tools and technologies become available. As such, video games continue to grow as a major medium for gamers globally, with access to a vast range of gaming experiences and communities becoming more diverse and attainable. This proposed alliance represents SEGA looking ahead, and by working with Microsoft to anticipate such trends as they accelerate further in future, the goal is to optimize development processes and continue to bring high-quality experiences to players using Azure cloud technologies.”\n\nFind comments from Sega and Microsoft below.\n\nYukio Sugino, President and COO, SEGA Corporation\n\n“We are very pleased to announce today that we are considering a strategic alliance with Microsoft to help develop SEGA’s new ‘Super Game’ initiative as well as build a next-generation game development environment. By considering a strategic partnership with Microsoft, we seek to further advance our game development so that our titles can be enjoyed by fans all over the world; in this regard, we aim to build an alliance that utilizes both SEGA’s powerful game development capabilities and Microsoft’s cutting-edge technology and development environment.”\n\nSarah Bond, CVP, Microsoft Corporation\n\n“SEGA has played such an iconic role in the gaming industry and has been a tremendous partner over the years.

It's not within the terms of the trade deal. And if somebody behaves unfairly in a trade deal, you're entitled to take action against them and seek some compensatory measures. And that is what we will do if the French don't back down,\" Truss said.\n\nAsked over what time frame France should back down, Truss said: \"This issue needs to be resolved in the next 48 hours.\"\n\nDISTRACTION\n\nThe row also risks being a distraction at the COP26 climate summit which began in Scotland on Sunday. [read more](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/frances-macron-tells-uks-johnson-respect-rules-fishing-row-2021-10-31/)\n\nParis has said it could ban British fishing boats from unloading in French ports, carry out additional licence checks on British vessels, tighten controls of trucks and reinforce customs and hygiene controls if talks fail.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday he had been \"puzzled\" to read a [letter](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-johnson-does-not-rule-out-french-trade-dispute-action-next-week-2021-10-30) from Paris to the European Union. Sent by French Prime Minister Jean Castex, it called on the bloc to demonstrate there was \"more damage to leaving the EU than to remaining there\". [read more](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/frances-macron-tells-uks-johnson-respect-rules-fishing-row-2021-10-31/)\n\nThe fishing issue dogged Brexit talks for years, not because of its economic importance but because of its political significance. If not resolved, it could trigger the beginning of dispute measures in the Brexit trade deal as early as this week.\n\nWhen asked why the fishing issue, a long source of discord between France and Britain, had again soured ties, Truss suggested it might have something to do with next year's presidential election in France.\n\nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge and Alistair Smout; Editing by Kate Holton and Gareth Jones\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nMore from Reuters\n\n00:0001:46Prince Andrew 'unequivocally' denies sex abuseTigrayan forces claim capture of strategic Amhara townClimate activists from across Europe gather in GlasgowThree shot dead in Sudan's nationwide protests -doctorsTurbulent arrival for Thunberg in Glasgow for COP26Australia soon open to vaccinated New ZealandersTrump tries to block Jan 6 panel access to filesFive stories you need to know about todayFrance and Britain lock horns over fishing rightsThe Week in Numbers: $1 trln club, BP's windfall\n\nRead Next\n\n* [United KingdomFTSE 100 lifted by weaker pound; Barclays slides as CEO steps down](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/weaker-sterling-boosts-ftse-barclays-slides-ceo-steps-down-2021-11-01/)\n* [Macro MattersUK factories see output growth slow, prices rocket - PMI](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-factories-see-output-growth-slow-prices-rocket-pmi-2021-11-01/)\n* [United KingdomTrain collision in southwest Britain injures several people](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/trains-collide-southwestern-england-police-2021-10-31/)\n* [Aerospace & DefenseRyanair may drop London listing as trading volumes drop post-Brexit](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ryanair-may-drop-london-listing-trading-volumes-drop-post-brexit-2021-11-01/)\n\nRead Next\n\n* [BusinessBarclays CEO Staley resigns after Epstein probe](https://www.reuters.com/business/barclays-ceo-staley-stand-down-following-epstein-investigation-2021-11-01/)\n* [EnergyEquinor plans 1 gigawatt floating offshore wind project in Scotland](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/equinor-plans-1-gigawatt-floating-offshore-wind-project-scotland-2021-11-01/)\n* [United KingdomAstraZeneca to transfer some drug rights to Covis Pharma in $270 mln deal](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/astrazeneca-transfer-some-drug-rights-covis-pharma-270-mln-deal-2021-11-01/)\n* [United KingdomBritain tells France: back down in 48 hours or we get tough](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-warns-france-back-down-48-hours-or-face-trade-trouble-2021-11-01/)\n\nSign up for our newsletter\n\nSubscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.\n\nSign up\n\n## United Kingdom\n\n[United Kingdom · 5:45 PM CST](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-factories-see-output-growth-slow-prices-rocket-pmi-2021-11-01/)", "timestamp": 1635760326, "digest": "MXH8X4kutHvNiKGSjZnY5zU7Vy4jHR_SdslZhYyElSo", "contributor": "0xC46e66793e975C115c6fEb679fB2557ce22FD597"}

For that, Darger and Shutt tell us they're willing to give up their quest to lock the phrase down if Zuck will shell out $20 MILLION.\n\nThe cost might seem crazy, but the way Darger and Shutt see it, giving up the TM will require them to rebrand their entire company ... which, of course, will be super expensive.\n\nTrademark or not, Meta PC has already reaped some of Facebook's announcement benefits -- they've seen a 5,000% increase in followers across their social media channels ... not too bad.\n\nHowever, a source close to discussions tells TMZ ... Meta (Facebook) believes they have the rights necessary to adopt the \"Meta\" trademark for their goods and services.\n\n* [SHARE ON FACEBOOK](https://www.tmz.com/2021/11/01/meta-trademark-applicants-will-sell-to-mark-zuckerberg-for-20m/)\n* [TWEET THIS](https://www.tmz.com/2021/11/01/meta-trademark-applicants-will-sell-to-mark-zuckerberg-for-20m/)\n\n### RELATED ARTICLES\n\n#### Metta Sandiford-Artest Approves Facebook's 'Meta' Name Change\n\n#### Mark Zuckerberg Denies FB Whistleblower's Claim it Puts Profits Over People\n\n* *[MARK ZUCKERBERG](https://www.tmz.com/people/mark-zuckerberg/)[MONEY](https://www.tmz.com/categories/money/)[FACEBOOK](https://www.tmz.com/categories/facebook/)[EXCLUSIVE](https://www.tmz.com/categories/exclusive/)[FAIRLY LEGAL](https://www.tmz.com/categories/fairly-legal/)*\n\n### MORE FROM TMZ\n\n## Here's a Chance to Buy That Classy Record Player You Always Wanted\n\n*[EXCLUSIVE](https://www.tmz.com/2021/11/01/jaime-luis-gomez-taboo-black-eyed-peas-gabby-petito-racial-bias/)*\n\n## BLACK EYED PEAS' TABOO\n\n[11/1/2021 12:50 AM PT](https://www.tmz.com/2021/11/01/jaime-luis-gomez-taboo-black-eyed-peas-gabby-petito-racial-bias/)\n\n*[EXCLUSIVE](https://www.tmz.com/2021/11/01/master-p-g-league-zaire-wade-dwyane-wade/)*\n\n## MASTER P", "timestamp": 1635760668, "digest": "PE7IkelBSi0Ljf1D2axtwec2UwDHs4ZSTa-F5ZpXoYk", "contributor": "0x8073DB17391a3781b4a401FD4adA047A0c318a6E"}

{"id": "yuex6UmyLOuP2u5Ads8rwC4t32rh6euuZsLEWhrHgpE", "title": "Man with knife on Tokyo train stabs several before starting fire, police say", "body": "A man dressed in Batman's Joker costume and brandishing a knife on a Tokyo commuter train on Sunday stabbed several passengers before starting a fire, which sent people scrambling to escape and jumping from windows, police and witnesses said.\n\nThe Tokyo Fire Department said 17 passengers were injured, including three seriously. Not all of them were stabbed and most of the other injuries were not serious, the agency said.\n\nThe attacker, identified as a 24-year-old man, was arrested on the spot and was being investigated on suspicion of attempted murder, NHK said. His motive was not immediately known.\n\nNippon Television reported that the suspect told police that he wanted to kill and get a death penalty, and that he used an earlier train stabbing case as an example.\n\nA police officer walks into the Kokuryo station of the Keio Line train where a knife, arson and acid attack incident occurred on a train, in Tokyo, Japan November 1, 2021.ISSEI KATO / REUTERS\n\nWitnesses told police that the attacker was wearing a bright outfit — a green shirt, a blue suit and a purple coat — like the Joker in Batman comics or someone going to a Halloween event, according to media reports.\n\nTokyo police officials said the attack happened inside the Keio train near the Kokuryo station.\n\nTelevision footage showed a number of firefighters, police officials and paramedics rescuing the passengers, many of whom escaped through train windows. In one video, passengers were running from another car, where flames were gushing.\n\nNHK said the suspect, after stabbing passengers, poured a liquid resembling oil from a plastic bottle and set fire, which partially burned seats.\n\nShunsuke Kimura, who filmed the video, told NHK that he saw passengers desperately running and while he was trying to figure out what happened, he heard an explosive noise and saw smoke wafting. He also jumped from a window but fell on the platform and hurt his shoulder.\n\n\"Train doors were closed and we had no idea what was happening, and we jumped from the windows,\" Kimura said. \"It was horrifying.\"\n\nThe attack was the second involving a knife on a Tokyo train in two months.\n\nIn August, the day before the Tokyo Olympics closing ceremony, a 36-year-old man stabbed 10 passengers on a commuter train in Tokyo in a random burst of violence. The suspect later told police that he wanted to attack women who looked happy.\n\nWhile shooting deaths are rare in Japan, the country has had a series of high-profile knife killings in recent years.\n\nIn 2019, a man carrying two knives attacked a group of schoolgirls waiting at a bus stop just outside Tokyo, killing two people and injuring 17 before killing himself. In 2018, a man killed a passenger and injuring two others in a knife attack on a bullet train. In 2016, a former employee at a home for the disabled killed 19 people and injured more than 20.\n\n### Trending News\n\n[The Irish cave known as hell's entrance — and Halloween's birthplace](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oweynagat-cave-halloween-ireland/?intcid=CNI-00-10aaa3b)\n\n[Biden says Russia, China \"basically didn't show up\" with climate commitments](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/biden-g20-press-conference-watch-live-stream-today-2021-10-31/?intcid=CNI-00-10aaa3b)\n\n[World's COVID-19 death toll tops 5 million in less than two years](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-death-toll-5-million/?intcid=CNI-00-10aaa3b)\n\n[World's richest could prevent global starvation, WFP director says](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/starvation-deaths-billionaires-could-help-fix-it-david-beasley/?intcid=CNI-00-10aaa3b)\n\n#### Download our Free App\n\nFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\n\n* [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cbs-news/id334256223?mt=8)\n* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews&hl=en)\n* [Fire TV](http://cbsn.ws/firetv)\n* [Apple TV](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cbs-news/id334256223#?platform=appleTV)\n* [Roku](https://channelstore.roku.com/details/27536/cbs-news)\n* [All Smart TV Apps](https://www.cbsnews.com/mobile/)\n\n*First published on October 31, 2021 / 4:14 PM*\n\n*© 2021 The Associated Press.

{"id": "FtaUg5EankM0a8JF4PyzuIaSKSIArHY74rNJA8J5GHI", "title": "Getting Started in NFTs", "body": "As a product that aims to help everyone in NFTs and not just the elite, we thought it would be helpful to provide simple and actionable advice to buy your first NFT, using our tool to make your money go furthest.\n\nWe want everyone to profit from using NFT Ninja regardless of their knowledge or capital levels.\n\nThere are tonnes of ways to actually buy an NFT with competing exchanges, wallets, and marketplaces, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ve detailed one possible route, which is one that has low fees and a good user experience.\n\n## What You Need\n\n* $1,000+\n* Will to learn\n\nYes - really. You don’t need to be a techie or art collector to get involved.\n\nAt the moment, for people used to Amazon, the infrastructure around NFTs is quite convoluted so you’ll need to jump through a few hoops to secure your prize. In the near future, this will be much easier but if you’re willing to do a tiny bit of work then you’re earlier than people who aren’t.\n\n## Links\n\nIt’d be worth bookmarking the below because you’ll need them throughout the process.\n\n* [Crypto.com](https://www.crypto.com)\n* [Metamask.io](https://metamask.io/)\n* [OpenSea](https://www.opensea.io)\n\n## Step 1 – Buy Ethereum\n\nFirst, you need to purchase cryptocurrency using your fiat currency (USD, GBP etc). The coin with the most liquidity in NFTs is Ethereum, with lower levels of activity existing in other ecosystems as well.\n\nHead to [Crypto.com](https://www.crypto.com) or download the [app](https://crypto.com/app), go through the necessary steps to be registered and verified, and buy Ethereum. It’s actually recommended to do as much on mobile as possible as mobile is inherently more secure than desktop.\n\nThe minimum viable amount you’ll need is around $1k, or 0.25 ETH at the time of writing. This is to cover the purchase of the NFT as well as the transaction costs (aka “gas fees”). \n\n## Step 2 – Setup MetaMask\n\nMetaMask is a browser extension wallet that allows you to easily access and interact with decentralized applications (aka dApps). \n\nFind out more at [metamask.io](https://www.metamask.io) or click on the below link to go straight to downloading the extension:\n\n[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)\n\nWhen you're done adding it to your browser, it’s time to start setting up your wallet. \n\nWe’re assuming you’re new to all this, so you want to create a new wallet. The next steps are incredibly important so please take extra care reading.\n\nHave a listen to this podcast episode to understand the need to go OTT when it comes to security in crypto:\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Wb0NT2kEXGaGxFqc4vSTD?si=2d4acc9b5c5c4ca7](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Wb0NT2kEXGaGxFqc4vSTD?si=2d4acc9b5c5c4ca7)\n\nTLDL; you will never be able to recover your funds if you lose your password and seed phrase.\n\n### Securing Your Wallet: Password  \n\nUnlike most application logins, you won’t be able to simply email yourself a forgotten password link. It is of the utmost importance that you first create a secure, unique password for your MetaMask wallet. Please make sure to store this password securely, offline in a secure location like a safe. \n\n### Securing Your Wallet: Seed Phrase\n\nThe secret recovery phrase, also referred to as the seed recovery phrase, is one of the most unique parts of interacting with cryptocurrencies and blockchains. Your secret recovery phrase is a string of typically 12 words that pertains to a specific private key and can be used to generate public keys or addresses.\n\n \n Simply put, your secret recovery phrase is the foundation of your wallet and wallet contents. If you happen to forget your password, the first line of defence, your recovery seed phrase will allow you to restore access to your wallet and all that is inside. \n\nThis also means that if the device you’re utilizing is damaged or lost, with your secret recovery phrase you can restore your wallet and contents on a different device. Therefore, anyone who has access to your secret recovery phrase could simply restore your wallet on their own device and take the contents for themselves. \n\nMuch like you wouldn’t share passwords, ***DO NOT*** share your recovery seed phrase with anyone. It’s good practice to store it offline in multiple, separate, secure locations. \n\nAfter securely recording and storing away your recovery seed phrase, your wallet is ready to receive your ETH from Crypto.com! \n\n## Step 3 – Transfer ETH to MetaMask\n\nSo you’ve got a MetaMask wallet, but nothing inside. Maybe you bought some Ether on Coinbase during the 2017 bull market. Maybe you have a generous friend who wants to send you some to get started. \n\nEither way, you’ll need to know how to access your Ethereum address to be able to receive funds. \n\nWhen opening your newly acquired MetaMask wallet, you can find your Ethereum address (a long string of letters and numbers, starting with 0x) at the top. \n\n**IMAGE**\n\nBecause of the length of addresses, it’s often most easy to identify an address by a few characters from the beginning and end of an address. To unveil the entire address though, you can simply hover over the characters, and click to copy the address to your clipboard. \n\nThe full result is your Ethereum address. You’ll need this address if you wish to be able to receive ETH or other ERC-20 tokens from an exchange such as Coinbase. \n\n## How do I send ETH?\n\nAfter you’ve got your wallet secured and have received some ETH, it’s time to learn how to send it. \n\nWith ETH in your wallet, you can select “send” from the opening screen on MetaMask. \n\nThat will prompt you to establish a recipient address. Simply put, where would you like to send ETH? \n\n**IMAGE**\n\nHere, we’ve decided to send some funds back to the Lucky Trader wallet. \n\nIf this is the first time you’re sending to an address, but you expect to use it in the future, you can add the recipient to your address book! This can help avoid silly copy and paste mistakes in the future. \n\nAfter you’ve selected your recipient, it’s time to decide how much you want to send.\n\n**IMAGE**\n\nOnce you’ve decided how much to send, click “next.”\n\n**IMAGE**\n\nIn this example, we’ve selected .01 ETH, but you’ll notice that the total transaction is a bit more than .01 ETH. This is because a transaction requires a “gas” fee to be pushed to and confirmed on the blockchain. The amount of gas you submit in a transaction can be edited (see steps below), but in this instance, we’re comfortable with the estimated fee and the probability of confirmation in less than 30 seconds. \n\n*Note: The initial fee estimation given by MetaMask is based on the current network activity and base fees on the Ethereum blockchain. MetaMask fees are no higher than other wallets as they use a compilation of multiple gas estimators to determine the appropriate fee at the time of transaction.* \n\n**IMAGE**\n\nOnce the confirmation is confirmed, you're all done! \n\nCongrats, you’ve sent ETH!\n\nYou can repeat this exact process for sending any other ERC-20 tokens that may reside in your Ethereum wallet.\n\n## Step 4 – Purchase NFT\n\nYou have two options here:\n\n* Minting an NFT\n* Buying on the secondary market\n\n### Minting\n\nAssuming you believe in a new project, and you think the price of an NFT will only go up, then you will maximize profits by being early and “minting” an NFT. This means you’re in the first batch of people who can get their hands on an NFT. \n\nUsually, you will randomly generate an NFT with certain traits and attributes that are rare or common, or more likely somewhere in between.\n\nYou can then hold this or sell it on OpenSea.\n\n### Secondary\n\nOpenSea is by and large the home of the secondary NFT market. \n\nPeople sell their minted NFTs or ones they’ve bought on OpenSea, generally for a profit although with all markets people sell for a loss if they think the price is only going down.\n\n## How to Set Up and Navigate Your Account\n\nAccounts on OpenSea, like nearly all of Web 3.0, are directly tied to your Ethereum address. \n\nTherefore, to set up an account on OpenSea, you’ll need to have an Ethereum address and wallet with compatibility with Web 3.0 and decentralized applications. The most popular wallet option is MetaMask, but with OpenSea, you can connect with a handful of other wallet options. \n\n \n If you already have a wallet, you can head to [OpenSea.io](https://opensea.io/) and connect to the site using the wallet icon in the top right corner of the page. \n\n**IMAGE**\n\nAfter choosing the appropriate wallet provider and following the connection steps, you’re now “signed in” to OpenSea.\n\nFrom this step, you’ll now be able to view and edit your profile. \n\nBy hovering over, or clicking on the circle next to the wallet icon in the screenshot above, you’ll be sent to your profile page.\n\n### How To Edit Your Profile\n\nYour OpenSea profile page will eventually be the home of all the NFTs you acquire. As you curate your collection, other OpenSea users will be able to navigate to this page, peruse your collection, buy NFTs you have listed for sale or make offers on the NFTs that aren’t. \n\nIf you wish to personalize your profile page, hover over the profile circle in the top right corner and select “my account settings.” \n\nIn the general account settings section, you’ll have the opportunity to name your profile for easier navigation, add your email for notifications, as well as attach a website or a social media profile to your account. \n\n**IMAGE**\n\nWhile a profile name is not required, with one attached, you’ll be able to quickly find your account or any other using the search bar at the top of the page.\n\n### How to Manage Your Notifications\n\nInside your profile settings, you can manage your notification settings as well. Assuming you’ve attached an email address to the account, OpenSea will allow you to create alerts for whenever you’ve sold an item, bought an item, or received an offer. \n\nIn this section, merely check the boxes that you wish to create a notification for and ensure you’ve verified your email address previously, to receive them. \n\nIt is important to note, you may receive a large amount of notifications regarding offers on your NFTs. At the bottom of the notification settings page, you have the opportunity to create a minimum offer threshold before an alert is generated and sent to you. Therefore, if you only care to receive notifications about offers of 1 ETH or more, setting this threshold to “1” will ensure you don’t receive any unwanted notifications.\n\n## How to Find the Perfect NFT on OpenSea \n\nNow that you have your OpenSea profile established, it’s time to find an NFT that you want to buy. \n\nSearching for an NFT on OpenSea is simple - use the search bar at the top of the page to navigate to a collection or specific NFT you have in mind.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to look through the Lazy Lions NFTs, you can type, “Lazy Lions,” and a collection matching that description will automatically populate.\n\n**IMAGE**\n\n***Security Tip: Nefarious actors will place look-alike collections on OpenSea that are not the real, verified collections. Ensure you’re selecting the right collection, and use the verified badge (blue checkmark) as a guide!*** \n\nUpon loading, the Lazy Lions collection will be pre-sorted from the lowest price to highest price among the collection. But, if you can’t find anything that suits your eye, you can use the filter panel on the left to sort and find exactly the right attributes that suit you.\n\n**IMAGE**\n\nSelecting a particular attribute will automatically filter the collection, leaving you with only the Lions with the respective attribute you’ve chosen. Add on as many filters as necessary to find the option most suitable for you.\n\n### How to Buy an NFT on OpenSea\n\nWhen you have found the perfect NFT, it’s time to buy it! \n\nFrom the collection page, you can double-click an individual asset to be directed to the respective asset page. \n\nOn this page, you can view the entire activity history of this asset as well as the price history, any pending offers, and more. \n\nTo buy it, click “buy now\" next to the asset image. \n\n**IMAGE**\n\nAfter doing so, your connected wallet will populate and allow you to confirm your wish to buy the NFT.\n\nHere, you’ll also be able to edit gas settings if the purchase is time-sensitive.\n\nOnce the transaction has confirmed on the blockchain, the NFT is yours!", "timestamp": 1635761465, "digest": "e0rpypNxJXBRBTwgy6DcWYYlXCtC1uGJ-esczuWrtuA", "contributor": "0xAc0a76Be83fE580d61F176753fE1ddc727FAd04f"}
