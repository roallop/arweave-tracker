The supporters of $NOVEL would be the first of their kind, since no other novels have ever been created this way, in the history of literary culture :) \n\n[BURN ALPHA NOVEL](crowdfund://0x95d0A89943E0e3e05d290Fc07462c148EB6a11Ff?network=homestead)\n\nUsually, novelists go to great lengths to fund their own novel-writing process by working other gigs, selling commercial writing, or – in significantly fewer cases – getting an advance from a publishing company. All of these methods have drawbacks, in the forms of limited time or limited creative freedom for the author. On top of that, the process of creating these works of art goes on behind a veil of secrecy, away from the community that will ultimately enjoy the final product. As an author and publisher, I’d like to change all that. This crowdfund will take us one step closer to a better future for writers and readers everywhere. \n\nI am so stoked to immerse myself more deeply in writing my second book and to share it with all of you.\n\nPhew! Without further ado...\n\n\n\n### The Book:\n\nMy novel-in-progress BURN ALPHA is a homoerotic teen thriller about a group of three girls at an elite New York City private school who stumble into busting a global sex trafficking ring related to their school and ultimately shut the school down, set in the mid-2000s in NYC. There is also an esoteric/supernatural element that informs how they gather information and fight the power – that part is related to Goetic magic, but it wouldn’t be very occult if I spilled it all here. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c4c8322-1fa8-4d91-a8f8-629d56413991.png?height=1630&width=1056)\n\nThe book-writing process was inspired by my fascination with the [very strange, real 1973 Sci Fi book Space Relations by Donald Barr](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvgpm3/epstein-truthers-are-obsessed-with-a-sci-fi-book-about-child-sex-slavery-written-by-bill-barrs-dad) – who was the headmaster of the Dalton School in New York where Jeffrey Epstein got his first gig (incidentally, Epstein was my mom’s high school math teacher). \n\n![](https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d56c6ec4d02ea00084d5162/lede/1565968446993-0-5.jpeg)\n\n\n\nThe vibe of BURN ALPHA is candy critique: Q Anon meets Umberto Eco meets Gossip Girl. My first novel was [Mercury Retrograde (2020)](https://delugebooks.com/collections/books), which was a New York Times New and Notable Book (!) and was released through [Deluge](https://delugebooks.com/), a press I run with collaborators in New York and Los Angeles ([more press links and info here](https://delugebooks.com/pages/links)). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/df270ae5-1111-4265-bf77-4619d1a2213e.png?height=1078&width=1072)\n\n\nBURN ALPHA would be the second installment in a series of fictional works I’m doing about power structures and how they shift or collapse. I want to crowdfund so I have uninterrupted time for world building and funds to work with the excellent editors in the Deluge network. I’m also trying to learn-by-doing in order to explore new models for publishing overall. This process will help me check out new structures for authors I publish through Deluge, and the larger community of queer, experimental, literary writers of which I am a part. \n\nI’m excited about crowdfunding and the world of social tokens because they open up new ideas about how writing can be generated, published and sustained. The world needs an attitude adjustment when it comes to how books are made, sold, and distributed, and writers have been waiting too long for better ways of working at better rates. (Platforms like Substack can show us a little of what might change but are only a drop in the bucket...they are also kinda hybrid old- and new-generation in a way that feels limp to me.) Therefore, this experiment is one part of figuring out what does and doesn’t work! \n\nAnd luckily, since I run [my own press](https://delugebooks.com/) we already know that this book will hit bookshelves (and e-readers) worldwide once it’s ready!\n\n\n## BURN ALPHA $NOVEL supporters would receive:  \n\n### TIER ONE: Everyone\n\n- Stake in manuscript excerpt from Act 1 of BURN ALPHA which will be posted on Mirror and minted as NFT\n- Stake in of the first edition NFT sale of the full book (this comes later, of course)\n- Mention in the book’s acknowledgments, along with my massive gratitude!\n\n### TIER TWO: .5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\n- Special supporter-only limited edition hardcover copy of BURN ALPHA\n- Limited edition supporter-only BURN ALPHA merch\n- Access to periodic supporter-only readings of manuscript in process\n\n\n### TIER THREE: 1.5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\nOne on one call with me: either a chat about writing, a chat about whatever is on your mind, or a tarot / astrology reading \n\nSneak peek of the full finished manuscript before anyone else\n\n \n\n### Here are the basic mechanics:\nThe initial manuscript excerpt will exist on Mirror, publicly accessible to all. It will be minted as an NFT utilizing the Zora protocol. Supporters retain a stake in both the manuscript excerpt and full manuscript NFTs. Any time these NFTs are sold, a percentage goes back to the token holders, who can then redeem them for a proportional share of ETH in the shared pool. The first edition book is minted as an NFT from the crowdfund, the future value of which routes back to the crowdfund and therefore the supporters. Supporters will forever be linked to the crowdfund as patrons that made this project (and the future of literary fiction) possible.\n\n \n### More about the BURN ALPHA story:\n\nThe three girls at the heart of the story are Elizabeth Macabee, Gillian Shapiro and Archer Fast. Archer is the daughter of a major American political dynasty and also happens to have the headmaster of their school for a father. Gillian is the child of a Goldman Sachs investment banker and Israeli emigre psychoanalyst – though her upper Madison Ave. meets East Hampton set up should make her a shoe-in for popular girl, but her queerness (as yet unarticulated) and body type (not thin enough) preclude this, so she ends up working an alternative angle of social capital: cool clothes, music knowledge, humor, and drugs. Elizabeth, understated and sardonic, is the least privileged of the three, though hardly poor in any consensus reality idea of the term. Raised on the Upper West Side by her academic parents, she is shielded from the high octane world of elite private schools (xoxo) for a good portion of her childhood. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec4a1a29-dcab-4751-a2d3-84e015f20b19.png?height=848&width=854)\n\nFor most of that period, Elizabeth’s mom is a PhD candidate in the sociology department at Columbia studying the network effects of a Panama Papers-type cabal of offshore accounts among the world’s wealthiest people. This eventually trickles up to the school’s trustees, who don’t like it. Elizabeth’s mom gets gaslit out of her grad program and has a psychotic break which includes her murdering the family dog – Elizabeth discovers them both covered with blood on the black-and-white tiled bathroom floor of their apartment on 106th Street. After Elizabeth’s mom emerges from the psych ward, she is totally blackpilled and utterly exhausted by the idea of fighting the power in any form. That’s when she sends Elizabeth crosstown to the ultra-tony Salisbury School, where she intends for her daughter to meld with the elite. Elizabeth’s friendship with Archer and Gillian pleases her in this vein, though if she knew about their daily after school ritual, she would likely be less happy: three girls smoking lots of weed-laced-with-bits-of-PCP in Central Park by the Met. It is during one of those wavy afternoons that the girls slip into another nearby realm, where a piece of information is revealed to them in the form of a crumbling old book. That book implicates Archer’s family and the whole school they attend in a global sex trafficking ring (yes, Epstein-esque, but as if the 2008 Epstein bust was the whole kit and kaboodle, not a slap on the wrist). You’ll have to read the rest of BURN ALPHA to find out what happens!\n\n\n## More about me:\n\nI’m a writer, artist, and trend forecaster based in Los Angeles. Some of you might know me as one of the co-founders of [K-HOLE](khole.net), the trend forecasting group best known for popularizing normcore, or as part of [Nemesis](nemesis.global), a consultancy I run with Martti Kalliala. My first book, Mercury Retrograde, was released in November 2020 by [Deluge Books](delugebooks.com), a mass experimental queer press I founded with collaborators in New York and LA. My writing has appeared in The Guardian, Frieze, Texte zur Kunst, Flash Art, Dazed, Mousse, 032c, e-flux journal, and many other publications, including anthologies by Verso Books and Sternberg Press. I’ve presented portions of my first novel-in-progress in art contexts at Project Native Informant in London, the Witte de With Contemporary Art Center in Rotterdam, the Berlin Biennial, the Serpentine Gallery, and elsewhere, so this crowdfund would be a further iteration of an existing exploration into opening up the novel-writing process in unexpected avenues :)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6f6555cb-298e-4921-b421-52b5146c8928.jpg?height=2291&width=1535)\n\n\n\nYou can find me on Twitter at @khole_emily, on Instagram at @nemesis_emily, on my web site at [emilysegal.net](emilysegal.net) and if you'd like to drop me a note, I'm reachable at emily@delugebooks.com\n \n## Praise for my first book:\n\n“Emily Segal is **almost mystically attuned to the cultural logic of our era**. She lives its pangs and contradictions intellectually, emotionally and somatically – late capitalism’s Simone Weil.” Tom McCarthy\n\n“I really liked reading this book. It’s the longest reply to “where have you been?” you’ll ever get from someone you first met in a skype chat which Emily Segal is to me. It’s **a brilliantly written novel** of a moment in search of a shimmer, half ‘here’, half digital, an everywhere post branding workplace place where few have dared to live and this writer, explorer, critic, philosopher of nonbusiness has done it deep. Segal's style is widely smart, different than deep (always). I mean her Mercury Retrograde is, it truly is.” Eileen Myles \n\n“‘Mercury Retrograde’ to me feels like **fiction's next historical leap**. It's smart and engaging (and bingeable) and yet it also feels necessary in a way that almost all books don't. It's a signpost that points to where the culture is headed, which is heady stuff, yet there you have it.” Douglas Coupland \n\n“I had so much fun reading it. It’s so fucking smart. It’s like **a love story between a girl and her intellect**. And it’s so cool to be all up in there with her.”  Michelle Tea\n \n“A thought-provoking and often extremely funny first novel looking back at the 2010s, which I couldn't put down. I should also say this book offered some very cathartic **food-for-thought on the strange ways capital, cultural capital, and the Internet interacted in the 10s,** for those of you who are still haunted by trying to make sense of it all.” Emilie Friedlander, VICE\n\n“**Dripping with line-level genius juice.**” M.E.S.H.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f134c960-788f-40c4-a89c-0c7eb66126ce.jpeg?height=2049&width=1536)\n\n\n## ADDITIONAL REFERENCES:\n\n[Crowdfunding Writing with NFTs — Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ)\n\n[Crowdfund Block on Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/igPh3OWGfT3ERv16GZdyQeI7t3FdkK-8zsKlHKSX-lc) \n\n[$GENERALIST](https://generalist.mirror.xyz/1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw)\n\n[$ESSAY](https://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0)\n\n[$MOOD](https://appliedarts.mirror.xyz/vbiD5sIgZaqUAuXu0P6SkvmCNOM7MtRCdqsEDyxsOXU)\n \n \n\n\n", "timestamp": 1617914950, "digest": "0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg", "contributor": "0xDA18e1537622802EC576D99A8e3913914653BD6F"}

Without further ado...\n\n\n\n### The Book:\n\nMy novel-in-progress BURN ALPHA is a homoerotic teen thriller about a group of three girls at an elite New York City private school who stumble into busting a global sex trafficking ring related to their school and ultimately shut the school down, set in the mid-2000s in NYC. There is also an esoteric/supernatural element that informs how they gather information and fight the power – that part is related to Goetic magic, but it wouldn’t be very occult if I spilled it all here. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c4c8322-1fa8-4d91-a8f8-629d56413991.png?height=1630&width=1056)\n\nThe book-writing process was inspired by my fascination with the [very strange, real 1973 Sci Fi book Space Relations by Donald Barr](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvgpm3/epstein-truthers-are-obsessed-with-a-sci-fi-book-about-child-sex-slavery-written-by-bill-barrs-dad) – who was the headmaster of the Dalton School in New York where Jeffrey Epstein got his first gig (incidentally, Epstein was my mom’s high school math teacher). \n\n![](https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d56c6ec4d02ea00084d5162/lede/1565968446993-0-5.jpeg)\n\n\n\nThe vibe of BURN ALPHA is candy critique: Q Anon meets Umberto Eco meets Gossip Girl. My first novel was [Mercury Retrograde (2020)](https://delugebooks.com/collections/books), which was a New York Times New and Notable Book (!) and was released through [Deluge](https://delugebooks.com/), a press I run with collaborators in New York and Los Angeles ([more press links and info here](https://delugebooks.com/pages/links)). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/df270ae5-1111-4265-bf77-4619d1a2213e.png?height=1078&width=1072)\n\n\nBURN ALPHA would be the second installment in a series of fictional works I’m doing about power structures and how they shift or collapse. I want to crowdfund so I have uninterrupted time for world building and funds to work with the excellent editors in the Deluge network. I’m also trying to learn-by-doing in order to explore new models for publishing overall. This process will help me check out new structures for authors I publish through Deluge, and the larger community of queer, experimental, literary writers of which I am a part. \n\nI’m excited about crowdfunding and the world of social tokens because they open up new ideas about how writing can be generated, published and sustained. The world needs an attitude adjustment when it comes to how books are made, sold, and distributed, and writers have been waiting too long for better ways of working at better rates. (Platforms like Substack can show us a little of what might change but are only a drop in the bucket...they are also kinda hybrid old- and new-generation in a way that feels limp to me.) Therefore, this experiment is one part of figuring out what does and doesn’t work! \n\nAnd luckily, since I run [my own press](https://delugebooks.com/) we already know that this book will hit bookshelves (and e-readers) worldwide once it’s ready!\n\n\n## BURN ALPHA $NOVEL supporters would receive:  \n\n### TIER ONE: Everyone\n\n- Stake in manuscript excerpt from Act 1 of BURN ALPHA which will be posted on Mirror and minted as NFT\n- Stake in of the first edition NFT sale of the full book (this comes later, of course)\n- Mention in the book’s acknowledgments, along with my massive gratitude!\n\n### TIER TWO: .5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\n- Special supporter-only limited edition hardcover copy of BURN ALPHA\n- Limited edition supporter-only BURN ALPHA merch\n- Access to periodic supporter-only readings of manuscript in process\n\n\n### TIER THREE: 1.5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\nOne on one call with me: either a chat about writing, a chat about whatever is on your mind, or a tarot / astrology reading \n\nSneak peek of the full finished manuscript before anyone else\n\n \n\n### Here are the basic mechanics:\nThe initial manuscript excerpt will exist on Mirror, publicly accessible to all. It will be minted as an NFT utilizing the Zora protocol. Supporters retain a stake in both the manuscript excerpt and full manuscript NFTs. Any time these NFTs are sold, a percentage goes back to the token holders, who can then redeem them for a proportional share of ETH in the shared pool. The first edition book is minted as an NFT from the crowdfund, the future value of which routes back to the crowdfund and therefore the supporters. Supporters will forever be linked to the crowdfund as patrons that made this project (and the future of literary fiction) possible.\n\n \n### More about the BURN ALPHA story:\n\nThe three girls at the heart of the story are Elizabeth Macabee, Gillian Shapiro and Archer Fast. Archer is the daughter of a major American political dynasty and also happens to have the headmaster of their school for a father. Gillian is the child of a Goldman Sachs investment banker and Israeli emigre psychoanalyst – though her upper Madison Ave. meets East Hampton set up should make her a shoe-in for popular girl, but her queerness (as yet unarticulated) and body type (not thin enough) preclude this, so she ends up working an alternative angle of social capital: cool clothes, music knowledge, humor, and drugs. Elizabeth, understated and sardonic, is the least privileged of the three, though hardly poor in any consensus reality idea of the term. Raised on the Upper West Side by her academic parents, she is shielded from the high octane world of elite private schools (xoxo) for a good portion of her childhood. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec4a1a29-dcab-4751-a2d3-84e015f20b19.png?height=848&width=854)\n\nFor most of that period, Elizabeth’s mom is a PhD candidate in the sociology department at Columbia studying the network effects of a Panama Papers-type cabal of offshore accounts among the world’s wealthiest people. This eventually trickles up to the school’s trustees, who don’t like it. Elizabeth’s mom gets gaslit out of her grad program and has a psychotic break which includes her murdering the family dog – Elizabeth discovers them both covered with blood on the black-and-white tiled bathroom floor of their apartment on 106th Street. After Elizabeth’s mom emerges from the psych ward, she is totally blackpilled and utterly exhausted by the idea of fighting the power in any form. That’s when she sends Elizabeth crosstown to the ultra-tony Salisbury School, where she intends for her daughter to meld with the elite. Elizabeth’s friendship with Archer and Gillian pleases her in this vein, though if she knew about their daily after school ritual, she would likely be less happy: three girls smoking lots of weed-laced-with-bits-of-PCP in Central Park by the Met. It is during one of those wavy afternoons that the girls slip into another nearby realm, where a piece of information is revealed to them in the form of a crumbling old book. That book implicates Archer’s family and the whole school they attend in a global sex trafficking ring (yes, Epstein-esque, but as if the 2008 Epstein bust was the whole kit and kaboodle, not a slap on the wrist). You’ll have to read the rest of BURN ALPHA to find out what happens!\n\n\n## More about me:\n\nI’m a writer, artist, and trend forecaster based in Los Angeles. Some of you might know me as one of the co-founders of [K-HOLE](khole.net), the trend forecasting group best known for popularizing normcore, or as part of [Nemesis](nemesis.global), a consultancy I run with Martti Kalliala. My first book, Mercury Retrograde, was released in November 2020 by [Deluge Books](delugebooks.com), a mass experimental queer press I founded with collaborators in New York and LA. My writing has appeared in The Guardian, Frieze, Texte zur Kunst, Flash Art, Dazed, Mousse, 032c, e-flux journal, and many other publications, including anthologies by Verso Books and Sternberg Press. I’ve presented portions of my first novel-in-progress in art contexts at Project Native Informant in London, the Witte de With Contemporary Art Center in Rotterdam, the Berlin Biennial, the Serpentine Gallery, and elsewhere, so this crowdfund would be a further iteration of an existing exploration into opening up the novel-writing process in unexpected avenues :)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6f6555cb-298e-4921-b421-52b5146c8928.jpg?height=2291&width=1535)\n\n\n\nYou can find me on Twitter at @khole_emily, on Instagram at @nemesis_emily, on my web site at [emilysegal.net](emilysegal.net) and if you'd like to drop me a note, I'm reachable at emily@delugebooks.com\n \n## Praise for my first book:\n\n“Emily Segal is **almost mystically attuned to the cultural logic of our era**. She lives its pangs and contradictions intellectually, emotionally and somatically – late capitalism’s Simone Weil.” Tom McCarthy\n\n“I really liked reading this book. It’s the longest reply to “where have you been?” you’ll ever get from someone you first met in a skype chat which Emily Segal is to me. It’s **a brilliantly written novel** of a moment in search of a shimmer, half ‘here’, half digital, an everywhere post branding workplace place where few have dared to live and this writer, explorer, critic, philosopher of nonbusiness has done it deep. Segal's style is widely smart, different than deep (always). I mean her Mercury Retrograde is, it truly is.” Eileen Myles \n\n“‘Mercury Retrograde’ to me feels like **fiction's next historical leap**. It's smart and engaging (and bingeable) and yet it also feels necessary in a way that almost all books don't. It's a signpost that points to where the culture is headed, which is heady stuff, yet there you have it.” Douglas Coupland \n\n“I had so much fun reading it. It’s so fucking smart. It’s like **a love story between a girl and her intellect**. And it’s so cool to be all up in there with her.”  Michelle Tea\n \n“A thought-provoking and often extremely funny first novel looking back at the 2010s, which I couldn't put down. I should also say this book offered some very cathartic **food-for-thought on the strange ways capital, cultural capital, and the Internet interacted in the 10s,** for those of you who are still haunted by trying to make sense of it all.” Emilie Friedlander, VICE\n\n“**Dripping with line-level genius juice.**” M.E.S.H.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f134c960-788f-40c4-a89c-0c7eb66126ce.jpeg?height=2049&width=1536)\n\n\n## ADDITIONAL REFERENCES:\n\n[Crowdfunding Writing with NFTs — Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ)\n\n[Crowdfund Block on Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/igPh3OWGfT3ERv16GZdyQeI7t3FdkK-8zsKlHKSX-lc) \n\n[$GENERALIST](https://generalist.mirror.xyz/1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw)\n\n[$ESSAY](https://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0)\n\n[$MOOD](https://appliedarts.mirror.xyz/vbiD5sIgZaqUAuXu0P6SkvmCNOM7MtRCdqsEDyxsOXU)\n \n \n\n\n", "timestamp": 1617914711, "digest": "0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg", "contributor": "0xDA18e1537622802EC576D99A8e3913914653BD6F"}

This process will help me check out new structures for authors I publish through Deluge, and the larger community of queer, experimental, literary writers of which I am a part. \n\nI’m excited about crowdfunding and the world of social tokens because they open up new ideas about how writing can be generated, published and sustained. The world needs an attitude adjustment when it comes to how books are made, sold, and distributed, and writers have been waiting too long for better ways of working at better rates. (Platforms like Substack can show us a little of what might change but are only a drop in the bucket...they are also kinda hybrid old- and new-generation in a way that feels limp to me.) Therefore, this experiment is one part of figuring out what does and doesn’t work! \n\nAnd luckily, since I run [my own press](https://delugebooks.com/) we already know that this book will hit bookshelves (and e-readers) worldwide once it’s ready!\n\n\n \n\n### Here are the basic mechanics:\nThe initial manuscript excerpt will exist on Mirror, publicly accessible to all. It will be minted as an NFT utilizing the Zora protocol. Supporters retain a stake in both the manuscript excerpt and full manuscript NFTs. Any time these NFTs are sold, a percentage goes back to the token holders, who can then redeem them for a proportional share of ETH in the shared pool. The first edition book is minted as an NFT from the crowdfund, the future value of which routes back to the crowdfund and therefore the supporters. Supporters will forever be linked to the crowdfund as patrons that made this project (and the future of literary fiction) possible.\n\n \n### More about the BURN ALPHA story:\n\nThe three girls at the heart of the story are Elizabeth Macabee, Gillian Shapiro and Archer Fast. Archer is the daughter of a major American political dynasty and also happens to have the headmaster of their school for a father. Gillian is the child of a Goldman Sachs investment banker and Israeli emigre psychoanalyst – though her upper Madison Ave. meets East Hampton set up should make her a shoe-in for popular girl, but her queerness (as yet unarticulated) and body type (not thin enough) preclude this, so she ends up working an alternative angle of social capital: cool clothes, music knowledge, humor, and drugs. Elizabeth, understated and sardonic, is the least privileged of the three, though hardly poor in any consensus reality idea of the term. Raised on the Upper West Side by her academic parents, she is shielded from the high octane world of elite private schools (xoxo) for a good portion of her childhood. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec4a1a29-dcab-4751-a2d3-84e015f20b19.png?height=848&width=854)\n\nFor most of that period, Elizabeth’s mom is a PhD candidate in the sociology department at Columbia studying the network effects of a Panama Papers-type cabal of offshore accounts among the world’s wealthiest people. This eventually trickles up to the school’s trustees, who don’t like it. Elizabeth’s mom gets gaslit out of her grad program and has a psychotic break which includes her murdering the family dog – Elizabeth discovers them both covered with blood on the black-and-white tiled bathroom floor of their apartment on 106th Street. After Elizabeth’s mom emerges from the psych ward, she is totally blackpilled and utterly exhausted by the idea of fighting the power in any form. That’s when she sends Elizabeth crosstown to the ultra-tony Salisbury School, where she intends for her daughter to meld with the elite. Elizabeth’s friendship with Archer and Gillian pleases her in this vein, though if she knew about their daily after school ritual, she would likely be less happy: three girls smoking lots of weed-laced-with-bits-of-PCP in Central Park by the Met. It is during one of those wavy afternoons that the girls slip into another nearby realm, where a piece of information is revealed to them in the form of a crumbling old book. That book implicates Archer’s family and the whole school they attend in a global sex trafficking ring (yes, Epstein-esque, but as if the 2008 Epstein bust was the whole kit and kaboodle, not a slap on the wrist). You’ll have to read the rest of BURN ALPHA to find out what happens!\n\n\n## More about me:\n\nI’m a writer, artist, and trend forecaster based in Los Angeles. Some of you might know me as one of the co-founders of [K-HOLE](khole.net), the trend forecasting group best known for popularizing normcore, or as part of [Nemesis](nemesis.global), a consultancy I run with Martti Kalliala. My first book, Mercury Retrograde, was released in November 2020 by [Deluge Books](delugebooks.com), a mass experimental queer press I founded with collaborators in New York and LA. My writing has appeared in The Guardian, Frieze, Texte zur Kunst, Flash Art, Dazed, Mousse, 032c, e-flux journal, and many other publications, including anthologies by Verso Books and Sternberg Press. I’ve presented portions of my first novel-in-progress in art contexts at Project Native Informant in London, the Witte de With Contemporary Art Center in Rotterdam, the Berlin Biennial, the Serpentine Gallery, and elsewhere, so this crowdfund would be a further iteration of an existing exploration into opening up the novel-writing process in unexpected avenues :)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6f6555cb-298e-4921-b421-52b5146c8928.jpg?height=2291&width=1535)\n\n\n\nYou can find me on Twitter at @khole_emily, on Instagram at @nemesis_emily, on my web site at [emilysegal.net](emilysegal.net) and if you'd like to drop me a note, I'm reachable at emily@delugebooks.com\n \n## Praise for my first book:\n\n“Emily Segal is **almost mystically attuned to the cultural logic of our era**.

It’s the longest reply to “where have you been?” you’ll ever get from someone you first met in a skype chat which Emily Segal is to me. It’s **a brilliantly written novel** of a moment in search of a shimmer, half ‘here’, half digital, an everywhere post branding workplace place where few have dared to live and this writer, explorer, critic, philosopher of nonbusiness has done it deep. Segal's style is widely smart, different than deep (always). I mean her Mercury Retrograde is, it truly is.” Eileen Myles \n\n“‘Mercury Retrograde’ to me feels like **fiction's next historical leap**. It's smart and engaging (and bingeable) and yet it also feels necessary in a way that almost all books don't. It's a signpost that points to where the culture is headed, which is heady stuff, yet there you have it.” Douglas Coupland \n\n“I had so much fun reading it. It’s so fucking smart. It’s like **a love story between a girl and her intellect**. And it’s so cool to be all up in there with her.”  Michelle Tea\n \n“A thought-provoking and often extremely funny first novel looking back at the 2010s, which I couldn't put down.

It is during one of those wavy afternoons that the girls slip into another nearby realm, where a piece of information is revealed to them in the form of a crumbling old book. That book implicates Archer’s family and the whole school they attend in a global sex trafficking ring (yes, Epstein-esque, but as if the 2008 Epstein bust was the whole kit and kaboodle, not a slap on the wrist). You’ll have to read the rest of BURN ALPHA to find out what happens!\n\n\n## More about me:\n\nI’m a writer, artist, and trend forecaster based in Los Angeles. Some of you might know me as one of the co-founders of [K-HOLE](khole.net), the trend forecasting group best known for popularizing normcore, or as part of [Nemesis](nemesis.global), a consultancy I run with Martti Kalliala. My first book, Mercury Retrograde, was released in November 2020 by [Deluge Books](delugebooks.com), a mass experimental queer press I founded with collaborators in New York and LA. My writing has appeared in The Guardian, Frieze, Texte zur Kunst, Flash Art, Dazed, Mousse, 032c, e-flux journal, and many other publications, including anthologies by Verso Books and Sternberg Press. I’ve presented portions of my first novel-in-progress in art contexts at Project Native Informant in London, the Witte de With Contemporary Art Center in Rotterdam, the Berlin Biennial, the Serpentine Gallery, and elsewhere, so this crowdfund would be a further iteration of an existing exploration into opening up the novel-writing process in unexpected avenues :)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6f6555cb-298e-4921-b421-52b5146c8928.jpg?height=2291&width=1535)\n\n\n\nYou can find me on Twitter at @khole_emily, on Instagram at @nemesis_emily, on my web site at [emilysegal.net](emilysegal.net) and if you'd like to drop me a note, I'm reachable at emily@delugebooks.com\n \n## Praise for my first book:\n\n“Emily Segal is **almost mystically attuned to the cultural logic of our era**. She lives its pangs and contradictions intellectually, emotionally and somatically – late capitalism’s Simone Weil.” Tom McCarthy\n\n“I really liked reading this book. It’s the longest reply to “where have you been?” you’ll ever get from someone you first met in a skype chat which Emily Segal is to me. It’s **a brilliantly written novel** of a moment in search of a shimmer, half ‘here’, half digital, an everywhere post branding workplace place where few have dared to live and this writer, explorer, critic, philosopher of nonbusiness has done it deep. Segal's style is widely smart, different than deep (always). I mean her Mercury Retrograde is, it truly is.” Eileen Myles \n\n“‘Mercury Retrograde’ to me feels like **fiction's next historical leap**. It's smart and engaging (and bingeable) and yet it also feels necessary in a way that almost all books don't. It's a signpost that points to where the culture is headed, which is heady stuff, yet there you have it.” Douglas Coupland \n\n“I had so much fun reading it. It’s so fucking smart. It’s like **a love story between a girl and her intellect**. And it’s so cool to be all up in there with her.”  Michelle Tea\n \n“A thought-provoking and often extremely funny first novel looking back at the 2010s, which I couldn't put down. I should also say this book offered some very cathartic **food-for-thought on the strange ways capital, cultural capital, and the Internet interacted in the 10s,** for those of you who are still haunted by trying to make sense of it all.” Emilie Friedlander, VICE\n\n“**Dripping with line-level genius juice.**” M.E.S.H.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f134c960-788f-40c4-a89c-0c7eb66126ce.jpeg?height=2049&width=1536)\n\n\n## ADDITIONAL REFERENCES:\n\n[Crowdfunding Writing with NFTs — Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ)\n\n[Crowdfund Block on Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/igPh3OWGfT3ERv16GZdyQeI7t3FdkK-8zsKlHKSX-lc) \n\n[$GENERALIST](https://generalist.mirror.xyz/1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw)\n\n[$ESSAY](https://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0)\n\n[$MOOD](https://appliedarts.mirror.xyz/vbiD5sIgZaqUAuXu0P6SkvmCNOM7MtRCdqsEDyxsOXU)\n \n \n\n\n", "timestamp": 1617919166, "digest": "0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg", "contributor": "0xDA18e1537622802EC576D99A8e3913914653BD6F"}

In order to keep in touch, reach out to me with your Ethereum address on Twitter at @khole_emily after you've contributed (at this point, I am obsessed with you, which is a plus!)***\n\n### Here we go...\n\nWelcome to a new experiment: using crypto to crowdfund my new novel, working title BURN ALPHA. The supporters of $NOVEL would be the first of their kind, since no other novels have ever been created this way, in the history of literary culture :) \n\n[BURN ALPHA NOVEL](crowdfund://0x95d0A89943E0e3e05d290Fc07462c148EB6a11Ff?network=homestead)\n\n## BURN ALPHA $NOVEL supporters will receive:  \n\n### TIER ONE: Everyone\n\n- Stake in manuscript excerpt from Act 1 of BURN ALPHA which will be posted on Mirror and minted as an NFT\n- Stake in the first edition NFT sale of the full book (this comes later, of course)\n- Mention in the book’s acknowledgments, along with my massive gratitude!\n\n### TIER TWO: .5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\n- Special supporter-only limited edition hardcover copy of BURN ALPHA\n- Limited edition supporter-only BURN ALPHA merch\n- Access to periodic supporter-only readings of manuscript in process\n\n\n### TIER THREE: 1.5 ETH +\n\nAll of the above, plus...\n\nOne on one call with me: either a chat about writing, a chat about whatever is on your mind, or a tarot / astrology reading \n\nSneak peek of the full finished manuscript before anyone else\n\n### More about this project:\n\n\nUsually, novelists go to great lengths to fund their own novel-writing process by working other gigs, selling commercial writing, or – in significantly fewer cases – getting an advance from a publishing company. All of these methods have drawbacks, in the forms of limited time or limited creative freedom for the author. On top of that, the process of creating these works of art goes on behind a veil of secrecy, away from the community that will ultimately enjoy the final product. As an author and publisher, I’d like to change all that. This crowdfund will take us one step closer to a better future for writers and readers everywhere. \n\nI am so stoked to immerse myself more deeply in writing my second book and to share it with all of you.\n\nPhew! Without further ado...\n\n\n\n### The Book:\n\nMy novel-in-progress BURN ALPHA is a homoerotic teen thriller about a group of three girls at an elite New York City private school who stumble into busting a global sex trafficking ring related to their school and ultimately shut the school down, set in the mid-2000s in NYC. There is also an esoteric/supernatural element that informs how they gather information and fight the power – that part is related to Goetic magic, but it wouldn’t be very occult if I spilled it all here. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4c4c8322-1fa8-4d91-a8f8-629d56413991.png?height=1630&width=1056)\n\nThe book-writing process was inspired by my fascination with the [very strange, real 1973 Sci Fi book Space Relations by Donald Barr](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvgpm3/epstein-truthers-are-obsessed-with-a-sci-fi-book-about-child-sex-slavery-written-by-bill-barrs-dad) – who was the headmaster of the Dalton School in New York where Jeffrey Epstein got his first gig (incidentally, Epstein was my mom’s high school math teacher). \n\n![](https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d56c6ec4d02ea00084d5162/lede/1565968446993-0-5.jpeg)\n\n\n\nThe vibe of BURN ALPHA is candy critique: Q Anon meets Umberto Eco meets Gossip Girl. My first novel was [Mercury Retrograde (2020)](https://delugebooks.com/collections/books), which was a New York Times New and Notable Book (!) and was released through [Deluge](https://delugebooks.com/), a press I run with collaborators in New York and Los Angeles ([more press links and info here](https://delugebooks.com/pages/links)). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/df270ae5-1111-4265-bf77-4619d1a2213e.png?height=1078&width=1072)\n\n\nBURN ALPHA would be the second installment in a series of fictional works I’m doing about power structures and how they shift or collapse. I want to crowdfund so I have uninterrupted time for world building and funds to work with the excellent editors in the Deluge network. I’m also trying to learn-by-doing in order to explore new models for publishing overall. This process will help me check out new structures for authors I publish through Deluge, and the larger community of queer, experimental, literary writers of which I am a part. \n\nI’m excited about crowdfunding and the world of social tokens because they open up new ideas about how writing can be generated, published and sustained. The world needs an attitude adjustment when it comes to how books are made, sold, and distributed, and writers have been waiting too long for better ways of working at better rates. (Platforms like Substack can show us a little of what might change but are only a drop in the bucket...they are also kinda hybrid old- and new-generation in a way that feels limp to me.) Therefore, this experiment is one part of figuring out what does and doesn’t work! \n\nAnd luckily, since I run [my own press](https://delugebooks.com/) we already know that this book will hit bookshelves (and e-readers) worldwide once it’s ready!\n\n\n \n\n### Here are the basic mechanics:\nThe initial manuscript excerpt will exist on Mirror, publicly accessible to all. It will be minted as an NFT utilizing the Zora protocol. Supporters retain a stake in both the manuscript excerpt and full manuscript NFTs. Any time these NFTs are sold, a percentage goes back to the token holders, who can then redeem them for a proportional share of ETH in the shared pool. The first edition book is minted as an NFT from the crowdfund, the future value of which routes back to the crowdfund and therefore the supporters. Supporters will forever be linked to the crowdfund as patrons that made this project (and the future of literary fiction) possible.\n\n \n### More about the BURN ALPHA story:\n\nThe three girls at the heart of the story are Elizabeth Macabee, Gillian Shapiro and Archer Fast. Archer is the daughter of a major American political dynasty and also happens to have the headmaster of their school for a father. Gillian is the child of a Goldman Sachs investment banker and Israeli emigre psychoanalyst – though her upper Madison Ave. meets East Hampton set up should make her a shoe-in for popular girl, but her queerness (as yet unarticulated) and body type (not thin enough) preclude this, so she ends up working an alternative angle of social capital: cool clothes, music knowledge, humor, and drugs. Elizabeth, understated and sardonic, is the least privileged of the three, though hardly poor in any consensus reality idea of the term. Raised on the Upper West Side by her academic parents, she is shielded from the high octane world of elite private schools (xoxo) for a good portion of her childhood. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec4a1a29-dcab-4751-a2d3-84e015f20b19.png?height=848&width=854)\n\nFor most of that period, Elizabeth’s mom is a PhD candidate in the sociology department at Columbia studying the network effects of a Panama Papers-type cabal of offshore accounts among the world’s wealthiest people. This eventually trickles up to the school’s trustees, who don’t like it. Elizabeth’s mom gets gaslit out of her grad program and has a psychotic break which includes her murdering the family dog – Elizabeth discovers them both covered with blood on the black-and-white tiled bathroom floor of their apartment on 106th Street. After Elizabeth’s mom emerges from the psych ward, she is totally blackpilled and utterly exhausted by the idea of fighting the power in any form. That’s when she sends Elizabeth crosstown to the ultra-tony Salisbury School, where she intends for her daughter to meld with the elite. Elizabeth’s friendship with Archer and Gillian pleases her in this vein, though if she knew about their daily after school ritual, she would likely be less happy: three girls smoking lots of weed-laced-with-bits-of-PCP in Central Park by the Met. It is during one of those wavy afternoons that the girls slip into another nearby realm, where a piece of information is revealed to them in the form of a crumbling old book. That book implicates Archer’s family and the whole school they attend in a global sex trafficking ring (yes, Epstein-esque, but as if the 2008 Epstein bust was the whole kit and kaboodle, not a slap on the wrist). You’ll have to read the rest of BURN ALPHA to find out what happens!\n\n\n## More about me:\n\nI’m a writer, artist, and trend forecaster based in Los Angeles.

{"id": "JarCi3OHpIlczlduVlNyL2DF1CdY_E9oa9CcP6qZfOI", "title": "Readers / Subscribers / Collectors / Patrons", "body": "My [previous post](https://air.mirror.xyz/5A16bvvS2IJK7fVVNb2GwrrEcyey2B4UiH2l1DI_Y2I) was about how cryptocurrencies function like content and how investing in tokens is in some ways like being a reader of a magazine. Both of these relationships are mediations between creators (a terrible word) and consumers or fans. Many digital platforms have lately been trying to form new relationships between creators and consumers, where it's donations on Patreon, subscriptions on Substack, or buying NFTs on SuperRare. The consumer provides some form of support (usually monetary) in exchange for various forms of access to the creator. \n\nIt's worth breaking down a bit how these different relationships work. Through its subscriptions, a magazine like The New Yorker offers access to a packaged group of writers and voices in various formats: articles, print magazines, crossword puzzles, podcasts, and videos. We subscribe to The New Yorker because we want to be in touch with those specific voices, and the magazine offers a convenient bundle. The subscription is a rather abstract exchange: We don't know how much money goes to the specific writer we like; we just know that it supports the whole organization, which we affiliate ourselves with as readers. \n\nOn Patreon and Substack, the relationship is more direct. Patrons or subscribers are paying directly for some form of content from the specific voice. Particularly with Substack, it feels like a subscription to a magazine of one writer. Those economics can work out very well because the now-accepted price for a solo newsletter is similar to that of an entire print magazine. Yet the relationship is less abstract. I know where my money's going and I know what the writer is going to do with it, and I want to be more closely affiliated with them, so I'm willing to pay a higher price relative to content. \n\nNewsletters or Patreon posts are a stream of content that consumers follow over time. NFTs function more like art exhibitions: creators put out a few in batches, or one at a time consistently, and collectors buy up ownership rights for much higher prices than a reader might pay to consume the same content on Patreon. It's a different business model and relationship, relying on wealthier, more committed followers to offer support in more intermittent, higher-value ways. What those collectors get is more intimacy or affiliation with the creator, because they can assert a right to something that no one else can. \n\nAn art collector buys a painting because they want to have the artist's presence in their life, to meditate on the one work on their wall over time, not to receive intermittent updates or a stream of new weekly creations. It's a limited transaction, even though it's usually high-priced. The affiliation with the artist is relatively one-sided, though the collector might, via a gallery, get invited to openings or dinners. Ownership of a painting (or NFT) can be a ticket into rarified spaces beyond that specific artist — partly because it's simply a display of wealth, and other groups want your collecting attention. \n\nThe patron relationship is different once again. Patrons are not just consuming a work via reading or ownership; they are supporting the work's creation and participating in the creator's process to some degree — committing to buy a work in advance, perhaps, or donating studio space or resources. (Not like getting their portrait painted; more like being an early investor, an insider.) The rewards of patronage are status, close affiliation, creative input, and a kind of equity: Your investment might turn into profit or your social capital might increase — though acting too cynically can make the opposite happen. \n\nI think content — in the form of writing, journalism, commentary, research — needs more forms of collector and patron relationships, where upfront investment and commitment is rewarded and more unique projects are enabled. These relationships reward the creators with independence and relative freedom and deeper understanding (ideally) from their audience. Subscription is certainly a sustainable business model for many forms of media, but it does not necessarily suit all forms of content or experimental work, which collectors and patrons are ideally suited for. \n\nNFTs can provide the support for the collector and patron relationships, as can the kinds of tokens that Mirror is supporting, like $ESSAY or [Emily Segal's $NOVEL](https://t.co/QOnEqOWall). I want to see blogs, series, and think tanks funded by tokens and NFTs rather than just readers and recurring payments, with rewards for both creators and patrons.", "timestamp": 1617979172, "digest": "dI8gr1UvN6er2xWO2kU9C1dIqXKaZR8DtkqTe6ofOqo", "contributor": "0x25cbCFA16e43e58517f80D583087Ea89241293E6"}

Cue inception memes\n\nAt the end of this post is the initial commit of the smart contract code. Since this post is minted as an NFT, this code is immortalized as part of it. Owning this NFT means owning a 1/1 collectible representing the initial commit of the open-source implementation of reserve auctions, which will live on Mint Fund’s [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mintfund/reserve-auction/blob/main/contracts/ReserveAuctionV3.sol).\n\n## **The Process**\n\nInitially Mint Fund created a bounty via a Mirror crowdfund to fund the development of an open source version of reserve auction smart contract, which was [fulfilled](https://github.com/okwme/core/blob/master/contracts/ReserveAuction.sol) by Solidity developer [Billy Rennekamp](https://twitter.com/billyrennekamp).\n\nThe Mirror team took this code and improved on it until it was production ready. The [final version](https://github.com/mintfund/reserve-auction/blob/main/contracts/ReserveAuctionV3.sol) (included at the bottom of this post) was used to auction off two NFTs on April 1st, 2021 for a combined value of 26.1 ETH.\n\nIn a testament to open source collaboration and smart contract composability, this auction code builds on top of the open Zora NFT protocol and honors the creator share of zNFTs.\n\nFurthermore, it also supports specifying a curator fee for facilitating the auction. This enables organizations like Mint Fund or other galleries a potential business model to sustain their operations .\n\n*We’d like to credit projects that have pioneered and improved on the reserve auction mechanism and experience, such as SuperRare and Foundation.*\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe [Zora](https://zora.co/) team is working on adding functionality to the reserve auction code that more fully utilizes the power of the Zora Protocol. Zora's update will support bidding in any ERC20 token, and honoring the sell-on-share fee that users will know from the Zora interface.\n\n## **What $BOUNTY holders get.**\n\nFollowing the initial crowdfund, $BOUNTY tokens were distributed to all backers. 25% of $BOUNTY tokens were retained by MintFund, with 5% allocated to the developer implementing the bounty. The remaining 70% were distributed to the $BOUNTY crowdfund backers.\n\n$BOUNTY represents the shared value created through the crowdfunding, development and auction of the NFT. If the $BOUNTY NFT sells, the proceeds will go to the crowdfund and thereby the $BOUNTY backers. Holding $BOUNTY tokens also grant one access to a private channel on the Mint Fund discord only accessible by those holding at least 15 $BOUNTY.\n\n## The future of public goods funding\n\nAs far as we know, this has been the first experiment to combine crypto-native crowdfunding with public works minted as an NFT. Recently, Vitalik [wrote](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) about the potential to use token incentives, NFTs, and decentralized governance to fund public goods like scientific research, local journalism, and poverty relief.\n\nWe believe this new model has the opportunity to create win-win scenarios for all parties involved: backers, creators, developers, collectors, and end-consumers of these funded projects.\n\nMintFund hopes to see others experiment with this model and push the boundaries of how creative work is financed, produced, and owned using the internet and crypto-native tools.\n\n## **The Code**\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later\npragma solidity 0.6.8;\npragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;\n\n// OpenZeppelin library for performing math operations without overflows.\nimport {SafeMath} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol\";\n// OpenZeppelin security library for preventing reentrancy attacks.\nimport {\n    ReentrancyGuard\n} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol\";\n// For interacting with Zora's Market contract.\nimport {IMarket} from \"./interfaces/IMarket.sol\";\n// For checking `supportsInterface`.\nimport {IERC165} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/introspection/IERC165.sol\";\n// For interacting with NFT tokens.\nimport {IERC721} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\";\n\ncontract IMediaModified {\n    mapping(uint256 => address) public tokenCreators;\n    address public marketContract;\n}\n\ninterface IWETH {\n    function deposit() external payable;\n\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);\n}\n\ncontract ReserveAuctionV3 is ReentrancyGuard {\n    // Use OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library to prevent overflows.\n    using SafeMath for uint256;\n\n    // ============ Constants ============\n\n    // The minimum amount of time left in an auction after a new bid is created; 15 min.\n    uint16 public constant TIME_BUFFER = 900;\n    // The ETH needed above the current bid for a new bid to be valid; 0.001 ETH.\n    uint8 public constant MIN_BID_INCREMENT_PERCENT = 10;\n    // Interface constant for ERC721, to check values in constructor.\n    bytes4 private constant ERC721_INTERFACE_ID = 0x80ac58cd;\n    // Allows external read `getVersion()` to return a version for the auction.\n    uint256 private constant RESERVE_AUCTION_VERSION = 1;\n\n    // ============ Immutable Storage ============\n\n    // The address of the ERC721 contract for tokens auctioned via this contract.\n    address public immutable nftContract;\n    // The address of the WETH contract, so that ETH can be transferred via\n    // WETH if native ETH transfers fail.\n    address public immutable wethAddress;\n    // The address that initially is able to recover assets.\n    address public immutable adminRecoveryAddress;\n\n    // ============ Mutable Storage ============\n\n    /**\n     * To start, there will be an admin account that can recover funds\n     * if anything goes wrong.

Kinda like how tech products rely on AI to remain competitive today.\n\nBut we’re still really damn early. So, what is crypto actually good for, *right now?* In this post, we'll cover a framework I share with creators on how to think about the crypto landscape.\n\nBy the way, when I say \"creators\", I'm referring to “[anyone doing non-commoditized work supported by digital platforms](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1350863079425376258)”. This includes writers, social media influencers, digital artists, musicians, podcasters, and online teachers, among others.\n\nAlright, now let's take a look at some tips for creators looking to experiment with crypto.\n\n## Tip #1: First, focus on creator market fit\n\nCreators are their own mini startups. They're responsible for focusing on a niche, understanding what customers want, creating something that people love, and finding sustainable ways to grow.\n\nIn startups, the concept “product market fit” is widely regarded as [the key](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html) to sustainable growth. Product market fit creates a positive feedback loop between happy customers, new customers, and profits.\n\nThe equivalent to product market fit for creators is [creator market fit](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1376393732610785283).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/931d23e6-1795-41c4-baf5-20b4d17de8d9.jpeg?height=1108&width=1972)\n\nBefore focusing on growth, creators should prioritize finding creator market fit because it will serve as the foundation for a sustainable career. Once a creator gets to creator market fit, then it may make sense to start experimenting with crypto to accelerate grow.\n\nCrypto is a powerful tool for growth. Crypto is *NOT* a replacement for creator market fit.\n\n## Tip #2: Start off using crypto as a monetization tool\n\nOnce a creator feels like they have creator market fit, it's time to think about how they can use crypto to build a sustainable business.\n\nCrypto can help creators in four main areas:\n\n*   **Financing**: \"Help me raise money for projects.\"\n*   **Acquisition**: \"Help me get more community members.\"\n*   **Engagement:** \"Help my existing community members get more involved.\"\n*   **Monetization:** \"Help me make money.\"\n\nSo, as a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed creator ready to jump down the crypto rabbit hole, where do you start? Well, crypto isn't like signing up for a new SaaS product. Instead, crypto is more like building a mini economy.\n\nEconomies have currencies, laws, governance, goods and services, markets, citizens, etc.\n\nCrypto gives creators the tools to build their own economies with each of these components. But like any good startup, creators should smart small and iterate.\n\nOut of all the ways crypto can help creators, I think *focusing on crypto as a monetization tool is the best place to start* for a few reasons:\n\n*   **Focusing on monetization empowers creators to produce on-chain goods.** Goods and services are the core engine for productive economies because it creates resources to reinvest in growth. One issue I see with many creator tokens is that they launch a token but don't produce any on-chain goods. Most of their revenue is off-chain so that’s where their focus ends up.\n*   **On-chain goods convince community members to download a crypto wallet, buy ETH, and pay the creator on-chain.** Convincing community members to download a crypto wallet and buy ETH is one of the biggest barriers for creators experimenting with crypto. I think it's much easier to persuade your community to go through the mindfvck of learning crypto if they're able to buy a cool NFT at the end.\n*   **On-chain cash flow provides a solid foundation for other experiments.** As you sell more digital goods, you begin to accrue an on-chain treasury. This treasury can then be used to fund experiments like a decentralized investment fund, rewards programs for token holders, collaborations with other crypto-native creators, etc. These experiments then create a positive feedback loop which makes the treasury more valuable and provides more resources for future projects.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1376966491816476674)\n\nAdditionally, creators can view crypto-native monetization as just one part of their product portfolio.\n\nWeb2 is great at monetizing artificial scarcity through paywalls for stuff like content, courses, and communities. Web2 is also great at monetizing attention through ads. But as we’ve seen, ad platforms heavily favor large creators and optimize for certain engagement metrics that aren’t always in the best interest of people consuming the content. Sponsorships are another option but they may require a large audience and a bunch of boring administrative work.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ec3efa3-9281-4312-b919-a295c1f22eaa\\_1440x1080.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ec3efa3-9281-4312-b919-a295c1f22eaa\\_1440x1080.jpeg)\n\nNFTs provide a new monetization channel for creators that complements existing channels. Instead of monetizing access or attention, NFTs monetize *ownership*.\n\nThrough math, computer science, and cryptography, digital goods that live on a blockchain can have a single owner. That’s basically what NFTs are. Digital goods that live on a blockchain and have an owner. The wider implication is that [NFTs make the internet ownable](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo). As a result, superfans are willing to buy NFTs from their favorite creators because for the first time in history, they can truly *own* a digital good. It’s like having a Nike shoe in your closet. As long as you buy it legally, Nike can’t bust down your door and take the shoe. It’s yours. Similarly, NFTs now provide a digitally-native form of property rights.\n\nAs scalability solutions reduce transaction fees and more infrastructure is built out, I believe NFTs will evolve to provide many other benefits beyond just ownership.\n\nEventually, creators will come up with crypto-native business models like [programmable subscriptions](https://medium.com/superfluid-blog/the-dawn-of-programmable-cashflows-2d50edae05cb), [prediction markets](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1309078385369460741?lang=en), [token reward programs](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641), investing in other creators, etc.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few ways creators can monetize with NFTs today.\n\n***1 of 1 NFTs***\n\nFor this model to work, you need just one true fan. But that leads to the main downside of this model. There’s only one owner. As a result, it's hard to create a community around these NFTs because only one person owns it. This model also prices out consumers who aren't willing to yolo their entire life savings on an NFT.\n\n***Limited supply NFT drops w/ collector rewards***\n\nThis model is still very underexplored. I think 3LAU is the [best example](https://nft.3lau.com/#/auction) of doing it right. With this model, you release a few NFTs and offer rewards to anybody that bids. This creates more of a community since multiple people can get involved while also retaining some scarcity. I think this model works best when releasing a large creative project like an album, a book, film, etc. because it can be made into an extravagant digital experience with a positive feedback loop between the value of the project and the NFTs.\n\n***Fractionalized NFTs***\n\nI think this will become the dominant model at some point. There are many variations but the general idea is to take one NFT and allow people to buy fungible tokens that represent the NFT. Token holders can speculate on the value of the NFT by trading their tokens or they can hold onto the NFT for access to exclusive rewards or just to flex. The main benefit is that this model enables many people to own a piece of your NFT. This can sow the seeds for a well-incentivized community. The design space here is pretty wide so I'm sure we'll see all sorts of experimentation in the coming months.\n\nWe're still in the early days but it's worth taking the time to experiment with different monetization models yourself to understand which is right for the type of community you want to build.\n\nOnce you've started generating on-chain cash flow through NFTs, the next step is community governance.\n\n## Increase community engagement and retention through decentralized governance\n\nDecentralized governance is another killer feature of cryptonetworks. Today, the relationship between creators and their communities is mostly one-way. The creator publishes content and their community consumes it. Maybe there are some chat groups but that‘s about it.\n\nI believe cryptonetworks will usher in a new era of *co-creation*. Creators will involve their communities in key decisions like how to allocate funds, who to onboard, what types of projects they should work on, etc. This type of co-creation increases community and retention which can lead to stronger communities over the long-term.\n\nHere's a few ways creators can involve their community in key decisions today.\n\n***Community-driven capital allocation***\n\nOnce a creator starts generating on-chain revenue, they can redistribute funds with the help of their community. One option is to create an investment fund where community members earn tokens which they use to vote on which digital assets the fund should purchase. Digital assets could include NFTs, [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) moments, plots of land in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), or tokens for a DeFi protocol. One example of a decentralized investment fund is [FlamingoDAO](https://docs.flamingodao.xyz/). [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa), has a [great blog post](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/A16NP2XXi9RdHptfdF9WHR0Xq_E1XDmUgMwPmJYOG7w) explaining the potential of these decentralized investment funds.\n\nAnother option is to create a grant program where community members decide projects to fund based on their potential impact on the community. DeFi protocols like Uniswap, AAVE, and Compound all have community-driven grant programs for projects improving their core protocol.\n\nLastly, communities could also vote on what percentage of the treasury should go to community members. For example, $UNI holders get to vote on whether to turn on the 0.05% [protocol fee switch](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-flip-the-protocol-fee-switch-for-uniswap-dev-team-and-uni-holders/4777).\n\n***Democratically add new community members***\n\nOnboarding new members to a community usually goes one of two ways. On one hand, there's an opaque process where a few people decide who gets allowed in. On the other hand, it's an open access community which can lead to trolls and fvck up the vibez.\n\nWith decentralized governance, the community can self-regulate by collectively deciding who gets onboarded.\n\nFor example, at Mirror, we onboard ten new members each week using a community-driven process called [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race). Existing Mirror writers start with 1,000 votes and prospective members start with 10 votes. Everyone has two hours to cast their votes and the top ten people each week are airdropped a $WRITE token which they can burn to get access to Mirror.\n\nGranted, there's still a lot we could do to improve (eg give people a chance to write a short prompt on what they would use Mirror for, experiment with quadratic voting to disincentivize large votes for one person, give prospective members ways to earn more votes, turn the voting system into a prediction market to incentivize voting for people that add the most value to the Mirror protocol, create a DAO to set the voting parameters, etc.)\n\nRegardless, $WRITE Race has turned onboarding from a centralized / permissioned process to a community-driven process.\n\nAs more tools get built for decentralized governance, I think it will become the default way communities make decisions online.\n\n## Capitalize projects through crowdfunding\n\nCrowdfunding today is limited. You either need to live in a certain jurisdiction or be an accredited investor. I believe these limitations are good-natured and agree that we need guardrails to protect consumers from scam artists.\n\nYet, I also believe these limitations are preventing many talented people from gaining access to capital they could use to build something great. There needs to be some sort of middle ground. Here are a few reasons why I think creators should consider using crypto to finance creative projects.\n\n***Global and permissionless access***\n\nTo contribute to a crypto-native crowdfund, all you need is an Ethereum address. No jurisdictional requirements. No minimum net worth requirements. Just a computer, an internet connection, and a crypto wallet with some ETH or ERC20 tokens.\n\n***Programmable ownership***\n\nWith a crowdfund on Kickstarter or GoFundMe, you mostly just receive a warm fuzzy feeling that you contributed to something meaningful. Granted, that’s super important! Unfortunately, many people would rather spend their funds on other assets that generate some sort of return. Whether that be financial or pro-social.\n\nWith crowdfunds on Ethereum, instead of just receiving a warm fuzzy feeling or a bumper sticker, contributors can receive an ERC20 token. This token can then be programmed to include all sorts of benefits. These could include access to an online community, governance rights on how the funds should be allocated, royalties on the assets generated from the crowdfund, or maybe even a cool badge you can display in your crypto wallet or virtual merchandise you can wear in a video game.\n\nThe main takeaway is that cryptonetworks provide a new era of *programmable ownership* which can be used as a tool for better incentive alignment around capital formation.\n\n***Economic graphs***\n\nWeb 1.0 was about information links (web pages). Web 2.0 was about social links (likes, follows, shares). Web 3.0 is about economic links (tokens you earn, investments you make, assets you own). ([source](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1373809410485719045)) One of the coolest products that I think will emerge is a “crypto-native [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) for creators”. For example, if you go to [Instacart’s page on Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/instacart), you can see their total funding amount, the number of investors, who the investors are, how much they’ve allocated, and a bunch of other information.\n\nWith crypto-native crowdfunding, we could see something similar emerge for any creative project. As the next generation of social products get built on crypto rails, I believe creators will use some sort of decentralized crowdfunding to finance their projects. If so, you could see the entire cap table for the next [Mr. Beast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA) or [Cardi B](https://www.instagram.com/iamcardib/) and build products around those economic graphs.\n\nYet, decentralized crowdfunding comes with risks since there’s no centralized party to regulate. To limit the risk of scams, I think we could develop something like an on-chain KYC process. To contribute to a crowdfund, you would need to submit your public key and be limited to contributing only a certain percentage of your net worth.\n\nTo raise funds, you would start off with a low funding cap (say $10k) and be required to build credibility within the system through certain metrics before being able to raise larger amounts.\n\nSo far, we’ve covered how crypto can help creators with monetization, engagement, and financing. Now let's take a look at how crypto can help with acquiring new community members.\n\n## Drive acquisition through token rewards\n\nTo drive customer acquisition, DeFi protocols employ a tactic known as \"[liquidity mining](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641)\". This is just a fancy way of saying “rewards program”. But, instead of providing cash incentives, protocols incentivize customers with their protocol token.\n\nFor creators, I prefer calling this a \"token rewards\" program since it's a bit more intuitive. Token rewards are so powerful that an entirely [new field of study](https://ce.mit.edu/) called cryptoeconomics was developed to understand it better.\n\nOne kinda scary definition of cryptoeconomics is: \"programming human behavior through the careful design of incentives.\" ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCFlGLbI_kE))\n\nThis is powerful stuff. In web2, we've seen what types of shitshows can happen online when incentives aren't crafted carefully. It’s important to educate ourselves on the mechanics of incentive design so we can consciously create new systems that reward positive sum behavior.\n\nHere's one framework that can help creators think through designing a token rewards program:\n\n1.  **Identify your community’s goal.** Is it to develop deeper social connections? Improve at a skill? Find a better job? Make money?\n2.  **Choose a reward mechanism.** In cryptonetworks, this is usually a programmable token.\n3.  **Choose a positive sum reward that benefits the network.** This can include votes in decentralized governance. Access to exclusive experiences. Or even financial rewards.\n\n*Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCFlGLbI_kE*\n\n(If you’d like to go deeper on this subject, check out [Token Engineering 101](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/library-te-101/)).\n\nCrypto gives us powerful tools for human coordination. Creators can use these tools to ensure their communities correct the mistakes that social networks made in the previous era of the web.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nCrypto is one of the most fascinating technologies in the world. Over the past decade, it has evolved from a cute little science experiment, to something that might actually be kinda important. Over the next decade, I strongly believe it will become an integral part of our lives.\n\nBut as a creator trying to make a living *today*, it's important to be practical.\n\nFirst, focus on getting to creator market fit. That will serve as the foundation for a sustainable career as a creator. Then, slowly start experimenting with all this crazy crypto stuff. At a high-level, crypto can help creators with financing, acquisition, engagement, and monetization.\n\nOn a tactical level, one option is to start by generating on-chain cash flows through NFTs. Creators can experiment with 1 of 1 NFTs, fractionalization, and limited release drops with tiered rewards. Another option is to create a system of community-driven governance to help improve engagement and retention. Creators can also try to crowdfund for a creative project and give contributors programmable ownership. Creators can even design a token rewards program for incentivizing positive sum behavior within their community.\n\nWhether you've been in crypto for a decade or just downloaded Metamask last week, we're all still trying to figure this stuff out. But that's what makes it so damn fun.\n", "timestamp": 1617997557, "digest": "WQQywdjjfnksMRPMaNKBMxPBqfE5k8nL6pCLe1roGyw", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

But like any good startup, creators should smart small and iterate.\n\nOut of all the ways crypto can help creators, I think *focusing on crypto as a monetization tool is the best place to start* for a few reasons:\n\n*   **Focusing on monetization empowers creators to produce on-chain goods.** Goods and services are the core engine for productive economies because it creates resources to reinvest in growth. One issue I see with many creator tokens is that they launch a token but don't produce any on-chain goods. Most of their revenue is off-chain so that’s where their focus ends up.\n*   **On-chain goods convince community members to download a crypto wallet, buy ETH, and pay the creator on-chain.** Convincing community members to download a crypto wallet and buy ETH is one of the biggest barriers for creators experimenting with crypto. I think it's much easier to persuade your community to go through the mindfvck of learning crypto if they're able to buy a cool NFT at the end.\n*   **On-chain cash flow provides a solid foundation for other experiments.** As you sell more digital goods, you begin to accrue an on-chain treasury. This treasury can then be used to fund experiments like a decentralized investment fund, rewards programs for token holders, collaborations with other crypto-native creators, etc. These experiments then create a positive feedback loop which makes the treasury more valuable and provides more resources for future projects.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1376966491816476674)\n\nAdditionally, creators can view crypto-native monetization as just one part of their product portfolio.\n\nWeb2 is great at monetizing artificial scarcity through paywalls for stuff like content, courses, and communities. Web2 is also great at monetizing attention through ads. But as we’ve seen, ad platforms heavily favor large creators and optimize for certain engagement metrics that aren’t always in the best interest of people consuming the content. Sponsorships are another option but they may require a large audience and a bunch of boring administrative work.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ec3efa3-9281-4312-b919-a295c1f22eaa\\_1440x1080.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ec3efa3-9281-4312-b919-a295c1f22eaa\\_1440x1080.jpeg)\n\nNFTs provide a new monetization channel for creators that complements existing channels. Instead of monetizing access or attention, NFTs monetize *ownership*.\n\nThrough math, computer science, and cryptography, digital goods that live on a blockchain can have a single owner. That’s basically what NFTs are. Digital goods that live on a blockchain and have an owner. The wider implication is that [NFTs make the internet ownable](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo). As a result, superfans are willing to buy NFTs from their favorite creators because for the first time in history, they can truly *own* a digital good. It’s like having a Nike shoe in your closet. As long as you buy it legally, Nike can’t bust down your door and take the shoe. It’s yours. Similarly, NFTs now provide a digitally-native form of property rights.\n\nAs scalability solutions reduce transaction fees and more infrastructure is built out, I believe NFTs will evolve to provide many other benefits beyond just ownership.\n\nEventually, creators will come up with crypto-native business models like [programmable subscriptions](https://medium.com/superfluid-blog/the-dawn-of-programmable-cashflows-2d50edae05cb), [prediction markets](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1309078385369460741?lang=en), [token reward programs](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641), investing in other creators, etc.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few ways creators can monetize with NFTs today.\n\n***1 of 1 NFTs***\n\nFor this model to work, you need just one true fan. But that leads to the main downside of this model. There’s only one owner. As a result, it's hard to create a community around these NFTs because only one person owns it. This model also prices out consumers who aren't willing to yolo their entire life savings on an NFT.\n\n***Limited supply NFT drops w/ collector rewards***\n\nThis model is still very underexplored. I think 3LAU is the [best example](https://nft.3lau.com/#/auction) of doing it right. With this model, you release a few NFTs and offer rewards to anybody that bids. This creates more of a community since multiple people can get involved while also retaining some scarcity. I think this model works best when releasing a large creative project like an album, a book, film, etc. because it can be made into an extravagant digital experience with a positive feedback loop between the value of the project and the NFTs.\n\n***Fractionalized NFTs***\n\nI think this will become the dominant model at some point. There are many variations but the general idea is to take one NFT and allow people to buy fungible tokens that represent the NFT. Token holders can speculate on the value of the NFT by trading their tokens or they can hold onto the NFT for access to exclusive rewards or just to flex. The main benefit is that this model enables many people to own a piece of your NFT. This can sow the seeds for a well-incentivized community. The design space here is pretty wide so I'm sure we'll see all sorts of experimentation in the coming months.\n\nWe're still in the early days but it's worth taking the time to experiment with different monetization models yourself to understand which is right for the type of community you want to build.\n\nOnce you've started generating on-chain cash flow through NFTs, the next step is community governance.\n\n## Increase community engagement and retention through decentralized governance\n\nDecentralized governance is another killer feature of cryptonetworks. Today, the relationship between creators and their communities is mostly one-way. The creator publishes content and their community consumes it. Maybe there are some chat groups but that‘s about it.\n\nI believe cryptonetworks will usher in a new era of *co-creation*. Creators will involve their communities in key decisions like how to allocate funds, who to onboard, what types of projects they should work on, etc. This type of co-creation increases community and retention which can lead to stronger communities over the long-term.\n\nHere's a few ways creators can involve their community in key decisions today.\n\n***Community-driven capital allocation***\n\nOnce a creator starts generating on-chain revenue, they can redistribute funds with the help of their community. One option is to create an investment fund where community members earn tokens which they use to vote on which digital assets the fund should purchase. Digital assets could include NFTs, [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) moments, plots of land in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), or tokens for a DeFi protocol. One example of a decentralized investment fund is [FlamingoDAO](https://docs.flamingodao.xyz/). [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa), has a [great blog post](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/A16NP2XXi9RdHptfdF9WHR0Xq_E1XDmUgMwPmJYOG7w) explaining the potential of these decentralized investment funds.\n\nAnother option is to create a grant program where community members decide projects to fund based on their potential impact on the community. DeFi protocols like Uniswap, AAVE, and Compound all have community-driven grant programs for projects improving their core protocol.\n\nLastly, communities could also vote on what percentage of the treasury should go to community members. For example, $UNI holders get to vote on whether to turn on the 0.05% [protocol fee switch](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-flip-the-protocol-fee-switch-for-uniswap-dev-team-and-uni-holders/4777).\n\n***Democratically add new community members***\n\nOnboarding new members to a community usually goes one of two ways. On one hand, there's an opaque process where a few people decide who gets allowed in. On the other hand, it's an open access community which can lead to trolls and fvck up the vibez.\n\nWith decentralized governance, the community can self-regulate by collectively deciding who gets onboarded.\n\nFor example, at Mirror, we onboard ten new members each week using a community-driven process called [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race). Existing Mirror writers start with 1,000 votes and prospective members start with 10 votes. Everyone has two hours to cast their votes and the top ten people each week are airdropped a $WRITE token which they can burn to get access to Mirror.\n\nGranted, there's still a lot we could do to improve (eg give people a chance to write a short prompt on what they would use Mirror for, experiment with quadratic voting to disincentivize large votes for one person, give prospective members ways to earn more votes, turn the voting system into a prediction market to incentivize voting for people that add the most value to the Mirror protocol, create a DAO to set the voting parameters, etc.)\n\nRegardless, $WRITE Race has turned onboarding from a centralized / permissioned process to a community-driven process.\n\nAs more tools get built for decentralized governance, I think it will become the default way communities make decisions online.\n\n## Capitalize projects through crowdfunding\n\nCrowdfunding today is limited. You either need to live in a certain jurisdiction or be an accredited investor. I believe these limitations are good-natured and agree that we need guardrails to protect consumers from scam artists.\n\nYet, I also believe these limitations are preventing many talented people from gaining access to capital they could use to build something great. There needs to be some sort of middle ground. Here are a few reasons why I think creators should consider using crypto to finance creative projects.\n\n***Global and permissionless access***\n\nTo contribute to a crypto-native crowdfund, all you need is an Ethereum address. No jurisdictional requirements. No minimum net worth requirements. Just a computer, an internet connection, and a crypto wallet with some ETH or ERC20 tokens.\n\n***Programmable ownership***\n\nWith a crowdfund on Kickstarter or GoFundMe, you mostly just receive a warm fuzzy feeling that you contributed to something meaningful. Granted, that’s super important! Unfortunately, many people would rather spend their funds on other assets that generate some sort of return. Whether that be financial or pro-social.\n\nWith crowdfunds on Ethereum, instead of just receiving a warm fuzzy feeling or a bumper sticker, contributors can receive an ERC20 token. This token can then be programmed to include all sorts of benefits. These could include access to an online community, governance rights on how the funds should be allocated, royalties on the assets generated from the crowdfund, or maybe even a cool badge you can display in your crypto wallet or virtual merchandise you can wear in a video game.\n\nThe main takeaway is that cryptonetworks provide a new era of *programmable ownership* which can be used as a tool for better incentive alignment around capital formation.\n\n***Economic graphs***\n\nWeb 1.0 was about information links (web pages). Web 2.0 was about social links (likes, follows, shares). Web 3.0 is about economic links (tokens you earn, investments you make, assets you own). ([source](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1373809410485719045)) One of the coolest products that I think will emerge is a “crypto-native [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) for creators”. For example, if you go to [Instacart’s page on Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/instacart), you can see their total funding amount, the number of investors, who the investors are, how much they’ve allocated, and a bunch of other information.\n\nWith crypto-native crowdfunding, we could see something similar emerge for any creative project. As the next generation of social products get built on crypto rails, I believe creators will use some sort of decentralized crowdfunding to finance their projects. If so, you could see the entire cap table for the next [Mr. Beast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA) or [Cardi B](https://www.instagram.com/iamcardib/) and build products around those economic graphs.\n\nYet, decentralized crowdfunding comes with risks since there’s no centralized party to regulate. To limit the risk of scams, I think we could develop something like an on-chain KYC process. To contribute to a crowdfund, you would need to submit your public key and be limited to contributing only a certain percentage of your net worth.\n\nTo raise funds, you would start off with a low funding cap (say $10k) and be required to build credibility within the system through certain metrics before being able to raise larger amounts.\n\nSo far, we’ve covered how crypto can help creators with monetization, engagement, and financing. Now let's take a look at how crypto can help with acquiring new community members.\n\n## Drive acquisition through token rewards\n\nTo drive customer acquisition, DeFi protocols employ a tactic known as \"[liquidity mining](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641)\". This is just a fancy way of saying “rewards program”. But, instead of providing cash incentives, protocols incentivize customers with their protocol token.\n\nFor creators, I prefer calling this a \"token rewards\" program since it's a bit more intuitive. Token rewards are so powerful that an entirely [new field of study](https://ce.mit.edu/) called cryptoeconomics was developed to understand it better.\n\nOne kinda scary definition of cryptoeconomics is: \"programming human behavior through the careful design of incentives.\" ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCFlGLbI_kE))\n\nThis is powerful stuff. In web2, we've seen what types of shitshows can happen online when incentives aren't crafted carefully. It’s important to educate ourselves on the mechanics of incentive design so we can consciously create new systems that reward positive sum behavior.\n\nHere's one framework that can help creators think through designing a token rewards program:\n\n1.  **Identify your community’s goal.** Is it to develop deeper social connections? Improve at a skill? Find a better job? Make money?\n2.  **Choose a reward mechanism.** In cryptonetworks, this is usually a programmable token.\n3.  **Choose a positive sum reward that benefits the network.** This can include votes in decentralized governance. Access to exclusive experiences. Or even financial rewards.\n\n*Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCFlGLbI_kE*\n\n(If you’d like to go deeper on this subject, check out [Token Engineering 101](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/library-te-101/)).\n\nCrypto gives us powerful tools for human coordination. Creators can use these tools to ensure their communities correct the mistakes that social networks made in the previous era of the web.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nCrypto is one of the most fascinating technologies in the world. Over the past decade, it has evolved from a cute little science experiment, to something that might actually be kinda important. Over the next decade, I strongly believe it will become an integral part of our lives.\n\nBut as a creator trying to make a living *today*, it's important to be practical.\n\nFirst, focus on getting to creator market fit. That will serve as the foundation for a sustainable career as a creator. Then, slowly start experimenting with all this crazy crypto stuff. At a high-level, crypto can help creators with financing, acquisition, engagement, and monetization.\n\nOn a tactical level, one option is to start by generating on-chain cash flows through NFTs. Creators can experiment with 1 of 1 NFTs, fractionalization, and limited release drops with tiered rewards. Another option is to create a system of community-driven governance to help improve engagement and retention. Creators can also try to crowdfund for a creative project and give contributors programmable ownership. Creators can even design a token rewards program for incentivizing positive sum behavior within their community.\n\nWhether you've been in crypto for a decade or just downloaded Metamask last week, we're all still trying to figure this stuff out. But that's what makes it so damn fun.\n", "timestamp": 1617998078, "digest": "WQQywdjjfnksMRPMaNKBMxPBqfE5k8nL6pCLe1roGyw", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

Figured I'd try it out as the first essay NFT auction on Mirror 😛\n\n---\n\nOne of the cool things about working at a startup is that you get to wear a lot hats.\n\n[Token #2757](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2757)\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the week is speaking with creators about how they can use crypto to build stronger communities.\n\nIn the future, I think crypto will be a core part of every creator’s business. Kinda like how tech products rely on AI to remain competitive today.\n\nBut we’re still really damn early. So, what is crypto actually good for, *right now?* In this post, we'll cover a framework I share with creators on how to think about the crypto landscape.\n\nBy the way, when I say \"creators\", I'm referring to “[anyone doing non-commoditized work supported by digital platforms](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1350863079425376258)”. This includes writers, social media influencers, digital artists, musicians, podcasters, and online teachers, among others.\n\nAlright, now let's take a look at some tips for creators looking to experiment with crypto.\n\n## Tip #1: First, focus on creator market fit\n\nCreators are their own mini startups. They're responsible for focusing on a niche, understanding what customers want, creating something that people love, and finding sustainable ways to grow.\n\nIn startups, the concept “product market fit” is widely regarded as [the key](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html) to sustainable growth. Product market fit creates a positive feedback loop between happy customers, new customers, and profits.\n\nThe equivalent to product market fit for creators is [creator market fit](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1376393732610785283).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/931d23e6-1795-41c4-baf5-20b4d17de8d9.jpeg?height=1108&width=1972)\n\nBefore focusing on growth, creators should prioritize finding creator market fit because it will serve as the foundation for a sustainable career. Once a creator gets to creator market fit, then it may make sense to start experimenting with crypto to accelerate grow.\n\nCrypto is a powerful tool for growth. Crypto is *NOT* a replacement for creator market fit.\n\n## Tip #2: Start off using crypto as a monetization tool\n\nOnce a creator feels like they have creator market fit, it's time to think about how they can use crypto to build a sustainable business.\n\nCrypto can help creators in four main areas:\n\n*   **Financing**: \"Help me raise money for projects.\"\n*   **Acquisition**: \"Help me get more community members.\"\n*   **Engagement:** \"Help my existing community members get more involved.\"\n*   **Monetization:** \"Help me make money.\"\n\nSo, as a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed creator ready to jump down the crypto rabbit hole, where do you start? Well, crypto isn't like signing up for a new SaaS product. Instead, crypto is more like building a mini economy.\n\nEconomies have currencies, laws, governance, goods and services, markets, citizens, etc.\n\nCrypto gives creators the tools to build their own economies with each of these components. But like any good startup, creators should smart small and iterate.\n\nOut of all the ways crypto can help creators, I think *focusing on crypto as a monetization tool is the best place to start* for a few reasons:\n\n*   **Focusing on monetization empowers creators to produce on-chain goods.** Goods and services are the core engine for productive economies because it creates resources to reinvest in growth.

These could include access to an online community, governance rights on how the funds should be allocated, royalties on the assets generated from the crowdfund, or maybe even a cool badge you can display in your crypto wallet or virtual merchandise you can wear in a video game.\n\nThe main takeaway is that cryptonetworks provide a new era of *programmable ownership* which can be used as a tool for better incentive alignment around capital formation.\n\n***Economic graphs***\n\nWeb 1.0 was about information links (web pages). Web 2.0 was about social links (likes, follows, shares). Web 3.0 is about economic links (tokens you earn, investments you make, assets you own). ([source](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1373809410485719045)) One of the coolest products that I think will emerge is a “crypto-native [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) for creators”. For example, if you go to [Instacart’s page on Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/instacart), you can see their total funding amount, the number of investors, who the investors are, how much they’ve allocated, and a bunch of other information.\n\nWith crypto-native crowdfunding, we could see something similar emerge for any creative project. As the next generation of social products get built on crypto rails, I believe creators will use some sort of decentralized crowdfunding to finance their projects. If so, you could see the entire cap table for the next [Mr. Beast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA) or [Cardi B](https://www.instagram.com/iamcardib/) and build products around those economic graphs.\n\nYet, decentralized crowdfunding comes with risks since there’s no centralized party to regulate. To limit the risk of scams, I think we could develop something like an on-chain KYC process. To contribute to a crowdfund, you would need to submit your public key and be limited to contributing only a certain percentage of your net worth.\n\nTo raise funds, you would start off with a low funding cap (say $10k) and be required to build credibility within the system through certain metrics before being able to raise larger amounts.\n\nSo far, we’ve covered how crypto can help creators with monetization, engagement, and financing. Now let's take a look at how crypto can help with acquiring new community members.\n\n## Drive acquisition through token rewards\n\nTo drive customer acquisition, DeFi protocols employ a tactic known as \"[liquidity mining](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641)\". This is just a fancy way of saying “rewards program”. But, instead of providing cash incentives, protocols incentivize customers with their protocol token.\n\nFor creators, I prefer calling this a \"token rewards\" program since it's a bit more intuitive. Token rewards are so powerful that an entirely [new field of study](https://ce.mit.edu/) called cryptoeconomics was developed to understand it better.\n\nOne kinda scary definition of cryptoeconomics is: \"programming human behavior through the careful design of incentives.\" ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCFlGLbI_kE))\n\nThis is powerful stuff. In web2, we've seen what types of shitshows can happen online when incentives aren't crafted carefully. It’s important to educate ourselves on the mechanics of incentive design so we can consciously create new systems that reward positive sum behavior.\n\nHere's one framework that can help creators think through designing a token rewards program:\n\n1.  **Identify your community’s goal.** Is it to develop deeper social connections? Improve at a skill? Find a better job? Make money?\n2.  **Choose a reward mechanism.** In cryptonetworks, this is usually a programmable token.\n3.  **Choose a positive sum reward that benefits the network.** This can include votes in decentralized governance. Access to exclusive experiences. Or even financial rewards.\n\n*Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCFlGLbI_kE*\n\n(If you’d like to go deeper on this subject, check out [Token Engineering 101](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/library-te-101/)).\n\nCrypto gives us powerful tools for human coordination.

Over the past decade, it has evolved from a cute little science experiment, to something that might actually be kinda important.

That will serve as the foundation for a sustainable career as a creator. Then, slowly start experimenting with all this crazy crypto stuff. At a high-level, crypto can help creators with financing, acquisition, engagement, and monetization.\n\nOn a tactical level, one option is to start by generating on-chain cash flows through NFTs. Creators can experiment with 1 of 1 NFTs, fractionalization, and limited release drops with tiered rewards. Another option is to create a system of community-driven governance to help improve engagement and retention. Creators can also try to crowdfund for a creative project and give contributors programmable ownership. Creators can even design a token rewards program for incentivizing positive sum behavior within their community.\n\nWhether you've been in crypto for a decade or just downloaded Metamask last week, we're all still trying to figure this stuff out.

Kinda like how tech products rely on AI to remain competitive today.\n\nBut we’re still really damn early. So, what is crypto actually good for, *right now?* In this post, we'll cover a framework I share with creators on how to think about the crypto landscape.\n\nBy the way, when I say \"creators\", I'm referring to “[anyone doing non-commoditized work supported by digital platforms](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1350863079425376258)”. This includes writers, social media influencers, digital artists, musicians, podcasters, and online teachers, among others.\n\nAlright, now let's take a look at some tips for creators looking to experiment with crypto.\n\n## Tip #1: First, focus on creator market fit\n\nCreators are their own mini startups. They're responsible for focusing on a niche, understanding what customers want, creating something that people love, and finding sustainable ways to grow.\n\nIn startups, the concept “product market fit” is widely regarded as [the key](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html) to sustainable growth. Product market fit creates a positive feedback loop between happy customers, new customers, and profits.\n\nThe equivalent to product market fit for creators is [creator market fit](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1376393732610785283).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/931d23e6-1795-41c4-baf5-20b4d17de8d9.jpeg?height=1108&width=1972)\n\nBefore focusing on growth, creators should prioritize finding creator market fit because it will serve as the foundation for a sustainable career. Once a creator gets to creator market fit, then it may make sense to start experimenting with crypto to accelerate grow.\n\nCrypto is a powerful tool for growth. Crypto is *NOT* a replacement for creator market fit.\n\n## Tip #2: Start off using crypto as a monetization tool\n\nOnce a creator feels like they have creator market fit, it's time to think about how they can use crypto to build a sustainable business.\n\nCrypto can help creators in four main areas:\n\n*   **Financing**: \"Help me raise money for projects.\"\n*   **Acquisition**: \"Help me get more community members.\"\n*   **Engagement:** \"Help my existing community members get more involved.\"\n*   **Monetization:** \"Help me make money.\"\n\nSo, as a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed creator ready to jump down the crypto rabbit hole, where do you start? Well, crypto isn't like signing up for a new SaaS product. Instead, crypto is more like building a mini economy.\n\nEconomies have currencies, laws, governance, goods and services, markets, citizens, etc.\n\nCrypto gives creators the tools to build their own economies with each of these components. But like any good startup, creators should smart small and iterate.\n\nOut of all the ways crypto can help creators, I think *focusing on crypto as a monetization tool is the best place to start* for a few reasons:\n\n*   **Focusing on monetization empowers creators to produce on-chain goods.** Goods and services are the core engine for productive economies because it creates resources to reinvest in growth. One issue I see with many creator tokens is that they launch a token but don't produce any on-chain goods. Most of their revenue is off-chain so that’s where their focus ends up.\n*   **On-chain goods convince community members to download a crypto wallet, buy ETH, and pay the creator on-chain.** Convincing community members to download a crypto wallet and buy ETH is one of the biggest barriers for creators experimenting with crypto. I think it's much easier to persuade your community to go through the mindfvck of learning crypto if they're able to buy a cool NFT at the end.\n*   **On-chain cash flow provides a solid foundation for other experiments.** As you sell more digital goods, you begin to accrue an on-chain treasury. This treasury can then be used to fund experiments like a decentralized investment fund, rewards programs for token holders, collaborations with other crypto-native creators, etc. These experiments then create a positive feedback loop which makes the treasury more valuable and provides more resources for future projects.\n\n[](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1376966491816476674)\n\nAdditionally, creators can view crypto-native monetization as just one part of their product portfolio.\n\nWeb2 is great at monetizing artificial scarcity through paywalls for stuff like content, courses, and communities. Web2 is also great at monetizing attention through ads. But as we’ve seen, ad platforms heavily favor large creators and optimize for certain engagement metrics that aren’t always in the best interest of people consuming the content. Sponsorships are another option but they may require a large audience and a bunch of boring administrative work.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ec3efa3-9281-4312-b919-a295c1f22eaa\\_1440x1080.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ec3efa3-9281-4312-b919-a295c1f22eaa\\_1440x1080.jpeg)\n\nNFTs provide a new monetization channel for creators that complements existing channels. Instead of monetizing access or attention, NFTs monetize *ownership*.\n\nThrough math, computer science, and cryptography, digital goods that live on a blockchain can have a single owner. That’s basically what NFTs are. Digital goods that live on a blockchain and have an owner. The wider implication is that [NFTs make the internet ownable](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo). As a result, superfans are willing to buy NFTs from their favorite creators because for the first time in history, they can truly *own* a digital good. It’s like having a Nike shoe in your closet. As long as you buy it legally, Nike can’t bust down your door and take the shoe. It’s yours. Similarly, NFTs now provide a digitally-native form of property rights.\n\nAs scalability solutions reduce transaction fees and more infrastructure is built out, I believe NFTs will evolve to provide many other benefits beyond just ownership.\n\nEventually, creators will come up with crypto-native business models like [programmable subscriptions](https://medium.com/superfluid-blog/the-dawn-of-programmable-cashflows-2d50edae05cb), [prediction markets](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1309078385369460741?lang=en), [token reward programs](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641), investing in other creators, etc.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few ways creators can monetize with NFTs today.\n\n***1 of 1 NFTs***\n\nFor this model to work, you need just one true fan. But that leads to the main downside of this model. There’s only one owner. As a result, it's hard to create a community around these NFTs because only one person owns it. This model also prices out consumers who aren't willing to yolo their entire life savings on an NFT.\n\n***Limited supply NFT drops w/ collector rewards***\n\nThis model is still very underexplored. I think 3LAU is the [best example](https://nft.3lau.com/#/auction) of doing it right. With this model, you release a few NFTs and offer rewards to anybody that bids. This creates more of a community since multiple people can get involved while also retaining some scarcity. I think this model works best when releasing a large creative project like an album, a book, film, etc. because it can be made into an extravagant digital experience with a positive feedback loop between the value of the project and the NFTs.\n\n***Fractionalized NFTs***\n\nI think this will become the dominant model at some point. There are many variations but the general idea is to take one NFT and allow people to buy fungible tokens that represent the NFT. Token holders can speculate on the value of the NFT by trading their tokens or they can hold onto the NFT for access to exclusive rewards or just to flex. The main benefit is that this model enables many people to own a piece of your NFT. This can sow the seeds for a well-incentivized community. The design space here is pretty wide so I'm sure we'll see all sorts of experimentation in the coming months.\n\nWe're still in the early days but it's worth taking the time to experiment with different monetization models yourself to understand which is right for the type of community you want to build.\n\nOnce you've started generating on-chain cash flow through NFTs, the next step is community governance.\n\n## Increase community engagement and retention through decentralized governance\n\nDecentralized governance is another killer feature of cryptonetworks. Today, the relationship between creators and their communities is mostly one-way. The creator publishes content and their community consumes it. Maybe there are some chat groups but that‘s about it.\n\nI believe cryptonetworks will usher in a new era of *co-creation*. Creators will involve their communities in key decisions like how to allocate funds, who to onboard, what types of projects they should work on, etc. This type of co-creation increases community and retention which can lead to stronger communities over the long-term.\n\nHere's a few ways creators can involve their community in key decisions today.\n\n***Community-driven capital allocation***\n\nOnce a creator starts generating on-chain revenue, they can redistribute funds with the help of their community. One option is to create an investment fund where community members earn tokens which they use to vote on which digital assets the fund should purchase. Digital assets could include NFTs, [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) moments, plots of land in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), or tokens for a DeFi protocol. One example of a decentralized investment fund is [FlamingoDAO](https://docs.flamingodao.xyz/). [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa), has a [great blog post](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/A16NP2XXi9RdHptfdF9WHR0Xq_E1XDmUgMwPmJYOG7w) explaining the potential of these decentralized investment funds.\n\nAnother option is to create a grant program where community members decide projects to fund based on their potential impact on the community. DeFi protocols like Uniswap, AAVE, and Compound all have community-driven grant programs for projects improving their core protocol.\n\nLastly, communities could also vote on what percentage of the treasury should go to community members. For example, $UNI holders get to vote on whether to turn on the 0.05% [protocol fee switch](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-flip-the-protocol-fee-switch-for-uniswap-dev-team-and-uni-holders/4777).\n\n***Democratically add new community members***\n\nOnboarding new members to a community usually goes one of two ways. On one hand, there's an opaque process where a few people decide who gets allowed in. On the other hand, it's an open access community which can lead to trolls and fvck up the vibez.\n\nWith decentralized governance, the community can self-regulate by collectively deciding who gets onboarded.\n\nFor example, at Mirror, we onboard ten new members each week using a community-driven process called [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race). Existing Mirror writers start with 1,000 votes and prospective members start with 10 votes. Everyone has two hours to cast their votes and the top ten people each week are airdropped a $WRITE token which they can burn to get access to Mirror.\n\nGranted, there's still a lot we could do to improve (eg give people a chance to write a short prompt on what they would use Mirror for, experiment with quadratic voting to disincentivize large votes for one person, give prospective members ways to earn more votes, turn the voting system into a prediction market to incentivize voting for people that add the most value to the Mirror protocol, create a DAO to set the voting parameters, etc.)\n\nRegardless, $WRITE Race has turned onboarding from a centralized / permissioned process to a community-driven process.\n\nAs more tools get built for decentralized governance, I think it will become the default way communities make decisions online.\n\n## Capitalize projects through crowdfunding\n\nCrowdfunding today is limited. You either need to live in a certain jurisdiction or be an accredited investor. I believe these limitations are good-natured and agree that we need guardrails to protect consumers from scam artists.\n\nYet, I also believe these limitations are preventing many talented people from gaining access to capital they could use to build something great. There needs to be some sort of middle ground. Here are a few reasons why I think creators should consider using crypto to finance creative projects.\n\n***Global and permissionless access***\n\nTo contribute to a crypto-native crowdfund, all you need is an Ethereum address. No jurisdictional requirements. No minimum net worth requirements. Just a computer, an internet connection, and a crypto wallet with some ETH or ERC20 tokens.\n\n***Programmable ownership***\n\nWith a crowdfund on Kickstarter or GoFundMe, you mostly just receive a warm fuzzy feeling that you contributed to something meaningful. Granted, that’s super important! Unfortunately, many people would rather spend their funds on other assets that generate some sort of return. Whether that be financial or pro-social.\n\nWith crowdfunds on Ethereum, instead of just receiving a warm fuzzy feeling or a bumper sticker, contributors can receive an ERC20 token. This token can then be programmed to include all sorts of benefits. These could include access to an online community, governance rights on how the funds should be allocated, royalties on the assets generated from the crowdfund, or maybe even a cool badge you can display in your crypto wallet or virtual merchandise you can wear in a video game.\n\nThe main takeaway is that cryptonetworks provide a new era of *programmable ownership* which can be used as a tool for better incentive alignment around capital formation.\n\n***Economic graphs***\n\nWeb 1.0 was about information links (web pages).
