It was a terrific session and I had more “ahas” in those three hours than I have had in many many months. There really is no substitute for sitting together with your colleagues working things out face to face.\n\nThis week our team met with a founder in Singapore via Zoom. It was midnight in Singapore and noon in NYC. In one hour we learned enough from the founder to be able to make a decision on whether or not to invest in the founder’s company.\n\nIn the last year, events like the latter one have been commonplace. Events like the former have been non-existent. And there are many in the tech sector and broader business sector (and other sectors too) that have come to believe that on-screen interactions will be the primary way we engage going forward.\n\nFor certain things, like raising capital and investing capital, on-screen works pretty well. Founders have figured out that they can raise capital from their kitchens, bedrooms, and offices in weeks vs roadshows that lasted months. I don’t think we will see founders going back on the road in any material way ever again. And founders in Singapore can access capital markets in NYC with ease. And investors in NYC can access investments in Singapore with ease. These are all important and disruptive changes to the startup, tech, and business sectors.\n\nBut in the last month, as I have been going into the USV offices most days, I have come to realize what we have been missing with the on-screen work model vs the in-person work model. Many things are more efficient on-screen but some things are way better in-person.\n\nUnderstanding which is which and then figuring out how to continue to do the in-person things will be critical to leaders and teams navigating the new normal.\n\nI got an email from a founder/CEO about six months ago saying that his company was going back to the office completely when the pandemic was over. I had not heard many CEOs taking that strong of a stance at that time. Since then, I have heard the same from a number of our portfolio company leaders. They are in the minority but they are not non-existent. When we survey our portfolio we find that about 20-25% will go back to full-time in the office work, another 20-25% have gone entirely remote, and the balance will try to figure out a hybrid model that makes sense for their company.\n\nAt USV, where we have landed for now, and maybe forever, is a bias to be in the office, particularly on the days we meet in person, but we are also way more open to on-screen work and we have an expectation that some team members will choose to work on-screen for multiple days a week, possibly the majority of days a week. We see that working parents benefit from the flexibility that on-screen work allows and younger team members benefit from the socialization and camaraderie that an office provides. We also see that those who commute long distances benefit significantly from being able to reduce the commuting load by working on-screen multiple days a week.\n\nOur business has a natural rhythm of two days a week when we meet as a team; Monday and Thursdays. So those tend to be the days that team members try to be in the office and those are the days we do things like cater in lunch and maybe go out after work together. That allows us to retain the team dynamic and culture while being more open to on-screen work going forward.\n\nWe definitely have not figured this all out, but we are starting to see some patterns and some benefits of both work modes, and we are trying to navigate to a good middle ground.\n\nEach company needs to figure this out in a way that works for their team and culture and I believe that there is no “right way” for everyone. But I also believe that in-person interactions remain critical to making better decisions, better products, better cultures, and better companies and so I would encourage everyone, including the fully remote teams, to figure out how to make in-person interactions happen on some regular cadence.\n", "timestamp": 1620743771, "digest": "a7-UBSTDvtz0qOAkzdmjSwPHfnTVXJb3sGvxQ9sPjJw", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

While Shakti was idealistic, he had a practical and empathetic way of working with people. Young people don’t want to disappoint their parents or alienate their friends.

He lead [ETHIndia](https://twitter.com/ETHIndiaco), which helped many young builders, including the founders of [Instadapp](https://defi.instadapp.io/).\n\nThere are many talented, energetic builders who languish in the Indian system. A particular culture around parenting, schooling, and marriage can sometimes restrain free thinking, entrepreneurial energy. This is definitely changing in some parts of India. But Shakti deeply cared about people in parts of India where this culture hasn’t changed.\n\nCan’t you just say FU and pursue whatever you want? No, you can’t. While Shakti was idealistic, he had a practical and empathetic way of working with people. Young people don’t want to disappoint their parents or alienate their friends. Shakti worked with many young people to help them pursue their dreams while still empathizing with some of the restrictions they might have.\n\nI admire his honesty and generosity. He gave time and attention to many young people before anyone else validated them.\n\nThanks Shakti.

I studied Finance but after a few internships, I realized I wasn’t meant to be in a cheap suit from JCPenny cranking out discounted cash flow models until midnight. At the time, a friend of mine had just finished a coding bootcamp and suggested I try learning to code.\n\nIt was my senior year so like any rational person, I decided to stop going to class so I could code all day (sorry mom). Over the next few months I picked up web development, built full-stack apps, and did so many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that you’d think it was a form of capital punishment. \n\nOnce I graduated, I bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco and stayed on a cozy air mattress in my friend’s living room. Over the next few months, I did some contract work for my friends at [Career Karma](http://careerkarma.com/) and eventually landed a job as a software engineer on the growth team at [Instacart](instacart.com).\n\nA little over a year later, I was looking to work at an early stage startup so I got in touch with a [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) startup called [Dharma](http://dharma.io/). I had no clue what DeFi was but it was using this crypto thing I vaguely remembered hearing about a while back. After speaking with the team about their vision for a decentralized bank, I was red pilled.\n\nI joined the team but started having imposter syndrome in my first meeting. They talked about counterfactuals, meta transactions, proxy contracts, on-chain this and off-chain that. After the meeting, I had a mini dictionary worth of terms to look up on Wikipedia that night. Then we got to lunch and the entire team passionately debated token economics, incentive structures, governance mechanisms, and all this other stuff I had no clue about. I quickly realized this crypto thing wasn’t just slightly different than existing systems. It was completely different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about crypto is that it’s not just a technology. It’s a philosophy. It’s a belief system. It’s a way of viewing the world. It’s about questioning conventional systems and not caring if everyone else thinks you’re batshit crazy.\n\nOver the next few months, I learned more about cryptonetworks and how they worked under the hood. I remember the “aha moment” when I wrote my first smart contract. With just a few lines of code and a private key, I was able to transfer an internet-native currency anywhere in the world in seconds. \n\nI didn’t have to sign up for Stripe. I didn’t have to use the Plaid API to connect a bank account. I didn’t have to check if TransferWise supported payments for a specific country. There was no centralized party. Just a peer-to-peer cryptonetwork called Ethereum. It was pretty damn mindblowing.\n\nAfter the first few weeks at Dharma, I was confident that DeFi and crypto were the future. But I also got the itch to work on some of my own ideas. I wanted to build software for creative people. Writers. Artists. Musicians. Online teachers. I strongly believe our world depends on these types of people having the tools they need to serve their communities as best they can.\n\nFrankly, I also thought it would take a couple years before the crypto industry had the infrastructure in place for a mainstream consumer app to be built.\n\n\nSo I ended up leaving Dharma to take some time off and explore a few startup ideas. But a couple months ago I read a [manifesto](https://cryptomedia.wtf/) by [Zora](https://zora.co/) that changed how I thought about crypto.\n\nIt described a world where crypto could be used to give any digital media file (eg an image, a song, an essay, digital art, etc.) property rights. It explained how cryptonetworks could turn digital media into liquid financial assets, secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.\n\nAlthough the individual ideas weren’t new, they were combined and articulated in a way that just made sense. And not just to me.\n\n[Digital artists](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9), [athletes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html), [social media influencers](https://cryptoslate.com/logan-paul-nfts-sell-3-5-million-worth-on-first-day-of-release/), [tech executives](https://scottbelsky.medium.com/the-furry-lisa-cryptoart-the-new-economy-of-digital-creativity-6cb2300ea081), [media executives](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI), and [journalists](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1366554892035219462) that never took the crypto weirdos seriously, seem to be taking notice.\n\nBut let’s be real. Is this latest NFT craze a bubble? Probz. Yet, is there at least a kernel of value in the idea of ownership over creative work? I think so.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell, there’s been a lot of talk about high transaction fees and lack of scalability in these systems. Although I do think these problems should and will get fixed, a lack of technical scalability is kinda the point.\n\nCryptonetworks trade off technical scalability for social scalability.\n\nFacebook is technically scalable because it’s a social network that processes millions of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is socially scalable because it’s a trillion dollar economic network without a centralized authority.\n\nCrypto isn’t just a technological revolution. It’s also a revolution in capital formation and human coordination. How creative projects are funded. How groups of people are incentivized. How organizations are structured.\n\nYears from now, when I’m old and senile, I believe we’ll look back at this period as an [Internet Renaissance](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1343210395704541189) of sorts. \n\nA time where we dared to fight back against systems that have been designed for centuries to elevate certain groups and keep others disenfranchised.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe all this crypto stuff really is just an intellectual ideal that’ll never work in practice. Regardless, I think it’s at least worth trying.", "timestamp": 1620786285, "digest": "pl07RMWdJZktHUAn8hZ02YlO35-Ju49orPrhaRnn4Vo", "contributor": "0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c"}

We now have curation without collection. Curators can create unique contexts and spaces to auction NFTs on behalf of creators and collectors instead of having to front the capital to buy and then resell. \n\nSimilarly for creators and collectors, they do not need to sell their NFT and forego ownership to a curator for them to benefit from the curation—simply share in the profit from a successful auction or get the NFT back if it doesn't sell.\n\nCurators now have a crypto native business model that is beneficial to both themselves and owner of the NFT. This unlocks entirely new models for editors, publishers, record labels, galleries studios, blogs or any experience that aims to contextualize the world we live in.\n\nWe should also start to see a 100x more options for creators and collectors to list their NFTs, and start listing in spaces outside of the platforms originally minted on.

A curator can:\n\n- Approve and deny proposals for an NFT to be listed with them.\n- Earn a fee for their curation\n- Cancel an auction prior to bidding being commenced\n\nCreators and collectors can submit a proposal to list their NFTs with a curator onchain, which the curator must accept (or optionally reject). This creates an onchain record of a curators activity and value creation. Curators build a public reputation for the value they’re creating for creators and collectors.\n\n**The auction house is the ***curation primitive***.**\n\n> Curation is creation.\n\nCurators can now create and capture value from curation without needing to directly collect NFTs. We now have curation without collection. Curators can create unique contexts and spaces to auction NFTs on behalf of creators and collectors instead of having to front the capital to buy and then resell. \n\nSimilarly for creators and collectors, they do not need to sell their NFT and forego ownership to a curator for them to benefit from the curation—simply share in the profit from a successful auction or get the NFT back if it doesn't sell.\n\nCurators now have a crypto native business model that is beneficial to both themselves and owner of the NFT.

Still in its infancy, the NFT ecosystem is mostly dominated by a small number of closed marketplaces—crypto middlemen and web3 gatekeepers that have launched closed-source systems on public blockchains. \n\n**The state of current marketplaces:**\n- Closed source\n- Unverified on Etherscan \n- Permissioned access \n- Super admin permissions\n- Opaque\n- Limited developer access\n- Restricted to platform NFTs\n\nThe Zora ethos is to create public goods that are either owned by the community or owned by no one. \n\nToday we are announcing the launch of **Auction House**. Auction House is an open and permissionless protocol on Ethereum that allows any creator, community, platform or DAO to create and run their own curated NFT auction houses. We have deployed the Auction House on mainnet without admin functionality, and it is therefore entirely permissionless and unstoppable—this auction house is free of gatekeepers, middlemen or corporate control. It is owned by no one. \n\nSoon, it will be owned by the community.\n\nCreators and collectors on [Zora](https://zora.co) can now list the NFTs for timed reserve auctions for primary and secondary sales. Simply add a reserve price on your NFT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/502cd4df-3f5c-44b0-9bce-265c4f89bcf1.gif?height=453&width=500)\n\nDevelopers and technologists can use the latest release of [ZoraOS](https://ourzora.gitbook.io/zoraos/dev/zdk) to create their own unique and independent auction houses, platforms and experiences that are open in nature.\n\n**The Auction House has unparalleled features:**\n- Run auctions in ETH or any ERC20 token \n- Run auctions on any ERC721 (SDK only)\n- Recognize creator resale royalties and sell on share\n- Introduced a role and value model for curators (more on this below)\n- 0% protocol fees\n- Permissionless and public\n- Usable for primary and secondary auctions.\n- SDK and Developer tools\n\n### Curators\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f4732545-7ed5-4293-a03a-95ee41557680.png?height=1370&width=1920)\n\nIn a metaverse of millions of NFTs, the act of curation is critical. Curators create and facilitate context and community which augment the value of NFTs that they select. The act of curation creates value for the NFT by contextualizing it and signalling its importance to a particular community.

From the very beginning...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/479bfef1-af23-4db7-b564-1e4a52d0d12d.png?height=785&width=1444)\n\nSongcamp’s Genesis Batch → [*Antid0t3*](https://beta.catalog.works/rainbowpunch/antid0t3) by Rainbow Punch, [*Hold On Hope*](https://beta.catalog.works/driftwoodtx/hold-on-hope) by Driftwood TX, [*Static Twist*](https://beta.catalog.works/thelunarveil/static-twist) by The Lunar Viel\n\n# Week -1\n\nIt all started five weeks earlier, on the evening of Friday March 26th. \n\nThat night, I did something I like to do about once or twice a week: I smoked a little weed. \n\nThat, with the ideas swirling about in my head, led me to spinning up a little Discord server called “SONGCAMP”. I had no idea what it was about, save for the opening line that I threw up on the first channel:\n\n***This is a place for music and the new internet to crash into each other.*** \n\nI sent off an invite to ~10 people. \n\nThe next day — in my clearer state of sobriety — I kicked myself for throwing an idea out into the world without much of it figured out at all. \n\nNevertheless, three days later Songcamp had its first call.   \n\nFour people showed up. One of them being my brother. \n\nWe spoke of music and web3 and it was fun and insightful. But no real plan came to light. I thought maybe this Discord server was a bit premature, and I considered cancelling the scheduled recurring call the following Monday. \n\n# Week 0\n\nSeed Club had just announced its upcoming Creator x Crypto Summit, and with it a set of [3 sponsorship NFTs](https://club.mirror.xyz/2jcmMIQ93KbFWvZ3xVvbcfD90qLhKBiqs8T3GMIOaQ0). Each NFT represented one of the 3 days of the event. Purchasing one of them meant you were *unlocking* the content for everyone else to enjoy for free. \n\nThe idea really resonated with me, and opened up an opportunity to show in a very tangible way my interest and support in what Seed Club is building. \n\nI decided to bid on the sponsorship NFT for Day 3. And I [won](https://zora.co/club/2436). \n\nShortly after, I had a call with Jess Sloss at Seed Club to talk about how we could bring value to my NFT collection. And that’s when I shared with him some of my loose ideas around Songcamp, and how I was thinking about what it could look like to run a songwriting camp in web3 land. \n\nHe loved it, and we decided to use my Day 3 sponsorship to talk about Songcamp during the summit. \n\nMonday April 5th came around, and we had our next discord call. \n\nThis time more people showed up. The ideas presented at the Creator x Crypto summit really resonated with people, and a bunch jumped into the Songcamp [discord](http://songcamp.band) to learn more about what we were doing. \n\nI figured the best way to find out what it meant for music and web3 to crash into each other was to simply jump into an experiment head first. \n\nSo on that call, I put the call to action out there: **we would run a 2-week songwriting camp that doesn’t end when the music is written, but extends out into the visual artwork and rollout of said music. We would use web3 tools to explore what it means to realize the value of that art in a more direct way.**\n\nI created a submission form. 26 people responded. \n\n# Week 1\n\nThat following week, on Monday April 12, the first Songcamp kicked off. \n\n9 musicians, 2 visual artists, and 2 project operatives were chosen to participate in this first go. \n\nThe musicians were split into 3 teams of 3, and given one instruction: *go make something together*.\n\nThe visual team was given two distinct tasks: The main one was to create the 3 cover artworks for the resulting songs. But of course, at the start of the camp they had no music to go off of just yet. So to start, the visual team was tasked with creating a piece for what we called [*The Unlock*](https://zora.co/songcamp/2863) NFT. \n\nPulling from Seed Club’s sponsorship NFTs which *unlocked* the summit’s content for everyone, we created *The Unlock* NFT to do just the same — fund Songcamp’s eventual distribution costs and thus unlock the camp for all involved. \n\n# Week 2\n\nHalfway through the camp, on Monday April 19, we minted *The Unlock* NFT on Zora. \n\nIn an act of poetic beauty, Seed Club swooped in with 20 minutes left in the auction and won the NFT. We now had the funds necessary to release this music with a web3 rollout. \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2863)\n\nThe musicians and visual artists were well on their way to creating their final artwork, and things were moving along swimmingly. \n\nMeanwhile, the project operatives were busy figuring out how to release this music. Early on, the team at [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/) showed interest in supporting the release by allowing Songcamp into their beta platform to mint the 3 songs as NFTs. We loved the idea of minting 1/1 canonical records via the project that is building *the* music-first NFT platform. \n\nNext up was figuring out how to build an event around the release, and make it matter. \n\n# Week 3\n\nOn Monday April 26, the 2-week camp came to a close. All teams delivered their final masters + cover artwork. And incredibly, *everything was insanely fire*! All three songs were magical, and the cover artwork imbued that magic through and through. We were all blown away. \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3028)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3029)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3030)\n\n\n\n\nAfter our in-camp listening party, we switched gears into release mode. We knew we were releasing the songs via Catalog NFTs. But the when and how kept changing. \n\nAt first we thought of running a week-long auction via Catalog’s order book bidding. But then we got talking to Mirror’s team, and they got us real excited at the prospect of using their [Splits](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw) tool to instantaneously split the proceeds of each NFT between all recipients. \n\nThe problem: No Catalog NFTs had yet to be auctioned off via Mirror, and thus Mirror did not yet support Catalog’s metadata.\n\nLuckily, both teams were super down to interoperate to bring this project to life. Mirror created the necessary functionality so that the cover artwork and audio player would populate on their interface. Furthermore, Catalog blocked bidding on their site for the NFTs, signalling that the auctions were taking place on Mirror.\n\nAll this within the space of a few days, so we could get the auctions up and running the following Monday. \n\nIt was amazing to witness the Catalog and Mirror teams enthusiastically go out of their way to support the specified needs for our first release. They demonstrated what it is like when platforms are truly being built to serve the artists who use them.\n\n# Week 4\n\nOn Monday May 3, the three songs were [minted as 1/1 NFTs](https://beta.catalog.works/songcamp) on Catalog and [put up for auction](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM) on Mirror. \n\nWe had a pre-auction Discord call one hour prior to the auctions going live. At exactly 5pm, while still on the call together, we pushed the three auctions live. \n\n**Before the clock could strike 5:01pm, all 3 NFTs’ reserve bids were met.** \n\nThe discord call went ballistic. Everyone was ecstatic, and could not believe the immediate success the release was having. With many of the camp’s participants never having sold an NFT before, this was a powerful moment in experientially tasting an entirely new avenue for realizing the value of their work. The energy on that call at that moment was exhilarating. And all 3 bidders, who were also on the call at that time, were able to witness in real time the huge impact they were having. \n\nOn Tuesday May 4, the 24-hour auctions came to a close. In the final hour, bidding activity really picked up and brought the value exponentially higher than we would have ever anticipated. It was truly a thrill to not only watch the bids go up, but to also see each participant’s share of those amounts rise in real time via Mirror’s Splits block. \n \nThe 3 NFTs ended up selling for a cumulative amount of 10.05 ETH (equivalent to ~$34,000 USD that day). \n\nhttps://twitter.com/songcampdotband/status/1389693376841277444\n\nAll funds were automatically split between those involved on each song. All recipients were able to claim their share and transfer it to their own wallet directly after the auctions closed. \n\nThese results, as you can imagine, were not what we expected. Not only did the 3 NFTs go for an amount of ETH far beyond our expectations, but there was also this newfound power in receiving those funds directly and instantaneously.\n\nCatalog, Mirror, and the underlying Zora protocol did not take any fees whatsoever. **So 100% of the auctions’ proceeds went directly to those involved in the project. And those funds were made available right away.**\n\nMusicians often grow used to a world where we wait months or even years to receive any sort of revenue from our work, if at all. Here, we experienced a project that in the span of a few weeks went from nothing, to 3 songs and artwork created from scratch, to over $30,000 in value. \n\n# Week 5 and Onward\n\nThis brings us to present day. We’ve had a week to relax and take in what just went down. And we are beginning to think about the road ahead. We want to keep these experiments going, and push into deeper waters at this new frontier. \n\nThis first experiment is in no way the end all be all answer for the future of music. We still have much to learn as far as how these new technologies will be used by people in the future. But we do feel confident that they will *do* hold a ton of untapped value for artists to discover. And we are set on uncovering those hidden paths and bringing them to light. \n\nThis is just the beginning. We collectively funded, created and distributed art. And we will continue to do so, in even more expansive ways. \n\nMore to come on that topic. But for now.. \n\n### Here are a few first-person testimonies from some of the participants of Songcamp Genesis:\n\n### Gavin Slate — Songwriter, Producer (Driftwood TX)\n> I was blown away by the whole process of Songcamp. I’ve done many song camps over the years as a writer/producer and they always have a vibe and are a great way to create, this however was one of a kind. It was incredible to see how quickly this all came together with 13 strangers on the internet. Most of the other camps it would take well over a year for any action to even happen with the songs themselves. I think this whole process shows such promise for the music industry as creatives no longer have to wait years to earn revenue from their works (we were paid out 3 hours after the auction ended). This web3 experiment opened my eyes to the continued possibilities of how this can create more efficient, more productive and a more creative focused music industry. Songcamp sorta feels like we’re music mad scientists, but in a good way.\n\n\n### MAi — Artist, Producer, Engineer (Rainbow Punch) \n> MAi experience with song camp was a pleasure, a treasure, and defiant of the weather. Tbh I don’t have many opinions other than this was a successful experiment with talented artists trying to break free from the industry we are a part of.  From the first meeting, it felt like a very fun and exciting experience. The time constraint added a cool pressure to throw ideas out quickly and not judge the flow. And having a visual and marketing team all to go along with the process let off a lot of pressure and added another level of trust and companionship to the game.  I guess ‘game’ is a word that resonates with me in this case.  It felt like a game.  And we all won.  The potential of this is grand and this first go gives me a lot of foresight as to where this could go; when more people understand this and can easily participate , I could see it being an ‘experience’/‘game’ that every artist/creator desires to be a part of.  Idk if that helps, I’m just typing words.  This gave power back to the art itself and as a creator thats the most exciting part.\n\n### Hvdson — Producer (The Lunar Veil)\n> The intersection of web3 and music is right here! For the longest time I was looking for a community that had both of these qualities and thankfully I found songcamp. I always had trouble working within the confines of the traditional music industry complex, but with this experiment, it was the first time I could relax all those predefined notions of what being a “musician” was and just do what was important - make music.\n\n### Samsonite — Producer (The Lunar Veil)\n> Wonderful to discover and hone in on a shared invisible thread between strangers. Collectively expound on that in ways beyond our imagination. And do it trustlessly with new web3 tooling where everything is fully transparent. Fuck yes.\n\n### Thys — Producer (The Lunar Veil)\n> Two things learned: 1. Strangers don’t bite. You have some things in common with everybody. 2. The way to find out what doesn’t work is to do it anyway, get in touch with people building the technology and tell them what changes you need. It was amazing to see how Catalog (Zora) and Mirror came together and built new functionality for this project, that can now be used by everybody!\n\n### Peace Node — Visual Artist (Clearest Deep Balloon)\n> Round one of songcamp in the visual team included moodboarding & focusing in on the necessary communication points of the artwork. Workshopping back and forth for individual elements and logo marks. That includes photography, illustration, and type. The moodboarding eliminated unnecessary back and forth and helped streamline our process to the end goal. Fastest work I completed happened when zooming in on assets rather than composing an entire image. Working like a ouji board and letting the group guide me over the visual language I was able to bring to the table.\n\n### Rowan Spencer — Songwriter, Producer (Driftwood TX)\n> What Hvdson said has to be said again: This is the intersection of web3 and music. Songcamp brings people from the world of music production / art / industry in direct contact with the community-first and change-driven energy of the world of web3. I thought I must have been particularly lucky to be paired with such positive and encouraging collaborators as Gavin and Kevin but, when it came time to share everyone’s experiences from Camp 1, it seemed everyone felt as lucky as I did. All credit to the energy of the web3 space and the unending energy of Matthew Chaim as well, without whom none of this would have happened.\n\n### Kevin Paris — Singer-Songwriter, Producer (Driftwood TX)\n> \"*The role of the artist is to make revolution irresistible*\" - Toni Cade Bambara.

From the very beginning...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/479bfef1-af23-4db7-b564-1e4a52d0d12d.png?height=785&width=1444)\n\nSongcamp’s Genesis Batch → [*Antid0t3*](https://beta.catalog.works/rainbowpunch/antid0t3) by Rainbow Punch, [*Hold On Hope*](https://beta.catalog.works/driftwoodtx/hold-on-hope) by Driftwood TX, [*Static Twist*](https://beta.catalog.works/thelunarveil/static-twist) by The Lunar Viel\n\n# Week -1\n\nIt all started five weeks earlier, on the evening of Friday March 26th. \n\nThat night, I did something I like to do about once or twice a week: I smoked a little weed. \n\nThat, with the ideas swirling about in my head, led me to spinning up a little Discord server called “SONGCAMP”. I had no idea what it was about, save for the opening line that I threw up on the first channel:\n\n***This is a place for music and the new internet to crash into each other.*** \n\nI sent off an invite to ~10 people. \n\nThe next day — in my clearer state of sobriety — I kicked myself for throwing an idea out into the world without much of it figured out at all. \n\nNevertheless, three days later Songcamp had its first call.   \n\nFour people showed up. One of them being my brother. \n\nWe spoke of music and web3 and it was fun and insightful. But no real plan came to light. I thought maybe this Discord server was a bit premature, and I considered cancelling the scheduled recurring call the following Monday. \n\n# Week 0\n\nSeed Club had just announced its upcoming Creator x Crypto Summit, and with it a set of [3 sponsorship NFTs](https://club.mirror.xyz/2jcmMIQ93KbFWvZ3xVvbcfD90qLhKBiqs8T3GMIOaQ0). Each NFT represented one of the 3 days of the event. Purchasing one of them meant you were *unlocking* the content for everyone else to enjoy for free. \n\nThe idea really resonated with me, and opened up an opportunity to show in a very tangible way my interest and support in what Seed Club is building. \n\nI decided to bid on the sponsorship NFT for Day 3. And I [won](https://zora.co/club/2436). \n\nShortly after, I had a call with Jess Sloss at Seed Club to talk about how we could bring value to my NFT collection. And that’s when I shared with him some of my loose ideas around Songcamp, and how I was thinking about what it could look like to run a songwriting camp in web3 land. \n\nHe loved it, and we decided to use my Day 3 sponsorship to talk about Songcamp during the summit. \n\nMonday April 5th came around, and we had our next discord call. \n\nThis time more people showed up. The ideas presented at the Creator x Crypto summit really resonated with people, and a bunch jumped into the Songcamp [discord](http://songcamp.band) to learn more about what we were doing. \n\nI figured the best way to find out what it meant for music and web3 to crash into each other was to simply jump into an experiment head first. \n\nSo on that call, I put the call to action out there: **we would run a 2-week songwriting camp that doesn’t end when the music is written, but extends out into the visual artwork and rollout of said music. We would use web3 tools to explore what it means to realize the value of that art in a more direct way.**\n\nI created a submission form. 26 people responded. \n\n# Week 1\n\nThat following week, on Monday April 12, the first Songcamp kicked off. \n\n9 musicians, 2 visual artists, and 2 project operatives were chosen to participate in this first go. \n\nThe musicians were split into 3 teams of 3, and given one instruction: *go make something together*.\n\nThe visual team was given two distinct tasks: The main one was to create the 3 cover artworks for the resulting songs. But of course, at the start of the camp they had no music to go off of just yet. So to start, the visual team was tasked with creating a piece for what we called [*The Unlock*](https://zora.co/songcamp/2863) NFT. \n\nPulling from Seed Club’s sponsorship NFTs which *unlocked* the summit’s content for everyone, we created *The Unlock* NFT to do just the same — fund Songcamp’s eventual distribution costs and thus unlock the camp for all involved. \n\n# Week 2\n\nHalfway through the camp, on Monday April 19, we minted *The Unlock* NFT on Zora. \n\nIn an act of poetic beauty, Seed Club swooped in with 20 minutes left in the auction and won the NFT. We now had the funds necessary to release this music with a web3 rollout. \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2863)\n\nThe musicians and visual artists were well on their way to creating their final artwork, and things were moving along swimmingly. \n\nMeanwhile, the project operatives were busy figuring out how to release this music. Early on, the team at [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/) showed interest in supporting the release by allowing Songcamp into their beta platform to mint the 3 songs as NFTs. We loved the idea of minting 1/1 canonical records via the project that is building *the* music-first NFT platform. \n\nNext up was figuring out how to build an event around the release, and make it matter. \n\n# Week 3\n\nOn Monday April 26, the 2-week camp came to a close. All teams delivered their final masters + cover artwork. And incredibly, *everything was insanely fire*! All three songs were magical, and the cover artwork imbued that magic through and through. We were all blown away. \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3028)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3029)\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3030)\n\n\n\n\nAfter our in-camp listening party, we switched gears into release mode. We knew we were releasing the songs via Catalog NFTs. But the when and how kept changing. \n\nAt first we thought of running a week-long auction via Catalog’s order book bidding. But then we got talking to Mirror’s team, and they got us real excited at the prospect of using their [Splits](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw) tool to instantaneously split the proceeds of each NFT between all recipients. \n\nThe problem: No Catalog NFTs had yet to be auctioned off via Mirror, and thus Mirror did not yet support Catalog’s metadata.\n\nLuckily, both teams were super down to interoperate to bring this project to life. Mirror created the necessary functionality so that the cover artwork and audio player would populate on their interface. Furthermore, Catalog blocked bidding on their site for the NFTs, signalling that the auctions were taking place on Mirror.\n\nAll this within the space of a few days, so we could get the auctions up and running the following Monday. \n\nIt was amazing to witness the Catalog and Mirror teams enthusiastically go out of their way to support the specified needs for our first release. They demonstrated what it is like when platforms are truly being built to serve the artists who use them.\n\n# Week 4\n\nOn Monday May 3, the three songs were [minted as 1/1 NFTs](https://beta.catalog.works/songcamp) on Catalog and [put up for auction](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM) on Mirror. \n\nWe had a pre-auction Discord call one hour prior to the auctions going live. At exactly 5pm, while still on the call together, we pushed the three auctions live. \n\n**Before the clock could strike 5:01pm, all 3 NFTs’ reserve bids were met.** \n\nThe discord call went ballistic. Everyone was ecstatic, and could not believe the immediate success the release was having. With many of the camp’s participants never having sold an NFT before, this was a powerful moment in experientially tasting an entirely new avenue for realizing the value of their work. The energy on that call at that moment was exhilarating. And all 3 bidders, who were also on the call at that time, were able to witness in real time the huge impact they were having. \n\nOn Tuesday May 4, the 24-hour auctions came to a close. In the final hour, bidding activity really picked up and brought the value exponentially higher than we would have ever anticipated. It was truly a thrill to not only watch the bids go up, but to also see each participant’s share of those amounts rise in real time via Mirror’s Splits block. \n \nThe 3 NFTs ended up selling for a cumulative amount of 10.05 ETH (equivalent to ~$34,000 USD that day). \n\nhttps://twitter.com/songcampdotband/status/1389693376841277444\n\nAll funds were automatically split between those involved on each song. All recipients were able to claim their share and transfer it to their own wallet directly after the auctions closed. \n\nThese results, as you can imagine, were not what we expected. Not only did the 3 NFTs go for an amount of ETH far beyond our expectations, but there was also this newfound power in receiving those funds directly and instantaneously.\n\nCatalog, Mirror, and the underlying Zora protocol did not take any fees whatsoever. **So 100% of the auctions’ proceeds went directly to those involved in the project. And those funds were made available right away.**\n\nMusicians often grow used to a world where we wait months or even years to receive any sort of revenue from our work, if at all. Here, we experienced a project that in the span of a few weeks went from nothing, to 3 songs and artwork created from scratch, to over $30,000 in value. \n\n# Week 5 and Onward\n\nThis brings us to present day. We’ve had a week to relax and take in what just went down. And we are beginning to think about the road ahead. We want to keep these experiments going, and push into deeper waters at this new frontier. \n\nThis first experiment is in no way the end all be all answer for the future of music.

But we do feel confident that they will *do* hold a ton of untapped value for artists to discover. And we are set on uncovering those hidden paths and bringing them to light. \n\nThis is just the beginning. We collectively funded, created and distributed art. And we will continue to do so, in even more expansive ways. \n\nMore to come on that topic.
