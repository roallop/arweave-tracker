Prior to this controversial piracy explosion, music discovery was a cumbersome, expensive endeavour, inaccessible to most.\n\nAs we started to realize just how much amazing music was sitting quietly on the internet, these early years ignited our passion to share unheard gems with as many people as possible.\n\nIn 2007, after nearly a decade of purely recreational music discovery, we started a blog called **Hillydilly**, originally intended as nothing more than an efficient means of sharing music with close friends.\n\nAs **Hillydilly** gained momentum, its ethos and purpose became clear: to share music on a song-by-song basis, solely based on each individual track’s quality—and nothing else. Regardless of whether a song came from an undiscovered talent or a superstar, we assessed everything equally, with as little bias as possible. We were determined to be the most reliable source for music discovery and curation, untouched by nepotism, politics, or monetary gain.\n\nDuring **Hillydilly**’s 14 year run, we were lucky enough to discover and help break some enormously influential artists ([Billie Eilish](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/magazine/billie-eilish-profile.html), [LANY](https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2016/03/27/new-noise-lany/), Lorde, [healy](https://www.memphisflyer.com/listen-up-ethan-healy-on-returning-to-his-memphis-roots-new-single-and-video-released-july-23rd) + many more), earning us our reputation as a trusted source of music discovery and curation—something that we are immensely proud of.\n\n## The Future\n\nWhen **Hillydilly** shut down in May of 2020, we started **Before The Data**, which allowed us to shift our focus towards shining a light on the need for human-led curation in a music business climate that heavily prioritizes data and algorithms.\n\nWhile data and algorithms have their extremely useful place in music, we believe that human curation is still essential for a healthy climate. We’re here to provide that service for those who share the same ethos.\n\nAt the time of this post, no A.I. (to our knowledge) can discover great artists and songs without a human finding it first. Thus is the purpose of **Before The Data**: finding and sharing great songs, while supporting the humans who discover them.\n\n## Before The Data + Web3\n\nFrom our perspective, we’ve seen the beginning of a sort of renaissance in the arts and technology world, occurring alongside the recent movement towards decentralization and community ownership in what’s being labeled the latest iteration of the internet: Web3.\n\nAs the tech evolves and becomes widely adopted, we’re anticipating a major shift where artists, curators, and fans will participate in building valuable communities around things they love and find sustainability within.\n\nWe’re devoted to leading the charge on discovering, supporting, and onboarding new artists into this web3 ecosystem, nurturing a human-focused music discovery community that shares in the upside of the resulting cultural capital.\n\nBe it through music NFTs, community fundraising, or any other innovative platforms that we expect to emerge in the web3 space, we intend to help create a more equitable landscape not only for brand-new artists to find their footing and audience, but also for passionate, music-loving humans to share the great music they find.\n\nFollow us on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/beforethedata), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/beforethedata), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/hillydilly.com), [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@beforethedata?), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Cj6v6Xp) & [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/beforethedata).\n\n*Special acknowledgement to our current contributors & additional team members Stephen Pollock, Lucas Martinez & Shane Friedman.*\n\n🏁", "timestamp": 1633986236, "digest": "-_F5qE3jGx5rdFN4bsv4Gsm_qQu1j3SvCcxpaFyIjiM", "contributor": "0xdFBB06683a882E827907422dbFE836E5430fE2aC"}

{"id": "c1mcwiOnD1_65Qne1gjQX5BhXYFLDJmnyRxv3szuqlE", "title": "DAO Research Notes V1", "body": "This is an early artifact of my DAO research. It covers some current trends I’m learning about, and where DAOs could potentially go.\n\n## DAO Stacks\n\n### Primitives (Level 1 Tools)\n\n* ERC20 tokens\n  * Can double as proportional voting (like shares)\n  * Examples:\n    * Friends with Benefits ($FWB)\n    * SharkDAO ($SHARK)\n  * Can cash out via UniSwap, etc.\n* ERC721 NFT\n  * Can signal art/creator support\n  * Can be built around a creator or group of creators\n  * Examples\n    * NounsDAO\n  * Typically 1 NFT 1 vote - but holding multiple NFTs\n* Multisig Wallets\n  * Wallets that are signed with multiple private keys. This allows more than one person access to the wallet. [Prevents key person risk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right/).\n  * They can also be used to require some portion of core group access to wallet: ie 2 of 3 signers needed to open a wallet.\n  * [Gnosis safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/)\n* Smart contracts\n  * Governs transactions, payouts, etc. for the DAO's treasury.\n\n### Level 2 Toolkits\n\nThese are tools for creating or using DAOs, wrapping up and coordinating the primitives above to form and/or manage DAOs.\n[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org) - cheap voting off-chain using oracles\n[DAOhaus](https://app.daohaus.club/) - Spin up DAO, interact, vote, etc. No-code\n[Colony](https://colony.io/) - No-code toolkit for DAOs. A general purpose framework with common DAO needs, like ownership, structure, etc.l\n[Juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) - funding, programmable spending, creates ERC-20 community tokens. No voting/governance, chiefly fundraising. Can be used in conjunction with a voting tool like Snapshot\n[Tokenwalk](https://www.tokenwalk.org/learn#learn_1) - Framework for building DAOs, using modules that are compatible with its interface, allowing for extensibility.\n[Parcel](https://parcel.money/) - Treasury management, multisig, yield farming\n[Zodiac](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/OuhG5s2X5uSVBx1EK4tKPhnUc91Wh9YM0fwSnC8UNcg) - Composable gnosis multisig wallet management tools\n\n**Need:** We need to bridge the Level 2 toolkits - which mostly focus on treasury management - with community management tools. DAOstack could be part one of this.\n\n### Member management tools\n\nThere needs to be much more built if DAOs are to be able to self-organize successfully, whether in traditional ways or new ones. [rafa0 has some ideas here](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1443157780374896648?s=20). Major themes:\n\n* Multi-DAO monitoring\n* Squad (internal) coordination. While this refers to squads within the DAO, these tools will likewise be needed at the whole-DAO level.\n* Workbench - collaborative tools for thought, as they mature, will be crucial here.\n* Payments\n* General admin\n* Community engagement\n\n### Community Tools\n\nMy thoughts on [RoamLab](https://roamlab.org/) as a collaborative labspace can be adapted to DAOs:\n\n* Workbench - Roam/Notion/etc.\n* Asynchronous communicator\n* Synchronous communicator\n* Scheduler\n\nSome common services in use today:\n\n* [Discord](https://discord.com) - common complaint is that it's hard to keep up with. Very few DAOs have asynchronous tools \n* [Guild.xyz](https://twitter.com/guildxyz) - token to gate Discord channels\n* [Collab.land](https://collab.land) - tools for creating token-focused communities\n* [Mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz) - just opened to the public\n  * Otherwise, can make a simple start page via [Carrd](https://carrd.co), [Webflow](https://Webflow.com), or your favorite one-page service\n* [PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/) - collective NFT voting\n* [MintGate](https://www.mintgate.app/) - token-based gating of content\n\n#### Useful tools I haven't seen common in the wild\n\n* [Notion](https://notion.so) - workspace \n* [Circle](https://circle.so) - asynchronous communication, geared towards creators\n* [Discourse](https://discourse.org) - asynchronous communication\n\n#### Problems/Opportunities\n\n* These tools are largely centralized. Opportunity for decentralized competitors? Are decentralized versions possible/needed?\n* Many challenges around compensation:\n  * Work allocation/selection\n  * Resource (compensation) allocation decisions\n    * Fully automated\n    * Done by DAO or squad + 3rd party?\n    * Governance around allocation\n  * See Compensation and Work Allocation section below\n* HR tooling for digital natives\n  * CRM+\n  * Taxation? Difficult because it's so murky.\n\n## Organization Styles\n\n* Public corporation - using membership tokens like shares, given voting power proportional to the total number of tokens held. Managers or top holders decide on how to raise funds, rest of members go with it.\n* Syndic - modeled after the syndicates found in The Dispossesed. People come together voluntarily to work on projects toward some goal, with autonomy on teams within the Syndic and the Syndic as a whole - exceptions for \"emergencies\" that need all hands on deck. Similar to [RoamLab](https://roamlab.org). DAO functions as workspace toward some stated end.\n* Guildhall - Bounties posted from members and 3rd parties for non-DAO work, and individuals or teams can claim them. The organization itself can draft proposals and vote on which ones to bring up.\n  **Note:** every style will end up needing administrators who are paid for running all the software, keeping track of members, etc. - operations work.\n\n### Purpose\n\n* Finding/collecting 3rd party work for members (Guildhall)\n* [Fundraising](https://medium.com/@bizzer/why-fundraising-daos-will-revolutionize-the-investment-industry-460b20645461)\n* Community for its own sake\n* Directing/organizing work in some field\n  * Education\n  * DevRel\n  * Research\n\n### Voting\n\n1 NFT : 1 Vote\n1 eth : 1 Vote\n[Quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting)\n\n### Compensation and Work Allocation\n\nAgain, [rafa0 outlines methods and intricacies around compensation](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1443269178404786186).\nAlong with compensation, a fair way to claim or allocate (whether a bottom-up organization or a top-down organization, respectively) work.\n\n### Fundraising Methods\n\n* Sales of DAO tokens\n* Sell NFTs that confer membership\n* Paid work as part of the DAO\n\n## Existing DAOs\n\n* [MolochDAO](https://github.com/MolochVentures/Whitepaper/blob/master/Whitepaper.pdf)\n* [RaidGuild](https://www.raidguild.org/)\n* [SharkDAO](https://twitter.com/sharkdao)\n* [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf)\n\n## Resources\n\n[How LionDAO created their DAO](https://blockchain.mirror.xyz/)\n\n## Other Questions to Explore\n\n* In what ways can a DAO promote or enforce participation?", "timestamp": 1633986844, "digest": "d37BZ0_pFLDiWFH2Z0Rxn3NtVrE3cCWY4zMko7VhP7w", "contributor": "0x0C137af7a47d47fdEDAEA06fc710DCE2Ca3FDbB7"}

{"id": "8WMh2hpYhHp8JWfgi7I5Skf17vErAxksTM39Zur4TUM", "title": "Give a split", "body": "Before getting into it, I want to express that all the ideas below are 100% mine. Entirely original. No external sources inspired any of this thought. I am the definitive sole author, and all credit should reflect that. No one before me provided any insight or shared any knowledge relating to what *I’m* about to share. /s\n\nIdeas are entangled things. Epiphanies are not our own, but the sum of everything around us, connecting in what feels like a moment. Authors are portrayed as singular figures, when beneath the surface a complex history exists.\n\nOne of these ideas the Mirror team has been kicking around is *the split*; a way of not only attributing sources of inspiration and collaboration, but also directing economic value to them. This is a quick series of overlapping (and optimistic) ideas centered on the split. I’ll leave drawing the connections and the resulting epiphany up to you.\n\n\n---\n\n[https://twitter.com/jondashkyle/status/1377076060873838592](https://twitter.com/jondashkyle/status/1377076060873838592)\n\n\n---\n\n[UbuWeb](https://ubu.com) is one of my long time favorite sources of inspiration—a collection of experimental art spanning all forms of media and collected by the poet Kenneth Goldsmith. It’s been a big influence on digital archival practice, and if you haven’t yet found yourself several hours deep in an Ubu-hole, I suggest diving in.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c257aee1-f197-47f5-8fde-4b68e8c0abf1.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560&&size=medium)\n\nGoldsmith taught a course called “*Uncreative Writing*”, where his students were penalized for any originality and “creativity,” and rewarded for plagiarism, repurposing, sampling, and stealing. This led to a [book of the same name](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/uncreative-writing/9780231149907). It’s a manifesto of sorts, describing a new form of authorship unlocked by the internet and instantaneous access to everything ever created all the time.\n\n> In 1969 the conceptual artist Douglas Huebler wrote, ‘The world is full of objects, more or less interesting; I do not wish to add any more.’ I’ve come to embrace Huebler’s ideas, though it might be retooled as ‘The world is full of texts, more or less interesting; I do not wish to add any more.’ It seems an appropriate response to a new condition in writing today: faced with an unprecedented amount of available text, the problem is not needing to write more of it; instead, we must learn to negotiate the vast quantity that exists. How I make my way through the thicket of information — how I manage it, how I parse it, how I organize and distribute it — is what distinguishes my writing from yours.\n\nIt’s a compelling provocation, and extends beyond textual writing. Yes, there are poetics in Goldsmith’s elaborations, but the notion expands on familiar ideas of the reblog and retweet; this being the remix, or the recontextualizion. What form could a tool take if it enabled *uncreative* authorship natively? Built on web3, could it be possible by default to assign attribution and route economic value to these sources?\n\n\n---\n\nLook, I listened to a lot of Bieber in 2020. No shame. It’s good to lead a balanced life. Soon after the release of *Changes* an exchange played out over an afternoon on Twitter. An artist accused Bieber of directly lifting a hook from his record. It was beyond similar; it was identical. Listen to [Bieber’s track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf0B9v9lDYU&ab_channel=JustinBieber) and then [the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtX4CmURvKE&ab_channel=AsherMonroe-Topic). An uncleared and uncredited sample. A Twitter mob began accusing Justin of stealing from another artist, and one less recognized.\n\nThat’s when this producer jumped into the fold with the receipts:\n\n[Laxcity Twitter Credit](https://twitter.com/laxcitymusic/status/1228487508314423296)\n\nNeither artists had created the hook! Credit goes to [Laxcity](https://soundcloud.com/laxcitymusic), a relative unknown who released it as a sample pack available for any one to use through [Splice](https://splice.com/), a sample subscription service.\n\n[Splice mentions in a comment to the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21140838/justin-bieber-changes-running-over-asher-monroe-synergy-splice-sample-melody) that “Laxcity made an amazing sample, and we’re glad he’s getting well-deserved recognition.” While recognition is better than nothing, it alone can not sustain a creative practice. We should do better.\n\nSplice does a good job at discovery and distribution, but the flat rate subscription licensing deal leaves artists out of possible upside, like with Laxcity. When musicians list their samples (or ideas) as up for remix, you could imagine a *split* is created when dropping a Splice sample into a track. For Laxcity, who’s sample runs the full duration of the track and [forms its foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80wg8Xp5sZY), the *split* could be generous. It should feel less like a pure expenditure, and more like extending gratitude by saying “if this happens, and we get lucky, we get lucky together.” I’m skeptical if this fully replaces other models, but see it augmenting them in beautiful ways.\n\n\n---\n\n> Web 2: @ mention\n> Web 3: economic mention\n> — [@literature](https://twitter.com/Iiterature)\n\nIt should be as easy to create a split as it is to tag someone in a photo on Instagram. Or adding an editor on Google Docs. There are many open questions, like… Should it be possible to tag someone in a work without assigning a split? *Split by default*?\n\nMy role at Mirror is to create interfaces for ideas like this, and distill somewhat complex mechanisms into useful and understandable patterns and tools. They must be both understandable *and* lead to a deeper knowledge of what crypto unlocks. Web3 and cyrpto’s economic and attribution layers could provide the basis of what a successful uncreative ecosystem could need.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/583755b9-e077-4141-995f-9b94fdef7bab.jpeg?height=1620&width=2880&&size=large)\n\nWhen I think about *splits*, I think about questions of interface and defaults. Laxcity was excited for the attention, but is that only in absence of creative tools which include him in the flow of value *by default*? Bieber and his producers were being *uncreative* by using that sample. What if they had been using an uncreative interface in an uncreative ecosystem, and what would have that meant for Laxcity?\n\nIn the Twitter video response Laxcity says “Here it is, I wrote this MIDI.” This is beautiful phrasing. MIDI is a communication protocol for musical instruments introduced in 1981. *1981*. This may seem long ago, but relative [all of music history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fHi36dvTdE&ab_channel=cagin), it barely registers as a blip. For a new generation of producers, music and MIDI are one and the same. Protocols become the defaults, and the defaults become how we perceive the world around us.\n\nThere is so much work to do.\n\n\n---\n\nIf it were possible to assign a series of splits for this entry, it would look similar to this:\n\n* `10%` Kennith Goldsmith for being the source of *Uncreative Writing*.\n* `10%` The Mirror team for collaboratively generating many of the ideas around *splits*. This split would behave as though directed at a DAO.\n* `5%` Laxcity for providing an insight about remixes and sampling.\n* `2.5%` [Brainpickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/), as I stole and slightly modified a paragraph (or two) from them when searching Goldsmith.\n\n\n---\n\n## Elsewhere\n\n* Another source of uncreative inspiration is [Reality Hunger, by David Shields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Hunger), a book of literary collage kind of like a long-form Tweet thread.

It now appears that Argent may be experimenting with StarkNet’s Layer2 as seen by a new repo title [argent-contracts-starknet](https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts-starknet) in [Argent Labs’ github](https://github.com/argentlabs) organization. Co-founder and Chief Science Officer at Argent, Julien Niset, has made [all the commits](https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts-starknet/commits/main) to the repo.

Wait 24 hours for someone to sponsor your post\n\nOnce the vote and grace period has past, you will become a member of the FoundationsDAO, and gain new privileges. Some of those privileges include:  sponsoring proposals, voting on proposals and processing proposals. We will walk through those processes in the following sections.\n\n## Sponsor a proposal\n\nYou may recall that when you created a proposal to be admitted into the DAO, a member of the DAO is needed to sponsor your proposal before it was put up for a vote. Now that you are a member of the DAO you have the ability to sponsor new proposals.\n\n***NOTE:*** You are able to sponsor proposals that are created by others as well as your own.\n\n### 1. Find a proposal to sponsor\n\nOn the proposals page you can use the “Filter By” dropdown menu to select “Unsponsored” to load all proposals that need to be sponsored. The first line of each proposal will tell you what kind of proposal it is. Remember: you are now a contributing member of a DAO and it is every member’s responsibility to learn what each proposal will do before sponsoring or voting on it. Take the time to browse the open proposals and select one that you would like to sponsor.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5XrxLkqPdGv6WTCcON2a9.png?height=681&width=1175)\n\n### 2. Review proposal\n\nWhen you click into a proposal you will be able to read more information about it. Just like you needed to do when you requested to join the DAO, you will see the amount the person has put up as “Tribute” (will add to the DAO treasury) to join, and how many shares they wish to receive in return. For the FoundationsDAO it is reasonable to request 1 Share in exchange for 1 HAUS. For more complex proposals there can also be a link to the forum where discussion should happen before a proposal should be sponsored and voted on.\n\n***NOTE***: If the person is asking for more than 1 share for tributing 1 HAUS it should not be sponsored.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YkybgnwT5u58YsrLA9H8p.png?height=459&width=1081)\n\n### 3. Sponsor the proposal\n\nIf you are convinced that the proposal is worthy of being voted on, then you can sponsor it by depositing 0.05 Wrapped xDai.  If you don’t already have this you can follow the tutorial to learn how to wrap xDai (the native token of the xDai network): [Tutorial: How to convert xDAI to Wrapped xDAI (WrapETH)](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/vJ8aJ5-aPvTV4V7HDckT430KfsASqtsIsNOHRPIQPzc)\n\nNaturally you will need to approve the contract to access the Wrapped xDai in your wallet first, but then you can click the “Sponsor” button, approve the transaction and that’s it.\n\n***NOTE:*** This deposit will be returned to you once the proposal has been processed. (Minus the reward for processing, if one has been selected.)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DnjFwz4D6K-vaJ-mHNcRJ.png?height=246&width=728)\n\n## Vote on a proposal\n\nOnce a proposal has been sponsored, it will take a minute or so to be able to be voted on.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lvCjLcbkzYQNP2chP-ew0.png?height=174&width=1047)\n\nAfter waiting a minute refresh the page and you will see that the proposal is up for a vote for the next 24 hours. You can then click on the green thumbs up icon to vote Yes, or the red thumbs down icon to vote No. Once you click on one a transaction window will pop up for you to approve and cast your vote. After 24 hours whether the vote passes or fails, it will go into the “grace period” this will give any DAO members that do not agree with the outcome of the vote the opportunity to “ragequit” by cashing their DAO shares in for an appropriate amount of funds from the treasury. This is a common feature of a Moloch DAO.\n\n***NOTE:*** Voting Yes or No will complete the RabbitHole Task.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tLUVcmYiptbXQxwg0pu7r.png?height=282&width=1008)\n\n## Process a Proposal\n\nOnce the grace period ends the proposal will be ready to be processed. If the vote failed the proposal will simply be discarded, but if the vote passed, then the proposal will be enacted. In the case of a Member Request proposal, the person that requested will be admitted into the DAO, their tribute will be added to the treasury, and they will gain the amount of shares they requested.\n\nOn the proposals page you can use the “Filter By” dropdown menu to select “Ready for Processing” to load all proposals that are ready to process.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uwrr16tvWfltbI2h1u3DI.png?height=619&width=1177)\n\nClick into the proposal and then click the “Process” button under the Actions heading on the right of the page. You will then need to confirm the transaction, and once it has gone through the proposal will be processed.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RWNp1akr6ZXZSZ8SgUA-7.png?height=315&width=734)\n\n**And that’s it!

{"id": "U23LT_X64LfTmLcqxcIYkzc_nNTmz-xulMvo7JGjsA4", "title": "How To Live in the Future, Part 1: The Future is a Place", "body": "I’m going to spoil it for you: how to live in the future is by being present, here and now. But then, it’s not that simple.\n\nWhat we call “the future” isn’t something out there to be held. It’s an idea that varies drastically between us, and between each one of us one moment to the next. A better way of thinking of the future than as though it’s some approaching comet is to think of it as our horizon to the “West” of now, a moving point of reference that everyone sees differently, depending on where we are standing. Consequently, most of what we call “the future” tells us more about where we are now than where we’re headed. Things are never all that clear from far away, and there’s no guarantee we’re moving toward that point and not some other.\n\nSo when the futurists, the real ones, speak of “futures,” what they mean is that there are a myriad of points along that far horizon, and that it makes better sense to talk about the future as a spectrum of potentials than as if it were the preordained and manifested destiny the corporations and the prophets want us to believe.\n\nI have this thing about imagining the landscape of experience in geographic metaphor (example: I just caught myself describing the lump sum of everything we know in life as “landscape”). Our human memories grew out of neural networks that help orient an animal to landmarks (ironically, originally “watermarks,” as this was going down in ancient oceans) — so it’s no surprise that math explores the n-dimensional, or that most human cultures think of “future” as a thing in front and “past” as something back behind us. We don’t visualize time the way we visualize space, unless you’re with me in the radical perspective that time and space are somewhat meaninglessly differentiated, time is space and space is time, and calendars are close-to-accurate reflections of the way time spreads invisibly across the warp and woof of hyperspace.\n\n(I recently discovered that I’m one of 1-in-50 people that has “time-space synesthesia” and reflexively, habitually sees the year in some consistent pattern in my mind’s eye. I am always standing on a giant ring, December/January at the 12 o’clock divide, July and August there at 6 o’clock, and as I write this now I’m moving counterclockwise through the year somewhere around 1:30, since it’s 17 November. This 3D projection doesn’t handle multiverses, parallel dimensions, linear progression, any of that — it’s an idiosyncratic system, opposite of how I learned to read a clock, but totally persistent. This is how I store my recollections: looking up or down the ring, the annum, not exactly a mnemonic “memory palace” but nonetheless a spatial system for organizing and referencing experience. I was not at all surprised to learn the hippocampus grew from some fish proto-GPS.)\n\nWhen I attempt to visualize “the future” as I learned to think of it in childhood, I see the image of a silvery, metallic, shifting sphere — presumably, the boundary of some 4D portal casting shadows into the mere three dimensions that my pitiable primate eyes can see. Whether this is my enculturated mind presenting something physics experts tell me is the probable appearance of a window into other times; or whether it’s a genuine prophetic third-eye vision of the portal through which we can gaze at all of our innumerable futures; or it’s allegory and the image represents the Noöspheric nanotech that wraps our planet in a skin of thinking mercury; or I am actually observing my own body from the point of view of someone living in the future, someone who has cybernetic eyes and sees the spherical magnetic field projected by my heart, I do not know. Perhaps it’s all of these.\n\nPerhaps that is the point: that our above/below and inner/outer dyads do not serve us in “the future” and the meaning of this image is that time tends toward holistic, holographic, fractal, and recursive incarnations. That the evolutionary arc defined by entropy assembling organisms as a means for moving energy effectively through space results in Pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s “Omega Point,” indeed, but that it is already so, the One Thing That We All Already Are just organizing its internal organs to present an ever-clearer and more luminous arrangement on one side, and that’s why New Jerusalem appears in revelations of the “end of time” and our Big Bang mythology so closely imitates the scene of Hell. That all of this is happening at once (that’s what the current state of science seems to tell us, anyhow) and all the psychonautic maps of glass chrysanthemums and god’s-eyes, portals and glass onions, are the intuitions of this universal truth: that we are wound up hyperspherically, precipitating in a giant goldfish bowl with all the other stars and interstellar dust, which we observe as if it were a string of pearls, one moment to the next, but really it’s the whole damn thing at once, a party more precisely than a great parade.\n\nThis is why I think that “future equals East, past equals West” when I imagine time along the spinning axis of a shape I only dimly grasp, which simultaneously is the world outside and also me, my eyes the fire projecting shadows of imagination on the cave walls of my unborn and undying consciousness.\n\n> *“The nature of infinity is this: That everything has its own vortex, and when once a traveler through Eternity has pass’d that Vortex, he perceives it roll backward behind his path, into a globe itself unfolding like a sun…” \n – William Blake*\n\n**[Michael Garfield](http://patreon.com/michaelgarfield) is a paleontologist-futurist exploring the intersections of complex systems science, weird philosophy, deep history, and creative meta-disciplinarity.

We don’t need a technological event horizon for this to be true (but they are actually quite frequent). The real Singularity that Church of Kurzweil devotees displace into the fruiting moment of today’s still-juvenile Ecology of Stuff — that sharp discontinuity between what is and what can’t be imagined, lives right now and always now, and we’re inside it. It’s the canopy of stars we pierce when we embody old alchemical engravings, poking our explorers’ heads out through the sky-as-limit-of-the-known. It is the Bardo of Tibetan mysticism, that chaotic space between our incarnations in which everything occurs at once — and every moment is the Bardo, since our lives are tunnels made of gates, and every day’s a new year. Every moment’s an inflection point between the end and the beginning of innumerable stories flowing in all possible directions. (If you don’t agree, just sit and listen long enough, and evidence will come.)\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing about this Day That Changes Everything is that we’re swimming in it all the time. If some Omega Point in hyperspace, the Eschaton that waits for us at history’s end, draws all mundane phenomena into its all-embracing unity, we’re implicated in that vast conspiracy already. We can celebrate. But particles apparently pop in and out of being all the time, each moment a Creation. All of it occurs at once, a party more than a parade. So point me to “the” Singularity, again?\n\nThat said, the future seems to have a character that holds up to the deconstruction of our histories: it’s more of everything. Defining time as the apparent movement of relationships between entangled objects — space as measure of entanglement — “time’s arrow” points to greater entropy, an isotropic, isomorphic cosmos in which every game’s been played and all can come to rest at last. But en route to that final moment, entropy-as-evolution seeks the best-fit path to oceanic stillness, and contrives the paradox of order-as-a-means-to-emptiness: the metabolic flurry of our intricate ecologies, no niche unoccupied, the fractal map of river deltas fitting neatly over our phylogenies and food webs. Winding tributaries and the “tangled bank” of Darwin’s evolutionary wilderness take shape as the inevitable system-seeking-rest, its filaments forever reaching from the trauma of explosive origins to grasp at peace in full and evenly distributed disorder.\n\nEvery action has its equal, opposite reaction, though. The liberating “march of progress,” Eros constantly transcending limitation by devising and inhabiting more brilliant and adaptable new bodies, is actually *the very definition* of conservative: the conservation of momentum, energy, and information as the cosmos rearranges its components to achieve a quicker peace by “stepping on the gas” and dissipating everything more rapidly. The answer to the ever-loving question of how order comes from chaos is that order is just \\*more efficient chaos — \\*an accomplice, not an adversary. Every tidied desk results in larger landfills; every landfill is a mine awaiting artificially intelligent trash harvesters; the ecosystem that matures to weave together DNA and carbon nanotubule microprocessors in an Anthropocene beyond the over-simple categories “man” and “nature” is itself one giant dissipative structure, functioning as an excretive organ of the Sun as it assists in the accelerated burnoff of the Big Bang.\n\nSo: two things collide to make a third. The third thing causes a more intricate relationship between the now-three things that make a fourth. Each novel species founds new niches that are filled as soon as luck mutates a nearby organism up the slope of fitness to become a key to fit the lock. The whole thing drives itself, the ever-deepening complexity of Gaia just a crystal growing in solution, ratcheting on up the double helix, just the natural consequence of radiating heat.\n\n(Intelligence is implicated in this: more complex environments create the need for teams of “individuals” to form and endosymbiotically enfold their members into larger creatures — smarter creatures that have more sophisticated needs and new dependencies — and these conditions favor more diverse and intricate societies, which count toward the increasing intricacy of the whole ecology, which favors teamwork as a strategy, and on we go until the Internet appears to link each nucleus of nation-state and corporation into one great planetwide amoeba, and beyond, our pseudopods already reaching into extraplanetary space…)\n\nAnd so it is that evolution tilts the narrative toward more of everything. We didn’t leave bacteria behind when we got into bigger, and then bigger, huddles and grew tissues, organs, spines, societies; we made a hundred billion previously undreamed jobs for germs to do. It was (and is, in that eternal and apocalyptic light infusing all of time) a transmutation of the flesh: the simple taken up into the great complexity of something both ineffable and vast, and unimaginably generous. No evolutionary layer left behind, each one the platform for and beneficiary of the next. And when we fuse with our machines completely, we will not render humankind extinct; but will explode in our diversity to offer every variation possible upon the theme of “human,” most of which do not exist today.\n\nThe permeable membrane of the atmosphere, so wider than the borders of our nations, just as they were wider than the walls of cities, means a bigger social body, made of far more *kinds* of people, than were necessary to sustain the spirit of a fatherland or motherland. When cities came they made us all a little dumber, as they made us smarter — specialists in pottery or farming or religion lose a little bit of each as far as knowledge was, before, connected through and through to everything, and pottery was farming and religion, all of it one motion, not the purview of an educated expert. (Presumably, and likewise, DNA was once more flexible than it is now, more potent but less realized, far less speciose.) Now, we have so many kinds of jobs, they do not all have names, so myriad are human economic functions; and when our society has stabilized to know itself at global levels as a day-to-day sensation of each local human life, our tasks will be so fluid, numerous, and partial that we will have moved beyond the modern experts in both hyper-specialization and increased awareness of how miniscule our knowledge is to that of the entire Commons. Each of us will be so much *more*, such empowered emanations of the Biosphere, and so much *less*, tiny in the corner of our wide experience, compared to egocentric ancestors with relatively static “jobs” and personal identities. Eventually we will take new bodies with each thought, the epistemic line erased between the-generation-as-experiment by blind selection forces and the-metamorphic-flesh-as-proposition by machinery of spirit, assuming selves to take on certain tasks. The arrow is toward more life, more apparent choice, more radiant and dangerous diversity — all hung together, maddest-ever symphony, admired all at once.\n\nThis order, which we organize and make explicit, the “invisible environment” of the cosmos’s distributed intelligence as manifested in the Biosphere’s webwork of thoughts-as-species, is already “out there” waiting to be recognized and drawn down from the heavens (metaphorically). That is one way the Singularity is here already — it hasn’t gathered, coalesced, and focused into history yet, but all of it already lies in wait, the Eschaton at history’s end impressing every moment with its tugging yearning, showing itself to us in and as a universe compelled to speak.\n\nAnd it can be no other way. The game was rigged “from the beginning,” which here means the origin beyond the Alpha and Omega, not “t = 0” but the architecture of the vacuum, in which past and future happen simultaneously, and the end and the beginning codetermine which of all nows swaddles us between. We are a path drawn from all possibilities, the likeliest of pasts and futures shaking hands to meet as now, and that’s why we get so confused about causality — because we haven’t caught our talk of time up to the networked and nonlinear epistemology of ecological, electric modern thinking.\n\nThat’s the essence of “time’s arrow” — echoing Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the narrative that our spacetime-projecting minds derive from pure unboxed experience in light of our best scientific work, the best-fit story to survive in this World-Wide-Webbed age is this: time moves from Singularity to “Intertwingularity,” and all the while The Great Perfection is and isn’t waiting round the bend for us.\n\nThe evolution of self-organizing parts to weave together an Omega Point that wakes up to itself at every level is the equal, opposite momentum to the *involution* of the already-and-always order ever seeking novel ways to manifest in form, not just potential. Nothing new exists, except new ways of saying it — the future is a dream we apprehend as best our tiny mammal bodies can, the poetry precipitating out of Holographic All to shape and wag our tongues and typing fingers. And as we approach the Eschaton to recognize it as the Self we’ve been this whole time, categories like “new” and “familiar” explode beneath the weight of our original experience, the only thing that ever was, as it unweaves and weaves us and our grand predictions.\n\nSo, in short: in some sense it is hard to be completely *wrong* about the future, if you say, “This thing will be remembered and repeated in some way.” A universe in which all possibilities occur is more entropic, thus more likely. And that makes the only certain thing that we can say about the future, that *it is*. (And also isn’t.)\n\n**[Michael Garfield](http://patreon.com/michaelgarfield) is a paleontologist-futurist exploring the intersections of complex systems science, weird philosophy, deep history, and creative meta-disciplinarity.

But then, it’s not that simple.\n\nWhat we call “the future” isn’t something out there to be held. It’s an idea that varies drastically between us, and between each one of us one moment to the next. A better way of thinking of the future than as though it’s some approaching comet is to think of it as our horizon to the “West” of now, a moving point of reference that everyone sees differently, depending on where we are standing. Consequently, most of what we call “the future” tells us more about where we are now than where we’re headed. Things are never all that clear from far away, and there’s no guarantee we’re moving toward that point and not some other.\n\nSo when the futurists, the real ones, speak of “futures,” what they mean is that there are a myriad of points along that far horizon, and that it makes better sense to talk about the future as a spectrum of potentials than as if it were the preordained and manifested destiny the corporations and the prophets want us to believe.\n\nI have this thing about imagining the landscape of experience in geographic metaphor (example: I just caught myself describing the lump sum of everything we know in life as “landscape”). Our human memories grew out of neural networks that help orient an animal to landmarks (ironically, originally “watermarks,” as this was going down in ancient oceans) — so it’s no surprise that math explores the n-dimensional, or that most human cultures think of “future” as a thing in front and “past” as something back behind us. We don’t visualize time the way we visualize space, unless you’re with me in the radical perspective that time and space are somewhat meaninglessly differentiated, time is space and space is time, and calendars are close-to-accurate reflections of the way time spreads invisibly across the warp and woof of hyperspace.\n\n(I recently discovered that I’m one of 1-in-50 people that has “time-space synesthesia” and reflexively, habitually sees the year in some consistent pattern in my mind’s eye. I am always standing on a giant ring, December/January at the 12 o’clock divide, July and August there at 6 o’clock, and as I write this now I’m moving counterclockwise through the year somewhere around 1:30, since it’s 17 November. This 3D projection doesn’t handle multiverses, parallel dimensions, linear progression, any of that — it’s an idiosyncratic system, opposite of how I learned to read a clock, but totally persistent. This is how I store my recollections: looking up or down the ring, the annum, not exactly a mnemonic “memory palace” but nonetheless a spatial system for organizing and referencing experience. I was not at all surprised to learn the hippocampus grew from some fish proto-GPS.)\n\nWhen I attempt to visualize “the future” as I learned to think of it in childhood, I see the image of a silvery, metallic, shifting sphere — presumably, the boundary of some 4D portal casting shadows into the mere three dimensions that my pitiable primate eyes can see. Whether this is my enculturated mind presenting something physics experts tell me is the probable appearance of a window into other times; or whether it’s a genuine prophetic third-eye vision of the portal through which we can gaze at all of our innumerable futures; or it’s allegory and the image represents the Noöspheric nanotech that wraps our planet in a skin of thinking mercury; or I am actually observing my own body from the point of view of someone living in the future, someone who has cybernetic eyes and sees the spherical magnetic field projected by my heart, I do not know. Perhaps it’s all of these.\n\nPerhaps that is the point: that our above/below and inner/outer dyads do not serve us in “the future” and the meaning of this image is that time tends toward holistic, holographic, fractal, and recursive incarnations.

At Scout, we build products that bring people together through the shared language of content. That may sound a bit vague, because it is! Our approach to building is unique in that we build multiple products in pursuit of our mission. So far, we’ve released:\n\n* [is.online](http://is.online/) — avatar- and mobile-based live-streaming\n* [onscout.com](http://onscout.com/) — teaser for customizable 3D rooms\n* [ideasby.ai](http://ideasby.ai/) — content ideas generated by GPT-3\n\nWith more on the way.\n\nOccasionally, we share our approach to building products. Below is an excerpt from a recent internal weekly note from our CEO.\n\n\n---\n\n### Why transparency matters\n\nLately, I've thought a lot about transparency and how we work together as teammates. We've stressed transparency and communication from day 1 at Scout but I have personally failed to communicate the value of working this way.\n\nAt Loom, transparency was at the heart of how we operated. The cultural value was *Lead with transparency* and, not only was it emphasized at our all-hands meeting every Monday, it was very much how we operated as teammates. We had conversations in public slack channels when at all possible and when we created Slack channels, they were almost always public. We were transparent with what we were working on and why those goals/actions were important for our customers.\n\nExamples of the benefits transparency brings are all around us. Since moving to LA, driving has become part of my daily routine and something we can all relate to. So let's consider this example: you're driving down the road at 65mph and vibing to some music. Suddenly, the car in front of you hits their breaks and turns left, causing you to slam your breaks. Your [cortisol levels spike](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-cortisol) and you have a few choice words for the driver 🤬. It completely disrupts your music flow and your overall mood.\n\nFortunately for us, in 1909, a little thing called the turn signal was invented to solve this exact problem. The turn signal is a method of communication — a way to be transparent about one's intent to turn, thereby giving nearby cars a way of adapting their behaviors according to that intent to turn.\n\nThe turn signal analogy continues in its relevance to us as a team. Intuitively, turn signals would only apply to cars *behind* the turning car. But modern turn signals let *all* nearby cars know you're turning — cars in front of you, beside you, and behind you. Why? Simply because they may benefit from knowing your intent to turn and, in turn, you may benefit from communicating that intent.\n\n**Transparency is** using your turn signal. Transparency is communicating openly to everyone around you and, in turn, helping yourself. Transparency is a minor and temporary inconvenience with a long-term (potentially massive) pay-off. In the context of teamwork, transparency is a great communication habit to practice.\n\n**Transparency is not** being the asshole that doesn't use a turn signal. Transparency is not a sign of distrust. Transparency is not micromanagement. Transparency is not being vague about your intention.\n\nAs a guiding light for transparency, we never ask of our teammate something we do not already do or would not readily do. At every step, we embody transparency and over-communication. At no step do we embody micromanagement or distrust.\n\nRevisiting Loom's cultural value of *leading with transparency*, I lead with transparency at every step of our journey together. In our monthly *What is Scout?* memos, you can see what we stand for as a company, our goals, major learnings, and more. In these *Week Ahead* notes, you can see our goals as a company and the ingredients that went into each. In my daily priorities (an async standup in #team-eng), you can see exactly what I hope to accomplish at the start of the day and exactly what I accomplished by the end of the day.\n\nWhy is this important? Because the insights, learnings, thinkings, goals, priorities, etc are all readily available for you to digest, disagree with, comment on, debate, love... whatever you please. **Everything is there for your input.**\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1633995258, "digest": "fT9BPXyZWJYv-gKzGyfK4djyRkIK3I3jE1RfIKvxIZk", "contributor": "0xC4af44833f9D65BEcB84f5c2581FA95f0885F095"}

In a fit of rage and enthusiasm, I sprung up a [crowdfund](https://chaim.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x0421f42eb7BD74774a09bD3454C6948A938324E9) to rectify the situation.\n\nThe thought went as follows: if web2 platforms such as YouTube and Spotify aren’t happy with us streaming their music in our Discord calls, then we must build a bot of our own.\n\n**A web3 music bot.**\n\nAnd so we did…\n\nIt gives me great pleasure to introduce to you → **[bpm.gg](https://www.bpm.gg/)**\n\n## First up: BPM v1.0\n\nBPM v1.0 streams [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/) 1/1 NFTs into Discord calls.\n\nThe bot is a community-funded public good. It is available for everyone to use, thanks to the beautiful souls who funded its development.\n\nNot only did the bot’s crowdfund reach its stretch goal, but [@raihan](https://twitter.com/raihan_) and [@JesseGrushack](https://twitter.com/JesseGrushack) both sweetened the deal by throwing enough $FWB into the pot so the developer who built it could join Friends With Benefits!\n\n[https://twitter.com/raihan_/status/1439004851304742916?s=20](https://twitter.com/raihan_/status/1439004851304742916?s=20)\n\nDaniel Rojkind ([@drojkind](https://twitter.com/drojkind)) is that very developer, who slid into my DMs the day after the crowdfund to inform me that he already got a functional bot up and running the night before!\n\n![dentist vibez](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_p5jAgszQ-Lj9TUsGXf95.png?height=610&width=1008)\n\nAfter running the beta bot for a week or so in a handful of Discords such as Songcamp and FWB, we now have a V1 ready for all to use. Daniel whipped up this awesome little landing page at **[bpm.gg](https://www.bpm.gg/)** where you can add the bot to your Discord server. (*Be sure to hover over “community-funded” with your mouse on desktop for a fun little easter egg.*)\n\n## Next up: BPM v2.0 + Club BPM\n\nThis is the public beta release of BPM. We still have soooo many ideas for how we can improve music playback in Discords, as well as paths to value realization for the artists that we’re streaming.\n\nWe will also launch \\*[Club BPM ](https://discord.gg/KQRxJgnevq)\\*soon *—* a suite of Discord voice and text channels in the BPM server where we intend to host parties, test out new features + versions of the BPM bot, and build out ***the hottest club in the metaverse***.\n\nTo gain access to *Club BPM,* you’ll need **5 $BPM** tokens.\n\n![meme by @shamanic](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/beWT2QQet0LJf-1daEgpp.jpg?height=749&width=749)\n\n## How do I get $BPM?\n\nThe $BPM token was first created and distributed during our crowdfund. Those who contributed ETH to the crowdfund received a portion of $BPM tokens in exchange.\n\nThis token’s first use case is as *the* entry ticket to *Club BPM: the hottest club in the metaverse.* But we can see it growing from there. As mentioned in the initial crowdfund…\n\n> Should this Discord bot product be successful, I’d love to build out a bigger collective to fund and create more Discord bots for the web3 community. Should we stand up said DAO in the future, it would make sense to recognize and reward $BPM holders as the initial backers of the collective’s genesis project.\n\n**There are 2 ways to recieve $BPM. You choose:**\n\n1. *“I’d like some $BPM as soon as humanly possible”*\n\n   Well, *alright*! We want more beautiful people to join this burgeoning lil’ community. At the top of the page, you have the ability to collect an editioned NFT of this article. **If you collect any edition by next Monday October 11th at 1pm ET, you’ll receive 10 $BPM (*Update: this airdrop has already taken place!)*** I’ll take a snapshot of the supporters at that time and date, and airdrop you the BPM then (as in next Monday). These funds will go to the continued development of BPM!\n2. *“I’m not in any rush, but I’d like some $BPM before Club BPM opens”*\n\n   There is no need to contribute ETH to receive $BPM! Well before our debut party at *Club BPM*, we will present ample ways to obtain the 5 $BPM needed to access the club. No action to take just yet, except [jumping into the BPM discord server](https://discord.gg/KQRxJgnevq).

{"id": "AtLW7JEim4BbiIttJJQ8EohQYxV9DMRzg9_sl0MRxxI", "title": "CyberConnect Protocol: Building the Social Graph Infrastructure for Web 3.0", "body": "## Abstract\n\nThe rise of global social network giants empowers the centralized tech cartels to misuse user data, infringing user privacy and imposing censorship. Investigated by Cambridge Analytica, Facebook collected social graphs and personal profiles from millions of users without their consent to facilitate political advertising, inappropriately profiting from personal data. The current landscape of Web 2.0 centralized social network has deviated from the principle of the World Wide Web to enable the decentralization of information on a large scale. \n\nAs the solution, we desire a decentralized, censorship-free, and self-sovereign social network, which exactly aligns with the thesis of the Web 3.0 revolution. We propose a new decentralized social graph protocol CyberConnect, a Web 3.0 infrastructure that is blockchain-agnostic and openly accessible. Users can collaboratively contribute to the protocol, bootstrapping a middleware for building Web 3.0 based social networks and Metaverse in the future. \n\n## Roadmap of Web 3.0 \n\nThe breakthrough innovation of the Ethereum blockchain enables smart contract execution in a decentralized way, opening the chapter of decentralized applications interacting with digital assets. We’ve seen the prosperity of the DeFi summer and the NFT summer. Numerous Dapps have committed to facilitate the trading of digital assets. \n\nOn the other hand, we are excited to see the increasing popularity of decentralized UGC platforms like mirror.xyz and blockchain-based games such as Axie Infinity. We believe the next major step on the roadmap of Web 3.0 will be the bloom of decentralized social networks and blockchain-based Metaverse. A decentralized social graph protocol will be an indispensable part of it. \n\nLack of a decentralized social graph protocol, current games, and social applications store users’ connection data in a centralized way. Users have to go through the process of building connections repeatedly whenever log in to a new application. Imagine how amazing it could be when you log in to Decentraland, Dark Forest, or even Opensea and you can immediately know your friends from your address book who are also using this app. With CyberConnect, users can roam around different Dapps and games on Web 3.0 with their digital assets, on-chain identities, and social graphs without giving up control to any centralized party. \n\n## CyberConnect Protocol \n\n### Protocol overview \n\nWe propose CyberConnect, a decentralized protocol for constructing the blockchain address-based social graphs. The CyberConnect Protocol will have the following features: \n\n* Publicly accessible: the decentralized social graph data will be publicly accessible for all Dapps as an add-on feature for developers to leverage users’ connections to grow beyond their existing user base. \n* Self-sovereign: while the social graph data are open to all, only users have full control over their own social graphs, i.e., adding, deleting, and updating the connections. \n* Blockchain-agnostic: instead of tying to a single blockchain, the protocol is created for a multi-blockchain ecosystem. The blockchain-agnostic feature will support connections from all blockchains. \n* Decentralized governance: Inspired by Ethereum’s vision, we will commit to the ideals of security, permissionless, and decentralized governance. The long-term development of the protocol will be subject to decentralized governance. \n* Token-incentivized: in order to support the long-term development of the CyberConnect Protocol, we introduce a token-incentivized model in the beginning stage to fairly reward all contributors who help bootstrap the social graph. \n\nOptions for privacy-preserving features: we know some users care about their connection data more than others do. We are actively researching the technical solutions for enabling privacy-preserving features in the future. \n\n### Storage \n\nAt the heart of CyberConnect is a tamper-proof data structure that efficiently facilitates the creation, update, query, and verification of user-centric data. \n\nEach piece of user-centric data is represented as a data stream where the update is only allowed by the data owner. Each update to the data is appended to the data stream in the form of an append-only commit log and the resulting data structure becomes a hash-linked data structure called a `Merkle DAG`. To provide data authenticity, we utilize the `dag-jose` `IPLD` codec so that each piece of data, whether the creation file or the individual updates is signed and optionally encrypted by the data owner. Before appending a new commit to the data stream, an authorization check is performed to ensure that only the data owner could append new updates. After the custom IPLD encoding, the data is safely stored in IPFS to provide content addressed lookup and data integrity. By this design, each user's social graph is only modifiable by the user, readable to applications with proper decryption permission given by the user, and verifiable by the signature attached. \n\nWe partner with Ceramic for our first release based on their implementation of such a mutable data stream storage system on top of IPFS. Further performance improvement will be achieved by writing a heavy data model. \n\nData availability among nodes is achieved through `libp2p pubsub` so that as long as one node subscribed to the pubsub topic has the needed commit log, data will be available for query among all the nodes. \n\nLong-term data retention is guaranteed through Ceramic’s blockchain anchoring and our custom data pinning service. \n\n### Authentication and Authorization \n\nTo fully give back ownership of user data, we have to first sort out authentication and authorization. The authentication of a user simply means that they are who they claim they are and is easily achieved by a signature using a user’s private key. The authorization of user data means that only the user has the access to write their own data and no other central party like Facebook could modify anyone’s data. Authorization is done with the help of pre-commit checks and `dag-jose IPLD` encoding to ensure correct signing after commit. \n\nGiven these two requirements on authentication and authorization, we designed a safe keychain scheme for Authentication and Authorization based on a public-key system (asymmetric key pairs). Firstly, users should not sign any non-transactional data with their blockchain private key. Signing with a blockchain private key provides an extra hurdle to the user experience and broadens the attack surface. Thus, we need to generate key pairs with `ed25519` curve from the entropy of a blockchain wallet signature on the client-side. The private key is generated inside a protected `iframe` and exposed to applications only through rpc to prevent XSS attacks. \n\nThe key pairs are then later encrypted with the user’s existing keychain private key (blockchain private key if keychain private key not existent) and stored in the specific data stream for a keychain. The keychain data stream is authorized and protected through a key rotation scheme combined with blockchain anchoring to resolve conflicts. \n\n### User-centric user tables \n\nIPFS storage has a common centralization concern where CIDs are stored in a centralized server. This raises the problem of data authenticity where a central server could swap out the real user-created data with fake ones by changing the CID. As mentioned above, we do enforce data signature with `dag-jose` codec so that data authenticity is guaranteed. \n\nTo lookup a certain user’s social graph, we first need to lookup the keychain of the user through their blockchain address. Then we could look up the user table through the keychain public key. In contrast to an application-centric design in web2, where each application stores some information about the user and information like name and avatar are duplicated across applications, in our design, a single user table for each user contains all the information needed and could be used across all applications. By putting all the social graph information inside one user table, only that user has the permission to update any data involved and only the parties that have been given the decryption key could read the data inside if encrypted. \n\n### Data indexer \n\nSimilar to how `thegraph` indexes transactional data on Ethereum, all the social graph data on top of CyberConnect welcome data indexers. On CyberConnect, social graph data is stored as unilateral connections. For example, if Alice follows Bob, Alice would add Bob to her own following list. However, Alice could not modify Bob's follower list due to limited access. Thus, we only store the following list inside the user table but not a follower list. Any indexer could easily retrieve such following list and recover a counter-party follower list and provide such data for easier application queries. We would first rollout an indexer for the aforementioned follower list use case (stored in `computed index`) and welcome other interesting data indexing opportunities by the community. Any user with some technical skills could verify the validity of a computed index and a more sophisticated system involving slashing could be developed in the future. \n\n### Node \n\nA node must provide the following functionalities to maintain such a decentralized social graph. A Ceramic node including a custom IPFS daemon with `dag-jose` `IPLD` encoding. This handles all the keychain authenticated data stream creation and update. It also maintains the desired data availability through libp2p and IPFS data pinning service, and stream data consensus with blockchain anchoring. An RPC endpoint that exposes the data stream. A data indexer that provides reverse lookups and data aggregation. To generate a reverse “follower list” based on unidirectional following connection. \n\n### Architecture (v1)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6kVVlbuEVqX0q_ieuWqOd.jpeg?height=701&width=1783)\n\n### Use Cases\n\n\nWe conceptualize the decentralized social graph as a collection of unilateral paths among different blockchain addresses. This simple structure is flexible and can potentially support many interesting Web 3.0 use cases.\n\nDecentralized social media applications can integrate the open social graph powered by the CyberConnect Protocol to bootstrap the Web 3.0 versions of Medium, LinkedIn, and Twitter.\n\nWeb 3.0 based IM (instant messaging) applications can leverage the bidirectional sub-graph(meaning two users followed each other) as the contact list to grow the user base.\n\nBlockchain games can import the social graph to enhance their social features. Players will be able to communicate and play with their on-chain friends effortlessly.\nSince users are collaboratively contributing to the decentralized social graph, the increasing adoption of the social graph results in a stronger network effect. A new connection created in one Dapp will benefit all Dapps utilizing the CyberConnect Protocol.\n\n\nWe introduce the concept of a Web 3.0 based IM application we are specifically interested in below: CyberChat. As the showcase of the utilities of the CyberConnect Protocol, CyberChat is expected to be the exemplar of a matrix of Web 3.0 applications based on CyberConnect in the future.\n\n## \nCyberChat\n\n\nEnabling messaging between blockchain addresses and allowing users to socialize with their crypto assets natively will be the next step for completing the social ecosystem on Web 3.0. CyberChat is a trustless Web3.0 chatting app for all blockchain users. More information about Cyberchat will be available soon.\n\n### Future possibilities: DIDs\n\n\nDecentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. It’s a standard created by W3C for users to identify themselves without centralized registries, identify providers and certificate authorities.\n\n\nIn the future, we can use DID as a globally unique identifier for each web3 user and each DID contains private-public key pair for a user to interact with services and data safely. Each DID is also linked to one or multiple blockchain addresses and those addresses could even be on different blockchains.\n\n\nThere are several benefits with this DID approach. Users are uniquely identified without a central authority and user data’s integrity is preserved by DID signature. Users could link different blockchain addresses to one DID, which suits the ever growing Layer1 blockchain landscape. Users will not use their blockchain private key to sign any non-transactional information like sending a message or updating their avatar.\n\nEach DID represents an abstract, key-agnositic, and blockchain-agnostic interfaces used to uniquely identify entities, sign and encrypt information and delegate access control to services.\n\n## \nCyberConnect DAO\n\n### \nDao Governance\n\n\nGovernance of the CyberConnect Protocol is carried out by CyberConenctDAO, consisting of $CYBER token holders. Governance proposals will go through two stages. The first stage is a consensus check and carried out on Snapshot. A minimum token threshold is required to pass any proposal. The second stage is the implementation of government proposals. Only proposals passed the first stage can be finally implemented to the protocol. The code must be audited by professionals before implementation and the audit fee will be reimbursed by the community reserve pool.\n\n$CYBER is the native token of CyberConnectDAO. The DAO is the owner of CyberConnect Protocol. $CYBER holders are members of CyberConenctDAO and share the ownership of the CyberConnect Protocol through the DAO. As the native token, $CYBER serves as an incentive to facilitate governance. CyberConnect team will continue to actively engage with top Web 3.0 projects to expand use cases for $CYBER.\n\n$CYBER token will only be used for governance purposes in the early stage. Functionality-related utilities, such as staking rewards, will be introduced later along with the increasing adoption of the protocol. The total token supply of $CYBER is 100,000,000. More tokenomics information will be shared in the future.\n\n## \nToken incentive program for bootstrapping\n\n\nIn order to bootstrap users’ connection networks, we propose to create a reward pool for early contributors. Early contributors will be rewarded $CYBER token when they add new valid connections to the network. Individuals will be directly rewarded for adding connections, and Dapp developers will also be rewarded for providing the relaying services. The authentication check of connections and rate limits will be applied to prevent spam.\n\n\nThe initial reward pool of the token incentive program contains a total number of 5,000,000 $CYBER. The program supports the addresses on the Ethereum and BSC networks. Only qualified addresses are eligible for the token rewards:\n\n* An address must have transactions on Ethereum/BSC before 2021.8.1 (account history check) \n* An address must have at least 1 transaction after 2021.8.1 (active address check)\n\n### Token rewards \n\n* 1 \\* 0.9^n $CYBER for each connection. e.g. A will get 1 $CYBER for the first connection, 0.9 $CYBER for the second, 0.81 for the third, and so on. \n* 9 \\* 0.9^n extra $CYBER for each mutual connection. e.g. if A follows B and B follows back, A will get 9 extra $CYBER for the first mutual connection, 8.1 for the second, and so on. \n* If those connections are made through an app relay service, the app developer will get rewards that equal x% of the individual rewards (the exact percentage will be determined later on). \n\n### Restrictions \n\n* Users will need to perform Twitter verification before claiming token rewards. \n* One address can only follow up to 5000 addresses. \n* The above details on $CYBER token may subject to change. \n\nProudly presented by CybertinoLab\n\nLinks: \n\n[https://cyberconnect.me/](https://cyberconnect.me/)\n\n[https://discord.gg/xyNGWWgs](https://discord.gg/xyNGWWgs)\n\n[https://t.me/joinchat/aESU7ZaUxh9kNWQx](https://t.me/joinchat/aESU7ZaUxh9kNWQx)\n\n", "timestamp": 1633998103, "digest": "k3pL5s2G3Emdz2iguhypcY3HPJaZLkC7SNB8XjgPkm0", "contributor": "0x148D59faF10b52063071eDdf4Aaf63A395f2d41c"}

BOARDROOM - DAY**\n \n LILI (late 20s), athletic and well-dressed, wears a Suit Supply white linen pinstripe suit that fits her perfectly, paired with high heels.\n \n She's in the middle of a presentation in a conference room, with 12 men at the table and only one other woman.\n \n LILI\nYour same-store sales have dipped 27% from pre-pandemic levels, with some of your locations down more than half. You have six billion outstanding tickets you need to either destroy or circulate before you go digital. That's millions in liabilities based on average redemptions from the average player. Your stock has only increased for two unsustainable reasons. One - word of a buyout has clearly leaked from people in this room. Two - a bunch of people on Reddit thought it would be funny to pretend a dying company was as valuable as Berkshire Hathaway. Given all these considerations, we are offering a generous buy-out price of 13% over the current Breadsticks and Joysticks share price.\n \n The Breadsticks and Joysticks CEO, MELVIN PARKER (early 50s), dressed in a suit that doesn't quite fit him anymore, sits at the end of the table. He stands and bows.\n \n MELVIN\nMy grace, we thank you for your magnanimity. Whatever would we do without you?\n \n LILI\nYou don't think it's a generous offer?\n \n MELVIN\nI think you're offering it so that some other vulture fund doesn't outbid you. It has jack shit to do with your generosity.\n \n LILI\nForgive me for my choice of words. I intended to say that this deal is extremely beneficial for all parties involved. You get your buyouts, we get a company we can turn around.\n \n MELVIN\nYou mean, sell for parts.\n \n LILI\nBreadsticks and Joysticks didn't adapt fast enough. You haven't given up on your weakest locations. You've refused to get rid of your least popular games because you are afraid the hardcore customers will get mad they can't try to beat their high scores. You haven't added food delivery despite having industrial scale kitchens in every big town in America. And you don't have the money to pivot now, not without us.\n \n MELVIN\nLooks like we caught you at the wrong time of the month. We'd be happy to reschedule.\n \n LILI\nExcuse me?\n \n MELVIN\nYou're being very emotional right now. If you would like to take a quick break, maybe go cry in the bathroom, it's right down the hall.\n \n Lili looks right at him. Then she looks to her male co-workers, who don't say anything. She looks at her female co-worker, ASTRID (late twenties), in a sharp black blazer and knee-length skirt, who glares at Melvin. Melvin looks over to Astrid and raises his fist.  \n  \n MELVIN\nAh. Girl power.\n \n Lili's boss, NOAH (early 40s) and very well-dressed in a dark navy suit with a red power tie, sits up.\n \n NOAH\nMelvin...\n \n MELVIN\nI don't want to hear it. This deal is not going to happen.\n \n LILI\nYou have a fiduciary responsibility to bring this offer to your shareholders.\n \n MELVIN\nAnd bring it I will. But I'll point out that we're in preliminary discussions with other funds and are positioned to get a better deal. Or we'll find a fund to take just enough shares to destroy any semblance of control you have. Doesn't really matter. Either way, it isn't happening how you want it to. Thank you for your time.\n \n Melvin, already standing, walks out. He's followed by the rest of his employees, who scurry to collect their things and leave. Noah and the rest of Lili's co-workers stand.\n \n NOAH\nWhat the hell was that?\n \n LILI\nWhat? You sitting silently while he talked to me like that? Not even a murmur of support.\n \n NOAH\nYou really came off like a bitch.\n \n LILI I did the exact same thing when we practiced the pitch beforehand! You had absolutely no problems with it then. The problem was him. Not me, not the facts, not the offer.  \n   \n NOAH\nThat's a matter of perspective.\n \n LILI\nIt's a matter of fact.\n \n NOAH\nI knew you weren't ready, I knew I shouldn't let you work on this. This is magnitudes bigger than the cosmetics companies you've turned around.\n \n LILI\nDid you forget that I led the Series A round for the biggest fintech firm in Africa? It was just a few months ago.\n \n NOAH\nJust some developing world shit. This here is the big leagues.\n \n LILI\nAnd what, you're the captain of the New York Yankees?\n \n NOAH\nI'm a lot closer than you are. Melvin was right, you are emotional. Take the day, get it together. I'll see you tomorrow.\n \n Noah and the men leave. Astrid waits behind and walks out with Lili.\n \n **INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS**\n \n They don't say anything as they head down the hallway and into the elevator.\n \n **EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER**\n \n Lili and Astrid walk through the lobby and exit the building. They don't break their silence until they get outside.\n \n LILI  \n I'm going to destroy them.  \n  \n ASTRID\nMelvin? Or Noah?\n \n LILI\nYes.\n \n The camera follows as Lili looks up and sees a convention center across the street from the office building. There's a huge sign for \"CON-Con: Celebrating Grifts, Scams, Hustles, and Heists.\"\n \n CUT TO:\n \n **INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**\n \n FBI Special Agent DAVID MACKIN (early 30s), dressed professionally but inexpensively in an ill-fitting polyester suit, sits at a small table across from a larger table, behind which 3 DISCIPLINARY PANEL MEMBERS sit.\n \n PANEL MEMBER ONE\nDo you know why you're here, Special Agent Mackin?\n \n MACKIN\nI have a couple ideas.\n \n PANEL MEMBER TWO\nWould you like to elaborate?\n \n MACKIN\nI'd rather you just told me.\n \n PANEL MEMBER TWO\nI'd like to refer you to the incident on August 2nd.\n \n CUT TO:\n \n **EXT. WAREHOUSE - FLASHBACK - DAY**\n \n Mackin enters a taped-off crime scene. A local male police officer, OFFICER TOWLES (early 30s), professional, stops him.\n \n OFFICER TOWLES\nSir, you're going to want to take one of these masks. It smells awful in there.\n \n MACKIN No need. Iron stomach. \n   \n Mackin taps his stomach confidently. He walks in. Camera ZOOMS IN to the back of his head as he stops and immediately throws up. We see his head go down and hear him but we don't see it.\n \n CUT TO:\n \n **INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - BACK TO PRESENT**\n \n The panel members continue to stare down Mackin.\n \n PANEL MEMBER ONE\nYou compromised all the evidence at the scene. It was our best chance to catch the Crapper King and we lost it.\n \n PANEL MEMBER TWO\nIf that were the only incident, you wouldn't be here. Do you remember September 11th?\n \n MACKIN\nNever forget.\n \n PANEL MEMBER TWO\nSeptember 11th, 2021.\n \n MACKIN\nI stand by it.\n \n PANEL MEMBER TWO\nLet's go over what happened.\n \n CUT TO:\n \n **INT. WAREHOUSE - FLASHBACK - DAY**\nMackin enters a taped-off crime scene - a warehouse with a single computer in the middle of it. Mackin carries a cup of coffee. He's escorted by a local female police officer, OFFICER BELL (late 20s).\n \n MACKIN\nWhat do we have here?\n \n OFFICER BELL By the time we got here, the place was emptied out. Save for this one computer and all these wires. \n   \n Mackin trips over the wire, spilling his coffee all over the computer.\n \n CUT TO:\n \n **INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**\n \n The panel members stare at Mackin incredulously.\n \n PANEL MEMBER TWO\nYou have ruined so many crime scenes in such a short period that we began an investigation. We thought you may have gotten paid off to destroy evidence. So we started by checking your bank accounts. Do you realize you only have a few thousand dollars? We weren't really sure how that was possible.\n \n PANEL MEMBER ONE\nSo we speculated that maybe you spent all your money on a big house. We sent someone by your address and saw it was just an apartment. It's fine. And you don't have any cars in your name other than your government-issued one.\n \n PANEL MEMBER THREE\nIt's possible you got paid in cash and you're just stashing it, since you clearly aren't spending it on clothes.\n \n Mackin looks down at his clothes and frowns.\n \n PANEL MEMBER TWO\nOur investigation then found that you're chronically single, so it's unlikely you're spending all your money on a partner.\n \n MACKIN\nI just met a nice lady on Tinder.\n \n PANEL MEMBER TWO So you're spending all your corruption money on a lady you just met?  \n  \n MACKIN\nNo! I barely know her! We even split drinks the first date.\n \n PANEL MEMBER TWO\nThat bodes well... so then what did you do with the corruption money?\n \n MACKIN\nWhat? There is no corruption money!\n \n PANEL MEMBER ONE\nWe didn't think so either. Which led us to one conclusion. Do you know what it is?\n \n MACKIN\nI'm clumsy?\n \n PANEL MEMBER THREE\nYou're bad at your job.\n \n Mackin looks around.\n \n MACKIN\nOh. Does this mean I'm fired?\n \n Panel members look at each other and start laughing.\n \n PANEL MEMBER THREE\nOh, oh goodness, no. We're not allowed to fire you yet. We have to give you a shot at redemption. Unless you're on the take - which we've determined you're not - or if you stole money or lied about how many hours you worked. Did you steal money or lie about how many hours you worked?\n \n MACKIN\nI did not.\n \n PANEL MEMBER TWO\nThat's good. We're PIP-ing you.\n \n MACKIN\nMa'am?\n \n PANEL MEMBER TWO\nPIP. Performance Improvement Plan. Your work has been determined to be unacceptable in one or more critical categories.\n\nThis panel has verbally provided this judgment, and this document provides the judgment in written form, along with what is needed to bring your performance up to an acceptable level.  \n   \n ZOOM IN on Mackin's face as the panel member continues.\n \n PANEL MEMBER TWO (O.C.)\nYou have a six month opportunity period to improve your performance. If you do not, then we can fire you or demote you. Best of luck to you, Agent Mackin.\n \n CUT TO:\n \n **INT.

CONVENTION CENTER - SAME TIME**\n \n TOMMY (mid-twenties), Eric's friend, athletic and neatly dressed, stands in a busy conference hall.\n \n TOMMY\nYou're going to miss the Heat panel. Al Pacino's agent and Val Kilmer's body double are going to do an oral history that we absolutely cannot miss.\n \n ERIC\nDon't make me feel worse than I already do. You know I've always wanted to see Rick Nicita--\n \n Vince comes out of the office and interrupts.\n \n VINCE  \n ERIC!   \n  \n Eric takes the phone away from his ear.\nEND INTERCUT.\n \n ERIC\nYes, sir?\n \n VINCE\nIs that my dog's portrait artist?\n \n ERIC\nNo sir, Sven called earlier to say he isn't available until next week because he's working on 50 Cent's dog this week.\n \n VINCE\nOprah?\n \n ERIC\nNo sir, 50 Cent.\n \n VINCE\nI know that, Eric. His dog is named Oprah.\n \n ERIC\nI assume it was Oprah then. Unless he has a second dog. Does he?\n \n VINCE\nI don't know, DOES HE?\n \n ERIC\nI don't know.\n \n VINCE\nSo who are you on the phone with?\n \n ERIC\nMy friend is waiting for me.\n \n VINCE\nSo it's a personal call?\nERIC\nIt is.\n \n VINCE I think someone needs to re-read Chapter Two of \"The New Art of War.\"  \n   \n ERIC\nI don't usually take personal calls, I was just supposed to be off today.\n \n VINCE Oh. That's great. You know that work-life balance is incredibly important to me. That's why we have unlimited paid time off at (screaming) SARGENTT \n \nAll the employees, including Eric, immediately stand.\n \n ALL  \n (screaming) SIR YESSIR.  \n  \n ERIC (quietly) Sir yessir.  \n  \n VINCE (screaming) AT EASE.  \n Everyone sits back down. Eric picks up the phone.\n \n ERIC\nI'm going to have to call you back.\n \n VINCE\nI am glad you're taking time for yourself. Very important for one's mental health. Just keep your phone on in case I need you.\n \n ERIC\nYes, sir.\n \n CUT TO:\n \n **INT. PRIVATE EQUITY OFFICES - MORNING**\n \n Lili and Astrid sit in Lili's office. Noah and the men walk past her office, looking at her and murmuring.\n \n LILI  \n I'm allegedly the emotional one but those boys haven't spoken to me in three days. \n   \n ASTRID\nForget them. What are you going to do?\n \n LILI\nI have a foolproof plan.\n \n ASTRID\nGo on.\n \n LILI\nWell, like I said, I'm going to destroy all of them.\n \n ASTRID\nThat sounds like more of an overarching goal than a plan.\n \n LILI\nI was getting to it!\n \n ASTRID\nSorry.\n \n LILI\nSo, after that travesty of a meeting, I went home to meditate. And the whole plan came to me.\n \n ASTRID\nNot really the point of meditation.\n \n LILI\nI can't control when inspiration strikes.\n \n ASTRID\nIt's probably good that you've only meditated twice since 2012.\n \n LILI\nIf I had known it'd be so good for destroying my enemies I would've done it a lot more.\n \n ASTRID\nSo what's the plan?\n \n LILI First, I realized that I need to do this quickly. No doubt in my mind that Melvin will be cancelled within two years, I just don't have that kind of time.   \n  \n ASTRID\nSo general misogyny won't get him quickly enough. You planning to speed it up with a sex scandal?\n \n LILI\nIt's not 1998, no one gives a shit about sex scandals.\n \n ASTRID\nGot it. Embezzlement then?\n \n LILI\nTheir books were airtight. It was tragic.\n \n ASTRID\nSo sex is out, as is white collar crime. I don't see many more options.\n \n LILI\nI didn't either until I remembered watching TNT the previous night.\n \n ASTRID\nIt's insane that you still have cable.\n \n LILI\nWe're going to have to table that for later. As I was saying, I remembered seeing \"Now You See Me\"...\n \n ASTRID\nThat movies must have been six hours long on cable.\n \n LILI\nFive and half but no one likes a counter. So the movie hooked me immediately. I was absolutely shocked when the FBI agent was the ring leader the whole time and no one, even the crew, knew it.\n \n ASTRID So you're going to join the FBI and take him down? The hiring and training will take years. \n   \n LILI No! I'm going to orchestrate a heist from behind the scenes.  \n  \n ASTRID\nYour whole life will be ruined if you get caught.\n \n LILI\nThat's why I said orchestrate. I'm not going to be personally involved in the actual operation. I know exactly where I'm going to find a crew to steal all those arcade tickets from Breadsticks and Joysticks.\n \n ASTRID\nThey're just pieces of paper.\n \n LILI\nSo is money. And that's besides the point. The heist will make them into an even bigger joke and will tank their stock price. The investigation will create a mountain of hassles for the company. Eventually the board will want to cut bait with Melvin and they'll cut a deal at my price.\n \n ASTRID\nOr a lower price.\n \n LILI\nOr a lower price.\n \n ASTRID\nI like the outline. I just don't get how you're going to convince some idiot to do the robbery.\n \n LILI\nI would call it a heist, not a robbery. Robbers would knock over some random location. This heist crew will steal all the tickets from the warehouse.\n \n ASTRID And you think you can convince someone to do it?   \n  \n LILI\nNot someone. Some dude.\n \n ASTRID\nEven dudes aren't that stupid.\n \n LILI\nCan I ask you a question?\n \n ASTRID\nOf course.\n \n LILI\nYou're still dating Winston, right?\n \n ASTRID\nI am.\n \n LILI\nAnd how long have you been together?\n \n ASTRID\nA little over a year now.\n \n LILI\nAnd does Winston still wear cargo shorts?\n \n ASTRID\nHe does not.\n \n LILI\nAnd does he wear sunscreen?\n \n ASTRID\nHe does.\n \n LILI\nAnd does he remember to call his mom on her birthday?\n \n ASTRID\nYes.\n \n LILI And do you think he thinks that he  -- by himself -- came to the conclusion that he didn't need so many pockets or that skin cancer was bad or that he could just put his mom's birthday in his calendar?  \n   \n ASTRID\nMy god.\n \n LILI\nWhat?\n \n ASTRID\nYou're going to be able to pull this off.\n \n CUT TO:\n \n **INT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY**\n \n Lili walks through the convention hall for CONCon, dressed in a suit reminiscent of Brad Pitt in Ocean's Eleven with a huge collar over the lapels. The look is an extremely fashionable version of an unfashionable costume.\n \n Lili walks up to a couple of guys in their early 20s, DOM and TORRETO, who are talking excitedly near a sign for the Art Heist Panel.\n \n LILI\nHi! You guys excited for the Art Heist Panel or what?\n \n DOM\nWhat?\n \n LILI\nYou guys seem really excited, I was wondering if it was about the panel?\n \n DOM\nOh. No, we weren't talking about the panel.\n \n TORRETO\nWe were talking about--\n \n DOM\nStop.\n \n TORRETO\nWe could use someone else's opinion since we don't agree.\n \n DOM But we don't even know her.  \n   \n LILI\nI'd love to be the tiebreaker.\n \n DOM\nFine.\n \n TORRETO\nWe were trying to decide if it's gross to have a crush on your stepsister.\n \n LILI\nIt is.\n \n Lili turns and walks away. She walks through the crowd until she sees another guy, JOSS, early 20s, standing alone, looking like he needs a friend.\n \n LILI\nHi!\n \n JOSS\nHello.\n \n LILI\nWhat brings you to CONCon?\n \n JOSS\nWhere are you from?\n \n LILI\nExcuse me?\n \n JOSS\nYou don't look like anyone here. Where are you from?\n \n LILI\nA place called Mahwah.\n \n JOSS\nSounds exotic.\n \n LILI\nIt's in New Jersey.\n \n Lili walks away from him too. Then she sees a guy in his late twenties, OLIVER, standing with some confidence. She approaches.\n \n LILI Hi!  \n   \n OLIVER\nAre you a gold digger?\n \n LILI\nAre you rich?\n \n OLIVER\nWouldn't you like to know?\n \n LILI\nNot really.\n \n Lili turns and walks away, concerned her plan might not work. She stops by a random stall and then looks around at the crowd.\n\n[crowdfund://0x8d76Cf97E373444c1aA8778b1fe056d3B07505fF?features=overview,editions](crowdfund://0x8d76Cf97E373444c1aA8778b1fe056d3B07505fF?features=overview,editions)\n\n\n \n The camera PANS OVER as we start following Eric and Tommy walking through the main hall.\n\n[crowdfund://undefined?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://undefined?features=overview,backers)\n\nTOMMY\nI cannot believe you missed the Logan Lucky session too. Everyone got to use the industrial vacuum to suck up all the money. It was so sick.\n \n ERIC\nYou don't have to keep rubbing it in.\n \n TOMMY\nI just don't get why you work for that doofus.\n \n ERIC\nThat doofus was on TechCrunch's 25 Under 25 Tech Visionaries list.\n \n TOMMY  \n Doesn't mean he's not a doofus.  \n  \n ERIC  \n People are pretty forgiving of doofuses who are visionaries.  \n  \n TOMMY  \n Is the plural of doofus, doofuses, or is it just doofus, like moose?  \n  \n ERIC\nNow that I think about it, it's probably doofi, like alumnus and alumni.\n\nTOMMY\nI think you're right. Should we check out the Baby Driver section? I heard they have a virtual reality set-up that lets you be the getaway driver.\n \n ERIC\nThat's incredible. I'll meet you over there, I didn't get to grab any food today with all the chaos at the office.\n \n TOMMY\nGot it, see you over there.\n \n Tommy walks away as Eric heads to the food concession area.\n \n **INT. CONVENTION CENTER - CONCESSION AREA - MOMENTS LATER**\n \n Eric stands at a high top table with a hot dog and a churro. He's not looking around, he's not looking at his phone, he's just taking a moment to himself.\n \n ANGLE ON: Lili sees Eric from a distance and something clicks. She begins to walk towards him. Eric notices her when she's still some distance away and is confused by her eye contact. He looks around, assuming she must be walking towards someone else.\n \n Lili waves at him and he points at himself. Lili nods \"yes\" and finally reaches him. Eric realizes he needs to finish chewing his hot dog and he does so quickly.\n \n LILI\nHi there.\n \n ERIC\nHi.\n \n LILI\nWhat's your name?\n \n ERIC\nEric. And you are... Rusty Ryan from Ocean's Eleven? It's a pleasure.\n \n LILI  \n Good eye. Most people have been giving me vacant stares. \n \nERIC\nDon't mind them, they're just confused they're actually seeing a woman at this thing.\n \n LILI\nYou wouldn't believe the reactions I've gotten when I said hello to people.\n \n ERIC\nI think I can guess. Have some sympathy though, they don't have many strange women coming and chatting them up. I know I don't.\n \n LILI\nI'm strange?\n \n ERIC\nI meant more like stranger but who knows, maybe you are also strange. You are talking to randos at a convention.\n \n LILI\nAren't you supposed to meet people with similar interests at conventions?\n \n ERIC\nYou're supposed to gawk at the few women who show up and get photos with C-list celebrities. But why not change things up. I'm Eric.\n \n LILI\nI'm El.\n \n ERIC\nHi, El. So why'd you come talk to me?\n \n LILI\nI'm not really sure. You don't look like a pervert or a complete lunatic. After the gawkers, I almost got trampled to death when they opened the Baby Driver Driving  \n Experience. You seemed chill. \n   \n ERIC\nYeah, I needed a minute. Long day at work, asshole boss. Tale as old as time.\n \n LILI\nI also figured that I had the option to just breeze past you if you seemed like a creep as I got closer.\n \n ERIC\nFoolproof plan.\n \n LILI\nBut then I saw that you have kind eyes and I decided to take the risk.\n \n ERIC\nYou're a very honest person.\n \n LILI\nI try to lie only when it's absolutely necessary.\n \n ERIC\nThat's a good policy.\n \n LILI\nI think so.\n \n ERIC\nSo...\n \n LILI\nSo?\n \n ERIC\nI'm not sure what to do next.\n \n LILI\nYou want to explore with me?\nEric points his thumb to his right.\n \n ERIC\nI'm with my friend, Tommy.\n \n LILI\nHi, Tommy.\n \n ERIC  \n What?   \n  \n LILI\nTommy, the invisible friend standing next to you.\n \n ERIC\nHe's a real friend over in that general direction.\n \n LILI\nYou sure about that?\n \n ERIC\nI didn't doubt it until this minute.\n \n LILI\nWell, let's find this Tommy just to confirm he exists. Where exactly do you think he is?\n \n ERIC\nThe Baby Driver Driving Experience.\n \n Lili laughs.\n \n ERIC\n \n I can see him any time. Let's go.\n \n LILI\nYou should probably finish your churro over this table. You'll be a lot less charming with sugar and cinnamon all over your shirt.\n \n Eric nods and starts eating the churro carefully over the table.\n \n CUT TO:\n \n **INT. MACKIN'S CAR - DAY**\n \n Mackin sits, looking at his phone. He's in a cryptocurrency wallet. It shows his investment in CAPUCHIN COIN, a fictional cryptocurrency. \n   \n It shows two categories - \"PURCHASE PRICE (Cost Basis) - $122,242\" and \"CURRENT VALUE (NET LIQUIDATION) - $4,483.\" There is a line graph below it showing the dramatic decrease.\n \n Mackin turns his rearview mirror to give himself a motivational speech.\n \n MACKIN\nYou may not have any money because you made a bad investment or two. But you're still a good guy.\n \n Mackin puts down his phone and picks up the formal PIP document, titled \"PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN for SPECIAL AGENT Mackin.\"\n \n He looks at the first line, which reads \"CORE COMPETENCY - COLLABORATION -  \n Agent must establish contacts and interact effectively with external agencies, government officials, the community and internal Bureau contacts; display professionalism while working with others to achieve common goals; and to proactively share information with others when appropriate.\"\n \n Mackin continues his motivational speech.\n \n MACKIN\nYou are a Special Agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. You made it through Quantico. You did so many push-ups. You read so many PowerPoints. That one instructor even said you were the best paper pusher he'd ever seen.\n \n Mackin improves his posture, puffs out his chest.\n \n MACKIN\nPeople like you. People trust you. People believe in you. You got this.\nMackin gets out of his car with gusto.\n \n CUT TO:\n \n **EXT. JEWELRY STOREFRONT - MOMENTS LATER**\n \n Mackin hasn't even closed the door when he hears Officer Bell from the crime scene flashback.\n \n OFFICER BELL\nWere you just talking to yourself?\n \n MACKIN\nWhat?\n \n OFFICER BELL In your car. Were you just talking to yourself?  \n   \n MACKIN\nNo. No, I was on a hands-free call.\n \n OFFICER BELL\nWere you?\n \n MACKIN\nYes.\n \n OFFICER BELL\nOkay.\n \n Mackin breathes a sigh of relief as if he's gotten through the interrogation. Officer Bell notices and shakes her head. Officer Towles, from the other crime scene flashback, approaches.\n \n OFFICER TOWLES\nWhat are you doing here?\n \n MACKIN\nI was told the local police requested FBI support.\n \n OFFICER BELL\nWe did. But we were hoping for Smalls.\n \n OFFICER TOWLES\nOh yeah, she's great.\n \n OFFICER BELL\nOr maybe Largesse.\n \n OFFICER TOWLES\nAlso great.\n \n MACKIN\nThat's not even a person! I mean Smalls is a wonderful person, but Largesse? Come on.\nBell and Towles bump fists to celebrate getting Mackin riled up.\n \n OFFICER BELL\nLook. You could understand why we'd be a little nervous after what happened last time.\n \n MACKIN I left my coffee in my car. I have cotton balls ready in case it's another King Crapper scene.  \n   \n OFFICER BELL\nIt's not.\n \n MACKIN\nOkay. Then I don't need those. So no coffee, no smells. I'm good to go. Show me what we're looking at.\n \n OFFICER TOWLES\nOkay, so this window was shattered. The alarm didn't go off.\nMackin gesticulates along with his words as part of his efforts to improve his communication. He comes off looking ridiculous.\n \n MACKIN\nSo we're thinking this is a sign of forced entry. The hole is pretty small, so we're looking for someone petite. They had to avoid the security system lasers, so this guy or gal is pretty nimble too. So we're thinking this is a real professional job.\n \n OFFICER TOWLES\nI don't think we're thinking any of those things.\n \n OFFICER BELL\nIt's not even that small a hole.\n \n OFFICER TOWLES\nWe think it was an inside job and the owner broke the window to make it look legit.\n \n MACKIN\nNo way, this guy or gal was serious. No one would break into their own store.\n \n OFFICER TOWLES\nInsurance fraud is super common.\n \n MACKIN Not possible.  \n  \n Over Mackin's shoulder, we see another POLICE OFFICER, arm on a VERY LARGE MAN in custody.  \n   \n OFFICER\nWe caught this guy a few blocks away. He's got jewelry in all his pockets. And some other places too.\n \n SUSPECT\nNo, no, this is all a big misunderstanding. I own the store.\n \n Bell and Towles look at Mackin.\n \n OFFICER BELL\nSee.\n \n SUSPECT\nAnd, and, there was no break-in. I was moving the inventory to do, to do a deep cleaning of the store.\n \n OFFICER BELL\nCan you play back that 9-1-1 call?\n \n OFFICER TOWLES\nSure can.\n \n Towles fiddles with his phone for a few seconds and then the recording begins. It's definitely the suspect's voice.\n \n SUSPECT (V.O.)\nMY STORE! IT'S BEEN ROBBED! 2323 MAIN STREET!\n \n OFFICER BELL\n(to Suspect)\nMisunderstanding, huh?\n(to Mackin)\nI don't think we'll be needing your expertise any more, Special Agent Mackin.\n \n Mackin nods and walks back to his car.\n \n **INT. MACKIN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS**\n \n Mackin grabs his PIP document and draws an 'X' over \"COLLABORATION\".\n \n **INT. KARAOKE BAR - EVENING** Mackin sits with ABIGAIL (late twenties), dressed well but comfortable enough for a night out at a booth in a karaoke bar. \n   \n MACKIN\nIt was brutal.\n \n ABIGAIL\nIt sounds brutal.\n \n MACKIN\nI knew I made a few mistakes, but to keep messing up after they so clearly laid out my issues. I'm not sure I'm cut out for this.\n \n ABIGAIL\nThat might be true. Do you even like being an FBI Special Agent?\n \n MACKIN\nI mean, it sounds better than \"accountant,\" and even \"forensic accountant.\"\nAbigail's boyfriend and Mackin's best friend DEVON (early 30s), dressed to impress with a tie slightly undone, sits next to ABIGAIL.\n \n DEVON\nWhat are you guys talking about?\n \n ABIGAIL\nWhether he should be an FBI agent.\n \n DEVON\nAbigail! We have to encourage him!\n \n ABIGAIL\nHe might not be a good FBI agent!\n \n DEVON\nOf course he is!\n(to Mackin)\nOf course you are! That's ridiculous! You've made a couple mistakes, sure. But who doesn't?\n \n MACKIN\nNot like mine.\n \n Abigail tries to recover after a stare from Devon.\n \n ABIGAIL Devon is right, Mack. Everyone makes mistakes. \n   \n MACKIN\nYou're just being nice because he wants you to be.\n \n DEVON\nI've prosecuted your cases. I know you can do good work. U.S. attorneys aren't known for tolerating slapdash garbage.\n \n MACKIN\nI don't know, guys. Maybe I'll quit.\n \n ABIGAIL\nWhat would you want to do?\n \n MACKIN\nI've always wanted to be a writer. I could pen a novel about a down-on-his-luck government employee trying to make the world a better place.\n \n ABIGAIL\nOkay, no one wants to read that book.\n \n DEVON\nSorry, buddy, I'm with her.\n \n MACKIN\nMaybe I'll make it a movie then.\n \n DEVON\nEven Netflix isn't that desperate.\n \n MACKIN\nI'm going to sing my feelings.\n \n Mackin gets up and walks over to the karaoke machine.\n \n CUT TO:\n \n **INT. CONVENTION CENTER - EVENING**\n \n Lili and Eric stroll through the hall without Tommy. We catch them in the middle of their conversation.\n \n LILI No way. \n   \n ERIC\nYes way.\n \n LILI\nCars are the absolute lamest thing you can steal. They only need a key. The getaway car is the same as the thing you stole. It's a total cop out.\n \n ERIC\nAbsolutely not. \"Gone in Sixty Seconds\" is peak Nic Cage.\n \n LILI\nYou two are friends?\n \n ERIC\nWhat?\n \n LILI\nI mean you called him Nic instead of Nicolas. I assume you two are close?\n \n ERIC\nIf only.\n \n LILI\nAlso, \"The Rock\" is peak Nicolas Cage.\n \n ERIC\nEither way, it's an amazing movie. He steals all those incredible cars.\n \n LILI\nSo lame.\n \n ERIC\nWhat's your pick then?\n \n LILI\nHas to be art. Or at least involve a museum.\n \n ERIC\nLike 'National Treasure.'\n \n LILI That might be peak Nicolas Cage! And yes. 'Lupin,' 'Ocean's 8...' \n   \n ERIC\n'Entrapment!'\n \n LILI\nI assume it was a formative experience to hear Catherine Zeta Jones breath heavily as she rehearsed her laser avoidance.\n \n ERIC\nNot as formative as the music video for 'My Immortal' by Evanescence but yeah, you assume correctly.\n \n LILI\nHow dark and brooding of you.\n \n ERIC\nI could never do that kind of heist. I don't have the hand-eye coordination required.\n \n LILI\nWhat makes you say that?\n \n ERIC\nI was only mediocre at sports growing up. I can't draw or paint. And I went to an arcade the other day for my niece's birthday and it seems I haven't gotten much better.\n \n Lili pauses to think for a second, seeing an opening.\n \n LILI\nWhich one?\n \n ERIC\nBreadsticks and Joysticks. Do you know it?\n \n LILI\nSure do. My company tried to buy it, they're a bunch of pricks. And those games are built to make you lose.\n \n ERIC\nThat's what I figured.\n \n LILI  \n It's amazing that their business is going bust despite how rigged the whole thing is. \n   \n ERIC\nThe prizes were super legit though.\n \n LILI\nToo legit. Most people just light their money on fire but a few people do so well that they win hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff every year.\n \n ERIC\nI met one of those guys! And by \"guy,\" I mean a pre-teen boy.\n \n LILI\nPre-teen boys are the most dangerous people in the world.\n \n ERIC\nSo those guys are the ones tanking the company?\n \n LILI\nJust to be clear, the company absolutely deserves to tank. And I wouldn't say that's the biggest problem but it could definitely be the nail in the coffin.\n \n ERIC\nWhat do you mean?\n \n LILI\nI warned them over and over again that their prizes were too good. They'd say \"El, you just don't get it, we have to keep people coming in.\" And I'd say, \"you just don't get it, we're spending millions on iPads and autographs when people would happily win knick-knacks.\"\n \n ERIC\nThat's so crazy! This kid gave my niece an iPad he won. An IPAD! Not to sound like a Boomer but back in my day, arcades only had knick-knacks. And I love knick-knacks.\n \n LILI  \n Everyone does. Marie Kondo wouldn't be famous if they didn't.  \n  \n ERIC\nThey probably should've listened to you.\n \n LILI\nI think so too! So they'd have millions of tickets at the various locations sitting in some box with a flimsy lock. Because of those ridiculous prizes, that's just real money sitting there. Even worse, there were literally billions of tickets at this warehouse outside of town.\n \n ERIC\nWhat are they worth?\n \n LILI  \n I once asked the CEO to guess. All he did was laugh. Then all the other executives started laughing too. He said the tickets weren't worth anything, nobody would ever think to steal them. They kept laughing until I left, humiliated. They would be humiliated if someone redeemed hundreds of millions of dollars in prizes with stolen tickets though.  \n  \n Eric starts walking slower as he processes what he's hearing.\n \n ERIC\nWe should do it.\n \n LILI\nDo what?\n \n ERIC\nThe exact thing that jerk and your bosses laughed at you for suggesting. A heist.\n \n LILI\nYou're kidding.\n \n ERIC I'm serious. I might not be able to do anything about my asshole boss but we can do something about yours. And come on, we met at CONCon. I've never been one for fate, but what better place to hatch a plan?  \n  \n LILI\nYou're crazy.\n \n ERIC\nMaybe.\n \n LILI\nHow about we think about it a bit more?\n \n ERIC\nSmart. A heist crew should never be rash.\n \n LILI\nWe're not a crew!\n \n ERIC\nNot yet.\n \n Lili smiles.\n \n LILI\nNot yet.\n \n Eric starts walking at a normal pace.\n \n ERIC\nLet's go find out if Tommy is real or a figment of my imagination.\n \n CUT TO:\n** \n INT. KARAOKE BAR - EVENING**\n \n Abigail and Devon sit alone at the table.\n \n ABIGAIL \n Do you think he's okay?\n \n DEVON\nI think we're about to see.\n \n They look over to see Mackin, who is now sitting on the stage with his legs crossed. Billie Eilish's Ocean Eyes starts playing.  \n  \n MACKIN\nAaaaahhh aaaah aaaah/Aaaah aaaah aaaaaah/Uuuuh aaaah uuuuhhhh/I've been watching you/For some time/Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes...\n \n DEVON\nHe's definitely not okay.\n \n ABIGAIL\nNot at all.\n \n MACKIN\nNo faaaaaaaiiir/You really know how to make me cry with those ocean eyes/I'm scaaaaared, I've never fallen from quite this high/Fallin' into your ocean eyes...\n \n DEVON\nPlease be nicer to him when he gets back.\n \n The song fades out. Mackin stands and walks back to the booth.\n \n DEVON\nThat was great, buddy.\n \n ABIGAIL\nYou have a beautiful voice.\n \n DEVON\nA generational talent.\n \n ABIGAIL\nBorn songbird.\n \n MACKIN.  \n I know what you guys are trying to do. And I appreciate it. It's just hard. All I ever wanted to be was an FBI agent and it turns out I'm not even good at it. Do you have any idea what it's like to accomplish your dream and then have it all fall apart?  \n  \n Before they can answer, Mackin looks over their heads, recognizing his new girlfriend walking in. \n   \n MACKIN\nYou came! I wasn't sure you'd make it. You just missed my song.\n \n The camera pans around as Abigail and Devon turn their heads.\n \n MACKIN.\nGuys, this is Lili, she's the girl I've been telling you about.\n \n LILI\nVery nice to met you both. Mack, maybe we could go sing together?\n \n The camera lingers on Lili as Mackin responds.\n \n MACKIN\nSure!\n \n FADE OUT.\n \n END OF ACT ONE", "timestamp": 1634000630, "digest": "XIU_1S5b-u4O-1l2CGIqjRS7SmX9-mekBzx4e0bZu9E", "contributor": "0xDDf5523DA3921b63F5Cd6e21998e8D07D329d6D7"}

The goal is to ship 30 essays in 30 days. These are short, \\~250 words, and designed to help you think concisely and get into a habit of publishing daily. The program recommends that you use a tool called Typeshare. Typeshare is a simple to use, social blogging tool. It’s nice. But today I wanted to post a picture, and it wouldn’t let me do that. So here I am. Every once in a while, I’ll compile [my shorter thoughts](https://typeshare.co/g/jeremyolken) into a longer form piece here.\n\n## Background\n\nOriginally, I wanted to explore technology, culture, and the implications of web3. It hit me that it might be easier to do so through the lens of a specific business. I thought for a minute and realized that there aren’t many mature web3 native consumer businesses. So, instead of analyzing one, let’s build one over the course of 30 days.\n\nNot all centralized services will be replaced by decentralized ones, but there are certain characteristics that make some of them prime for disruption. Tracking your golf handicap certainly fits the mold and we’ll dive deeper into why in a further piece.\n\nWith that said, we’re going to create golf.xyz, a dApp and DAO tool that allows golfers to track their handicaps. Maybe we’ll even bring it to life.\n\n## The Inspiration\n\nThe idea was inspired by Chris Dixon’s, [Come for the tool, stay for the network](https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network). In it, he lays out a strategy for bootstrapping a network by “attracting users with a single-player tool and then, over time, get them to participate in a network”. The tool provides initial utility, gathering a critical mass of users, and the network helps to shape the product and create long-term value.\n\n## Where we’re going\n\nOver the next 27 days, I’m going to build out the business model and dev plans for golf.xyz. In the process, we’re going to explore all aspects of the web3 and golf ecosystems. Based on the functionality of our application, here’s a rough outline.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/samDEPz413VSxvkGq2NLw.jpg?height=540&width=960)\n\nWithin each of those sections, I’ll give a brief overview and discuss what the implications are on golf.xyz. Most of these will happen in shorter form on my Typeshare blog. Once I feel there’s enough to fill in a comprehensive piece of the puzzle, I’ll come back here.\n\nIn 27 days, I’ll have a fully baked plan and might even launch a crowdfund to get this thing off the ground. I’ll dive into why you would want to be a part of that crowdfund when we talk about NFTs.\n\n## Speaking of NFTs\n\nIf you’re a golfer, you know how important having a handicap is. It allows you to play in sanctioned tournaments, establishes your strokes gained in league play, and serves as a way to identify yourself among other players.\n\nWith golf.xyz, you will be able to display your handicap in the comfort of your wallet. And that’s just the start. Holding the Handicap NFT acts as your entrance into the world of golf in web3. This isn’t so crazy when you realize that your current handicap, held by local golf clubs, allows you to play in leagues and tournaments.\n\nAnd that’s just the surface-level implications. There’s so much to explore and I’m excited to dive in. See you all in a few days.", "timestamp": 1634003826, "digest": "spAN9FgIGSaNYrZKG5FCJ0TspcgxaTvkWrid6-BIn6Q", "contributor": "0x9256812d06f6F1D0ACC6A676131965Aad11f8727"}

{"id": "yegWOmegOQg5KzGrP4LVtH_NBqxXnoRiY_qQFdilyYE", "title": "DAOs Are Eating The World", "body": "## DAOs Will Replace Companies In Our Lifetime\n\n![Group of people sharing a success.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*AB7uDsl9nnVe6ASrzH499g.jpeg)\n\nWe learned a lot from the Covid pandemic. Governments ran the money printing machines on full steam. There’s more [money in the economy](https://www.cityam.com/almost-a-fifth-of-all-us-dollars-were-created-this-year/) than ever before in history. and it’s only getting worse.\n\nUnderstandably, millions have abandoned government-backed fiat in favor of Bitcoin and [cryptocurrency](https://medium.com/the-capital/what-the-heck-is-cryptocurrency-54a9001b83c3).\n\nBy every measure, Bitcoin is objectively better [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money) than US dollars.\n\nBut there is an even more exciting innovation right around the corner. They’re called [DAOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)).\n\n# DAOs Are Crypto-Native Companies\n\nDAO stands for *decentralized autonomous organization*. It’s decentralized because there’s no formal leadership. It’s autonomous because it can do anything the members decide. And basically, it’s just an organization.\n\nThe best way to understand DAOs is like a company. They have many similarities. Here are just a few.\n\n* Organize individuals for a cause\n* Solve society’s problems by creating value\n* Provide an opportunity for wealth generation (both individually and for society at large)\n\nTo better understand the similarity, we need to look at the history of companies. It’s a social construct that’s much older than you might think.\n\n# Early Companies\n\nIndividual humans can’t do very much. Even today, we have tools and technology offering infinite leverage. And yet, most people fail to make a lasting impact. Individuals were even more limited before the industrial revolution.\n\nIn order to have real power, you need leverage. Today, there are 4 ways to get leverage.\n\n* Labor\n* Capital\n* Media\n* Code\n\nThe oldest form of leverage is labor. We’ve been taking advantage of that leverage for thousands of years. We did this with the invention of governments. This helped large groups of people coordinate toward a common cause.\n\nThis largely explains why we saw relatively no innovation for most of history. But one day, everything changed.\n\nThe British created the [East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company) in 1600 AD. This was one of the earliest joint-stock companies. And it changed the world.\n\n*But why?*\n\nInvestors could buy shares in the company. This represented *ownership*. If the company made a lot of money, they could trade those shares for a profit without having to do any work.\n\nBut it was also good for the founders. The business would have a much harder time getting off the ground without investors.\n\nIn practice, it combined labor and capital leverage.\n\nCompanies became the most powerful entity in the world. Which largely explains why the British Empire, an early adopter of this new way to organize, colonized a fourth of the planet.\n\nIt wasn’t through military force at first. It was through company-sponsored colonies. Military occupation happened only after the locals rebels.\n\nThe East India Company dissolved in 1873. But concept of companies combining labor and capital remained. And they’ve become a cornerstone of our lives.\n\n# Companies Today\n\nThere have been millions of companies since the 1600s. They continue to exist because they *successfully coordinate large groups of people*.\n\nAmazon has nearly 1,000,000 workers. The company provides an easy way to get goods to consumers. It works like a well oiled machine. You can order a book off Amazon tonight and expect to get it within a week.\n\nCompanies form the basis of our modern society. Do you work for a company or do you own one? What is your position in the company? What products do you buy from companies in your free time?\n\nWe interact with companies every day. And the entire concept of a company is from the 1600s. Combining capital and labor leverage is a tried-and-true practice. But it doesn’t end there.\n\nThe most powerful companies today use new forms of leverage. *Media and code.*\n\nCompanies in the 1600s combined labor and capital. This was an innovation for the time. But the most successful companies in the last 2 centuries have taken advantage of media and code for more leverage.\n\nLet’s continue with our Amazon example. Amazon uses every form of leverage effectively. It uses capital to get new projects off the ground. Labor to build and keep everything running. Code to allow anyone to order anything online. And media to get the word out.\n\nAfter all, [software is eating the world](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460). That’s because software companies effectively combine every form of leverage.\n\nThese companies created a lot of wealth. However, companies have downsides as well.\n\n# Problems with Companies\n\nCompanies are a powerful social construct. But they have many significant problems. This is hardly a comprehensive list. But these are 3 pressing problems facing companies today.\n\n1. Investor upside\n2. Barrier to entry\n3. Profit-driven\n\n## Investor upside\n\nCompanies created 2 classes of people. Those who own the company. And those who make it work.\n\nCompany owners fall into one of two categories. Investors or co-founders. Investors buy stock in the company and expect a return on their investment. Co-founders help build the company and typically receive partial ownership.\n\nThe only objective of the company is to produce capital. Each part of the business is expendable. Unfortunately, that includes the human beings who make the company function. The workers.\n\nCompanies pay workers the bare minimum amount of money to get them to do the job. As the population has increased with more efficient farming methods, there’s never been a real shortage of labor in the developed world.\n\nThis results in low wages for workers.\n\nThis dynamic creates a stark contrast between those who own the business and those who work the business. You can work for the most profitable company on Earth. But the upside (wealth generated by the company) is limited to the owner class.\n\nAmazon is the perfect example. It’s extremely valuable. Uses every form of leverage. And generates ungodly amounts of wealth. But all that surplus value is captured by the owner class. It’s not uncommon to see Amazon workers living in poverty. Amazon is the top employer of [SNAP recipients](https://thecounter.org/15-minimum-wage-amazon-top-employer-snap-recipients-walmart-mcdonalds/) across the country. Amazon workers are paid so little they qualify for government welfare.\n\nThis is hardly a new problem.\n\nThe most popular [revolutionary ideology of the 20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) sought to end private companies altogether. However, this movement failed to produce a coherent alternative. Which means we live in a world where their opposition won. And many of their criticisms still ring true.\n\nIn the decades following the collapse of the Soviet union, we have failed to adequately address the contrast between the owner and working classes.\n\n## Barrier to Entry\n\nHumans are logically incentivized to become company owners. Meekly accepting the alternative is to subjugate their life to circumstances beyond their control.\n\nEveryone understands that it’s better to be a business owner than a worker. The smallest business owner is higher status than the most well-compensated worker.\n\nHowever, getting a company off the ground is difficult. These are a few reasons most people fail to launch a successful company.\n\n* Lack of education\n* Lack of financial safety net (business failure can result in financial ruin)\n* Legal difficulty (companies often need an entire legal department)\n* Lack of geographic opportunity (poor access to pools of talent or customers)\n* Expertise in a stagnant industry (achieving success is unlikely if not impossible)\n\nThe state mandated education fails to teach anything about business. The consequence is that company ownership will be a privilege limited to a small percentage of society.\n\n## Profit-Driven\n\nCompanies exist to produce profit. Nothing more. Nothing less. This often results in poor resource allocation and price-gouging.\n\nVacant homes [outnumber the homeless](https://www.self.inc/info/empty-homes/). Companies throw away [millions of calories of food](https://www.rts.com/resources/guides/food-waste-america/) while the impoverished starve. Companies [destroy their own products](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543527/amazon-unsold-products-destruction-investigation) to artificially decrease supply, resulting in a higher price.\n\nThese actions are taken in the name of profit. Companies are not charities.\n\nThey are *for-profit businesses*.\n\nThe best example of price gouging comes from the American medical industry. Americans pay [more for healthcare](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/#:\\~:text=Health%20spending%20per%20person%20in,highest%20per%20capita%20health%20spending.) than every other developed nation. Despite the heavy price tag, Americans receive some of the worst treatment.\n\nAn ambulance ride is more than a month’s salary. Medical bills [create 62%](https://medalerthelp.org/blog/healthcare-statistics/) of all bankruptcies. And roughly [30% of all healthcare costs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertszczerba/2013/10/22/six-frightening-facts-you-need-to-know-about-healthcare/?sh=67b1535ec24c) are completely wasted.\n\nAll these problems stem from the inherent structure of companies. It is simply more profitable to destroy their own products or charge $20,000 to treat a heart attack.\n\nCompanies have existed for 400 years now. If we haven’t solved these problems yet, it’s unreasonable to expect we ever will.\n\nI feel the need to clarify that I do not blame company owners for these problems. They are playing the game to the best of their ability. And more power to them.\n\nThe problem exists in the *game design*. Not the *players* in the game.\n\nThankfully, DAOs provide a better game to play. A game that adequately addresses every problem with companies.\n\n# DAOs Are Better Companies\n\nDAOs have countless benefits compared to companies. There aren’t formal roles or hierarchy. And decisions are made by community opinion.\n\nDAOs rely on voluntary labor. People show up to provide value because they *voluntarily* choose to do so. This results in *exponentially higher quality labor*.\n\n> It’s the difference between clocking in and doing the bare minimum compared to working on a passion project. There’s simply no comparison.\n\nThe best example is comparing [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) to [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). Both organizations offer the ability to trade cryptocurrency.\n\nCoinbase is a publicly traded company with thousands of employees. Uniswap is a DAO with \\~20 core engineers.\n\nDespite the different amount of labor, they handle *similar levels of volume*. There have even been days when [Uniswap’s volume is higher](https://cryptobriefing.com/uniswaps-daily-volume-overtook-coinbase-more-80-million/).\n\nWhich organization sounds like a better investment?\n\nAnd mind you, Coinbase runs a tight ship. They are the largest American cryptocurrency exchange and provide a safe and convenient user experience.\n\nThe difference between Uniswap and Coinbase illustrates the difference between DAOs and companies.\n\nDAOs also solve the 3 most pressing problems facing companies today.\n\n## Investor upside\n\nCompanies are investor-owned. All the captured value goes directly to them. While the workers are paid the bare minimum.\n\nDAOs are community-owned. All the captured value goes into the DAO as a whole. This is primarily done with a native token.\n\nUniswap does a good job? Every token increases in value. It doesn’t matter if you built the smart contracts or wrote the copy on the website. You capture just as much value.\n\nThe only way to become a community member is by owning the token. This ensures every member is *financially incentivized* to contribute their best labor to the DAO.\n\nIn time, DAOs will replace every company for this reason. It’s not a mild improvement. *It’s a revolution of efficiency.*\n\n## Barrier to entry\n\nCompany ownership is a privilege few will ever know. There are simply too many barriers to entry.\n\nAnyone can start a DAO. The only barrier to entry is will-power. This means DAOs will be in fierce competition with each other. Only the best will rise to the top. They’ll attract the best labor, capital, and members. And once part of the DAO, they each have a stake in its success.\n\nA similar dynamic played out between Hollywood and YouTube. Hollywood operates much the same way companies do. There’s a massive barrier to entry. Even bigger than to start a company.\n\nThis resulted in decades of stagnation, remakes, and nonsense.\n\nYouTube allowed anyone to become a video-creator. Suddenly, millions of independent creators were locked in fierce competition to entertain the world. It wasn’t just a mild improvement. It was a *revolution of efficiency.*\n\nToday, movies are an occasional pleasure. Meanwhile, YouTube is so entertaining that it’s [addictive](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/03/youtube-addiction-mental-health).\n\nRemoving the barrier to entry exponentially increases the quality of the competition. *A similar dynamic will play it with DAOs.*\n\n## Profit-driven\n\nProfit is the only goal of companies. Resource allocation and human lives come second. Always have and always will.\n\nDAOs are mission-driven. The primary goal is to solve a problem or create value. *Profit comes second.*\n\nThe profit is a byproduct of creating value.\n\nIf a DAO put profit before its mission, members would leave. That’s not what they joined for.\n\nAdditionally, competitor DAOs could position themselves as a better alternative. This would attract those members, and create a better public perception.\n\nLet’s imagine Uniswap became profit-driven. Let’s say they tacked on a 25% fee on all transactions. Uniswap users would drop like flies. They would flee to a competitor.\n\nLet’s also acknowledge that this wouldn’t happen anyway. The community makes collective decisions in the best interest of the DAO. It would require the majority of Uniswap members to vote in favor of this decision.\n\nTheoretically, this could happen. But a competitor would immediately capitalize on it.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nCompanies play an important role in our modern societies. And they have for 400 years. It was a useful social construct that combined different forms of leverage. And created the wealthiest human civilization we have ever seen.\n\nHowever, companies are an outdated tool. They create many problems that plague our society. They create rampant wealth inequality, prevent competition, and will sacrifice anything for profit.\n\nDAOs address each of these issues and more. They are more efficient, encourage competition, and emphasize mission over profit.\n\n**DAOs will replace companies in our lifetime. The structural efficiencies are too powerful to ignore.**\n\nIf you’d like to learn [how to join a DAO, check out this article.](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-join-a-dao-cfae5577e8f9)", "timestamp": 1634003748, "digest": "81oDlls5x199Wi3D_3yrVmaFZ8rdqnD46Zn5eMCN7dw", "contributor": "0x7afF5FdE4312Ac9874b89B2ba0cE1FA269B80de1"}

{"id": "FHBWOR6PAw2UzZPoZTkqgldvmDXIDNF11PNiuuYFAAM", "title": "Exploring Web3 Business Models by Creating One", "body": "🚢  **Ship30for30** (3/30)\n\ntldr: I’m exploring web3 business models by creating one for golf.xyz, a decentralized application that allows golfers to track their handicap.\n\nI recently enrolled in a program called Ship30for30. The goal is to ship 30 essays in 30 days. These are short, \\~250 words, and designed to help you think concisely and get into a habit of publishing daily. The program recommends that you use a tool called Typeshare. Typeshare is a simple to use, social blogging tool. It’s nice. But today I wanted to post a picture, and it wouldn’t let me do that. So here I am. Every once in a while, I’ll compile [my shorter thoughts](https://typeshare.co/g/jeremyolken) into a longer form piece here.\n\n## Background\n\nOriginally, I wanted to explore technology, culture, and the implications of web3. It hit me that it might be easier to do so through the lens of a specific business. I thought for a minute and realized that there aren’t many mature web3 native consumer businesses. So, instead of analyzing one, let’s build one over the course of 30 days.\n\nNot all centralized services will be replaced by decentralized ones, but there are certain characteristics that make some of them prime for disruption. Tracking your golf handicap certainly fits the mold and we’ll dive deeper into why in a further piece.\n\nWith that said, we’re going to create golf.xyz, a dApp and DAO tool that allows golfers to track their handicaps. Maybe we’ll even bring it to life.\n\n## The Inspiration\n\nThe idea was inspired by Chris Dixon’s, [Come for the tool, stay for the network](https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network). In it, he lays out a strategy for bootstrapping a network by “attracting users with a single-player tool and then, over time, get them to participate in a network”. The tool provides initial utility, gathering a critical mass of users, and the network helps to shape the product and create long-term value.\n\n## Where we’re going\n\nOver the next 27 days, we’re going to build out the business model and dev plans for golf.xyz. In the process, we’re going to explore all aspects of the web3 and golf ecosystems. Based on the functionality of our application, here’s a rough outline.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/samDEPz413VSxvkGq2NLw.jpg?height=540&width=960)\n\nWithin each of those sections, I’ll give a brief overview and discuss what the implications are on golf.xyz. Most of these will happen in shorter form on my [Typeshare blog](https://typeshare.co/g/jeremyolken). Once I feel there’s enough to fill in a comprehensive piece of the puzzle, I’ll come back here.\n\nIn 27 days, I’ll have a fully baked plan and might even launch a crowdfund to get this thing off the ground. I’ll dive into why you would want to be a part of that crowdfund when we talk about NFTs.\n\n## Speaking of NFTs\n\nIf you’re a golfer, you know how important having a handicap is. It allows you to play in sanctioned tournaments, establishes your strokes gained in league play, and serves as a way to identify yourself among other players.\n\nWith golf.xyz, you will be able to display your handicap in the comfort of your wallet. And that’s just the start. Holding the Handicap NFT acts as your entrance into the world of golf in web3. This isn’t so crazy when you realize that your current handicap, held by local golf clubs, allows you to play in leagues and tournaments.\n\nAnd that’s just the surface-level implications. There’s so much to explore and I’m excited to dive in.

链闻获作者授权转载**\n\n维塔利克·布特林（Vitalik Buterin）是以太坊（Ethereum）的创始人，他 19 岁创立了以太坊，20 多岁就拥有了亿万身家。如果说中本聪是区块链的创世者，那布特林则开启了区块链 2.0，人称「V 神」，是加密货币圈的精神领袖。\n\n布特林 1994 年出生于俄罗斯，六岁的时候随父亲移民加拿大。在布特林出生的 90 年代，互联网开始普及，技术飞跃带来的乐观主义弥漫全球。很多人相信，互联网会让世界更开放、更高效、更平等，信息曝光会变得更简单，掌握权力的人更容易被问责。\n\n*2017 年 9 月 18 日美国加利福尼亚州旧金山，以太坊创始人维塔利克·布特林 (Vitalik Buterin) 于 TechCrunch Disrupt 上发表讲话。摄：David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images*\n\n但技术带来了巨大进步的同时，也带来严重问题。 个人数据被大公司、政府掌握。 电子监控无处不在、无时不在。社交媒体表面上增进了沟通，但却在全球范围内，让观念对立更严重。\n\n比特币，以及底层的区块链技术，在许多人心中，代表了互联网的另外一种可能：去中心化、匿名性。17 岁那年，布特林开始接触刚刚出现的比特币。高中毕业，他进入加拿大滑铁卢大学，但 8 个月后就退学、投身到比特币领域中去，周游世界，拜访各国比特币开发者社群，同时也在找寻区块链更广泛应用的可能性。\n\n2013 年末，19 岁的布特林发表「以太坊」白皮书。 以太坊不仅带来一种新的加密货币——以太币，而且基于通用的代码语言，可以用来创建各种各样的应用。以太坊号称永远不下线的「世界计算机」，愿景是将数据的控制权交还给其所有者，将创作权交还给其作者。\n\n以太坊公开发布六年之后，以太币成为了仅次于比特币的全球市值第二高的加密货币。围绕着以太坊，形成了一个非常庞大，迅猛发展的生态系统。在去中心化金融（DeFi）、社交媒体、出版、社会组织等方面都已经开始有实际应用。\n\n将数据的所有权交还给个人、同时保障任务执行的效率是可能的吗？这样的结构有没有可能解决现在的互联网中的一些重大问题？以太坊可以担当这样的任务吗？下一代互联网是什么样？去中心化会带来什么？用加密货币和区块链可以构建一个什么样的世界？带这些问题，我们在新加坡采访了以太坊的创始人布特林。\n\n布特林有清晰的世界观。他所倡导的去中心化、抵御审查、平方投票法（Quadratic Voting）等涉及民主实践、互联网结构、商业与公益组织。他对世界的看法，令他知道自己该在什么社群之中，该连结什么，促成什么，该避免什么，也令他的影响力远超过了加密货币圈。用布特林自己的话说，「我的人生就是成为所有事物的桥梁。」他当然是以太坊社群中的领军人。以太坊基金会每年对外资助高达数千万美元，有些项目已经超出加密货币的领域。他的 Twitter 有 230 万粉丝。他参与「激进市场（Radical Markets）」理论的论述生产，也经常参与在公众政策与智库和其他意见领袖的讨论。\n\n布特林相信，技术领域有两股不同的力量，一股科技力量会让强者更强、资源更向头部集中，而另一种科技力量也许可以让我们继续保有自由，匿名的自由，思想和言论的自由。他提到彼得·蒂尔（Peter Thiel，硅谷著名投资者与创业者）的论断，「人工智能是共产主义；加密技术是自由主义。」他也提到，也许未来并不是一种技术完败另一种技术，但数字生存着的人们，应该有选择的自由。\n\n以下是端与布特林的访谈摘要：\n\n### WEB 3 浪潮\n\n**端：上世纪 90 年代的人们相信，互联网会逐步让世界走向开放社会。但这一切没有发生。Big Tech 强调中心化，集权政府打造了高效的审查制度，他们都赢得了用户，也让互联网走向封闭。你觉得现在我们谈的 Web3、区块链和加密货币，这股浪潮，会带来不同的结果吗？中国也正在建立自己的国家版加密货币——数字人民币，它的广泛使用，将会极大增加国家的监视手段。Web3 到底会令人民更自主，还是集权更强大呢？**\n\n**布特林：**我同意 15 年前人们对互联网可以带来社会进步的预期确实过于乐观，但我也不认为互联网完全失败了。互联网在许多方面推进了社会进步。因为互联网，有很多东西，人们现在能做而 15 年前不能。即使是加密货币本身，也是因为互联网才成为可能。有了互联网，才可能让一个人物理上不离开一个地方、不用牺牲物理上的社交与生活环境，而参与国际性的交流。当然，我承认，互联网实际上也让集中化的电子监控无所不在、更加高效。\n\n我认为在技术领域有两股不同的力量。Peter Thiel 说：「加密技术是自由主义；人工智能是共产主义（Crypto is libertarian, AI is communist）。」人工智能很强大，可以提供很多有价值的好东西，但它的本质是大数据、大政府，数据将会集中、控制在一个国家或一个公司的手中，让强者更强。而加密技术有一些固有的性质，会让强迫变得更加困难。这一点，从一些已经发生的事情就可以看出来。例如，在区块链上，公有链的发展多数超出预期，而私有链、联盟链则大多表现不佳、低于预期。我认为，在这里面有非常深层次的原因。\n\n一些公司，想联合另外几个公司做一个联盟链，但最后就是做不起来。也许他们最初能拉到几个伙伴加盟，但是一旦需要进入下一个阶段，联盟链的劣势就出来了，新的伙伴就不容易加入。联盟链虽然容易获得前几个参与者，但早期参与者常常会希望保有控制权，就会成为更多人加入的阻力。\n\n而对于公有链来说，在抵御中心化的控制方面做得很好，它的发展常常超出人们的预期。你们知道，从原则上我是不喜欢 Proof of Work （工作量证明），但采用这种方式的比特币生态，仍然极有活力。我相信对于用 Proof of Stake （权益证明）的项目也将会如此。\n\n虽然对未来的预测，永远不易。但基于在过去几年中在加密领域里看到的进步，我至少是对加密技术的未来是乐观的。\n\n*2019 年 12 月 16 日德国巴登符腾堡，一位女士通过智能手机买卖以太坊等加密货币。摄：Marijan Murat/picture alliance via Getty Images*\n\n### 以太坊与去中心化应用\n\n**端：以太坊公开发布已经六年。最近，以太币的价格已经远超过 $3,000 每枚。如果按以太币的价格作为衡量标准，以太坊已然大获成功。但以太坊的初衷不只是币价，在以太坊发布时，你强调以太坊的愿景在于去中心化、抵御审查。但在「DeFi」（去中心化金融）之外，以太坊在这两个方面究竟取得了哪些进展？**\n\n布特林：「DeFi」（去中心化金融）确实是以太坊网络中，迄今为止最成功的应用。原因有很多。首先，在 DeFi 领域里做事情，因为有实际的经济利益，动力要大得多。其次，与互联网的其他运用相比，传统金融服务极为低效。例如，我现在人在新加坡，如果我发封电子邮件给一个在危地马拉的收件人，电子邮件会在几秒钟内到达。虽然，可能美国国家安全局也会将在几秒钟内收到一个复本，但至少收件人的邮件会秒达。如果是金融服务，特别是涉及到国际金融业务时，一笔钱从新加坡汇到危地马拉可能需要数天，甚至数周的时间。在这种情况下，加密货币自然而然会在金融业务中首先得到使用。\n\n虽然到现在为止，以太坊在中心化金融带来的好处最为明显。但我绝对相信，也将会有无数的人在其他领域内受益于以太坊不受审查、去中心化的特点。已经有一些很好的利用区块链防御审查的例子。比如，在中国的#MeToo 运动中，就有些运动参与者在区块链上发布和存储了一些内容。虽然例子还很少，但我觉得这是很有意思的开端。\n\n但挑战是，因为金融之外的互联网运用其实效率已经不低，在那些领域运用区块链技术，需要达到标准也就高很多。但我相信，我们已经在路上。\n\n**端：Dapp （去中心化应用）是以太坊的一个重要发展方向。如果让你选择一个 Dapp，并把你自己全部时间投入在上面，你会选择什么方向？**\n\n**布特林：**这是一个好问题。「如果克隆一个布特林，让他在 2021 年进入以太坊生态，他会选择什么 Dapp？」我觉得我应当会选择社交媒体（social media）。社交媒体做得好，就会有大量真正的用户。不像是有些区块链应用程序，一开始时，大家很兴奋，但是一旦上线，没有人用，获得了 30 几个用户，然后就无声无息消失。\n\n**端：是的，去中心化的社交媒体应该是最让人期待的 Dapp 之一。市场上现在基于 web2 的社交媒体都有严重的问题，算法偏差、极化效应、政府审查。我其实很好奇，去中心化的社交媒体，技术上已经成熟，好处非常明显，为什么现在还没有大行其道？**\n\n**布特林：**已经有一些去中心化的社交媒体，比如 Steemit、Hive、Status。这些应用在过去的一年中都有一些成绩。重要的这些应用都不是「鬼域」，确实有不少人在用。 一个很有意思的点是，很多这些中心化的社交媒体都试图将社交媒体与加密货币元素结合一起，就像一个大具乐部，他们拥有单独的代币，有各种奖励制度。非常有趣。对创作者来说，有机会为创作提供更好的激励，又能够发布人们真正喜欢的内容。\n\n比如 Status 就是一个很有趣的去中心化的社交媒体。它没有中心化的服务器，全部数据放在分布式的网络当中。它比 Signal 更为去中心化，Signal 还有服务器，而 Status 就完全没有服务器，一切都只是通过端对端来实现。它还有一个内置的加密电子钱包的身分。所以你甚至不需要为 Status 专门注册 ID，你可以在以太坊上注册一个 ID，然后就可以使用 Status 了。有越来越多的人在使用它。里面有相当多的华语社区，不少人进去聊天，不少人喜欢争论，比如讨论共产党是好还是坏。当然，它仍然是一个比较早期的项目，用户界面并不完美，但它的存在，也许就代表了一个很大的进步。\n\n虽然币圈之外的人们也许还不太了解这些去中心化的社交媒体，但这个有趣的空间已经初具雏形，正在成长。\n\n当然，如果希望成为一个能够和 Twitter 和 Facebook 进行真正竞争的对手，除了需要有不受审查的特点之外，还要为用户提供更多的价值，因为除了不喜欢被审查这一点之外，用户还有其他很多需求。比如就我个人而言，我也想要 Twitter 替代品的原因，其实与审查无关。\n\n我对 Twitter 最大的不满是，上面的讨论，常常质量很低。无数人在我的 Twitter 下面推销他们自己的项目，发各种各样的没有讨论价值的东西，就像垃圾邮件太多，让找到有用的邮件更加困难，让我们无法进行有效对话。我相信很多人都有同样体会，可能只是我遇到的情况更糟糕。\n\n*2021 年 1 月 22 日罗马尼亚克卢日纳波卡，一名工程师于开采以太坊和 Zilliqa 加密货币。摄：Akos Stiller/Bloomberg via Getty Images*\n\n**端：你对 Facebook、Twitter 这些大平台的期待和看法是什么？这些大平台会在加密货币、元宇宙（Metaverse）的发展中起到什么样的作用？**\n\n**布特林：**我觉得 Facebook 最大的错误就是，他们以为自己进入一个新的生态，就可以占有整个生态。他们走进加密货币圈说，「嘿，我们是 Facebook。Facebook 非常大，我们不准备遵守生态系统里的既有规则，我们要制定规则，这样你们就可以遵循我们确定的规则。」这种做法在加密货币领域完全行不通。尽管 Facebook 也在努力地寻找合作伙伴，拉了不少大公司，做联盟，想尽办法降低大家对 Facebook 控制欲的担心，但最后还是很难改变外界对 Libra （天秤币）的看法：「这玩意不可信，不管你怎么说，都是扎克伯格币。」\n\n在加密货币圈之外，它也得不到支持。监管机构对 Facebook 想要做的事情，更是没有信任。不仅是反洗钱的部门盯着他们，反垄断竞争部门也是。所以，现在，他们在方向上做了很大调整，项目还在，但已经比他们最早想要做的事小、也没有特别有意义。 Facebook 在 Metaverse 上会做成什么样？也许他们会不那么想控制生态，也许他们会表现好一些。我们可以走着瞧。\n\n至于 Twitter，我很喜欢他们的 Bluesky （蓝天项目)。这是 Twitter 支持的一个很有趣的去中心化的社交媒体项目。愿景很好，但我特别关心他们是否能够从结构上，将用户界面层与用户数据层分开，不试图去控制整个结构。我还特别关心他们是否会允许用户迁移。假如用户具备可移转性，那同一个用户可以同时通过不同的社交网络与不同的受众交流，而不是在同一社交平台上，在同样的社交泡泡中，以同样的内容，应对不同的受众。这是非常有趣、雄心勃勃的计划。我绝对支持 Twitter 试一试。当然，问题是多大程度上，这些目标可以变成现实。不论结果如何，这个去中心化的愿景，就已经很棒。\n\n**端：我们来谈谈 NFT 吧。NFT 可能是当下区块链领域最热门的问题之一。对 NFT 的关注也已经出了链圈或者币圈。艺术家、影星、歌星、新闻媒体都有在进行尝试。端最近也发行了自己的 NFT 项目。你如何看 NFT 的未来？它会有长期的持久影响力吗？**\n\n**布特林：**NFT 的发展出乎我的意料。四年前就有人问我对 NFT 的看法，我当时说 NFT 的前景被并没有那么好。现在看来，我是错误的。\n\nNFT 的发展，绝对令人着迷。NFT 是加密货币的应用当中，极少的、能够吸引到与关心 De-Fi 的人完全不一样的人群。De-Fi 往往吸引那些关心金钱或关心金融的人，他们要么就想赚钱，要么关心金融领域上的自由。但 NFT 吸引了相当不同的人群——艺术家，文化人。我甚至看到来自埃塞俄比亚的一批艺术家，开始制作发行 NFTs。而这种多元性反过来也有利于以太坊生态的发展。\n\n你知道，加密货币在减少「中间人」方面非常有效，而这一点在 NFT 的发展上也体现出来了。做 NFT，你不需要自己去搞处理器、网站这些，就像开发其他分布式服务一样，你可以利用已经存在的、建立在智能合约基础上的线上市场，然后专注做核心的事情，比如自己创作 NFTs、出售 NFTs。很多人都已经充分利用这一优势，创造艺术作品，做出 NFT，通过 OpenSea 或其他市场，卖出很好的价格。NFT 能够有这样开放的模式，吸引这么多不同背景的人，迅速取得成功，太神奇了。\n\nNFT 的发展是否是可持续的？我觉得，NFTs 会一直存在下去，但宣告 NFT 标志着范式转移，我觉得可能也为时尚早。NFT 还没有像其他加密货币应用一样，经历过一个繁荣和萧条的完整周期。当然，到目前为止，它看起来很有潜力，让我们再等等看看。\n\n### 去中心化的治理\n\n**端：去中心化的应用（Dapp）想摆脱单一平台对用户的控制，去中心化的治理则想摆脱单一公司对一个生态的控制。一个社区、一群公司、甚至一间机构内部怎样去中心化地组织协作者、参与者，设定规则，让治理去中心化，这是 DAO （decentralized autonomous organizations）处理的问题。你怎么看以太坊上 DAOs 的发展？**\n\n**布特林：**DAO 的微妙之处在于，它不是纯粹的金融，也不是纯粹的非金融。DAO 赖以存在的基础是智能合约（Smart Contracts）。几年前，它还仅仅是空洞的理论，但到今天，已经有很多成功通过 DAO 来组织的项目。\n\nDAO 有意思的地方是，它让社区更容易觉得他们真正拥有项目，他们也是项目中的一部分，它更容易让每个人加入的第一天就为社区做贡献。\n\n我认为，这对区块链项目的成功至关重要。在比特币和以太坊上，非常让人兴奋的事情之一就是，一开始你就可以获得一些加密货币，然后将它绑定在自己的计算机上，通过继续「挖矿」来获得比特币。这是一个从一开始就对所有人开放的系统，并且有强大的社区参与，让社区与项目一起成长。\n\n对于一个 DAO 的项目来说，要将去中心化做好，不仅仅是要求在结构上去中心化，而且需要设计好如何发起、基于哪些社区。预先设计很重要。复杂如 DAO，也可以非常安全，只是你需要花费大量时间来成为这个领域的专家，学会把事情做到极致的能力。 很多运行很好的项目一开始就是 DAOs。通过 DAO 来分配资金，设立合理的管理结构。相比之下，有些区块链的项目，号称将成为以太坊的终结者，但他们分发方式都非常中心化，他们将 45% 的币给了两三家风险投资公司，最后，他们也没有做得很好。\n\n我认为，通过不同的新项目，建设 DAO，更少地依赖现有的机构，这也是一个防御审查的应用。说到「防御审查」，很多人有这样的误解，认为它只是防着政府。但现实世界里的「审查」其实没那么简单。政府审查只是「审查」当中的一部分。有很多公司作为中介，常常比政府还保守，它们常常胆子太小，它们屏蔽和删除的，往往比政府审查还要多出许多。\n\n*2021 年 6 月 24 日香港，香港数字资产交易所。摄：Paul Yeung/Bloomberg

Gitcoin。他们最近也在往 DAO 的治理方式转变，开始使用二次方募资（Quadratic funding）。它现在已经做得很好，虽然现在说它已经成功仍然为时过早，但已经是一个非常有意义的尝试。\n\n还有一些项目目标已经超越加密货币领域，比如，有一个叫做 VitaDAO 的项目，关注人类寿命的延长。你可以将它理解为一群关心这一课题的人，希望通过 DAO 来推进这个目标，也允许为了赚钱的人去投资它。它发行了一个叫 VitaDao Token 的币，现在有 2000 万美元的市值，已经开始赞助这个领域里的研究。\n\n**端：你有没有考虑过，也许有一天也将以太坊基金会转变成为一个 DAO？**\n\n**布特林：**确实考虑过。我觉得，可以用两种方式让以太坊基金会进一步去中心化。一种方式，就是你说的，将整个以太坊基金会转成为 DAO。另一种方式，是让以太坊基金会本身在以太坊生态中的作用变得不重要。我们两个方向的尝试都在做。\n\n例如，以太坊基金会最近几年发生的重大变化之一是，从 2015 年开始到现在，我们的大部分资金都用于资助外部项目，每年我们在对外资助上花的钱，已经超过我们自己内部运营上花的钱。这种作法，即使是在加密货币领域，也是不寻常。这种方式，让我们可以扩展社区，串连更多的团队。\n\n决定资助的方式也是去中心化的。在今天，如果你有一些真正有利于以太坊生态的项目，需要资金支持，就算你和基金会的某个领导层有个人恩怨，只要你可以证明项目对于生态是有帮助的，你还是可以得到基金会的支持。用这样去中心化的方式来运作以太坊基金会，在三年前还不是这样的。\n\n以太坊基金会甚至向其他 DAO 提供资金，让这些 DAO 能够为其他人提供资助。\n\n以太坊社区里很多重要的事情是由一些独立的小团队来做的，他们专注于做他们自己的事情，而且遍布世界各地。例如，位于美国的 Prismatic labs 在建设 Ethereum 2.0 上，提供非常重要的基础技术工作。而总部在澳大利亚的 Sigma Prime，在以太网络安全与速度上，有很大的贡献。类似这样的团队，在欧洲、亚洲都有一些。我们帮助这些独立的公司成长，为他们提供相应的费用，同时我们避免自己变成集中管理、大规模的机构。 所以，虽然以太坊基金还不是一个 DAO，最顶层仍然还有领导层、董事会和基金会，在瑞士和新加坡也存在法律实体，但我们整体上是非常去中心化的。我们的工作、合作环境，比绝大多数公司，包括许多在加密货币领域内的公司，都要更为去中心化。我们会在各个方面更加去中心化。\n\n### 加密社群和布特林的世界观\n\n**端：你为《激进市场》这本书写了一篇有趣的序。这本书的两位作者，一个芝加哥大学法学教授，另一位是芝加哥大学有史以来最年轻的经济学教授。为什么他们会觉得让一位加密货币领域的人，为一本专门写公共政策的书写序是最合适的呢？显然他们认为，在为将来重构社会制度上，你所代表的人的想法非常重要。你觉得在公共政策方面，加密货币社区的贡献是什么？**\n\n**布特林：**是的，加密货币社群与激进市场理论的倡导者——或者，更广一些，关心在 21 世纪如何坚持自由的价值、贯彻民主的实践社群——之间，有着非常有意思的联接。 一方面，加密货币社群对于在 21 世纪中如何坚持自由价值、贯彻民主很有兴趣。参与激进市场实验的人当中，也有很多人对加密货币有兴趣。这两个社群之间当然存在意见分歧，在一些价值观上也存在差异。比如，如果你在 Twitter 上关注 Glen Weyl （激进市场的一位作者），他有时就会说，他对区块链的有些做法并不赞成，他也不认为自己属于链圈。但与此同时，激进市场理论的倡导者们也了解，区块链社区是一个强大、有很多资源的社区，而且真正有知识和技术，可以尝试更好的投票、更好的治理、更好的市场解决方案，可以将这些方案付诸实践。比如，Gitcoin 就是一个用平方投票法（Quadratic Voting）来做高达数百万美元交易的以太坊项目。当然，激进市场理论也在做他们自己的社会试验。在不同的政府环境中，包括市政府、地方政府。比如，据我了解，在台湾总统杯黑客松当中，就尝试使用了平方投票法。\n\n在这两个社群之间存在深层联结，有很多共同的兴趣和共同的价值观。我希望自己继续成为这两个社群共同的一分子，也成为这两个社群之间的桥梁和纽带。两个社群有有很多地方可以继续合作，让彼此都变得更强大。特别是当加密货币社群变得更加复杂，开始做的东西已经不仅仅是金融，会有更大的空间，让很多的新想法可以尝试，也让激进市场理论的倡导者可以在这里具体实践一些设想，看看它们若放在加密货币社群，会是如何运作，是否可行。\n\n比如零知识证明（Zero-Knowledge Proof），它原来只是一个理论，出现在学术论文里，但正是因为以太坊和加密货币的存在和发展，包括社区的热情和金钱，让零知识证明变成了非常强大、有实际应用的东西。它最终将会在很多地方得到应用。比如，各种公共领域，在任何一个既需要验证、又需要隐私的地方，你就可以使用零知识证明，例如投票。\n\n我一直认为，技术与社会进步可以相辅相成，而且在未来会起到更为积极的作用。\n\n**端：你一直在谈的平方投票法（Quadratic Voting）很有意思。它本质上是用更为定量的方式，去提高民主决策的效率。你觉得平方投票法会在更广泛的范围得到运用吗？会不会出现一些国家正式采用这种投票方式？**\n\n**布特林：**让这些全新的方法得到采用的最简单方式，不是尝试改变已经存在很长时间的结构，而是尝试将这些新方法运用到最近才存在，甚至还在产生过程当中的新事物之中。\n\n一些 DAO 会首先开始使用平方投票法（Quadratic Voting）。前面我们谈到 Gitcoin，它的拨款就采用了平方投票法。我也在考虑一些新的方向。比如对新闻行业的拨款。新闻是公共品，如果完全靠市场，容易供给不足，并且出现新闻受商业利益不当影响的情形。但是，如果完全靠政府拨款，也会有问题。特别是当发生政权更替，一个差劲的政党接管政府，就可能会对新闻行业产生负面影响。用二次方募资（Quadratic Funding）来处理对新闻行业的资金支持，可能是一个有趣的解决方案，同时尝试避免市场失灵或政府失职。比如，我们可以建立一个用于资助媒体的资金池，通过平方投票法给合适的新闻机构或项目分配资金，用这种方式做一些小规模实验。\n\n*2018 年 4 月 25 日英国伦敦，以太币。摄：Jack Taylor/Getty Images*\n\n**端：通过比特币、以太坊和其他加密货币，以及 DAO 的组织方式，不仅仅在赛博空间中可以成立自己的国家，理论上，也有可能在真实世界里，搞一个国家出来。实际上，也有人在做这样的实验。有人在夏令营小规模地尝试，也有人在讨论，是不是可以在微型国家尝试，一个激进的、按加密货币和区块链治理的国家。对这个话题，你有什么想法？**\n\n**布特林：**我想有两种方式，可以让加密货币领域越来越像一个国家。\n\n一种可能性是，整个加密货币社区仍停留在虚拟世界，但在加密货币领域中出现的观念、制度、方法大行其道，在某一天成为一些国家的主流。在这一过程当中，虽然空间上的链接还是在虚拟世界中，但这些链接已经足够强大，以至于让社群中的人感觉越来越像生活在同一个国家。\n\n加密货币空间可以提供越来越多人们在现实市场中需要的社会环境，提供越来越多人们需要或者在乎的服务。尽管物理上，加密货币社区仍在虚拟世界，但实际生活中，它的影响越来越大。\n\n如果你是一个加密货币社群中的人，你希望以这个社区为家，你可以选择去一家加密货币公司上班。当然，工作之外你还是需要自己的线下网络，而这些网络很多时候又根植在现实世界——某些国家的法律政策可能对加密货币特别不友好。\n\n所以，确实有一个趋势发生：那些希望将全职投入加密货币领域的人，如果他们所在的国家太难做加密货币的事情，可能会选择直接搬到另外一个国家去。新加坡就在成为一个加密货币社群的中心，很多原来在中国做加密货币的人都搬到这里了。瑞士也是这样，以太坊基金会就设立在那里。\n\n另一种方式，就真的是建立一个以加密货币和区块链治理的国家。有一个词叫「反向离散」（reverse diaspora）。离散者（diaspora）指的是，原来一群人生活在一个国家里，但他们后来都离散到世界各地移居。反向离散则是指，移居各地的离散者，回到了原来的国家。若用这个词来描述加密社群就是，原来大家都是离散在互联网上，保持彼此联结，但社群不断发展，终于数量到了一个临界点，社群里面的人会选择一起到一个地方去，如果有很多人都去那个地方，也许那里就出现一个现实世界的加密货币城市甚至国家？也许有一天，加密货币领域会有足够的增长、会有足够的人做出这种选择？这是一个很有意思的趋势。\n\n**端：如果真有一个按加密货币和区块链治理的国家，你会搬到那里去吗？**\n\n**布特林：**我不知道我会不会搬到哪里去。我现在的情况其实就是在不断的迁徙。在 COVID 之前，我的国际旅行节奏是比较疯狂的，2014 年和 2019 年期间，我基本上平均每六天国际飞行一次，参加世界各地的会议。\n\n当然，在 COVID 期间，我不可能这么频繁的旅行。最终 COVID 会过去，我应当也不会再那么极端去旅行了。但即使我做一些调整，我仍然需要不时见到社群中的人，去不同的世界旅行，也让我获益良多。所以，不论如何，我都不太可能选择在同一个地方长久定居。所以，如果有一天真的有某个超级棒的加密货币国家，我会在那里住「一些时间」，但不会是「所有的时间」。\n\n**端：谈谈塑造你世界观的成长经历吧。技术领域有不同类型的领导者。例如，马克·扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg），他显然在非常年轻时也异常聪敏、极为成功。但与你不同，扎克伯格似乎喜欢建立一个庞大的帝国。他创立脸书，收购 Instagram，买下 WhatsApp，然后是 Oculus。而你似乎更倡导去中心化，不喜欢审查，喜欢让小公司自己管理自己。我们先不评论一种治理是不是比另一种好，但我想搞明白的是，为什么你会成为你？有哪些对你的成长最有影响的人，或者某一本书？**\n\n**布特林：**对我成长最有影响的不是某个人，或者某本书。对我的影响最大的是一些我所仰慕的社群。比如，早些年我和理性主义者社群（rationalist community）有很多交往，这是一个倡导理性主义、利他主义的社群。他们喜欢使用科学、数据来论证自己的观点。比如，他们会告诉你，如果你给一些服务于非洲公共衞生的机构捐款，用一张商务舱机票的钱，就可以挽救一条生命，用 3000 美元，就可以让数百人免于疟疾。他们选择做的事情后面，有清楚的价值观：要关心他人，关心他们的健康、需求和福祉，不管他们是不是和你是同一个国家，或者同在一个团队。这样的社群对我影响很大。\n\n我一开始加入比特币社群时，一些有影响力的开发者也给我留下了深刻的印象。很多人都非常聪明，具有奉献精神。很多人将所有时间都投入到生态系统的建设当中，并且为了自己真正相信的事情，投入大量资金，包括自己的钱，甚至不一定是为了自己致富，而是希望让整个生态能够繁荣，并创造新的东西。\n\n*2015 年 12 月 8 日英国伦敦，以太坊创始人维塔利克·布特林 (Vitalik Buterin) 在演讲。摄：John Phillips/Getty Images*\n\n**端：那你的成长过程当中有没有「反面典型」——那种你不想成为的人？**\n\n**布特林：**这个问题有点意思。我小时候总是听到这样的故事：有些人很有钱，但把钱都花在私人飞机、直升机、豪华跑车或其他愚蠢的东西上，最后他们一无所有。我记得自己想，「哇，这太愚蠢了。」\n\n长大以后的例子，是加密货币领域里出现的一些情况。如果在 2013 年，你去 Bitcointalk.org，你会发现很多人在讨论不同的事情，争论不同的观点，比如比特币到底是一种支付系统，还是价值的储存系统？也有人争论到底是资本主义好，还是社会主义更好，你知道，两边观点都有不同的人支持。但是，大约从 2014 年左右开始，加密货币领域出现比较严重的分裂。有一些比特币原教旨主义者，完全不愿意倾听不同的意见。凡是和他们意见不一样的，就是他敌人，会采用特别极端的方式对抗。他们可能也是我的「反面典型」吧。因为这些人，让我更喜欢心灵开放、理性对话，以及和平沟通。我喜欢 DAO 的包容性，喜欢用这种模式来建立社群，吸引同道。\n\n如我之前所说，理性主义和利他主义的社群在早年让我了解，为什么要捐赠给慈善机构，特别是给贫穷和欠发达国家的慈善机构。这个社群也很重视和平、理性沟通，看重对事情的仔细思考，尽量不要过于意识形态和教条。我原本就相信这些价值，后来看到比特币社群中一些原教旨主义者的行为，让我更远离极端主义，让我成为今天的我。\n\n**端：你六岁时就跟父亲一起从俄罗斯移民到加拿大。现在，你在世界各地旅行。就自我身份认同而言，你认为自己是「加拿大人」，还是一个「世界公民」碰巧持有加拿大护照？你是怎么看「爱国主义」和「世界公民」的？**\n\n**布特林：**我肯定是越来越认同自己是一个世界公民。过去六年，我在世界不同的地方旅行，接触各地的加密货币社群。我在美国，在瑞士和欧洲其他国家，在中国大陆、台湾、新加坡都度过了不少时间。在所有去过的国家中，都一些东西我非常认同，但也有些东西，要么我并不认同，要么我会有「我不确定这东西对或不对，但肯定不是我」的感觉。时间久了，通过这些对照和参考，我越来越确认，在自我认同上，我不需要只和一个国家锁定，我是一个世界公民。\n\n即使是线上的社群里，我也是流动的。我当然是以太坊社群中的一员，同时我也会与激进市场理论的成员们交流，而在理性主义者社群（rationalist community）里，我也珍惜有机会和各种流派的经济学家沟通。\n\n我有时觉得，我的人生就是成为所有事物的桥梁。这并不是我 10 年前对自己的期望。不过这个变化很有意思。\n\n**端：今天我们讨论的一个关键词是社群（community）。几乎每一个话题，都会回到社群。你最认同的社群是什么样的？它都具有哪些特点？**\n\n**布特林：**好的社群首先是要开放。不要限制太多，不要一直给别人下命令，外面的人、新的人可以很容易进到社群里来，可以和先来的人一起参与社群的讨论和建设。 要有善意，对外面的世界也有善意。\n\n要跨学科。这是以太坊社区中的一个突出的特点。我们这个社群里有很多数学家、很多密码学家，但也不仅仅是数学和密码学。社群里面的人不能只和自己泡泡里的人交流，最终我们还是试图为这个世界做点什么。\n\n要重视合作。不要过分竞争，不是专注去找别人的毛病，而是关注于找出大家擅长的事情，把事情做成。\n\n我喜欢的社群应当要具备上面这一些特质。\n\n**端：这样的社群确实很理想。另一个问题是，如何把一个理想的社群维持下去？一个好的社群在 20、30 年以后还可以持续吗？或者，还有这个必要吗？**\n\n**布特林：**这是个好问题。但可能首先要问的另一个问题是，那个长久持续下去的「东西」究竟是什么？\n\n比如在美国，共和党人有时会说，林肯是共和党，是我们共和党解放了奴隶，而你们民主党当年是支持奴隶制。但 150 年前的共和党和 150 年后的共和党还是一个群体吗？叫同样的名字，未必就是同一个「东西」了吧？哪怕一个机构表面上的历史没有间断，也并不意味着这个群体在本质上获得了连续。\n\n有时候，民族性连续了，但理念却发生根本变化。德国是一个很好的例子。德国有很长的军国主义历史，有一段非常黑暗的纳粹统治，但是，现在的德国完全不一样了。现在的德国人可能对保有一支正常军队的兴趣都没有。德意志民族还在，但价值却发生了根本变化。\n\n所以，说到社群的连续性时，你必须问自己，你真正希望要保留的东西是什么？也许我们能做的最好的事只就是，创造一些东西，可以存在 20 年或 40 年，但下代人需要有他们自己的新东西。文化、组织结构和社群， 回应压力或激励，有变化也会有连续。\n\n我希望以太坊能够持续下去，以太坊社群也能够在没有变得我都认不出来的情况下，长久存在下去。\n\n预测 30 年、60 年后的未来总是不太容易，但如果你创建了一个生态系统，而且这个生态系统的特性就是合作才能成功，那么我相信，强调协作的文化会让这个生态长久持续下去。",

黄金市场份额的 5.6%。若以此比例来推算，ETF 可吸引当前总市值约 6% 的资金入市，以当前市值计算，约 600 亿美元。\n\nETF 不止解决了合规问题，它为市场提供的流动性同样重要。ETF 为投资者提供了一个廉价和简单的工具，使他们能够在一个安全和容易获得的产品中接触到比特币。这种方式将有助于更好的保护并没有那么了解 Crypto 的投资者：他们不必真正持有比特币，无需了解链、地址、公钥、私钥，更不用担心忘记自己的私钥以至于丢失了自己的资产。这将在技术上抹平所有人投资 Crypto 的门槛，尽管这或许并不是 BlockChain 的初衷，但这一公平性却出人意料的和 BlockChain 的宗旨达成了一致。\n\n### BTC ETF 的「伟大航路」\n\nBTC ETF 的发展可谓命途多舛。早在 2013 年，文克莱沃斯兄弟就宣布即将推出 BTC ETF。2014 年，该 ETF 在递交申请后遭到 SEC 否决。此后，文克莱沃斯兄弟又曾尝试变更交易场所、设立地点等多种方式企图设立 BTC ETF，在多年中申请了数次，但都未获成功，至今该计划仍在搁浅中。这或许是 BTC ETF 的第一次尝试。\n\n2016 年，SolidX 申请比特 ETF 遭到拒绝。2017 年，是 BTC ETF 似乎要迅猛发展的一年。这一年 BTC 价格变化剧烈，从年初最低的 789 美元到达年末最高的 18674 美元。一年之内数家 BTC ETF 基金申请设立，从年初的 BTC Investment Trust、年中的 VanEck，再到年底的 Exchange Listed Funds Trust、Pro Shares、REX BTC、First Trust，一年之内六家 ETF 递表申请，但遗憾的是，他们或被 SEC 拒绝，或自主撤销，无一家成功发行。\n\n2018 年，即使是在币价持续下行的背景下，新的 ETF 申请依然没有中止。这一年，市场上新增了 GraniteShares、Direxion 两位新玩家，还有两位老玩家：VanEck 和 SolidX 联合申请了一支 ETF。但与过去的一年并没有什么不同，前二者的 ETF 申请被 SEC 拒绝，而后者的申请则因合作关系破裂而主动撤销。\n\n在当时，SEC 尚未对 BTC 予以明确的定性，Crypto 既非证券，亦非金融衍生品。作为一种非实物商品的 BTC 理论上不受美国证券交易委员会和商品期货交易委员会（Commodity Futures Trading Commission）的监管，这也是 BTC ETF 频遭拒绝的主要原因之一。\n\n此后，每年 BTC 都有一支或多支基金递交申请，但无一例外，他们均失败了。申请屡屡被拒绝，期望屡屡落空，BTC ETF 的发行，似乎永远都停留在「明年」。直到今日，「美国首支 BTC ETF」的发行，依然停留在「有望通过」的状态。\n\n时间到了 2021 年，历史的车轮终于向前缓慢转动。今年 2 月，加拿大审批通过了世界首支 BTC ETF——Purpose BTC ETF。该 ETF （股票代码 BTCC）在加拿大多伦多证券交易所正式上市后，首日总成交量为 930 万股，交易总额达到 1.45 亿美元，成为当天多伦多交易所交易最活跃的前十大证券之一。\n\n此后短短数月，Crypto ETF 开始增长，几个月时间快速完成了此前数年都未曾走过的道路。在 BTC ETF 发行仅两个月后，三支 ETH ETF 也获准上市，分别为：Purpose Investment 推出的 Purpose Ether ETF （ETHH）、CI 全球资本管理公司推出的 CI Galaxy Ethereum ETF （ETHX）以及 Evolve 资本集团推出的的 Evolve Ether ETF （ETHR）。\n\n### 以灰度为代表，ETF 的另类替代品\n\nCrypto 世界中广泛存在的跨链桥沟通了不同的基础设施，而在传统金融与链上世界这两个市场中，同样也亟需一个沟通二者的「桥」。而灰度信托，则是这其中最为出名的那座桥。\n\n*华尔街的传统金融机构无法方便的配置 Crypto 敞口*\n\n如果一个合规的机构投资者看涨 Crypto，如何才能在完全合规的情况下配置 Crypto 敞口？灰度信托就是答案之一。在本轮机构助推的牛市中，灰度信托的迅猛崛起，也让传统金融业看到了新的机会——进入 Crypto 世界是市场所急需的真实需求。即使在当下，灰度仍是机构中持仓量最大的，其 BTC 持仓已达 64.9 万枚。在很长一段时间内，灰度信托份额一直是机构间接投资 Crypto 货币的主要途径之一。\n\n遗憾的是，灰度信托，它并不是那么「好用」。灰度并非真正的 ETF 产品，长期以来被视为 Crypto ETF 的一种替代。尽管它为机构提供了 Crypto 敞口，但与真正的 ETF 相比，灰度信托也存在着极大的劣势。灰度信托的 GBTC 份额不仅存在 6 个月锁定期，且解锁后只可转售，无法赎回，这一特殊的机制或也是推动灰度份额相较 BTC 长期溢价的原因之一。在长达数年的时间内，灰度 GBTC 一直维持着较高的溢价水平，最高时甚至超过了 100%。监管框架的缺乏，让机构投资者缺乏入场的易用工具。\n\n除灰度信托外，市场上还存在着其他替代品。早在 2017 年，法国 Tobam 发行了全球首支 BTC 共同基金。同年，瑞士的 Swissquote Group 就曾推出 BTC 证书 ETP 产品，并于瑞士最大证券交易所 Six Swiss 上市。此后，德国、瑞典、奥地利等国相继发行了 Crypto ETP 产品。与灰度信托劣势相同，这些产品也仅能满足 ETF 的部分功能——ETP 本质为债券，并不能被纳入基金的监管框架内。\n\n在现行的监管框架内，Crypto ETF 是市场的真实需求所在，毕竟 ETF 的另类替代品并无法真正的替代 ETF。如果可以设立 Crypto ETF，就可设立一个完全合规的、可日内交易的、金融机构可视为基金购买的金融产品。这极大的降低了机构配置 Crypto 的门槛。这也是 Crypto 行业八年来屡次申请被驳回却仍在不断申请的原因之一。\n\nCryptoETF 目前大有加速之势。但在资本最密集的美国，目前仍未有合规 ETF 推出。据统计，截至至今美国至少有 15 家资管机构曾至少 35 次申请过 Crypto ETF。而遗憾的是，至今一家都未获批通过。随着合规框架的逐渐完善，Crypto 世界的大门正逐渐向传统金融开放。若此次 BTC 期货 ETF 得以通过，在传统金融领域或将会有一定的示范效应。而美国 Crypto ETF 究竟是跟上其他地区的步伐，还是数年如一日的「有望推出」，我们仍需等待时间给出答案。", "timestamp": 1634008774, "digest": "u9x1pJTFiqXytB-ipqHMtupU-AEksE7OkZoKLbM1e0s", "contributor": "0x53b172dE2602104FDD46CCfE57a869b60177C4AD"}

Every equation in finance has interest rates in it, either explicitly or implicitly. Mortgages, student loans, business loans, government borrowings, and even equities and commodities are impacted by interest rates.\n\nBusinesses can avoid interest rate risk by engaging in fixed-rate borrowing. Fixed-rate borrowing is the most common form of borrowing in traditional markets. Per [Notional's terrific whitepaper](https://docs.notional.finance/developers/whitepaper/whitepaper), “In 2018, there was $15.3 trillion dollars of debt outstanding in U.S. corporate debt and mortgage debt markets. 88% of that debt was in terms of fixed rates.” However, fixed-rate borrowers may be unhappy with the terms of their loan (and/or have the view that rates across the economy will go down), and may swap their exposure with a different borrower who is currently paying variable but wants a fixed rate. Lenders who own fixed-rate bonds may have the view that rates across the economy will go up and desire to hedge that risk.\n\nToday’s DeFi markets are largely limited to variable-rate lending and borrowing. The two largest borrow/lend protocols, [Compound](https://compound.finance/) and [Aave](https://aave.com/), both support variable rates. While these products work well for users aiming to earn a decent yield, they don’t work for corporations or neo-banks who need predictability—both on the lending and borrowing side. As DeFi grows to serve more use cases, the ability to lock in an interest rate will be a key enabling technology.\n\nInterest rate swaps (IR swaps) are the most popular form of interest-rate derivatives. IR swaps account for [$6.5 trillion](https://stats.bis.org/statx/srs/table/d5.1?f=pdf) of daily traded volume, which represents [over 80%](https://stats.bis.org/statx/srs/table/d5.1?f=pdf) of the world's total derivatives volume. IR swaps serve a variety of use cases: 1) borrowers use IR swaps to lock in interest rates, 2) speculators can express capital efficient directional views using IR swaps, and 3) portfolio managers and lenders use swaps to manage interest rate risk.\n\nThere are a number of teams building fixed-rate lending products and IR derivative protocols in DeFi. In this essay we explore the design space for these primitives and the various choices made by teams building this future.\n\n## The Opportunity for IR Markets in Crypto\n\nThe vast majority of loans in DeFi today are variable rate. As a point of reference, there are $19 billion of loans [outstanding](https://dune.xyz/hagaetc/lending) across the three major lending protocols: 1) Aave - $7.9 billion, 2) Compound - $4.9 billion, and 3) MakerDAO - $6.3 billion.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jrfJL3Zil-5rvsJNWIePq.png?height=474&width=805)\n\n**Source**: [Dune Analytics, @hagaetc](https://dune.xyz/queries/13575/27235)\n\nOf these, 100% of Compound and MakerDAO’s loans are completely variable and open term. Additionally, of Aave’s 5 largest markets (DAI, GUSD, SUSD, TUSD, and USDC), only \\~1.5% of the loans outstanding were “stable rate loans” as of July 2021.\n\nThere are a few DeFi-native fixed-rate platforms live today, such as Yield Protocol and Notional Finance. Notional [has](https://defipulse.com/) $12 million of TVL, and Yield is currently in the process of building out V2. As such, it’s clear that the market for variable-rate loans is much more mature than fixed-rate loans in DeFi. However, we expect fixed-rate loans to become larger than variable rate loans as DeFi rails eventually power traditional financial markets.\n\nWe’ve chatted with many institutional funds and neo-banks who are exploring DeFi. One of the main concerns we hear from them is that interest rates in the lending and borrowing markets are quite volatile. There are many reasons for the volatility (basis trade compression and expansion, Grayscale arb closing, new yield farms with really high APYs, etc.), but the most important fact is that even if they get comfortable with custody and regulatory risk, the lending markets don’t offer them maximal utility. The below chart is a sample of some of the most liquid USDC borrowing rates in DeFi over the past few years:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PNbHVxFTm1H3hCzEN8EzG.png?height=462&width=850)\n\n**Source:** [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/defi-lending)\n\nIn order for large traditional businesses to borrow in DeFi, rates are going to need to be more predictable and stable. A business who borrows $100M on-chain paying 2% is very unlikely to be ok with the rate spiking to 20% a week later because an unrelated liquidity mining farm is now paying extremely high yield. The business will either want to 1) enter into a fixed-rate, fixed-term loan, or 2) have hedging access for their variable rate exposure from Compound and Aave.\n\nAs crypto grows, we also expect the market for on-chain DAO-to-DAO business lending to grow significantly. As businesses mature, debt financing becomes the major source of funding and DAOs will be no different.\n\nWe predict that many DAOs, such as the DAOs that [manage risk](https://multicoin.capital/2021/09/16/daos-manage-risk/) in large DeFi protocols and NFT platforms, will pursue debt financing. Imagine a world in which the SushiSwap DAO can borrow funds from a variable-rate lending protocol and encode logic that says “we will redirect 10% of our revenues from our staked xSUSHI to repay the loan.” This would expose the SushiSwap DAO to interest rate risk from the variable rate protocol, and they could use IR swaps to hedge it.\n\nFixed-rate lending and IR derivative protocols are about to explode in popularity as new products launch.\n\n## An Overview of Fixed-Rate Lending and IR Derivative Protocols\n\nThere are a handful of DeFi constructions that can produce fixed-rate loans and IR derivatives. Each construction has pros and cons.\n\n### Zero-Coupon Bonds (ZCBs)\n\nIn this model, borrowers create bond tokens (yDAI-2021-12-31, for example) by depositing collateral into smart contracts and borrowing yDAI against it. They then sell the yDAI on the open market which settles on a specific date. The effective interest rate paid by the borrower is determined by the discount at which yTokens can be sold on the open market, and the length of the loan. For example, Alice can mint 100 yDAI backed by $200 of ETH and sell the 100 yDAI in exchange for 97 DAI to Bob. Hence, Bob is lending $97 and will receive $100 at contract expiry.\n\nThere are many implementations of this approach, such as 1) trading bond tokens primarily on an AMM or CLOB 2) physical vs cash settlement 3) liquidation management.\n\nThe zero-coupon bond model is used by [Hifi](http://hifi.finance/), [UMA](https://umaproject.org/), [Notional](http://notional.finance/), and [Yield Protocol](https://yield.is/).\n\n**Pros:** 1. Simple construction 2. Supports both fixed-rate lending and borrowing 3. Overcollateralization improves safety for lenders 4. Can build a yield curve on top of the protocol 5. Native token value capture is clear through backstopping liquidation risk\n\n**Cons:** 1. Fragments liquidity across expiries 2. Need oracle for the collateral/debt ratio 3. Requires depositing collateral into a new smart contract system 4. Capital inefficient for speculators and liquidity providers 5. Liquidation risk\n\n### Yield Stripping\n\nIn this model, users can deposit a money market token such as Compound’s cUSDC into the yield stripping protocol’s smart contracts. The protocol then splits the deposited cUSDC into two tokens: 1) the principal token (PT), and 2) the yield token (YT).\n\nDepositors can then sell the YTs for cash upfront, allowing them to lock in a fixed rate for the duration of the contract. As an example, let’s assume that the current lending rate on Compound is 10%. If Alice deposits $100, her annual yield—should the blended Compound rate stay the same for the next 12 months—would be $10. She can trade this unpredictable $10 YT for $8 cash today.\n\nBob, who buys the YT from Alice, is taking a leveraged long view on Compound’s lending rate. To illustrate, imagine that Bob thinks Compound’s interest rate will double to average 20% for the next 12 months. He can deposit $100 into Compound and earn $20 over the next year. Or instead, he can buy 12.5 YTs for $100 ($100 / $8 = 12.5). If Bob is right and the blended rate is 20%, he will get back ($100 *20%* 12.5) = $250, a 150% return on capital. Of course, if he is wrong and the rate decreases to 5%, he will only receive ($100 *5%* 12.5) = $62.50, a 37.5% loss on capital.\n\nYield stripping is used by [Swivel](https://swivel.finance/), [Pendle](https://www.pendle.finance/), [Tempus](https://tempus.finance/), [Element](https://www.element.fi/), [Sense](https://sense.finance/), and [APWine](https://apwine.fi/). We are investors in Swivel, and are very excited about combining the yield stripping construction with a central limit order book.\n\n**Pros:** 1. Enables fixed-rate lending 2. Enables leveraged long speculation on interest rates 3. Requires no liquidation or oracle because principal is deposited upfront and leverage is implied 4. Capital efficient for speculators 5. Safer than ZCBs because collateral is contained with Compound, Aave, etc., which are trusted and established protocols 6. The market capitalizations and liquidity of AAVE and COMP (which act as [backstops](https://multicoin.capital/2021/09/16/daos-manage-risk/) to protocol risk) have achieved a level that is difficult to replicate for new protocols.\n\n**Cons:** 1. Does not allow for explicitly shorting of rates 2. Somewhat capital inefficient for rate trading because it requires the entire principal amount up front 3. Limited to principal assets and rates (no exotic rate exposure) 4. Does not allow for perfect hedging on the floating side because of the spread between Compound and Aave’s lending and borrowing rates 5. Fragments liquidity across expiries\n\n### Stable Rates\n\nAave piggybacks the protocol’s variable interest rates with their stable-lending feature. The basic idea is that when a borrower opens a new loan, she has the opportunity to select “stable rate.” Her origination rate will be higher (often substantially higher) than the variable rate she can borrow at. For example, the variable borrow rate for USDC is 5.4% and the stable borrow rate is 11.9%. The variable borrow rate for ETH is 0.25% and the stable borrow rate is 3.3%. This buffer ensures that the protocol remains solvent before a “rebalancing event” in which the stable rate changes for existing borrowers.\n\nUnlike the borrow rate for a variable user, the borrow rate for stable borrowers in most market conditions will not fluctuate with new borrows, new deposits, new liquidations, etc. into the core Aave market.\n\nThis is the model used by [Aave](https://aave.com/).\n\n**Pros:** 1. Trusted protocol in the Ethereum ecosystem, and AAVE has a large market cap and sufficient liquidity to backstop the protocol in size -- as such, likely safer than other models. See this post for more detail. 2. Enables users to borrow at a stable rate (though not guaranteed fixed in weird market conditions) 3. Lots of liquidity because it leverages Aave TVL 4. Highly utilized in more volatile rate markets on lower market cap and less liquid tokens 5. Liquidity concentration because of the loan’s perpetual nature (no fragmentation across expiries)\n\n**Cons:** 1. No ability to explicitly speculate on rates 2. Only applies to borrowers and not lenders 3. In adverse market conditions users’ rates may be “rebalanced” 4. Does not allow for synthetic rate exposure 5. Borrow rates for stable users are significantly higher than variable\n\n### Contracts for Difference (CFDs) and Interest Rate Perpetual Contracts\n\nIn this model, users deposit any form of collateral into a margin account and go long or short rates. This construction looks very similar to perpetual contracts on FTX and BitMEX. Funding is paid based on the underlying reference rate the contract points to versus the current mark interest rate on the protocol.\n\nThese products offer leverage, and thus require a liquidation engine. In the case of a trader’s account margin falling below its maintenance margin, the system unwinds the position against the perpetual contract AMM (or CLOB).\n\nThis is the model used by [Strips Finance](https://strips.finance/) and [YieldSwap](https://yieldswap.app/).\n\n**Pros:** 1. Explicit rate shorting is possible 2. Ability to get exposure to synthetic rates that are not derived on chain (e.g., LIBOR or FTX’s BTC perp funding rate) 3. Capital efficient because it does not require principal token up front and allows for two-sided leverage 4. Liquidity concentration because of the contract’s perpetual nature\n\n**Cons:** 1. Requires an oracle for off-chain rates 2. Liquidations are necessary because there is leverage 3. Requires separate perp contracts for Compound/Aave borrow and lend rates in order to create perfect hedging\n\n## Exploring the Trade-offs in Fixed-Rate Lending and IR Derivatives\n\nIn examining the various types of fixed-rate lending and IR derivative constructions in DeFi, it’s clear that there are many trade-offs based on design decisions in these systems. In our view, each of these types of protocols will carve out a niche for itself.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dbn8EeH-r2Xz7xgHpd-so.png?height=290&width=831)\n\n## DeFi Perpetual Contracts for Interest Rates\n\nThe flexibility of the synthetic nature of the perpetual contract enables speculators—and hedgers—to trade rates on any theoretical interest rate (e.g., Compound USDC lending rate, LIBOR interest rate, Fed Funds rate, FTX funding rate, ETH 2 staking yield, etc). Notably, there is no need to roll over a position because these contracts are perpetual in nature and do not expire. As such, there is no liquidity fragmentation across expiries. Speculators drive liquidity, and that drives value for hedgers and other organic users.\n\nImagine Alice is borrowing XYZ token from Aave to use for her trading strategy. She can, via interest rate perpetual contracts, go long the Aave interest rate for XYZ token such that she is protected in the event that her borrow rate increases and eats into the profitability of her trading strategy.\n\nThe perpetual swap contract is not perfect, but it offers a capital efficient way for market participants to bet on rates.\n\nIn our earlier post about the design space for DeFi derivatives (highly recommended read) we concluded that the perpetual swap contract will likely be the winning construction for DeFi derivatives. We believe this is likely also true for IR swaps. While the perpetual swap contract is not perfect, its weaknesses are manageable. While the stable rates model is safe for lenders in that capital is kept within Aave, it does not allow for two-sided leveraged exposure to rates and this reduces its utility. ZCBs enable perfectly predictable fixed-rate lending and borrowing, but don’t enable capital efficient rate speculation and therefore have less liquidity.\n\nWhile the perpetual contract construction for interest rates in DeFi is not yet live in meaningful size, we see a massive opportunity for it. We expect that the perpetual contract, which is already the dominant trading product in crypto, will also work very well for CeFi and Defi interest rates.\n\nDisclosure: Multicoin has established, maintains and enforces written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and effectively manage conflicts of interest related to its investment activities.

{"id": "hkEifWCITigfzBM5q51gOBjI2hJYGsFevGwo9CVecFA", "title": "Building 2046 Quest #1: Change Your Identity", "body": "*Note: this is a work of fiction, and is a paired quest from the broader series [Building 2046](https://shawndimantha.substack.com/). To learn more about the original narrator, shawndao, see [Issue #1](https://shawndimantha.substack.com/p/building-2046-issue-1).*\n\nAs promised, Building 2046 will be an interactive experience and I will give you a quest; it is up to you to fulfill it or not. **Disclaimer:** **this is not investment advice, and some of the steps listed may not work perfectly for you, or age well**. This quest may not be easy if you are new to the world of NFTs, but I want you to try as you can get a taste for my future world and the opportunity of having multiple identities. If you’re already in possession of some NFTs, then feel free to skip to step 12 and share this quest with someone who hasn’t gone down the NFT rabbit hole yet. \n\n 1. **Buy some crypto:** Either Ethereum or Solana on an exchange like [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/). You can start with 0.1 ETH as a lot of NFT projects have floor prices below this value, and this will give you some padding for gas fees. Alternatively you can buy 2 Solana (SOL) on Coinbase, which should give you enough to go shopping on secondary marketplaces. Luckily SOL transaction fees are negligible.\n 2. **Install a wallet:** Add the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) Chrome extension for Ethereum wallets or [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) extension for Solana wallets. Keep your Secret Recovery Phrase secret, ideally in a password manager like LastPass or 1Password. Sign in to your wallet and create 3 wallets: 1 to mint, 1 to buy, 1 to list your sales / public profile. Keep your ETH or SOL in the buy wallet.\n 3. **Pick a NFT PFP project** (like BAYC, but less expensive) to go into. You can start on the [Collectibles section of OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/collectibles). Some tips from @punk2476 on picking a collectible project below (not investment advice):\n\n    [https://twitter.com/punk2476/status/1446139822901534720](https://twitter.com/punk2476/status/1446139822901534720)\n\n 4. **Select a specific NFT you like** probably from a marketplace like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) or [Solanart](http://solanart.io/). Once on either marketplace connect your wallet by clicking the icon at the top right of the screen. You will need some Ethereum or Solana tokens to start as mentioned in step 1, fractional Ethereum tokens will do if you can’t afford whole tokens or don’t want to take the risk. You should get a Metamask or Phantom wallet. Make sure to account for [gas fees](https://pumpmygas.xyz/) in your pending purchase.\n 5. **If you go the public mint/sale route**: Be careful with the public sales and do your research before doing public mints. You can find some on [NFTCal](https://nftcal.xyz/) or [HowRare](https://howrare.is/drops) (*I do **not** vouch for the quality of NFTs listed here, so do your own research*). Generally you want to see an active Discord and Twitter presence + some identified developers (many will be anonymous, but that is ok). If you check out the Discord server, make sure to turn off direct messages (Privacy Settings, disallow direct messages). **Never respond to an unsolicited direct message on Discord**, other than some of the verification bots like Dyno or Collab.land. Most verification on Discord servers simply requires you to click a reaction and you’re in.\n 6. **Double check your NFT’s storage pattern** with [Check my NFT](https://checkmynft.com/), which will give you a score when you enter the contract address and token ID of the NFT you are looking to purchase. For example if the URL you are on is “https://opensea.io/assets/0xae3d8d68b4f6c3ee784b2b0669885a315ba77c08/414”, then the **contract address** is *0xae3d8d68b4f6c3ee784b2b0669885a315ba77c08* and the **token ID** is *414*. Basically you want to make sure if the project disappears (called a “rug”), your NFT doesn’t disappear with the project.\n 7. **Buy the selected NFT**. You can either make a bid by converting some of your ETH to WETH using Uniswap in your Metamask wallet, or select a NFT directly by filtering for the ones with a “Buy Now” option. I’d recommend going with the Buy Now option as it is much simpler. In OpenSea “Buy Now” NFTs will be the ones with a black ETH symbol and 1 associated price on the right, like below: \n 8. **Execute the transaction and pay your gas:** You will probably see a message to confirm your transaction in Metamask with an associated gas fee. I know this is painful, but is part of the cost of buying NFTs in your timeline, usually gas fees are in the \\~$100 range, but you can wait for lower ones usually late night PST. If using Phantom app, the gas fee is going to be really small.\n 9. **Collect your NFT:** After a couple minutes your NFT will show up in your OpenSea profile if you bought with ETH, or in your Phantom wallet if you bought with SOL. You can save it (right click + save).\n10. **Change your profile picture (and identity):** on Twitter to an image of the NFT you purchased! Yes, you can also change your profile pic on other Web2 platforms.\n11. **Share your experience on Twitter**: link back to this post and tag @sdimantha: How has this changed about how you think about your identity? What would you want others to compose on top of your identity? What are the wildest derivative projects on top of your identity that you can imagine?\n12. **Discussion opportunities!** My 2021 counterpart Shawn Dimantha (@sdimantha) may reach out to some of you to talk to you about how you feel and invite you to a small group discussion where we can expand upon the topics discussed in this post. Even if you didn’t buy an NFT you are welcome to join the conversation (you can always just right click + save, but it is not the same as owning and supporting the artists).\n\nOk happy travels and remember WAGMI :) \n\nshawndao", "timestamp": 1634014422, "digest": "jF4BxZSe8dalns2TtfkIRmKmwI3NuncBBnL5sXh-4pw", "contributor": "0x577f50D568eb6340C5c019282Bbfc0c6Dd8df8B6"}

{"id": "27laOF8fZ9Ta3fssuyO_A7GQCA0lQY6ZHr8SfNOaWLo", "title": "Why Web3 Matters", "body": "Web1 (roughly 1990-2005) was about open protocols that were decentralized and community-governed. Most of the value accrued to the edges of the network — users and builders.\n\nWeb2 (roughly 2005-2020) was about siloed, centralized services run by corporations. Most of the value accrued to a handful of companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook.\n\nWe are now at the beginning of the web3 era, which combines the decentralized, community-governed ethos of web1 with the advanced, modern functionality of web2.\n\nWeb3 is the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens. \n\n(Thanks to [@packyM](https://twitter.com/packyM) for this definition.)\n\nWhy does web3 matter?\n\nFirst, let’s look at the problems with centralized platforms. (I wrote more about this [back in 2018](https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters).)\n\nCentralized platforms follow a predictable life cycle. At first, they do everything they can to recruit users and third-party complements like creators, developers, and businesses.\n\nThey do this to strengthen their network effect. As platforms move up the adoption S-curve, their power over users and third parties steadily grows.\n\nWhen they hit the top of the S-curve, their relationships with network participants change from positive-sum to zero-sum. To continue growing requires extracting data from users and competing with (former) partners.\n\nFamous examples of this are Microsoft vs. Netscape, Google vs. Yelp, Facebook vs. Zynga,  Twitter vs. its third-party clients, and Epic vs. Apple.\n\nFor third parties, the transition from cooperation to competition feels like a bait-and-switch. Over time, the best entrepreneurs, developers, and investors have learned to not build on top of centralized platforms. This has stifled innovation.\n\nNow let’s talk about web3. In web3, ownership and control is decentralized. Users and builders can own pieces of internet services by owning tokens, both non-fungible ([NFTs](https://a16z.com/2021/04/02/nfts-readings-resources/)) and fungible.\n\nTokens give users property rights: the ability to own a piece of the internet.\n\nNFTs give users the ability to own objects, which can be art, photos, code, music, text, game objects, credentials, governance rights, access passes, and whatever else people dream up next.\n\nNFTs exist on top of blockchains like Ethereum. Ethereum is a decentralized global computer that is owned and operated by its users.\n\nBlockchains are special computers that anyone can access but no one owns.\n\nEthereum is powered by a fungible token, ETH, which is used to incentivize the physical computers that underlie the system. ETH is also the system’s native currency for transactions, like NFT purchases.\n\nThere are many ways for users to acquire fungible and non-fungible tokens. You can buy them, but there are also ways to earn them.\n\nUniswap famously retroactively airdropped 15% of its governance tokens to early users of the protocol. Community grants like this have become common in web3 as a way to build goodwill and incentivize adoption.\n\nYou can also earn tokens through creative and entrepreneurial activities. For example, people are earning roughly $100 million worth of ETH per day selling NFTs.\n\nTokens align network participants to work together toward a common goal — the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token.\n\nThis fixes the core problem of centralized networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.\n\nBefore web3, users and builders had to choose between the limited functionality of web1 or the corporate, centralized model of web2.\n\nWeb3 offers a new way that combines the best aspects of the previous eras. It’s very early in this movement and a great time to get involved.\n\n*This first appeared [here](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201621266534402).*", "timestamp": 1634015685, "digest": "pYJ4jq6UU4a2lcdnSPOxNGibtr6G-kLJTIXDUcNt6Gw", "contributor": "0xF5179b7758D19D3F34131aA17401743399Ab5B42"}

We’re ever-changing beings - we evolve, decay, and die. Why do we expect our avatars to live forever? *Impermanent Digital* is taking the NFT concept beyond our wildest expectations and plans to bring avatars to life.\n\nPulling from a robust interdisciplinary background in graphic design, video editing, media theory, and marketing, Josh (working mostly under the moniker Glassface or Glass) is a visual artist in the most modern sense. He's carved out a unique lane for himself in a constantly evolving industry. NFT artist is one of his latest roles. On September 18th Glassface launched his first NFT project called *Impermanent Digital*.\n\n***Listed are a series of questions answered by Glassface himself.***\n\n**Where are you from and what’s your story?**\n\nI grew up in upstate New York, currently living in Los Angeles. I’ve always been very creative since I was a kid. I went to school for a major called Electronic Media, Arts & Communications w/ a minor in Technological Entrepreneurship. Was always interested in experimental media, but I went into graphic design as my initial career path out of college. Worked at ad agencies doing design work for corporate projects, learned the groundwork to what I know now - but never really enjoyed that work. Lived in NYC for a while doing freelance design work by day, and filming concerts by night. I honed my craft shooting + editing concert recaps, and started to get asked by artists to shoot music videos. I quickly started building up a catalog of music videos, and had some big viral hits like OG Maco - U Guessed It, and Lil Yachty - 1 Night. Then I started working on commercials for companies like Target, Finish Line, Adidas, and Complex Networks. I’ve taken my craft full circle. Kept doing music videos from 2012 to 2021, and likely have over 500 that I have either directed, co-directed, edited, or did vfx on. My style is very focused on sensory overload, mixed media, and experimenting with media in general.\n\nI started getting into AI art over the past three years. To me, AI art is the future. I look at entire forms of media as my “paints”. Neural networks just so happen to be an insanely powerful new form of paint, and my style has organically gravitated toward AI as a medium… (for more information about Glassface and his work, here are a few other articles and his official website).\n\n[https://glassfaceworld.com/](https://glassfaceworld.com/)\n\n[https://medium.com/@kcorcutt/behind-the-lens-interview-with-digital-media-artist-glassface-2921ae4c8819](https://medium.com/@kcorcutt/behind-the-lens-interview-with-digital-media-artist-glassface-2921ae4c8819)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15955618/glassface-music-video-interview-1-night-lil-yachty-target](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15955618/glassface-music-video-interview-1-night-lil-yachty-target)\n\n[https://www.thefader.com/2016/05/05/lil-yachty-1-night-goldrush-director-interview](https://www.thefader.com/2016/05/05/lil-yachty-1-night-goldrush-director-interview)\n\n**Directly speaking about *Impermanent Digital*, where did the inspiration come from? Are you able to pin it to something or someone?**\n\nThe initial thing that got me even thinking about impermanence in the first place - my girlfriend has a dog that she’s had for 12 years, Guinness. She’s been getting older and slowing down a lot, and one night she seemed really sick all of a sudden. We took her to an emergency vet and they told us she had a huge tumor in her entire chest cavity, and likely would have to be put down. There was an option of surgery but it was really expensive and might result in her still having to be put down if they found cancer. We only had the day to decide what to do, so we ended up deciding to get the surgery. They were able to safely remove the tumor, and she was able to come home 2 days later.\n\nI spent the following two weeks at home watching and taking care of her. A few days into watching her, I wrote up the concept of the project. The whole experience had slapped me in the face with the idea of mortality, after I had spent a few months immersed in a world of NFT’s & collectible avatars. The avatar space seems to be filled with these ageless, over simplified anthropomorphic avatars that just don’t align with the fact that we’re all human. We age, we decay, we die.\n\n**What was your goal and why did you want to make this project?**\n\nI wanted to put out a collection that is culminatory and combines many of my skill sets into one place. I think AI art is absolutely the future, and part of my goal as an artist is to bring AI art to the world in a broader sense. I also was kind of taken aback by a majority of the avatar projects I’ve seen - and wanted to create something to break the mold and shift the paradigm. I created thousands of images through the perspective of AI, as it imagines what human impermanence & mortality look like. It’s kind of a disturbing concept, but I think it’s necessary right now. I also just wanted to bring more ART into the PFP space. Life is filled with unexpected twists and turns, and lots of entropy - I wanted to make a collection that embraces that fact. I hope that this project inspires others to break the mold.\n\n**How are the ID’s made?**\n\nEach ID is made using a unique CryptoPunk input. The idea is we’re killing off some of the OG collections to make way for the new wave. (All <3 to punks)\n\nEach one is then processed through AI - meaning, an almost infinite array of neural networks are used to reimagine each image. On the other side of the process, I am controlling variables (for example: typing in text prompts that give the AI topics to focus on). The software for this project is in-development, and exclusive to Wolfbear Studio. It’s the highest tier, and is miles ahead of anything I’ve seen available publicly. It allows me as an artist to have extremely fine control, and to paint with neural networks. The same way artists started utilizing oil paints at their advent, we are now able to utilize NEURAL NETWORKS as our paint/medium.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gs0_U3j5TPP_-w_u4YEBb.png?height=1678&width=1684)\n\n**Can the AI technology you and Wolfbear Studio use add value in other ways besides making cool nfts?**\n\nAbsolutely - I think there is a huge potential use for AI art as art therapy. Imagine you can type in any sentence, and almost immediately you get to see a beautiful representation of that image. I find the practice very meditative, and recently did a benefit auction for Mental Health America with a meditative art piece I created: [https://foundation.app/@glassface/\\\\\\~/53586](https://foundation.app/@glassface/%5C\\~/53586)\n\n**What makes the 19 *Impermanent Digital* 1/1’s so special?**\n\nMost were created individually (whereas other traits were created in more randomized batches). I made some very custom ones for Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst. Holding a 1/1 means you get the benefits of an Afterlife 3 token, but don’t have to evolve or burn to do so.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/veT247rS6vCnguRzQhnC4.png?height=1694&width=1670)\n\n**What are your expectations for *Impermanent Digital* now?**\n\nI deeply believe in what we’re doing here - I know we’ll have an impact on the future of AI art. I’ve been working on the later stages of this project for quite some time. It will take time to fully develop, but this ID project is the underpinning to *Auras*, and is meant to help us build a community around the idea. We aim to have long term members transition / evolve with us into the next phases. My ultimate goal with Auras is to create a very robust avatar project that introduces futuristic avatars with AI utility. I want to give back as much as possible to the community that has grown around ID, and I intend to continue elevating the art + offering value to the community.\n\n**Do you have anything else you’d like to share with your fans/collectors?**\n\nI want to say thank you for the support. As an artist, my dream has always been to be able to make my own art and share it with the world. I’ve spent years making art for other artists, with the feeling that I was always leading up to a moment like this. Your support enables me to live my dream, and I am beyond excited for what’s to come. We are just getting started.\n\n***Please see the website for all infographics. If you have any questions, Glassface and the team welcomes you to join the discord group.***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2OjubBypqbwIJvg64Ay5N.png?height=479&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2XlYnJj6uN8jnByWyGahq.png?height=460&width=800)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aBmx5iOUbIUYT53J_6TIw.png?height=1700&width=1688)\n\n***Review by mojomitch.eth***\n\nThe art is what drew my attention. The ID’s caught my eye right away and I had to get one. Each one is so unique and original. They are generated using AI tools that very few have access to in the world. Quick peek from the website *“High powered web3 creative tools to allow holders to create AI-assisted artwork of their wildest imagination”.*\n\nThe exclusivity of this project excites me as well. 4,444 ID’s exist today, but in a matter of days that supply is going to decrease significantly when the community decides to burn or hold their tokens. The number of ID’s that will exist after this process is completely unknown, which creates this mysterious excitement within the community. Holders will converse in the discord, so I’d recommend joining if you’re not sure what to do. Glassface and the team have been very supportive and are active every day in Discord. To date, the project has been able to attract roughly 1,870 unique holders, including some amazing artists and other talent like Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst, 888, JN Silva, Stani, Marc Ecko, flur and more.\n\nThis article was done because I really wanted to interview Glassface. *Impermanent Digital* was one the first NFT projects I joined where I wanted to learn more about the artist and support the community. By now, we’ve learned that Glass has a very impressive background. I’m not sure if you knew this but he’s worked with notable artists like Lil Yachty, Wiz Khalifa, Rick Ross, Ty Dolla $ign, Bryson Tiller, Tove Lo, Dua Lipa, Khalid, Migos, Fifth Harmony, Young Thug, Trippie Redd, and more. It’s incredible, but what’s more incredible is his demeanor. I can’t imagine the challenges one encounters when developing NFTs. Or even being an artist of his magnitude. Glass has so much to balance on a plate, and he’s still on Discord every day, being patient and answering questions. Everyone talks about community this, community that. All I know is the *Impermanent Digital* community is very strong because Glass + Team have created an amazing experience. Investing in the artist is a common expression in the NFT space. I think we can all agree this statement fits perfectly in this situation.\n\nI would love to write more but I’m going to save it for the next article. I’ll leave you with this last statement said by Glassface “The art is always going to get better for *Impermanent Digital*. The Auras are the key piece. Many look at the surface of this project, but only some see the big picture.”\n\nAlpha in Discord.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WxijtQbcmR1-RwpJuHXdn.PNG?height=2048&width=2048)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZsNTeksibEhWT_OW3NTFB.PNG?height=2048&width=2048)\n\n", "timestamp": 1634015898, "digest": "BcZb_qyCWqjD78lpvrWDTfWBoiYsVa_WecsKtkoO4Yg", "contributor": "0x467AdE04b9CE978976C3AFD6Ef85a28bf245CC75"}

{"id": "kru3cP2xG-6ZY39shCMEcyofvhjW6CbCHufA4Iu2iGg", "title": "你必须知晓的理财观|理财不是找规律，而是找自己", "body": "不是在币圈还是在传统的股票、有收益理财，都存在问题：正确的投资观，什么是正确的理财观。多的钱。\n\n对于这一点，可以有很多维度去评判：赚取收益的多少，开单的成功率，最大投资回报，最大回撤等等。**但归根结底，我觉得根本是需要长期活着，稳定地赚取更高的收益，实现资本的保值增值。**所以，有些维度并没有太大意义。理财高手的成功，只在于正确时多赚钱，错误时尽可能的少亏钱。市场不断变化、充满不确定性，除了骗子和傻子，没有人能保证不犯错。所以今天我们来探讨下，到底正确的理财观是什么。\n\n**一、理财的重点不是很严重，会有冲动**\n\n提到理财很多人都会觉得复杂高深。韩愈老先生教导我们“闻道有先后，术业有专攻”，那作为所谓的圈内人，我个人的观点是：理财其实一点都不复杂，很多东西复杂是因为被教科书解释的太复杂了。我们不懂汽车的构造也能成为老司机，我们不必懂电磁炉是如何工作的却能把饭做熟。道理是一样的，我们不必弄懂各种理财产品，一样可以打理好自己的资产。\n\n原因很简单，如今已经是高度分工的社会了，你想达到某个目的，会有专业的人士配合你，但有个重要的前提：**你要有明确的想法和目的，也就是说理财的重点不是你懂不懂，而是你想不想去做这件事。**\n\n**二、找到自己的幸福点，不做让自己不舒服的投资才是好的理财方式**\n\n在《水浒传》中，及时雨宋江是个特别会“投资”的人，虽然只是郓城的小押司，但是却经常结交各路好汉赠金送银。不过，宋江的弟弟宋清是个老实本分的人，不明白哥哥为啥这么花钱，还担心交友不慎连累家人。这就是两种截然不同的投资风格，造反的风险和回报都很高，宋江很激进，用钱和义换来了名声，并且很享受这种风险投资，但是这种享受对宋清来说就是折磨，还不如老实务农来得幸福。\n\n**人类的经济行为归结到最后都是获得幸福，那么一个正确的理财观就是找到自己的幸福点，不做让自己不舒服的投资。**诺贝尔奖获得者萨缪尔森有个经典的公式，幸福=效用/欲望。如果想获得稳定的幸福，当我们的欲望比较大时，必须放大追求金钱的步伐，也就是说要做一些激进的投资，否则就只能压制自己的欲望，贫贱夫妻百事哀，这个过程是非常痛苦的。反过来讲，如果效用（分母）过大，我们就要被迫放大自己的欲望，面临的后果很可能是担惊受怕，拉低了幸福值。\n\n老子《道德经》第三十三章中有一句话：知人者智，自知者明。人一生的痛苦大多来自于没真正明白想要什么，追求金钱的欲望是个很主观的东西，而且会随着环境和时间等要素而变化，我们大多数时候只能在欲望的无限大和效用的无限小之间取一个均衡，这个均衡点就是不能让自己不舒服。\n\n**三、理财要不要剔除赌性**\n\n理财到底能干嘛？每次投资人问这个问题的时候，我都很头痛。这不是我能回答的，理财给你的回报完全取决于你对他的理解。\n\n总的来说理财可以分为三种类型，一投机型、二投资型、三赌博型。大多数的普通人适用于第二种，但是这种方式只能锦上添花，不可能帮你实现人生的跨越，我从来没见到哪个人买银行理财或者基金发财的。不少财经专家都宣扬理财不要有赌博的心理，在我看来理财方式并无优劣之分，原则上讲，一切的投资行为都是赌博，只是你押注的筹码大小不同而已。一个最典型的例子，六合彩中奖的概率是1400万分子一，在概率学中，这已经是无限接近于零。虽然只有2元，但从投资回报比看，这是一笔稳赔不赚的投资，而且亏损比是100%。你为什么还要买？无非想以小博大，这就是典型的赌性，一场人人都参与的赌局。\n\n《人民的名义》里，公安厅长祁同伟是个典型的知人且自知的人，他寒门出身，求学苦读，有强烈的改变命运的欲望，但是在升迁的道路上一直坎坷，所以他懂得利用各种资源，达到自己的目的。虽然最后饮弹自杀，在我看来，这并不是一个悲剧的反面教材，而是有血有肉的生活。想要胜天半子，你就得投入超乎他人的资源，这本来就是不公平的游戏，千万富翁想赚100万，只需要涨10%就可以了，而你只有10万本金，需要翻10倍才可以。不过赌性并不是一定要梭哈自己的资金，而是包含了一切你能调动的资源，时间、毅力、甚至是尊严。**理财方式没有好坏，不要盲目的嘲笑或者教育他人，人家追求的东西不同而已。**\n\n**四、认知的笼子要关得住财富和欲望**\n\n有句话讲：你根本赚不到你认知以外的钱，赚到了也没用，因为你留不住，你怎么赚的就会怎么亏回去。这一点在任何圈子都适用。比如很多人靠着一波比特币牛市看起来挣了几百上千万，但是一个不小心，可能就会在一个月内亏完，甚至亏得更多。为啥？因为亏完后想赶本啊。最痛苦的不是没有赚过钱，而是让你赚到钱了又一无所有，这就好比让你趴在井沿儿上往外面的世界看了一眼，又一下子把你打入最阴暗的井底。再比如，中彩票是不是一件好事？当然是，但是这些幸运儿的结局往往出乎很多人的意料。美国有个记者专门研究了彩票得主的后续故事，结局令人唏嘘不已。\n\n她通过调查发现，将近70%的巨额彩票得主在中奖后出现了以下几种情况：\n\n1、家庭关系迅速恶化，夫妻亲朋之间出现矛盾，引发暴力事件\n\n2、挥霍无度，养成不良习惯，以破产结局，更有甚者付出生命代价\n\n3、整日惶惶不安，精神高度紧张，背离原来的生活频道，走极端路线\n\n财富和欲望是非常容易被养大的，但认知的积累却要株积寸累，当有一天认知无法包裹膨胀的财富，人就会放浪形骸。对于陡然而富的人，掌控财富是很难的，比特币在过去十来年里上涨了几千万倍，成就了不少亿万富翁，亲眼看到身边的几个90后，甚至95后，从当初的十几万元，变成了千万身价的，然后就不再工作，买豪车，变得目空一切，谁都瞧不上。结果在今年的519后，财富缩水一大半，立马陷入了另一个极端，又颓又丧。\n\n结语：尤瓦尔赫拉利在《人类简史》中说到：千百年来，哲学家、思想家和宗教人物都对钱嗤之以鼻，称钱为万恶的根源。但就算真是如此，钱同时也是人类最能接受的东西。所有人类创造的信念系统之中，只有金钱能够跨越几乎所有文化鸿沟，不会因为宗教、性别、种族、年龄或性取向而有所歧视。现实生活中，很多人厌恶唯金钱论的世界观，其实对于金钱的共识，恰恰是大多人平权的伟大胜利，人类不可跨越的阶层藩篱不再那么坚固，你对于金钱认知的每一次提升，都可能是人生的一次跨越。**在理财的世界里，我们主动学习，努力工作，深谙稳健投资的意义，遵循周期循环的规律，不见得就能赚到钱，这些都是别人教给我们的，认知不是发现规律，而是发现自己。**", "timestamp": 1634018945, "digest": "lWrheXjTE6IZP9KZ4bBDah_cOEWKREF5irVAaLD8YoI", "contributor": "0x57B93AbAC68f244150984f57cD8E3Fe00CF1B936"}

丰积/财库/鸫\n\nOMI充代币核心有40%的在线互动了VeVe充值钱，这和OMI特色的经济模型设计相关，如果行为用户的价值、购买等与OMI代币的价值相连接，具体如下。\n\nvee储钱钱包中的钻石有3000亿亿亿亿亿亿OMI，用户在VeVeVeVeVe平台使用法法用户值用户时间，充值宝石的OMI币从储钱袋转移到财库代十奥妙。\n\n举例说明，用户一个值了1000个宝石*（即1000美元）*，那么就可以充值1000美元的OMI从收藏到收藏库到库库，如果用户一次使用50个宝石购买了VeVe某个人NFT，那么那时财库钱中捕猎500美元的OMI被永恒永恒。\n\n**亿**链上数据已经显示，**目前已有2969亿个OMI，财库有409亿个OMI，慎重25亿个OMI。**\n\n回购 按照上述规则，如果有大量用户充值宝石，那么储备钱包中的 3000 亿 OMI 有被耗尽的可能。为此，OMI 经济模型中加入了回购规则，使用 VeVe 平台收入的一部分创建回购基金，用于在二级市场回购 OMI 代币放入储备钱包，既可以补充储备，也利于 OMI 代币的市值提升。\n\n疯狂基金的资金来源分为两部分：\n\n首先是平台销售NFT收入的10%。例如用户在VeVe充值了1000宝石（1000美元），读者约30%的应用商店抽成（如“苹果税”），然后平台实际到账约700美元。充值后500宝石平台购买了一个NFT，就相当于通过销售NFT使用盈利350美元，其中的10%即35美元会是虚拟社交基金。\n\n好像是平台已销售但使用的宝石的收入。 按照上面的例子，用户在购买 NFT 后，账户中的 500 宝石，这部分宝石界面使用，在 30% 的应用商店抽成后，平台收入的 350 美元将全部无生命动力基金。\n\n文献所述可以简化为一个公式：\n\nOMI抽抽资金=（宝石销售-应用商店）-（NFT销售-商店成）+\\[（NFT销售应用金额-应用商店抽成）\\*10%\\]\n\n3\\.2 价格信息注：世界信息来源

DeFi、近乎以太坊。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XPd3eKUHn6dWgBSA5uGZk.webp?height=527&width=1080)\n\n**这主要源于NFT的破圈能力。**传统加密领域和DEFI领域对于普通用户的吸引力不足，且有着较高的学习门槛，即使是在众多机构，名人站台的当下，也难以造就大范围的影响力。NFT拥有和流行IP相结合的能力，能够有效拉拢IP原有的粉丝群体，从而吸引圈外用户进入场，就像影视剧IP周边产品、明星开店一样。另外，NFT数字收藏品同时存在。是一个新兴的类别，但与传统的、拥有广泛用户基础的藏品/玩市场相比，仅存在形态上的不同，精神内核还是一致的，NFT更像一种另类的游戏，热衷于收藏、用户群体的诉说有创作的魅力。\n\nEcomi NFT 领域内收入较早的项目，早在 2018 年就开始探索 NFT 与 IP 的结合，且核心成员 David Yu、Alfred Kahn 等在营销营销方面有多年经验，**先发**拥有**知名**品牌资源**优势和团队 Econi拿下优势为品牌授权提供了基础。**\n\n当前Ecomi合作的品牌品类及数量后期，现场报道的粉丝群体也很广泛，加上支持法支付、付费操作简单，当前仅靠一级市场的NFT就已经吸引到了大量的付费用户，遍布各个地区的Google Play 霸榜，**近期建筑市场后，工人VeVe 的会场一波新的高潮。**\n\n \n OMI代币的经济模型上有很多创新，按照规则，VeVe平台内NFT的知识知识，营养财富中被精细的OMI代币会越来越多，同时再使用平台，生活方式OMI代币来填充储备钱包，相当于变相大型市场上正在流通的**O**代币。**精通缩通**，大量粉丝**币价**，接触平台NFT销售持续进行，象征平台和币价会呈正相关，随着平台的成长，持币者也大可以证明获得相关的成长性成果。\n\n综上所述，简单的后期品牌授权是Ecomi的护城河，操作、体验良好是分项，经济模型创新则加币价，综合考察，Ecomi有机会在同一时间的竞品中突围，关注。",

Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist in the Gila forest***\n\nBatman-five looks at his military wristwatch to see the timer which he sets earlier just before he came down from the treehouse, and it’s showing 2 hours 11 minutes. It has been quite a while since Officer Davis starts trekking inside the misty forest of the First-Ring.  \n\nThough he seemed to made a clumsy decision, but he has calculated the potential risks even before going down from the treehouse that the HQ approved to build and used for recon purposes. The wooden treehouse was named Outpost-One and it’s located on the outskirt of the First-Ring of the misty forest which is known to have the densest mist and the gloomiest compared to the Second or the Third-Ring.  \n\nBelieve it or not, it was officer Davis's idea to set up the recon post besides being the only soldier who volunteers for this insane field duty; However, Officer Davis is not an ordinary soldier. Back before Z-Day—which most human survivors have named it these days; he was a decorated and committed Special Operation Forces (SOF) for the US Military Special Unit Division. He served in countless military covert operations overseas, ranging from the Middle East, North Africa, and some parts of Asia; but whatever he did before Z-Day is another story.  \n\nRight after the deadly outbreak, Officer Davis is counted as an asset for the US military—or to be exact, what’s left of the US military corps; and well-respected for his bravery and loyalty in the line of fire to always defend his unit. \n\nFor two long hours—which he felt like a lifetime inside the First-Ring of the mist—Davis has been walking in real slow motions. He consciously controls his breathing by inhaling and exhaling from his nose and mouth to conserve energy in his muscles while consistently measure every step he took for that long tiring shadowy ninjalike walk. \n\nHiding under his ghillie suit, he sometimes chooses to walk or crawl from one place to another in a strictly discreet manner. At every certain distance, he lowers his body to rest on the ground while his camouflage suit blends him almost perfectly with the surrounding bushes. Ordinary watchful eye could never detect or expect anything. \n\nHe couldn’t walk faster or run to the source of the gunshots that he heard because there is a well-known myth not long after this catastrophe began, which is: don’t ever run inside the First-Ring of the mist. Most stories told from human survivors were, whoever runs inside the First-Ring of the mist will not survive. Therefore, believing there can be human survivors left inside the First-Ring of the mist is just too good to be true. \n\n***16:00.***\n\nAs Officer Davis keeps moving for nearly three hours, he starts to realize that his body is demanding water and sugar. Davis's mind and emotions have begun to wander wildly in the last ten minutes, but he tries to stay focus. Minutes later, he finally decided to stop and rest longer behind a large tree which makes him almost invisible by the naked eye. \n\nConnected to the earpiece he wears, Davis turns his CNR back on and a while later, he hears a radio call coming in, \"Batman-five, Batman-five, this is Batman-six, do you copy? Over.\" \n\nLike before, Officer Davis respond by whispering, \n\n\"Batman-six, this is Batman-five, I am half click from the source and conducting recon on the perimeter. Requesting radio silence, over.\" \n\n\"Damn you, Davis! This conversation is not over yet. Batman-six, out.\" \n\nHearing the response from Batman-six back in the HQ, Officer Davis smiles and turns off his radio. \n\nFor an ordinary person, or perhaps most soldiers, a battlefield is a crazy place to hang out, but for Davis, is just another day on the stomping ground. Little does the HQ know that ever since Davis spend his days for these past few weeks in Outpost-One, the reality is, he rarely stays in the treehouse in the daytime. He always stays inside the treehouse after sunset but during the day, Davis is busy exploring and scouting the surrounding area. What Davis has done alone in these past few weeks at Outpost-One is considered insane by many survivors, but he probably did it because he was driven by his survival instinctive behavior and becomes territorial over his domain. Or, the survivors were right, he might just be an adrenaline junky and felt challenged to do it considering he is a well-trained military man.  \n\nSome of Davis’s colleagues in HQ think he is overwhelmed, desperate, and hopeless about the global situation. They believe Davis has made a death wish after he was assigned voluntarily for the field duty on Outpost-One alone. But some colleagues from his unit see it differently. They think Davis is not a desperate and hopeless type of person, yet instead, he simply doesn't want to give up believing that after one-third of the earth's surface is covered by the mist and roamed by the undead, all of it is empty of survivors. They see Officer Davis as a man who believes that the only way to avoid fire is not to run away from it but rather, jump into it. \n\nDuring most of the day, Davis sets up \"invisible fences\" by planting boobytraps or other decoy materials to lure the undead away from entering the Outpost-One perimeter. Anyway, although he never journeys as far as he did today, nevertheless, only time can reveal Davis's true motive as to why he went through all this trouble in the first place? \n\nOfficer Davis use his short resting time to drink and took a bite of his military-grade food supplement. Several minutes later, suddenly, “...Bang! ... Bang! ... Bang! Ratatat! … Ratatat!” \n\nA new round of gunshots was heard and it was close to Davis's proximity. This time Davis did not overhear it once or twice but several times of loud gunshots then followed by a semi-automatic rifle. In an instant, Davis knew what type of semi-automatic rifle was fired; he knew it was not a military-grade weapon but a nonmilitary one. \n\nFor a second, Davis was caught in a moment of disbelieve but he is not an overreactive person, his mind works like lightning, calculating the possible risk, angle, and approximate distance of the gunshot's location, then he begins to move with caution. \n\nDavis knows that he is so close to the source of the gunshots sound and it can be someone or something or it might even be nothing at all because when he heard it the first time, he knew it can just be a gun belonging to a dead survivor triggered accidentally by an undead, yet he feels so in need to follow his hunches today and kill his curiosity.  \n\nDavis slowly crawls to the source. Part of him wishes that he can just run and arrive sooner to see what happen, but then he immediately remembers the myth of the First-Ring; and today, somehow, Davis doesn’t want to be the first one to prove if the myth is either true or false. \n\n## CHAPTER THREE\n\n### Ghostrider\n\n![AC-130J Ghostrider gunship (Illustration 03)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lyXOE5Z7E5CPIVUbWe4iy.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***The Gila Forest National Park, New Mexico***\n\nSince the late '80s, a secluded airfield located in a not well-known location inside the Gila Forest National Park was used by the US Forest Service to prevent forest fire. After 9/11, the airfield was secretly handed over to the US Military. Later, the airfield was converted to an airstrip and used as a secret military base for the US Special Forces. Ever since it was used by the US Forest Service, the locals never see the airfield because it was located deep inside the Gila National Forest.\n\nFor more than two decades, people from the surrounding towns knew that the airfield is regularly used once or twice a year as a training ground for forest firefighters and areal firefighter planes to prevent bushfires in Gila National forest. After it was taken by the US Special Forces, many planes that look like the US Forest Service are often seen near the vicinity. Besides the military servicemen that work on the airstrip, the common folks who live near the surrounding towns never know anything about it. The so-called US Forest Service airfield that they once knew since the '80s has become one of the most sophisticated secret military bases for the US Special Forces. At night, two AC-130J Ghostrider which are known as the deadliest gunship planes take off and land without ever being noticed. Most military servicemen or field agents who work inside the base live like regular people, and some do daily jobs in the nearby towns.\n\n***16:20. The year is 2025, New Mexico. Somewhere inside the Gila forest.***\n\nBatman-six walks to the Air Commando’s Office. He knocks on the door, and seconds later a male voice was heard from inside the room, \"Come in.\"\n\nOfficer Spencer enters and gives his military salute to the high-ranking officer inside the room and says, \"Colonel, Permission to report, Sir.”\n\n“State your report, Spencer,” says the Colonel after he glances at Spencer and continues drawing lines on a map. Before Officer Spencer entered the room, Colonel Monk was busy marking and drawing lines on a military map hanging on the wall that covers almost one side of his office wall.\n\nOfficer Spencer: “Sir, Officer Davis left Outpost-One and he is walking by himself inside the First-Ring of the misty forest. He reported earlier that he might overhear several gunshots and explosions at around noontime from Outpost-One. Now he is investigating the source for the last 2,5 hours and requested radio silence.\"\n\nColonel: \"(Sigh)…He never changes. So, where is he now and what is his status?\"\n\n\"Around 20 minutes ago, Officer Davis reported that he is already 500 meters away from the source. He insists to conduct recon in the surrounding vicinity. Colonel, it is almost sunset, he will never make it alone. Sir, requesting duty, Sir!\" replies Officer Spencer.\n\nColonel: \"Dispatch Blackbird-509 and Bravo-One Team to Outpost-One. Tell them to secure the perimeter and wait for my orders. I will be in Eagle-One. We leave in 20.\"\n\nOfficer Spencer: \"Right away, Sir!\"\n\n***16:40, Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist.***\n\nOfficer Davis has entered uncharted territory. He knows that he never wanders this far before, not at morning, noon, less close to sunset like this late evening. Thirty minutes is the maximum time frame before the night and the dark misty forest turn into Davis's worse nightmare. Well, except he can quickly find a secure hiding place like an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), a hidden treehouse, or a sound escape plan, then even a spec op with skills as Davis will not likely make it. The chance is thin considering two out of the three options are not available. So, time is critical and Davis aware of his weak spot.\n\nTo be clear, the densest mist mainly appears after sunset and is known by survivors including Davis as the sanctuary of the undead, which is why the First-Ring of the mist is undoubtedly the monsters’ lair. Each day, the mist from the First-Ring which has sporadically cover forty percent of the earth's surface in the most world major continents has been continuously expanding. What matters is not only about the mist’s expansion but if a person is trapped inside the First-Ring of the mist for one night, then his effort to escape from the mist the next day becomes greater and farther. Therefore, whoever decided to remain indoors when the deadly outbreak event took place some eight months ago, which is also the first time for the mist to appear, then he is either safe and sound without needing to go out at all, or he is good as an undead.\n\nWith little time to spare, Davis maps the surrounding area with his mind as fast and accurately as he possibly could, and for whatever happens then, he needs to be certain not to lose his way back to Outpost-One. Davis is 400 meters away from the source of the gunshots, but the thick mist still makes it difficult for him to get a clear visual of the location. He needs to go further ahead.\n\n***16:55.***\n\nWhile lying face down on the ground, Davis moves his elbow and feet pushing his body forward one step at a time. This time he moves even slower. It took him almost fifteen minutes just to reached 100 meters from where he was before until he finally arrived at a nearby open field. Kill zones to be precise. Davis knew he has reached the safe limit; further movement can expose him to threat and uncertainty.\n\nIn the battleground, better safe than sorry is never an option. Knowing the risk Davis might face the undead, he has no plan to add hostile enemies to his adversary list. A spec op like Davis has figured out that a gunshot sound that happened inside the sanctuary of the undead is always a bad combination. He decides to stay hidden and use his spot to observe the approximate gunshot location using his MRAD sniper scope. Gently, he positions his sniper rifle while listening to every noise happening nearby. For Davis, sitting alone day in and day out inside a misty forest is not his first time, but sitting alone in the misty forest full of undead walking around after sunset, now that is his first time.\n\n![(Illustration 04)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Dy0N98IHCc4n4OocTcuRn.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nAfter adjusting his sniper’s position, Davis starts to see a small-looking red dot wobbling from afar. It also becomes apparent to him that the red dot is moving in his direction. He shakes his head twice to make sure his mind is not playing with his eyes but is neither his head nor his eyes. He sees something out there alright. Davis measures the distance of the red object which is around 200 meters away; but as the night invites the sun to sets at the edge of the horizon, the mist also thickens inside the misty forest. Davis still couldn’t confirm what he sees with his naked eye. He opens the sniper scope and begins to zoom in onto the small red dot. Once he saw it, Davis’s heart was shocked. He mumbles, \"It’s impossible!”\n\n## CHAPTER FOUR\n\n### The briefing room\n\n![Dubai, UAE (Illustration 05)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4o4i4rwijnz4llzHe-FRA.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***01:00, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 24 days before Christmas, 2024.***\n\nTwo AC-130J Ghostrider belonging to the US Special Forces landed safely on the US-UAE join operation military air force base near Dubai. They have just completed one of their two secret missions at an undisclosed area somewhere inside the Middle East. The two birds are refilling their ammunition and fuel while the crew has been given spare time to rest inside the military compound before doing their next and last assignment this year.\n\n![AC-130J Ghostrider (Illustration 06)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PgZz-pp0PXErf1FtCfHg_.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nOfficer Davis is drinking a cold beer inside the military cafeteria. He needs a break from his military duty; at least it’s what he felt in his heart. Although he has not returned home in the past six months, his face looks glad, because once he completed his last assignment, the miserable days of missing his family will soon be over.\n\nEver since Officer Davis was assigned to conduct several classified and covert military operations overseas six months ago; well actually, he was stationed by the US military high command in Washington to remain at a secret military base located inside The Gila Forest National Park, New Mexico. It is not far from the New Mexico state capital, Albuquerque, where his family are making their daily lives.\n\nEach month in the past six months, Davis spent seven days in Washington DC, where he reported the status of his last assignment and was then assigned to a new one before heading back to the Gila Military Base in New Mexico. Davis's missions are classified as covert operations; therefore, he never tells Catherine of his whereabouts for safety reasons and his loyalty to the corps.\n\nCurrently, he is on a video call with his wife and six years old son, Catherine and Mike.\n\nMike: \"Daddy, will you be home on Christmas Eve?\"\n\nDavis: \"Sure Mike, I’ll not miss it for the world. I miss you son.\"\n\nMike: \"But last year you also promised but you were not home on Christmas and New Year?\"\n\nDavis: \"I am so sorry Mike, but daddy was busy last year. Look, I tell you what, Daddy promise will be home before Christmas and I got a surprise for you and Mommy.\"\n\nMike: \"Mommy, Daddy said he got a surprise for me and you. Daddy, when will you return home?\"\n\n\"Davis! Briefing room, ASAP!\", Officer Monk shows up and interrupts Davis's conversation with his 6 years old son.\n\nDavis: \"Mike, Daddy got to go. Be good and help Mommy, you hear me kid?\"\n\nMike: \"Okay, Daddy.\" Though he is not pleased with his father's decision to end the video call too soon.\n\nSuddenly, Davis's wife takes over the iPhone from her son.\n\nCatherine: “Sweetheart, can Mommy talk to Daddy? Mommy needs to tell Daddy about something,” then she switches the call mode to a private conversation as she walks to the kitchen.\n\nCatherine: \"Again Davis? It’s not even five minutes yet?\"\n\nDavis: \"Look, Honey, I'll be home on the fifth, but don't tell Mike about it, I want to surprise him. I love you both. Honey, I am sorry. I got to go.\"\n\nCatherine is upset with Davis's excuses and she hung up the call without saying anything.\n\nFor a moment Davis was having a mixed feeling between disappointment with himself and the need to be patient at the same time. He closes his eyes, then after a while, he sighs.\n\nDavis switches his mobile phone off and walks to the briefing room. Inside the military base, all personal mobile phones must remain switched off except inside the cafeteria.\n\n***December 2024, Albuquerque, New Mexico. Catherine’s residence.***\n\nSomewhere in a rented apartment in downtown Albuquerque, Catherine has recently switched off her call with her husband. Catherine holds herself not to cry but she sometimes found herself having no clue whether she loves her husband so much or just hated him too much because he is rarely available at home with her.\n\nCatherine opens the fridge to get a glass of milk for Mike while she mumbles, “Just be patient Catherine. It’s not his first time he did it, and it’ll certainly not be his last.”\n\nShe puts the glass of milk beside Mike while he is busy playing with his toys on the dining table. Some minutes later, she opens her mobile phone again and writes a short message (SMS) to Davis.\n\nCatherine writes: \"Davis, I am so sorry. I just missed you so much. Promise me to be safe and see you soon. Charlie-Mama-Lima-Delta ...\"\n\nShe always adds “Charlie-Mama-Lima-Delta” on her SMS to Davis at the end which means Catherine-Mike-Love-Davis, although Davis never does the same.\n\n***17:00, August 2025. Somewhere in the outskirt of Gila National Forest Park.***\n\nInside the First-Ring of the misty forest, Davis is looking closely using his MRAD sniper scope. He still could not believe what he sees and whispers repeatedly to himself, \"No, No, ... This can't be true!\"\n\n## CHAPTER FIVE\n\n### Love your neighbor like yourself\n\n![(Illustration 07)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BEM9WoTI_A5qVrRO8823h.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***Albuquerque, New Mexico. Early December 2024***\n\nCatherine has been sitting for half an hour in the living room apartment. She picks her mobile phone several times and hopes there is a Short Message or call from Davis. Today, all she ever wanted—after her last SMS to Davis—was a reply from her husband to say anything that gives a clear sign for Catherine that Davis is still truly cares for her and Mike.\n\nWell, she feels like she deserves it, at least after living patiently alone for four and half years, although she married Davis nine years ago. Each year she only spends six months with her husband. And most of all on this late evening, she misses him so much and needs something that can cheer her mood.\n\nWhile she keeps staring at her mobile phone, suddenly Mike says to Catherine, \"Mommy, why is there a cloud outside?\"\n\nCatherine: \"What cloud? Where?\"\n\nMike: \"There.\" he points out to the balcony that is facing the city.\n\nThe balcony has a panoramic view of the city. This was one of the reasons Catherine chose the apartment. She likes to sit at night thinking about her life and wonder will she be able to see her husband again? Safe and still in one piece.\n\nCatherine often listens to romantic Mexican music and watches the beautiful night lights of the beautiful city of Albuquerque. She hopes it can ease the pain inside her heart from missing her husband.\n\nCatherine is still sitting on the living room sofa when Mike says about the cloud. So, she cannot see what’s happening outside her apartment. The balcony door is near the dining table opposite the kitchen where mike is playing with his toys. She immediately gets up from the sofa and walks towards the balcony.\n\nAs she reaches the dining table, she takes a glance and sees the city is covered by white smoke. She felt disbelieve but it’s real. As she thinks it could be fire smoke, she says, “O God, is it forest fire?” Fear suddenly struck her mind and she breathes faster than usual though tries to calm herself down. She opens the balcony and steps out to the balcony.\n\nAs she gets closer and holds the balcony handrail, she looks at the street below. She sees the whole neighborhood is empty. No cars passing by or people walking around as they used to. She ponders, “Where the hell is everybody?”\n\nCatherine looks closer toward her car at the parking lot below and sees one of her neighbors who lives on the ground floor is standing beside her car. Her name is Mrs. Abigail. She is an elderly lady and lives alone with her cat, Beatrice after her husband passed away four years ago. Catherine doesn't know Mrs. Abigail well but since she walks with a four-legged walker and smiles every time they met, Catherine felt sorry for what Mrs. Abigail is going through.\n\nCatherine's apartment is only three floors high and that is why it's easy for her to identify the old lady who has been staring at her car for the last minute but without her walker.\n\nCatherine was surprised to see Mrs. Abigail is standing without her walker and shouts to her neighbor from the balcony, \"Mrs. Abigail! Mrs. Abigail! What are you doing? Where is Rosa? Why are you standing without your walker? Mrs. Abigail! Do you know why the city is covered with white smoke? Mrs. Abigail! … Mrs. Abigail!”\n\nDespite she shouted to Mrs. Abigail from the balcony, Mrs. Abigail just keeps standing in front of Catherine's car without the walker and she did not respond to what Catherine is saying.\n\nShe feels something strange is happening, but suddenly, she hears her apartment door was opened. She quickly rushes back into her apartment and saw her main apartment door was opened. She looks at the dining table and Mike was gone! She spontaneously says, \"O GOD, NO!\"\n\nShe panics and runs chasing Mike to the stairs. As she rushes on the stairs to the ground floor, she yells, “Mikey! Come back here! Stop! Mikey!\"\n\nWhile running on the stairs, she wonders, how a six-year-old boy runs these stairs so fast that she couldn’t catch up on him. Catherine finally reaches the ground floor and she continues running to the main building entrance that is facing the main street. The main door is partly glass. So the main street is visible.\n\nShe can see Mrs. Abigail is still standing facing her car, and several meters away behind Mrs. Abigail, Mike is walking towards Mrs. Abigail.\n\nCatherine feels relief for a moment, but now she sees something frightening and almost impossible. The neighbor she knew can barely stand on her two feet moreover to walk because she’ll need a walker to do it. At that time, she vividly sees part of Mrs. Abigail's clothes has reddish stains, which from where Catherine sees it, it's looks like fresh blood.\n\nIn that frightening moment, Catherine suddenly feels as if everything moves in slow motion.\n\nShe sees Mrs. Abigail's apartment door is opened and more bloodstains are seen on the floor and wall near the apartment’s door. She found Beatrice's dead body. Mrs. Abigail's cat was lying dead in a pool of blood not far from the door. Beatrice's neck was cold-bloodedly ripped off.\n\nSeeing what she saw, Catherine runs to the door to grab Mike as fast as she could, but somehow her legs are not responding to her will, and by the time she reaches the main building door, Mike is already too close to Mrs. Abigail. She yells so loud trying to stop Mike from getting closer to Mrs. Abigail, \"Mikey Stop! Mikey!\"\n\nCatherine tries to run faster but somehow, she couldn't.\n\nShe shouts repeatedly, and yet innocent Mike just keeps walking towards Mrs. Abigail.\n\nAs Mike stands behind Mrs. Abigail, she suddenly turns around and at that moment, Catherine sees the most frightening face she ever sees in her entire life!\n\n![(Illustration 08)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D6-QdXYsRo7SuuNgLa5_1.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nStill struck by the fear of what she sees, Mrs. Abigail suddenly moves to hold Mike.\n\nCatherine knew Mike made a mistake as he probably thought that the old lady standing by her car is the nice and warm-hearted Mrs. Abigail, their neighbor.\n\nAs Mrs. Abigail grabs Mike's jacket. Catherine cries and her mind flees at that frightening moment and shouts her husband’s name, Davis, who always lives far away from home, leaving her and Mike alone.\n\nCathrine screams: “Davis, help me! Davis! … Mikey!\n\nThough scares as hell, Catherine pulls herself together and gives all her strength and courage to save her one and only son, Mike.\n\nAs Catherine gets closer, she sees the frightening face of Mrs. Abigail who already looks like a dead person. Her eyes are yellowish red and her mouth is dripping thick colored blood which Catherine thought is Beatrice who was known in the neighborhood as the fat cat.\n\nKnowing he makes a mistake, Mike is terrified as he sees Mrs. Abigail's face and he turns to rush back into the apartment building. As Mike turns swiftly, the monster or someone who looks like Mrs. Abigail grabs his shoulder with her right hand. Mike struggles to fight back because both his hand is loosened and he yells, \"Mommy help! Help me! Mommy!\n\nWith both hands, Catherine quickly grabs both of Mike's arms as she tries to pull her son with all her strength to safety. She cries and yells, \"Let him go you old hag! Let Mikey go!”\n\nCatherine keeps screaming and she can hear Mike was screaming desperately to be saved from Mrs. Abigail.\n\n\"Mommy! Wake up! Mommy! Wake up!\"\n\nSlowly ... Catherine hears Mike’s screams become louder and she suddenly awakes from her sleep and sees Mike standing in front of him inside the living room apartment crying while calling her name.\n\n\"Mommy! Mommy! Please, wake up! You scare me. Why do you keep calling Daddy and me?\" Asks Mike.\n\n## CHAPTER SIX\n\n### Certain plans in an uncertain time\n\n![(Illustration 09)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_BbKwUBrjtYmpWBmC2vyR.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***The year is 2025. A helo flying on route 180 heading North near Whispering Pines, New Mexico.***\n\nBravo-One: \"Eagle-One, come in Eagle-One, this is Bravo-One. Bravo-One Oscar-Mike and five clicks from Outpost-One. Over.\"\n\nEagle-One: \"Eagle-One to Bravo-One. Roger-Tango, Lima-Charlie. Break. Bravo-One, be advised the ground is FUBAR after sunset. Advance with caution. Over.\"\n\nBravo-One: \"Roger that. Bravo-One, Out.\"\n\nThe bravo-One team consists of four highly trained spec ops. They know the vicinity and the surroundings of the Gila National Forest well since they have been guarding the base before Z-Day. They used to disguise themselves as forest rangers to scare hikers away who come in too close to the secret military base, then they told them to return because they’ve entered wolves or bear hunting ground and not safe to proceed.\n\nDespite the Bravo-One team have the knowledge and experience of the Gila forest, but before Z-Day, most people have reported strange-looking Oak Trees appeared in many areas and some grew overnight.\n\nAs Blackbird-509 is preparing to land in a nearby open field on the edge of the Second-Ring of the misty forest, the Bravo-One team is checking their weapons and communication unit inside the Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk for the last time. The helo that carries the Bravo-One team is like a tank and will provide air support for the ground team. The Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk has two external wings that can support four weapons on each side, like the 50-cal (12.7mm) gun, Hydra 70 rocket pods, and Hellfire missiles. There is also a 7.62mm minigun mounted on the side of the cockpit and controlled remotely using the pilot visor’s helmet.\n\n***17:02. Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist***\n\nOfficer Davis still can’t trust what he sees. He needs to be perfectly sure that whatever he sees is real and not his imagination. He keeps looking through his sniper scope and waits until the object becomes closer and clearer.\n\nPerhaps it's fate or mere coincidence on that late afternoon because a heavy storm is also gathering above some parts of the surrounding misty forest in Gila. The wind is building speed fast and followed by dark clouds thickening by the minute. The stormy weather makes the misty forest even darker at sunset. As a spec op, Davis knew well that stormy weather is his advantage over the enemy but at the same time, it can also become his biggest obstacle.\n\nThe high-speed wind scatters the mist and makes Officer Davis finally has the visual ability to see and confirmed the wobbling red dot with certainty. Then he uses the sniper scope again to zoom to what is behind the red object, and what he sees has brought fear down to Davis’s spine!\n\nOnce Davis knew what he is about to face, he takes a deep breath and sighs. He knows he is facing the impossible, but then his mind tries to make a quick plan but today, time is not on his side!\n\n**(To be continued)**", "timestamp": 1634019949, "digest": "cvfeCUhakb4FFnb4geW3ZmzfZ5S1ZRRBTERR0r1xWQQ", "contributor": "0xc1C41e3606bF2756c09c95132F528012be17f724"}

For example, the stock price of a company continues to fall (but actually without any business changes), which is usually thought to be in financial crisis or personnel changes and other operational problems. In fact, it’s just because the private equity investors continue to sell shares, so the stock supply increases, while the demand remains unchanged, resulting in the decline of the stock price, thus affecting people's evaluation of the company and people's enthusiasm for buying shares. It is not difficult to understand that the fundamentals are decoupled from the price and affected by the distribution of chips. \n  \n \n\nAs the blockchain market gets more and more effective, token issuance schemes become more important. The market price is affected by supply and demand. We first assume that the demand is strong, and when the hotspot comes, the buyers will increase greatly. At this time, the late trend and the interests of private equity investors alike should be considered when the project party goes to the exchange, so the supply of tokens seems particularly important.\n\n \n\nIf all the private equity investors don’t release tokens at the start of trading, the project side don’t carry out a good market-making plan, and there is no supply in the market, the opening price will be pulled extremely high. Later when tokens are released, the price will drop sharply, or even more than 90%(this is not uncommon), which will affect not only the buying enthusiasm of the secondary market, but also the interests of private equity investors. When tokens are released later, the hotspot has gone, and there will be no buying demand, which not only damages the reputation of the project side, but also does no help to the accumulation of operating capital.\n\n \n\nIf all the tokens released to private equity investors at the start of trading exceeds market expectations and buying demand, the price will open low and is likely to go low, which also affects the reputation of the project, and the project party will be regarded as incapable by the market. At the same time, all the private equity investors sell in the secondary market, so the project party's own funds will not be able to sell well, affecting the funds for later operations.\n\n \n\nA better solution is to release some tokens/shares to private equity investors, such as 10% or 30%, and then release them linearly for about one or two years. In this way, private equity investors can sell some of them at the start of trading, or hold them if they are bullish on them for a long time, and the market demand can also bear this part of the selling pressure. The price will open low and go high, which not only ensures the income of private equity investors, but also gives the project side an opportunity of increasing the operating capital. At the same time, with a good market reputation, the products issued by the project side are highly sought after and become high-frequency and just-needed. Therefore, the project will be considered as high-quality by the market, and the ability of the team will be recognized. As a result, it is easier for the project side to get the market by re-issuing derivative projects.\n\nAny project party should pay attention to the token issuance plan.

Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist in the Gila forest***\n\nBatman-five looks at his military wristwatch to see the timer which he sets earlier just before he came down from the treehouse, and it’s showing 2 hours 11 minutes. It has been quite a while since Officer Davis starts trekking inside the misty forest of the First-Ring.\n\nThough he seemed to made a clumsy decision, but he has calculated the potential risks even before going down from the treehouse that the HQ approved to build and used for recon purposes. The wooden treehouse was named Outpost-One and it’s located on the outskirt of the First-Ring of the misty forest which is known to have the densest mist and the gloomiest human eye visibility compared to the Second or the Third-Ring.\n\nBelieve it or not, it was officer Davis's idea to set up the recon post besides being the only soldier who volunteers for this insane field duty; However, Officer Davis is not an ordinary soldier. Back before Z-Day—which most human survivors have named it these days; he was a decorated and committed Special Operation Forces (SOF) for the US Military Special Unit Division. He served in countless military covert operations overseas, ranging from the Middle East, North Africa, and some parts of Asia; but whatever he did before Z-Day is another story.\n\nRight after the deadly outbreak, Officer Davis is counted as an asset for the US military—or to be exact, what’s left of the US military corps; and well-respected for his bravery and loyalty in the line of fire to always defend his unit.\n\nFor two long hours—which he felt like a lifetime inside the First-Ring of the mist—Davis has been walking in real slow motions. He consciously controls his breathing by inhaling and exhaling from his nose and mouth to conserve energy in his muscles while consistently measure every step he took for that long tiring shadowy ninjalike walk.\n\nHiding under his ghillie suit, he sometimes chooses to walk or crawl from one place to another in a strictly discreet manner. At every certain distance, he lowers his body to rest on the ground while his camouflage suit blends him almost perfectly with the surrounding bushes. Ordinary watchful eyes could never detect or expect anything.\n\nHe couldn’t walk faster or run to the source of the gunshots that he heard because there is a well-known myth not long after this catastrophe began, which is: don’t ever run inside the First-Ring of the mist. Most stories told from human survivors were, whoever runs inside the First-Ring of the mist will not survive. Therefore, believing there can be human survivors left inside the First-Ring of the mist is just too good to be true.\n\n***16:00***\n\nAs Officer Davis keeps moving for nearly three hours, he starts to realize that his body is demanding water and sugar. Davis's mind and emotions have begun to wander wildly in the last ten minutes, but he tries to stay focus. Minutes later, he finally decided to stop and rest longer behind a large tree which makes him almost invisible by the naked eye.\n\nConnected to the earpiece he wears, Davis turns his CNR back on and a while later, he hears a radio call coming in, \"Batman-five, Batman-five, this is Batman-six, do you copy? Over.\"\n\nLike before, Officer Davis respond by whispering,\n\n\"Batman-six, this is Batman-five, I am half click from the source and conducting recon on the perimeter. Requesting radio silence, over.\"\n\n\"Damn you, Davis! This conversation is not over yet. Batman-six, out.\"\n\nHearing the response from Batman-six back in the HQ, Officer Davis smiles and turns off his radio.\n\nFor an ordinary person, or perhaps most soldiers, a battleground is a crazy place to hang out, but for Davis, is just another day on the stomping ground. Little does the HQ know that ever since Davis spend his days for these past few weeks in Outpost-One, the reality is, he rarely stays in the treehouse in the daytime. He always stays inside the treehouse after sunset but during the day, Davis is busy exploring and scouting the surrounding area. What Davis has done alone in these past few weeks at Outpost-One is considered insane by many survivors, but he probably did it because he was driven by his survival instinctive behavior and becomes territorial over his domain. Or, the survivors were right, he might just be an adrenaline junky and felt challenged to do it considering he is a well-trained military man.\n\nSome of Davis’s colleagues in HQ think he is overwhelmed, desperate, and hopeless about the global situation. They believe Davis has made a death wish after he was assigned voluntarily for the field duty on Outpost-One alone. But some colleagues from his unit see it differently. They think Davis is not a desperate and hopeless type of person, yet instead, he simply doesn't want to give up believing that after one-third of the earth's surface is covered by the mist and roamed by the undead, all of it is empty of survivors. They see Officer Davis as a man who believes that the only way to avoid fire is not to run away from it but rather, jump into it.\n\nDuring most of the day, Davis sets up \"invisible fences\" by planting boobytraps or other decoy materials to lure the undead away from entering the Outpost-One perimeter. Anyway, although he never journeys as far as he did today, nevertheless, only time can reveal Davis's true motive as to why he went through all this trouble in the first place?\n\nOfficer Davis use his short resting time to drink and took a bite of his military-grade food supplement. Several minutes later, suddenly, “...Bang! ... Bang! ... Bang! Ratatat! … Ratatat!”\n\nA new round of gunshots was heard and it was close to Davis's proximity. This time Davis did not overhear it once or twice but several times of loud gunshots then followed by a semi-automatic rifle. In an instant, Davis knew what type of semi-automatic rifle was fired; he knew it was not a military-grade weapon but a nonmilitary one.\n\nFor a second, Davis was caught in a moment of disbelieve but he is not an overreactive person, his mind works like lightning, calculating the possible risk, angle, and approximate distance of the gunshot's location, then he begins to move with caution.\n\nDavis knows that he is so close to the source of the gunshots sound and it can be someone or something or it might even be nothing at all because when he heard it the first time, he knew it can just be a gun belonging to dead survivors triggered accidentally by an undead, yet he feels so in need to follow his hunches today and kill his curiosity.\n\nDavis slowly crawls to the source. Part of him wishes that he can just run and arrive sooner to see what happen, but then he immediately remembers the myth of the First-Ring; and today, somehow, Davis doesn’t want to be the first one to prove if the myth is either true or false.\n\n## CHAPTER THREE\n\n### Ghostrider\n\n![AC-130J Ghostrider gunship (Illustration 03)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lyXOE5Z7E5CPIVUbWe4iy.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***The Gila Forest National Park, New Mexico***\n\nSince the late '80s, a secluded airfield located in a not well-known location inside the Gila Forest National Park was used by the US Forest Service to prevent forest fire. After 9/11, the airfield was secretly handed over to the US Military. Later, the airfield was converted to an airstrip and used as a secret military base for the US Special Forces. Ever since it was used by the US Forest Service, the locals never see the airfield because it was located deep inside the Gila National Forest.\n\nFor more than two decades, people from the surrounding towns knew that the airfield is regularly used once or twice a year as a training ground for forest firefighters and areal firefighter planes to prevent bushfires in Gila National forest. After it was taken by the US Special Forces, many planes that look like the US Forest Service are often seen near the vicinity. Besides the military servicemen that work on the airstrip, the common folks who live near the surrounding towns never know anything about it. The so-called US Forest Service airfield that they once knew since the '80s has become one of the most sophisticated secret military bases for the US Special Forces. At night, two AC-130J Ghostrider which are known as the deadliest gunship planes take off and land without ever being noticed. Most military servicemen or field agents who work inside the base live like regular people, and some do daily jobs in the nearby towns.\n\n***16:20. The year is 2025, New Mexico. Somewhere inside the Gila forest.***\n\nBatman-six walks to the Air Commando’s Office. He knocks on the door, and seconds later a male voice was heard from inside the room, \"Come in.\"\n\nOfficer Spencer enters and gives his military salute to the high-ranking officer inside the room and says, \"Colonel, Permission to report, Sir.”\n\n“State your report, Spencer,” says the Colonel after he glances at Spencer and continues drawing lines on a map. Before Officer Spencer entered the room, Colonel Monk was busy marking and drawing lines on a military map hanging on the wall that covers almost one side of his office wall.\n\nOfficer Spencer: “Sir, Officer Davis left Outpost-One and he is walking by himself inside the First-Ring of the misty forest. He reported earlier that he might overhear several gunshots and explosions at around noontime from Outpost-One. Now he is investigating the source for the last 2,5 hours and requested radio silence.\"\n\nColonel: \"(Sigh)…He never changes. So, where is he now and what is his status?\"\n\n\"Around 20 minutes ago, Officer Davis reported that he is already 500 meters away from the source. He insists to conduct recon in the surrounding vicinity. Colonel, it is almost sunset, he will never make it alone. Sir, requesting duty, Sir!\" replies Officer Spencer.\n\nColonel: \"Dispatch Blackbird-509 and Bravo-One Team to Outpost-One. Tell them to secure the perimeter and wait for my orders. I will be in Eagle-One. We leave in 20.\"\n\nOfficer Spencer: \"Right away, Sir!\"\n\n***16:40, Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist.***\n\nOfficer Davis has entered uncharted territory. He knows that he never wanders this far before, not at morning, noon, less close to sunset like this late evening. Thirty minutes is the maximum time frame before the night and the dark misty forest turn into Davis's worse nightmare. Well, except he can quickly find a secure hiding place like an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), a hidden treehouse, or a sound escape plan, then even a spec op with skills as Davis will not likely make it. The chance is thin considering two out of the three options are not available. So, time is critical and Davis aware of his weak spot.\n\nTo be clear, the densest mist mainly appears after sunset and is known by survivors including Davis as the sanctuary of the undead, which is why the First-Ring of the mist is undoubtedly the monsters’ lair. Each day, the mist from the First-Ring which has sporadically cover forty percent of the earth's surface in the most world major continents has been continuously expanding. What matters is not only about the mist’s expansion but if a person is trapped inside the First-Ring of the mist for one night, then his effort to escape from the mist the next day becomes greater and farther. Therefore, whoever decided to remain indoors when the deadly outbreak event took place some eight months ago, which is also the first time for the mist to appear, then he is either safe and sound without needing to go out at all, or he is good as an undead.\n\nWith little time to spare, Davis maps the surrounding area with his mind as fast and accurately as he possibly could, and for whatever happens then, he needs to be certain not to lose his way back to Outpost-One. Davis is 400 meters away from the source of the gunshots, but the thick mist still makes it difficult for him to get a clear visual of the location. He needs to go further ahead.\n\n***16:55.***\n\nWhile lying face down on the ground, Davis moves his elbow and feet pushing his body forward one step at a time. This time he moves even slower. It took him almost fifteen minutes just to reached 100 meters from where he was before until he finally arrived at a nearby open field. Kill zones to be precise. Davis knew he has reached the safe limit; further movement can expose him to threat and uncertainty.\n\nIn the battleground, better safe than sorry is never an option. Knowing the risk Davis might face the undead, he has no plan to add hostile enemies to his adversary list. A spec op like Davis has figured out that a gunshot sound that happened inside the sanctuary of the undead is always a bad combination. He decides to stay hidden and use his spot to observe the approximate gunshot location using his MRAD sniper scope. Gently, he positions his sniper rifle while listening to every noise happening nearby. For Davis, sitting alone day in and day out inside a misty forest is not his first time, but sitting alone in the misty forest full of undead walking around after sunset, now that is his first time.\n\n![(Illustration 04)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Dy0N98IHCc4n4OocTcuRn.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nAfter adjusting his sniper’s position, Davis starts to see a small-looking red dot wobbling from afar. It also becomes apparent to him that the red dot is moving in his direction. He shakes his head twice to make sure his mind is not playing with his eyes but is neither his head nor his eyes. He sees something out there alright. Davis measures the distance of the red object which is around 200 meters away; but as the night invites the sun to sets at the edge of the horizon, the mist also thickens inside the misty forest. Davis still couldn’t confirm what he sees with his naked eye. He opens the sniper scope and begins to zoom in onto the small red dot. Once he saw it, Davis’s heart was shocked. He mumbles, \"It’s impossible!”\n\n## CHAPTER FOUR\n\n### The briefing room\n\n![Dubai, UAE (Illustration 05)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4o4i4rwijnz4llzHe-FRA.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***01:00, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 24 days before Christmas, 2024.***\n\nTwo AC-130J Ghostrider belonging to the US Special Forces landed safely on the US-UAE join operation military air force base near Dubai. They have just completed one of their two secret missions at an undisclosed area somewhere inside the Middle East. The two birds are refilling their ammunition and fuel while the crew has been given spare time to rest inside the military compound before doing their next and last assignment this year.\n\n![AC-130J Ghostrider (Illustration 06)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PgZz-pp0PXErf1FtCfHg_.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nOfficer Davis is drinking a cold beer inside the military cafeteria. He needs a break from his military duty; at least it’s what he felt in his heart. Although he has not returned home in the past six months, his face looks glad, because once he completed his last assignment, the miserable days of missing his family will soon be over.\n\nEver since Officer Davis was assigned to conduct several classified and covert military operations overseas six months ago; well actually, he was stationed by the US military high command in Washington to remain at a secret military base located inside The Gila Forest National Park, New Mexico. It is not far from the New Mexico state capital, Albuquerque, where his family are making their daily lives.\n\nEach month in the past six months, Davis spent seven days in Washington DC, where he reported the status of his last assignment and was then assigned to a new one before heading back to the Gila Military Base in New Mexico. Davis's missions are classified as covert operations; therefore, he never tells Catherine of his whereabouts for safety reasons and his loyalty to the corps.\n\nCurrently, he is on a video call with his wife and six years old son, Catherine and Mike.\n\nMike: \"Daddy, will you be home on Christmas Eve?\"\n\nDavis: \"Sure Mike, I’ll not miss it for the world. I miss you son.\"\n\nMike: \"But last year you also promised but you were not home on Christmas and New Year?\"\n\nDavis: \"I am so sorry Mike, but daddy was busy last year. Look, I tell you what, Daddy promise will be home before Christmas and I got a surprise for you and Mommy.\"\n\nMike: \"Mommy, Daddy said he got a surprise for me and you. Daddy, when will you return home?\"\n\n\"Davis! Briefing room, ASAP!\", Officer Monk shows up and interrupts Davis's conversation with his 6 years old son.\n\nDavis: \"Mike, Daddy got to go. Be good and help Mommy, you hear me kid?\"\n\nMike: \"Okay, Daddy.\" Though he is not pleased with his father's decision to end the video call too soon.\n\nSuddenly, Davis's wife takes over the iPhone from her son.\n\nCatherine: “Sweetheart, can Mommy talk to Daddy? Mommy needs to tell Daddy about something,” then she switches the call mode to a private conversation as she walks to the kitchen.\n\nCatherine: \"Again Davis? It’s not even five minutes yet?\"\n\nDavis: \"Look, Honey, I'll be home on the fifth, but don't tell Mike about it, I want to surprise him. I love you both. Honey, I am sorry. I got to go.\"\n\nCatherine is upset with Davis's excuses and she hung up the call without saying anything.\n\nFor a moment Davis was having a mixed feeling between disappointment with himself and the need to be patient at the same time. He closes his eyes, then after a while, he sighs.\n\nDavis switches his mobile phone off and walks to the briefing room. Inside the military base, all personal mobile phones must remain switched off except inside the cafeteria.\n\n***December 2024, Albuquerque, New Mexico. Catherine’s residence.***\n\nSomewhere in a rented apartment in downtown Albuquerque, Catherine has recently switched off her call with her husband. Catherine holds herself not to cry but she sometimes found herself having no clue whether she loves her husband so much or just hated him too much because he is rarely available at home with her.\n\nCatherine opens the fridge to get a glass of milk for Mike while she mumbles, “Just be patient Catherine. It’s not his first time he did it, and it’ll certainly not be his last.”\n\nShe puts the glass of milk beside Mike while he is busy playing with his toys on the dining table. Some minutes later, she opens her mobile phone again and writes a short message (SMS) to Davis.\n\nCatherine writes: \"Davis, I am so sorry. I just missed you so much. Promise me to be safe and see you soon. Charlie-Mama-Lima-Delta ...\"\n\nShe always adds “Charlie-Mama-Lima-Delta” on her SMS to Davis at the end which means Catherine-Mike-Love-Davis, although Davis never does the same.\n\n***17:00, August 2025. Somewhere in the outskirt of Gila National Forest Park.***\n\nInside the First-Ring of the misty forest, Davis is looking closely using his MRAD sniper scope. He still could not believe what he sees and whispers repeatedly to himself, \"No, No, ... This can't be true!\"\n\n## CHAPTER FIVE\n\n### Love your neighbor like yourself\n\n![(Illustration 07)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BEM9WoTI_A5qVrRO8823h.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***Albuquerque, New Mexico. Early December 2024***\n\nCatherine has been sitting for half an hour in the living room apartment. She picks her mobile phone several times and hopes there is a Short Message or call from Davis. Today, all she ever wanted—after her last SMS to Davis—was a reply from her husband to say anything that gives a clear sign for Catherine that Davis is still truly cares for her and Mike.\n\nWell, she feels like she deserves it, at least after living patiently alone for four and half years, although she married Davis nine years ago. Each year she only spends six months with her husband. And most of all on this late evening, she misses him so much and needs something that can cheer her mood.\n\nWhile she keeps staring at her mobile phone, suddenly Mike says to Catherine, \"Mommy, why is there a cloud outside?\"\n\nCatherine: \"What cloud? Where?\"\n\nMike: \"There.\" he points out to the balcony that is facing the city.\n\nThe balcony has a panoramic view of the city. This was one of the reasons Catherine chose the apartment. She likes to sit at night thinking about her life and wonder will she be able to see her husband again? Safe and still in one piece.\n\nCatherine often listens to romantic Mexican music and watches the beautiful night lights of the beautiful city of Albuquerque. She hopes it can ease the pain inside her heart from missing her husband.\n\nCatherine is still sitting on the living room sofa when Mike says about the cloud. So, she cannot see what’s happening outside her apartment. The balcony door is near the dining table opposite the kitchen where mike is playing with his toys. She immediately gets up from the sofa and walks towards the balcony.\n\nAs she reaches the dining table, she takes a glance and sees the city is covered by white smoke. She felt disbelieve but it’s real. As she thinks it could be fire smoke, she says, “O God, is it forest fire?” Fear suddenly struck her mind and she breathes faster than usual though tries to calm herself down. She opens the balcony and steps out to the balcony.\n\nAs she gets closer and holds the balcony handrail, she looks at the street below. She sees the whole neighborhood is empty. No cars passing by or people walking around as they used to. She ponders, “Where the hell is everybody?”\n\nCatherine looks closer toward her car at the parking lot below and sees one of her neighbors who lives on the ground floor is standing beside her car. Her name is Mrs. Abigail. She is an elderly lady and lives alone with her cat, Beatrice after her husband passed away four years ago. Catherine doesn't know Mrs. Abigail well but since she walks with a four-legged walker and smiles every time they met, Catherine felt sorry for what Mrs. Abigail is going through.\n\nCatherine's apartment is only three floors high and that is why it's easy for her to identify the old lady who has been staring at her car for the last minute but without her walker.\n\nCatherine was surprised to see Mrs. Abigail is standing without her walker and shouts to her neighbor from the balcony, \"Mrs. Abigail! Mrs. Abigail! What are you doing? Where is Rosa? Why are you standing without your walker? Mrs. Abigail! Do you know why the city is covered with white smoke? Mrs. Abigail! … Mrs. Abigail!”\n\nDespite she shouted to Mrs. Abigail from the balcony, Mrs. Abigail just keeps standing in front of Catherine's car without the walker and she did not respond to what Catherine is saying.\n\nShe feels something strange is happening, but suddenly, she hears her apartment door was opened. She quickly rushes back into her apartment and saw her main apartment door was opened. She looks at the dining table and Mike was gone! She spontaneously says, \"O GOD, NO!\"\n\nShe panics and runs chasing Mike to the stairs. As she rushes on the stairs to the ground floor, she yells, “Mikey! Come back here! Stop! Mikey!\"\n\nWhile running on the stairs, she wonders, how a six-year-old boy runs these stairs so fast that she couldn’t catch up on him. Catherine finally reaches the ground floor and she continues running to the main building entrance that is facing the main street. The main door is partly glass. So the main street is visible.\n\nShe can see Mrs. Abigail is still standing facing her car, and several meters away behind Mrs. Abigail, Mike is walking towards Mrs. Abigail.\n\nCatherine feels relief for a moment, but now she sees something frightening and almost impossible. The neighbor she knew can barely stand on her two feet moreover to walk because she’ll need a walker to do it. At that time, she vividly sees part of Mrs. Abigail's clothes has reddish stains, which from where Catherine sees it, it's looks like fresh blood.\n\nIn that frightening moment, Catherine suddenly feels as if everything moves in slow motion.\n\nShe sees Mrs. Abigail's apartment door is opened and more bloodstains are seen on the floor and wall near the apartment’s door. She found Beatrice's dead body. Mrs. Abigail's cat was lying dead in a pool of blood not far from the door. Beatrice's neck was cold-bloodedly ripped off.\n\nSeeing what she saw, Catherine runs to the door to grab Mike as fast as she could, but somehow her legs are not responding to her will, and by the time she reaches the main building door, Mike is already too close to Mrs. Abigail. She yells so loud trying to stop Mike from getting closer to Mrs. Abigail, \"Mikey Stop! Mikey!\"\n\nCatherine tries to run faster but somehow, she couldn't.\n\nShe shouts repeatedly, and yet innocent Mike just keeps walking towards Mrs. Abigail.\n\nAs Mike stands behind Mrs. Abigail, she suddenly turns around and at that moment, Catherine sees the most frightening face she ever sees in her entire life!\n\n![(Illustration 08)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D6-QdXYsRo7SuuNgLa5_1.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nStill struck by the fear of what she sees, Mrs. Abigail suddenly moves to hold Mike.\n\nCatherine knew Mike made a mistake as he probably thought that the old lady standing by her car is the nice and warm-hearted Mrs. Abigail, their neighbor.\n\nAs Mrs. Abigail grabs Mike's jacket. Catherine cries and her mind flees at that frightening moment and shouts her husband’s name, Davis, who always lives far away from home, leaving her and Mike alone.\n\nCathrine screams: “Davis, help me! Davis! … Mikey!\n\nThough scares as hell, Catherine pulls herself together and gives all her strength and courage to save her one and only son, Mike.\n\nAs Catherine gets closer, she sees the frightening face of Mrs. Abigail who already looks like a dead person. Her eyes are yellowish red and her mouth is dripping thick colored blood which Catherine thought is Beatrice who was known in the neighborhood as the fat cat.\n\nKnowing he makes a mistake, Mike is terrified as he sees Mrs. Abigail's face and he turns to rush back into the apartment building. As Mike turns swiftly, the monster or someone who looks like Mrs. Abigail grabs his shoulder with her right hand. Mike struggles to fight back because both his hand is loosened and he yells, \"Mommy help! Help me! Mommy!\n\nWith both hands, Catherine quickly grabs both of Mike's arms as she tries to pull her son with all her strength to safety. She cries and yells, \"Let him go you old hag! Let Mikey go!”\n\nCatherine keeps screaming and she can hear Mike was screaming desperately to be saved from Mrs. Abigail.\n\n\"Mommy! Wake up! Mommy! Wake up!\"\n\nSlowly ... Catherine hears Mike’s screams become louder and she suddenly awakes from her sleep and sees Mike standing in front of him inside the living room apartment crying while calling her name.\n\n\"Mommy! Mommy! Please, wake up! You scare me. Why do you keep calling Daddy and me?\" Asks Mike.\n\n## CHAPTER SIX\n\n### Certain plans in an uncertain time\n\n![(Illustration 09)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_BbKwUBrjtYmpWBmC2vyR.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***The year is 2025.

Bravo-One, Out.\"\n\nThe bravo-One team consists of four highly trained spec ops. They know the vicinity and the surroundings of the Gila National Forest well since they have been guarding the base before Z-Day. They used to disguise themselves as forest rangers to scare hikers away who come in too close to the secret military base, then they told them to return because they’ve entered wolves or bear hunting ground and not safe to proceed.\n\nDespite the Bravo-One team have the knowledge and experience of the Gila forest, but before Z-Day, most people have reported strange-looking Oak Trees appeared in many areas and some grew overnight.\n\nAs Blackbird-509 is preparing to land in a nearby open field on the edge of the Second-Ring of the misty forest, the Bravo-One team is checking their weapons and communication unit inside the Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk for the last time. The helo that carries the Bravo-One team is like a tank and will provide air support for the ground team. The Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk has two external wings that can support four weapons on each side, like the 50-cal (12.7mm) gun, Hydra 70 rocket pods, and Hellfire missiles. There is also a 7.62mm minigun mounted on the side of the cockpit and controlled remotely using the pilot visor’s helmet.\n\n***17:02. Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist***\n\nOfficer Davis still can’t trust what he sees. He needs to be perfectly sure that whatever he sees is real and not his imagination. He keeps looking through his sniper scope and waits until the object becomes closer and clearer.\n\nPerhaps it's fate or mere coincidence on that late afternoon because a heavy storm is also gathering above some parts of the surrounding misty forest in Gila. The wind is building speed fast and followed by dark clouds thickening by the minute. The stormy weather makes the misty forest even darker at sunset. As a spec op, Davis knew well that stormy weather is his advantage over the enemy but at the same time, it can also become his biggest obstacle.\n\nThe high-speed wind scatters the mist and makes Officer Davis finally has the visual ability to see and confirmed the wobbling red dot with certainty. Then he uses the sniper scope again to zoom to what is behind the red object, and what he sees has brought fear down to Davis’s spine!\n\nOnce Davis knew what he is about to face, he takes a deep breath and sighs. He knows he is facing the impossible, but then his mind tries to make a quick plan but today, time is not on his side!\n\n**(To be continued)**", "timestamp": 1634019823, "digest": "cvfeCUhakb4FFnb4geW3ZmzfZ5S1ZRRBTERR0r1xWQQ", "contributor": "0xc1C41e3606bF2756c09c95132F528012be17f724"}

Over.\"\n\nNo response was heard.\n\nSeveral minutes later, the Combat-Net Radio (CNR) suddenly gets a response but the person on the other end is whispering.\n\n“Batman-six, this is Batman-five, I am on the ground. Over.”\n\n“Batman-five, this is Batman-six, you have been out in the mist for two days. Break.

Over.\"\n\n\"Batman-five, Batman-five, this is Batman-six, respond! Over.\"\n\nNothing. No response was heard, only silence …\n\n## CHAPTER TWO\n\n### Some hell looks cold and damp\n\n![(Illustration 02)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TQf1rF1F2YqmKVZbuUdCc.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***15:15. Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist in the Gila forest***\n\nBatman-five looks at his military wristwatch to see the timer which he sets earlier just before he came down from the treehouse, and it’s showing 2 hours 11 minutes. It has been quite a while since Officer Davis starts trekking inside the misty forest of the First-Ring.\n\nThough he seemed to made a clumsy decision, but he has calculated the potential risks even before going down from the treehouse that the HQ approved to build and used for recon purposes. The wooden treehouse was named Outpost-One and it’s located on the outskirt of the First-Ring of the misty forest which is known to have the densest mist and the gloomiest compared to the Second or the Third-Ring.\n\nBelieve it or not, it was officer Davis's idea to set up the recon post besides being the only soldier who volunteers for this insane field duty; However, Officer Davis is not an ordinary soldier. Back before Z-Day—which most human survivors have named it these days; he was a decorated and committed Special Operation Forces (SOF) for the US Military Special Unit Division. He served in countless military covert operations overseas, ranging from the Middle East, North Africa, and some parts of Asia; but whatever he did before Z-Day is another story.\n\nRight after the deadly outbreak, Officer Davis is counted as an asset for the US military—or to be exact, what’s left of the US military corps; and well-respected for his bravery and loyalty in the line of fire to always defend his unit.\n\nFor two long hours—which he felt like a lifetime inside the First-Ring of the mist—Davis has been walking in real slow motions. He consciously controls his breathing by inhaling and exhaling from his nose and mouth to conserve energy in his muscles while consistently measure every step he took for that long tiring shadowy ninjalike walk.\n\nHiding under his ghillie suit, he sometimes chooses to walk or crawl from one place to another in a strictly discreet manner. At every certain distance, he lowers his body to rest on the ground while his camouflage suit blends him almost perfectly with the surrounding bushes. Ordinary watchful eye could never detect or expect anything.\n\nHe couldn’t walk faster or run to the source of the gunshots that he heard because there is a well-known myth not long after this catastrophe began, which is: don’t ever run inside the First-Ring of the mist. Most stories told from human survivors were, whoever runs inside the First-Ring of the mist will not survive. Therefore, believing there can be human survivors left inside the First-Ring of the mist is just too good to be true.\n\n***16:00.***\n\nAs Officer Davis keeps moving for nearly three hours, he starts to realize that his body is demanding water and sugar. Davis's mind and emotions have begun to wander wildly in the last ten minutes, but he tries to stay focus. Minutes later, he finally decided to stop and rest longer behind a large tree which makes him almost invisible by the naked eye.\n\nConnected to the earpiece he wears, Davis turns his CNR back on and a while later, he hears a radio call coming in, \"Batman-five, Batman-five, this is Batman-six, do you copy? Over.\"\n\nLike before, Officer Davis respond by whispering,\n\n\"Batman-six, this is Batman-five, I am half click from the source and conducting recon on the perimeter. Requesting radio silence, over.\"\n\n\"Damn you, Davis! This conversation is not over yet. Batman-six, out.\"\n\nHearing the response from Batman-six back in the HQ, Officer Davis smiles and turns off his radio.\n\nFor an ordinary person, or perhaps most soldiers, a battlefield is a crazy place to hang out, but for Davis, is just another day on the stomping ground. Little does the HQ know that ever since Davis spend his days for these past few weeks in Outpost-One, the reality is, he rarely stays in the treehouse in the daytime. He always stays inside the treehouse after sunset but during the day, Davis is busy exploring and scouting the surrounding area. What Davis has done alone in these past few weeks at Outpost-One is considered insane by many survivors, but he probably did it because he was driven by his survival instinctive behavior and becomes territorial over his domain. Or, the survivors were right, he might just be an adrenaline junky and felt challenged to do it considering he is a well-trained military man.\n\nSome of Davis’s colleagues in HQ think he is overwhelmed, desperate, and hopeless about the global situation. They believe Davis has made a death wish after he was assigned voluntarily for the field duty on Outpost-One alone. But some colleagues from his unit see it differently. They think Davis is not a desperate and hopeless type of person, yet instead, he simply doesn't want to give up believing that after one-third of the earth's surface is covered by the mist and roamed by the undead, all of it is empty of survivors. They see Officer Davis as a man who believes that the only way to avoid fire is not to run away from it but rather, jump into it.\n\nDuring most of the day, Davis sets up \"invisible fences\" by planting boobytraps or other decoy materials to lure the undead away from entering the Outpost-One perimeter. Anyway, although he never journeys as far as he did today, nevertheless, only time can reveal Davis's true motive as to why he went through all this trouble in the first place?\n\nOfficer Davis use his short resting time to drink and took a bite of his military-grade food supplement. Several minutes later, suddenly, “...Bang! ... Bang! ... Bang! Ratatat! … Ratatat!”\n\nA new round of gunshots was heard and it was close to Davis's proximity. This time Davis did not overhear it once or twice but several times of loud gunshots then followed by a semi-automatic rifle. In an instant, Davis knew what type of semi-automatic rifle was fired; he knew it was not a military-grade weapon but a nonmilitary one.\n\nFor a second, Davis was caught in a moment of disbelieve but he is not an overreactive person, his mind works like lightning, calculating the possible risk, angle, and approximate distance of the gunshot's location, then he begins to move with caution.\n\nDavis knows that he is so close to the source of the gunshots sound and it can be someone or something or it might even be nothing at all because when he heard it the first time, he knew it can just be a gun belonging to a dead survivor triggered accidentally by an undead, yet he feels so in need to follow his hunches today and kill his curiosity.\n\nDavis slowly crawls to the source. Part of him wishes that he can just run and arrive sooner to see what happen, but then he immediately remembers the myth of the First-Ring; and today, somehow, Davis doesn’t want to be the first one to prove if the myth is either true or false.\n\n## CHAPTER THREE\n\n### Ghostrider\n\n![AC-130J Ghostrider gunship (Illustration 03)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lyXOE5Z7E5CPIVUbWe4iy.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***The Gila Forest National Park, New Mexico***\n\nSince the late '80s, a secluded airfield located in a not well-known location inside the Gila Forest National Park was used by the US Forest Service to prevent forest fire. After 9/11, the airfield was secretly handed over to the US Military. Later, the airfield was converted to an airstrip and used as a secret military base for the US Special Forces. Ever since it was used by the US Forest Service, the locals never see the airfield because it was located deep inside the Gila National Forest. \n\nFor more than two decades, people from the surrounding towns knew that the airfield is regularly used once or twice a year as a training ground for forest firefighters and areal firefighter planes to prevent bushfires in Gila National forest. After it was taken by the US Special Forces, many planes that look like the US Forest Service are often seen near the vicinity. Besides the military servicemen that work on the airstrip, the common folks who live near the surrounding towns never know anything about it. The so-called US Forest Service airfield that they once knew since the '80s has become one of the most sophisticated secret military bases for the US Special Forces. At night, two AC-130J Ghostrider which are known as the deadliest gunship planes take off and land without ever being noticed. Most military servicemen or field agents who work inside the base live like regular people, and some do daily jobs in the nearby towns.\n\n***16:20. The year is 2025, New Mexico. Somewhere inside the Gila forest.***\n\nBatman-six walks to the Air Commando’s Office. He knocks on the door, and seconds later a male voice was heard from inside the room, \"Come in.\"  \n\nOfficer Spencer enters and gives his military salute to the high-ranking officer inside the room and says, \"Colonel, Permission to report, Sir.” \n\n“State your report, Spencer,” says the Colonel after he glances at Spencer and continues drawing lines on a map. Before Officer Spencer entered the room, Colonel Monk was busy marking and drawing lines on a military map hanging on the wall that covers almost one side of his office wall.\n\nOfficer Spencer: “Sir, Officer Davis left Outpost-One and he is walking by himself inside the First-Ring of the misty forest. He reported earlier that he might overhear several gunshots and explosions at around noontime from Outpost-One. Now he is investigating the source for the last 2,5 hours and requested radio silence.\" \n\nColonel: \"(Sigh)…He never changes. So, where is he now and what is his status?\" \n\n\"Around 20 minutes ago, Officer Davis reported that he is already 500 meters away from the source. He insists to conduct recon in the surrounding vicinity. Colonel, it is almost sunset, he will never make it alone. Sir, requesting duty, Sir!\" replies Officer Spencer.\n\nColonel: \"Dispatch Blackbird-509 and Bravo-One Team to Outpost-One. Tell them to secure the perimeter and wait for my orders. I will be in Eagle-One. We leave in 20.\" \n\nOfficer Spencer: \"Yes, Sir! Right away, Sir!\" \n\n***16:40, Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist.***\n\nOfficer Davis has entered uncharted territory. He knows that he never wanders this far before, not at morning, noon, less close to sunset like this late evening. Thirty minutes is the maximum time frame before the night and the dark misty forest turn into Davis's worse nightmare. Well, except he can quickly find a secure hiding place like an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), a hidden treehouse, or a sound escape plan, then even spec ops with skills as Davis will not likely make it. The chance is thin considering two out of the three options are not available. So, time is critical and Davis aware of his weak spot.\n\nTo be clear, the densest mist mainly appears after sunset and is known by survivors including Davis as the sanctuary of the undead, which is why the First-Ring of the mist is undoubtedly the monsters’ lair. Each day, the mist from the First-Ring which has sporadically cover forty percent of the earth's surface in the world's major continents has been continuously expanding. What matters is not only about the mist’s expansion but if a person is trapped inside the First-Ring of the mist for one night, then his effort to escape from the mist the next day becomes greater and farther. Therefore, whoever decided to remain indoors when the deadly outbreak event took place some eight months ago, which is also the first time for the mist to appear, then he is either safe and sound without needing to go out at all, or he is good as an undead.\n\nWith little time to spare, Davis maps the surrounding area with his mind as fast and accurately as he possibly could, and for whatever happens then, he needs to be certain not to lose his way back to Outpost-One. Davis is 400 meters away from the source of the gunshots, but the thick mist still makes it difficult for him to get a clear visual of the location. He needs to go further ahead.\n\n***16:55.***\n\nWhile lying face down on the ground, Davis moves his elbow and feet pushing his body forward one step at a time. This time he moves even slower. It took him almost fifteen minutes just to reached 100 meters from where he was before until he finally arrived at a nearby open field. Kill zones to be precise. Davis knew he has reached the safe limit; further movement can expose him to threat and uncertainty.\n\nIn the battleground, better safe than sorry is never an option. Knowing the risk Davis might face the undead, he has no plan to add hostile enemies to his adversary list. A spec op like Davis has figured out that a gunshot sound that happened inside the sanctuary of the undead is always a bad combination. He decides to stay hidden and use his spot to observe the approximate gunshot location using his MRAD sniper scope. Gently, he positions his sniper rifle while listening to every noise happening nearby. For Davis, sitting alone day in and day out inside a misty forest is not his first time, but sitting alone in the misty forest full of undead walking around after sunset, now that is his first time.\n\n![(Illustration 04)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Dy0N98IHCc4n4OocTcuRn.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nAfter adjusting his sniper’s position, Davis starts to see a small-looking red dot wobbling from afar. It also becomes apparent to him that the red dot is moving in his direction. He shakes his head twice to make sure his mind is not playing with his eyes but is neither his head nor his eyes. He sees something out there alright. Davis measures the distance of the red object which is around 200 meters away; but as the night invites the sun to sets at the edge of the horizon, the mist also thickens inside the misty forest. Davis still couldn’t confirm what he sees with his naked eye. He opens the sniper scope and begins to zoom in onto the small red dot. Once he saw it, Davis’s heart was shocked. He mumbles, \"It’s impossible!”\n\n## CHAPTER FOUR\n\n### The briefing room\n\n![Dubai, UAE (Illustration 05)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4o4i4rwijnz4llzHe-FRA.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***01:00, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 24 days before Christmas, 2024.***\n\nTwo AC-130J Ghostrider belonging to the US Special Forces landed safely on the US-UAE join operation military air force base near Dubai. They have just completed one of their two secret missions at an undisclosed area somewhere inside the Middle East. The two birds are refilling their ammunition and fuel while the crew has been given spare time to rest inside the military compound before doing their next and last assignment this year.\n\n![AC-130J Ghostrider (Illustration 06)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PgZz-pp0PXErf1FtCfHg_.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nOfficer Davis is drinking a cold beer inside the military cafeteria. He needs a break from his military duty, at least it’s what he felt in his heart. Although he has not returned home in the past six months, his face looks glad because once he completed his last assignment, the miserable days of missing his family will soon be over.\n\nEver since Officer Davis was assigned to conduct several classified and covert military operations overseas six months ago; well actually, he was stationed by the US military high command in Washington to remain at a secret military base located inside The Gila Forest National Park, New Mexico. It is not far from the New Mexico state capital, Albuquerque, where his family are making their daily lives.\n\nEach month in the past six months, Davis spent seven days in Washington DC, where he reported the status of his last assignment and was then assigned to a new one before heading back to the Gila Military Base in New Mexico. Davis's missions are classified as covert operations; therefore, he never tells Catherine of his whereabouts for safety reasons and his loyalty to the corps.\n\nCurrently, he is on a video call with his wife and six years old son, Catherine and Mike.\n\nMike: \"Daddy, will you be home on Christmas Eve?\"\n\nDavis: \"Sure Mike, I’ll not miss it for the world. I miss you son.\" \n\nMike: \"Last year you also promised but you were not home on Christmas and New Year?\" \n\nDavis: \"I am so sorry Mike, daddy was busy last year. Look, I tell you what, Daddy promise will be home before Christmas and I got a surprise for you and Mommy.\" \n\nMike: \"Mommy, Daddy said he got a surprise for me and you. Daddy, when will you return home?\" \n\n\"Davis! Briefing room, ASAP!\", Officer Monk shows up and interrupts Davis's conversation with his 6 years old son. \n\nDavis: \"Mike, Daddy got to go. Be good and help Mommy, you hear me kid?\" \n\nMike: \"Okey, Daddy.\" Though he is not pleased with his father's decision to end the video call too soon.\n\nSuddenly, Davis's wife takes over the iPhone from her son.\n\nCatherine: “Sweatheart, can Mommy talk to Daddy? Mommy needs to tell Daddy about something,” then she switches the call to private mode as she walks to the kitchen.\n\nCatherine: \"Again Davis? It’s not even five minutes yet?\" \n\nDavis: \"Look, Honey, I'll be home on the fifth, but don't tell Mike about it, I want to surprise him. I love you both. Honey, I am sorry. I got to go.\" \n\nCatherine is fed up with Davis's excuses and she hung up the call without saying anything.\n\nFor a moment Davis was having a mixed feeling between disappointment with himself and the need to be patient at the same time. He closes his eyes, then after a while, he sighs.\n\nDavis switches his mobile phone off and walks to the briefing room. Inside the military base, all personal mobile phones must remain switched off except inside the cafeteria.\n\n***December 2024, Albuquerque, New Mexico. Catherine’s residence.***\n\nSomewhere in a rented apartment in downtown Albuquerque, Catherine has just recently switched off her call with her husband. Catherine holds herself not to cry but she sometimes found herself having no clue whether she loves her husband so much or just hates him too much because he is rarely available at home with her. \n\nShe opens the fridge to get a glass of milk for Mike while she mumbles, “Just be patient Catherine. It’s not the first time he did it, and it’ll certainly not his last.”\n\nShe puts the glass of milk beside Mike while he is busy playing with his toys on the dining table. Some minutes later, she opens her mobile phone and writes a short message (SMS) to Davis. \n\nCatherine writes: \"Davis, I am so sorry. I just missed you so much. Promise me to be safe and see you soon. Charlie-Mama-Lima-Delta ...\" \n\nShe always adds “Charlie-Mama-Lima-Delta” on her SMS to Davis at the end which means Catherine-Mike-Love-Davis, although Davis never does the same.\n\n***17:00, August 2025. Somewhere in the outskirt of Gila National Forest Park.***\n\nInside the First-Ring of the misty forest, Davis is looking closely using his MRAD sniper scope. He still could not believe what he sees and whispers repeatedly to himself, \"No, No, ... This can't be true!\"\n\n## CHAPTER FIVE\n\n### Love your neighbor like yourself\n\n![(Illustration 07)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BEM9WoTI_A5qVrRO8823h.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***Albuquerque, New Mexico. Early December 2024***\n\nCatherine has been sitting for half an hour in the living room apartment. She picks her mobile phone several times and hopes there is a Short Message or call from Davis. Today, all she ever wanted—after her last SMS to Davis—was a reply from her husband to say anything that gives a clear sign for Catherine that Davis is still truly cares for her and Mike.\n\nWell, she feels like she deserves it, at least after living patiently alone for four and half years, although she married Davis nine years ago. Each year she only spends six months with her husband. And most of all on this late evening, she misses him so much and needs something that can cheer her mood.\n\nWhile she keeps staring at her mobile phone, suddenly Mike says to Catherine, \"Mommy, why is there a cloud outside?\"\n\nCatherine: \"What cloud? Where?\"\n\nMike: \"There.\" he points out to the balcony that is facing the city.\n\nThe balcony has a panoramic view of the city. This was one of the reasons Catherine chose the apartment. She likes to sit at night thinking about her life and wonder will she be able to see her husband again? Safe and still in one piece.\n\nCatherine often listens to romantic Mexican music and watches the beautiful night lights of the beautiful city of Albuquerque. She hopes it can ease the pain inside her heart from missing her husband.\n\nCatherine is still sitting on the living room sofa when Mike says about the cloud. So, she cannot see what’s happening outside her apartment. The balcony door is near the dining table opposite the kitchen where mike is playing with his toys. She immediately gets up from the sofa and walks towards the balcony.\n\nAs she reaches the dining table, she takes a glance and sees the city is covered by white smoke. She felt disbelieve but it’s real. As she thinks it could be fire smoke, she says, “O God, is it forest fire?” Fear suddenly struck her mind and she breathes faster than usual though tries to calm herself down. She opens the balcony and steps out to the balcony.\n\nAs she gets closer and holds the balcony handrail, she looks at the street below. She sees the whole neighborhood is empty. No cars passing by or people walking around as they used to. She ponders, “Where the hell is everybody?”\n\nCatherine looks closer toward her car at the parking lot below and sees one of her neighbors who lives on the ground floor is standing beside her car. Her name is Mrs. Abigail. She is an elderly lady and lives alone with her cat, Beatrice after her husband passed away four years ago. Catherine doesn't know Mrs. Abigail well but since she walks with a four-legged walker and smiles every time they met, Catherine felt sorry for what Mrs. Abigail is going through.\n\nCatherine's apartment is only three floors high and that is why it's easy for her to identify the old lady who has been staring at her car for the last minute but without her walker.\n\nCatherine was surprised to see Mrs. Abigail is standing without her walker and shouts to her neighbor from the balcony, \"Mrs. Abigail! Mrs. Abigail! What are you doing? Where is Rosa? Why are you standing without your walker? Mrs. Abigail! Do you know why the city is covered with white smoke? Mrs. Abigail! … Mrs. Abigail!”\n\nDespite she shouted to Mrs. Abigail from the balcony, Mrs. Abigail just keeps standing in front of Catherine's car without the walker and she did not respond to what Catherine is saying.\n\nShe feels something strange is happening, but suddenly, she hears her apartment door was opened. She quickly rushes back into her apartment and saw her main apartment door was opened. She looks at the dining table and Mike was gone! She spontaneously says, \"O GOD, NO!\"\n\nShe panics and runs chasing Mike to the stairs. As she rushes on the stairs to the ground floor, she yells, “Mikey! Come back here! Stop! Mikey!\"\n\nWhile running on the stairs, she wonders, how a six-year-old boy runs these stairs so fast that she couldn’t catch up on him. Catherine finally reaches the ground floor and she continues running to the main building entrance that is facing the main street. The main door is partly glass. So the main street is visible.\n\nShe can see Mrs. Abigail is still standing facing her car, and several meters away behind Mrs. Abigail, Mike is walking towards Mrs. Abigail.\n\nCatherine feels relief for a moment, but now she sees something frightening and almost impossible. The neighbor she knew can barely stand on her two feet moreover to walk because she’ll need a walker to do it. At that time, she vividly sees part of Mrs. Abigail's clothes has reddish stains, which from where Catherine sees it, it's looks like fresh blood.\n\nIn that frightening moment, Catherine suddenly feels as if everything moves in slow motion.\n\nShe sees Mrs. Abigail's apartment door is opened and more bloodstains are seen on the floor and wall near the apartment’s door. She found Beatrice's dead body. Mrs. Abigail's cat was lying dead in a pool of blood not far from the door. Beatrice's neck was cold-bloodedly ripped off.\n\nSeeing what she saw, Catherine runs to the door to grab Mike as fast as she could, but somehow her legs are not responding to her will, and by the time she reaches the main building door, Mike is already too close to Mrs. Abigail. She yells so loud trying to stop Mike from getting closer to Mrs. Abigail, \"Mikey Stop! Mikey!\"\n\nCatherine tries to run faster but somehow, she couldn't.\n\nShe shouts repeatedly, and yet innocent Mike just keeps walking towards Mrs. Abigail.\n\nAs Mike stands behind Mrs. Abigail, she suddenly turns around and at that moment, Catherine sees the most frightening face she ever sees in her entire life!\n\n![(Illustration 08)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D6-QdXYsRo7SuuNgLa5_1.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\nStill struck by the fear of what she sees, Mrs. Abigail suddenly moves to hold Mike.\n\nCatherine knew Mike made a mistake as he probably thought that the old lady standing by her car is the nice and warm-hearted Mrs. Abigail, their neighbor.\n\nAs Mrs. Abigail grabs Mike's jacket. Catherine cries and her mind flees at that frightening moment and shouts her husband’s name, Davis, who always lives far away from home, leaving her and Mike alone.\n\nCathrine screams: “Davis, help me! Davis! … Mikey!\n\nThough scares as hell, Catherine pulls herself together and gives all her strength and courage to save her one and only son, Mike.\n\nAs Catherine gets closer, she sees the frightening face of Mrs. Abigail who already looks like a dead person. Her eyes are yellowish red and her mouth is dripping thick colored blood which Catherine thought is Beatrice who was known in the neighborhood as the fat cat.\n\nKnowing he makes a mistake, Mike is terrified as he sees Mrs. Abigail's face and he turns to rush back into the apartment building. As Mike turns swiftly, the monster or someone who looks like Mrs. Abigail grabs his shoulder with her right hand. Mike struggles to fight back because both his hand is loosened and he yells, \"Mommy help! Help me! Mommy!\n\nWith both hands, Catherine quickly grabs both of Mike's arms as she tries to pull her son with all her strength to safety. She cries and yells, \"Let him go you old hag! Let Mikey go!”\n\nCatherine keeps screaming and she can hear Mike was screaming desperately to be saved from Mrs. Abigail.\n\n\"Mommy! Wake up! Mommy! Wake up!\"\n\nSlowly ... Catherine hears Mike’s screams become louder and she suddenly awakes from her sleep and sees Mike standing in front of him inside the living room apartment crying while calling her name.\n\n\"Mommy! Mommy! Please, wake up! You scare me. Why do you keep calling Daddy and me?\" Asks Mike.\n\n## CHAPTER SIX\n\n### Certain plans in an uncertain time\n\n![(Illustration 09)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_BbKwUBrjtYmpWBmC2vyR.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n***The year is 2025. A helo flying on route 180 heading North near Whispering Pines, New Mexico.***\n\nBravo-One: \"Eagle-One, come in Eagle-One, this is Bravo-One. Bravo-One Oscar-Mike and five clicks from Outpost-One. Over.\"\n\nEagle-One: \"Eagle-One to Bravo-One. Roger-Tango, Lima-Charlie. Break. Bravo-One, be advised the ground is FUBAR after sunset. Advance with caution. Over.\"\n\nBravo-One: \"Roger that. Bravo-One, Out.\"\n\nThe bravo-One team consists of four highly trained spec ops. They know the vicinity and the surroundings of the Gila National Forest well since they have been guarding the base before Z-Day. They used to disguise themselves as forest rangers to scare hikers away who come in too close to the secret military base, then they told them to return because they’ve entered wolves or bear hunting ground and not safe to proceed.\n\nDespite the Bravo-One team have the knowledge and experience of the Gila forest, but before Z-Day, most people have reported strange-looking Oak Trees appeared in many areas and some grew overnight.\n\nAs Blackbird-509 is preparing to land in a nearby open field on the edge of the Second-Ring of the misty forest, the Bravo-One team is checking their weapons and communication unit inside the Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk for the last time. The helo that carries the Bravo-One team is like a tank and will provide air support for the ground team. The Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk has two external wings that can support four weapons on each side, like the 50-cal (12.7mm) gun, Hydra 70 rocket pods, and Hellfire missiles. There is also a 7.62mm minigun mounted on the side of the cockpit and controlled remotely using the pilot visor’s helmet.\n\n***17:02. Somewhere inside the First-Ring of the mist***\n\nOfficer Davis still can’t trust what he sees. He needs to be perfectly sure that whatever he sees is real and not his imagination. He keeps looking through his sniper scope and waits until the object becomes closer and clearer.\n\nPerhaps it's fate or mere coincidence on that late afternoon because a heavy storm is also gathering above some parts of the surrounding misty forest in Gila. The wind is building speed fast and followed by dark clouds thickening by the minute. The stormy weather makes the misty forest even darker at sunset. As a spec op, Davis knew well that stormy weather is his advantage over the enemy but at the same time, it can also become his biggest obstacle.\n\nThe high-speed wind scatters the mist and makes Officer Davis finally has the visual ability to see and confirmed the wobbling red dot with certainty. Then he uses the sniper scope again to zoom to what is behind the red object, and what he sees has brought fear down to Davis’s spine!\n\nOnce Davis knew what he is about to face, he takes a deep breath and sighs. He knows he is facing the impossible, but then his mind tries to make a quick plan but today, time is not on his side!\n\n**(To be continued)**", "timestamp": 1634020497, "digest": "cvfeCUhakb4FFnb4geW3ZmzfZ5S1ZRRBTERR0r1xWQQ", "contributor": "0xc1C41e3606bF2756c09c95132F528012be17f724"}

If your holding 10ktf and haven't verified yet, please do that and join us in the chat. The following has been derived from our community chat in ✨︱grailed︱検証済み and has not been confirmed by 10ktf at this time.\n\nI went through the daily chat and summarized the following information. Not complete or total in any way so feel free to add or suggest edits. Thanks Frens!\n\n10/10 Floor Tracker : 10KTF- .169 at 10AM PST- .15 at 12:00AM PST 10KTF Stockroom - .029 at 10AM PST - .023 at 12:00AM PST\n\nThis is a Mega-Game - clues, mystery, plot. The team has storytellers and they are listening and crafting the story, challenges and narrative as we go. Community here is most important step in the game (so far). We think games could be added and physical bags (LV?) and shoes (Nike?).\n\nGame Status: We're in level 1 headed to level 2 of 6 levels. Figge has mentioned weekly value being added. We should hold for Wagmi until then. If you can afford genesis items from shop (shoes & bags), might be advantageous but any items will probably be helpful. \n\nLV, Possible, & Games - Figge runs Possible (a digital marketing and services agency) - Possible has a game out with LV “LOUIS THE GAME” irl right now with LV - LV also holds a partnership with Wenew. LV NFT “moments” created in “LOUIS THE GAME” by Wenew and set for release in January 2022. We know there’s also a RIOT games partnership and that unreal engine helped design the LV game. One NFT called “LV x Beeple 2219 Collaboration - Postcard 52.\n\nHideaki confirmed today that he has ordered Sake for Thursday. Mint started at 3pm last Thursday. Plan on another Party - It's also Beeples 1 year anniversary of discovering NFT's. Get your dancing shoes out and be prepared to shake your ass y'all!\n\nGroup talked about sandbox and gaming application/future but might be something we should keep an eye on. Someone also mentioned checking out a spot in the Metaverse/decentraland. Speculation we should check 341112 in metaverse. Possibly a New Tokyo? KentCrypt said he would check. Any love ser? Should keep this in mind as far as building out game however.\n\nSpeculation that Meta is the end grail for the project and that LV game mechanics & metaverse or some combination of could allow us to meet and craft materials in real time in the game/metaverse.\n\nBrands - Vans Senior Director of Marketing liked a previous wagmi-post (have seen BAYC vans. dope.) Also, Ken Zakalik - Head of Product, Valiant Labs at NIke liked Lindsay E's (VP of partnerships at Wenew) MAYC HT post. ABOUT NIKE VALIANT LABS Nike Valiant Labs builds off the entrepreneurial legacy of Nike founder, Phil Knight, and the 1964 Plymouth Valiant he used as his first makeshift Nike store. As Nike’s new business incubator, we’re rooted in a similar approach, moving with speed and purpose, taking calculated risks and failing fast – all with one goal in mind: serving consumers in new and unimagined ways.\n\nHot links 10/10 -\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/cassellferere/2021/05/24/grailed-is-stepping-up-and-into-the-sneaker-game-with-versace-sneaker-designer-salehe-bembury/?sh=2e1324146a65](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cassellferere/2021/05/24/grailed-is-stepping-up-and-into-the-sneaker-game-with-versace-sneaker-designer-salehe-bembury/?sh=2e1324146a65)\n\n[https://footwearnews.com/2021/business/retail/nike-nft-digtal-sneakers-resale-1203130757/](https://footwearnews.com/2021/business/retail/nike-nft-digtal-sneakers-resale-1203130757/)\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1634021961, "digest": "QVIR8z5M3MS4mD29TpRoLyOYjlCZYpya90BysrT9t38", "contributor": "0x02ea16F0963FaAA66D9097AA066f69d5Cf07C521"}

世上只有一种英雄主义，就是发现了生活的真相，依然热爱它。——罗曼·罗兰\n\n前不久我们做了一次社区调研，\n\n朋友们提到最多的建议就是：\n\n授人以鱼，不如授人以渔。\n\n很多朋友都想自己掌握发现好项目的途径。\n\n恰逢最近整体环境的变化，\n\n也许授人以渔还会具有特殊的意义。\n\n因此我们决定做本期内容，\n\n与社区的朋友们分享和交流。\n\n我们将分享一些基础和常用的找项目的方式，\n\n希望对大家有所帮助。\n\n因篇幅有限，只做一些基础介绍。\n\n当然这也只是一家之言，\n\n如果你还有更多好的方式，欢迎与我们的社区朋友一起交流。\n\n电报群：\n\n[https://t.me/diamondhandsinvest](https://t.me/diamondhandsinvest)\n\nDiscord群：\n\n[https://discord.gg/6tVwE8nP](https://discord.gg/6tVwE8nP)\n\n## 整体思路\n\n> 有道无术，术尚可求也；有术无道，止于术。——《天道》\n\n在解决单个问题之前，\n\n建议最好有一个系统的方法论。\n\n现在的项目层出不穷，\n\n有时候即使你采取守株待兔的策略，\n\n也会有很多项目自己找上门来。\n\n所以你需要的将不只是找项目一件事，\n\n你还需要知道如何快速筛选项目。\n\n而随着关注项目的增多，\n\n将来你还需要建立自己的信息聚合渠道。\n\n用来甄别哪些信息需要细看，\n\n哪些信息只需要快速浏览即可。\n\n因此本次内容将分为三个部分：\n\n* 广泛获取项目\n* 快速筛选项目\n* 持续关注项目\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PlxIP9E0NOMQUMPs37T9r.png?height=986&width=1192)\n\n# 找项目：广泛浏览、信息聚合\n\n### 推特关注\n\n很多人的项目信息来源于推特，\n\n看到某个大V转载、点赞或者follow了哪个项目，\n\n就会开始对这个项目产生兴趣。\n\n但是对于新手而言，\n\n这里的难点在于应该如何开始？\n\n或者不知道应该follow哪些人才正确？\n\n首先，从哪里开始，我们的看法是至少关注三类账号：\n\n* 资方及创始人\n* 公链宣发账号\n* 第三方工具\n\n**1-资方及创始人**\n\n比如Zhu Su、Dragonfly Capital等。作为资方，他们偶尔会为所投项目站台，或者转发所投项目的资讯。\n\n![Zhu Su & Dragonfly Capital转推](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ERuVs446wJsQfs7MAfUq5.png?height=638&width=1786)\n\n如果你发现好的资方或者创始人，\n\n正在转发某个你不知道的项目，\n\n也许你就可以先去了解一下。\n\n哪些是好的资方，我们在后面会谈到。\n\n**2-公链宣发账号**\n\n当你开始关注某个生态的时候，\n\n最有效的获取该生态即时资讯和项目的方式，\n\n就是关注其公链的宣发账号。\n\n如BSC Daily、Solana Daily、AVAX Daily等。\n\n![公链宣发账号](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RpgMzwggomBk9oo8vtRwD.png?height=694&width=2532)\n\n这些账号经常会告诉你，\n\n态上又有什么新的项目，\n\n或者某个项目取得了什么样的突破。\n\n等你关注多了以后，\n\n除了官方宣发账号外，\n\n你还会逐渐发现一些关注这些生态项目的发烧友。\n\n如果你觉得这些发烧友分享的内容还不错，\n\n同时关注一下他们也是不错的。\n\n**3-第三方工具**\n\n除了聚焦资方、聚焦公链生态外，\n\n还有一类账户必须关注，就是第三方机构。\n\n第三方机构更多是通过数据说话和事件说话。\n\n某个项目最近数据表现不错，\n\n或者拿了一笔不错的融资，\n\n这些账号都会进行分享。\n\n典型的有：DappRadar、Dapp.com、1C0 Analytics等。\n\n![DappRadar & Dapp.com & 1C0 Analytics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3Ystm5FQDpChHwoNh7DTk.png?height=676&width=2514)\n\n以上只是基础的一些账号类型，\n\n之后你还可以关注一些交易所账号、个人大V，\n\n或者关注项目官方及创始人账号等等，\n\n便于你了解更多项目上架信息或一些个人的观点。\n\n在解决从哪里开始之后，下一步还需要扩充覆盖面。\n\n最直接的方式就是，\n\n看看上面这些账号都关注了什么人。\n\n你可以把他们关注的人都简单浏览一遍，\n\n然后顺藤摸瓜，逐渐扩充自己的关注量。\n\n![Solana Daily Followers](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WZbKPysFKecqOD9Bsmd73.png?height=1386&width=1178)\n\n我们团队其中一个朋友也有自己的推特账号，\n\n以前从来没有宣传过。\n\n如果大家感兴趣也可以关注一下，\n\n从我们这里突破。\n\n感谢大家支持。\n\n[https://twitter.com/real_xiong](https://twitter.com/real_xiong)\n\n## 平台快讯\n\n获取项目的另一个渠道就是资讯平台。\n\n尤其关注快讯。\n\n目前能用且有一定价值信息的快讯平台是[链闻](https://www.chainnews.com)和金色财经。\n\n如果你觉得每天弹窗信息太多，\n\n你可以选择集中抽一个时间，\n\n在平台上搜索「融资」快速查找项目。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/29IR4Ly-dcOa1xXxtrK33.png?height=920&width=1215)\n\n当然这里的项目依然只是为了扩充信息，\n\n毕竟融了资的也不一定都是好项目，\n\n你还需要在后续进一步筛选。\n\n## 工具筛选\n\n前面我们提到了Dappradar的工具。\n\n在筛选项目的时候，\n\n使用一些第三方工具，\n\n从数据角度出发也是一个不错的选择。\n\n[Dappradar](https://www.dappradar.com)、[Dapp.com](https://www.dapp.com) 可以帮助你从用户量、交易量等角度筛选项目。\n\n一般来讲数据不会骗人。\n\n在第三方平台上找到数据好的，或者增长趋势好的，\n\n但是你还不知道的项目。\n\n去了解一下，总不会是坏处。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z5YLUWzLVDC10oqcJ9RxR.png?height=816&width=1105)\n\n了解多了以后，\n\n你会发现数据其实也会骗人。\n\n因为太多项目会刷数据，博眼球。\n\n所以数据只是你的参考标准，而不是唯一标准。\n\n另外，Defi赛道的工具也非常多。\n\n这里我们介绍一个工具叫做：[DefiLama](https://defillama.com)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N5ef0vsJ7qpD3qfQ4Gp0v.png?height=879&width=1718)\n\n一般而言，锁仓量的大小会侧面反应项目的价值，\n\n而锁仓量的趋势会侧面反应项目的潜力及风险。\n\n比如在Trader Joe价格上涨之前，\n\n你会看到他的锁仓量正在上升。\n\n而在vee.finance价格下跌之前，\n\n你会看到他的锁仓量正在下降。\n\nDefiLama能够帮助你纵览锁仓量整体情况，\n\n以及按公链维度、Defi的细分赛道维度筛选项目。\n\n如果你是一个关注Defi的人，\n\n这个工具推荐你使用。\n\n同样，Defi的工具也非常多，\n\n我们后面还会谈到一些，\n\n但这也绝不是全部。\n\n在你不断深入的过程中，\n\n你还会有更多的新发现。\n\n# 筛项目：建立标准、快速过滤\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YBZi06pR0RDuFQiZkoYGW.png?height=820&width=1338)\n\n> 你的信息渠道越多，你知道的项目也就会越多。\n>\n> 同时，你能放在单个项目上的时间也会越少。\n>\n> 因此建立一些自己的标准，\n>\n> 快速筛选掉一些看起来不靠谱的项目，\n>\n> 把时间花在刀刃上，是很重要的。\n\n### 铁三角：固定标准\n\n对于我们而言，\n\n我们一般从资方、团队和产品三个角度做筛选。\n\n* 资方：至少1个靠谱的资方\n* 团队：成员背景好，有相关从业经历\n* 产品：产品体验好，赛道有前景且白皮书清晰。\n\n这里的三个维度都没有明确指标，\n\n而是需要在你看了足够多项目后。\n\n通过对比，你才会有一个比较直观的感受。\n\n加上现在很多区块链项目都是匿名团队，\n\n或者产品还没上就开始宣传卖货了。\n\n所以很多时候这样的铁三角，\n\n不一定需要三者俱全，\n\n而是至少占其一。\n\n另外关于资方，很多朋友也知道要看，\n\n但更多的问题是不知道哪个资方算好。\n\n我们提供三种方法：\n\n1-通过[block123](https://www.block123.com)查找资方情况；\n\n2-到资方官网，查看创始人及过往项目；\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SVns4trwhqlplJXXmjzkq.png?height=790&width=1245)\n\n3-第三方资料。\n\n我们之前拿到一份第三方做的资方排名，\n\n虽然不具备100%可信度，但仍然是一份不错的参考材料。\n\n`文章末尾会告诉大家获得此份材料的方式。`\n\n## 多维度：独立见解\n\n在快速筛选完项目之后，\n\n就到了各显神通的时候了。\n\n初步看起来不错的项目，\n\n值得你多花一点时间去了解更全面的信息。\n\n这里包括但不仅限于：\n\n竞争对手情况、该项目的优劣势、赛道发展前景及周期、代码审计/更新情况、经济模型/持仓占比等。\n\n这里再为大家介绍一个工具：[TokenTerminal](https://www.tokenterminal.com)\n\n这个工具在看Defi项目的时候会用的比较多。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s4D-qDEqwCsxAr6fFNN91.png?height=905&width=1648)\n\n他引入了很多重要的项目指标，\n\n并能够让你把多个项目放到同一张图里进行对比，\n\n让你快速了解相关项目的数据表现情况。\n\n至于哪些数据指标重要，\n\n我们之前看过一篇来自mint ventures的文章.\n\n`本文末尾会告诉大家获得此份材料的方式。`\n\n# 盯项目：固化渠道、每日精读\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hu7CZT4rzdQsyPvPzWTuM.png?height=986&width=1424)\n\n### 重点项目，每日必读\n\n有了前面的基础之后，\n\n随着时间的推移，你想关注的项目会越来越多。\n\n这时候你就需要有一个高效的方式，\n\n快速获取这些项目的重要信息。\n\n获取重要信息一般有四种方式：\n\n* 关注项目方[Medium](https://medium.com)\n* 加入项目方的电报Announcement频道\n* 关注Discord群Announcement信息\n* 订阅官方邮件推送\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H3SVBCp6c9KbOidef1v-A.png?height=668&width=770)\n\n这些渠道更新频率不一定快，但一定都是重要信息。\n\n### 建立分组，提升信息效率\n\n在你关注的项目多了以后，\n\n你还会遇到一个问题就是：\n\n你没有那么多时间去刷推特、工具等。\n\n这时候我们的建议是建立信息的聚合渠道，\n\n快速了解当天的重要信息。\n\n方法有两种：\n\n**1-推特建立分组；**\n\n**2-关注重要电报频道。**\n\n推特上将不同类别的账号进行分类，\n\n根据你的需求进行浏览。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s9IL6sGxo8ktkT850W7Jw.png?height=510&width=867)\n\n电报中也可以关注一些每日新闻的频道，推荐：[The Daily Ape](https://t.me/thedailyape)、[defiprime](https://t.me/defiprime)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3-PTz6r-5WP48CDO8DvMm.png?height=702&width=1280)\n\n# 写在最后\n\n写到这里，\n\n本次内容基本上就结束了，\n\n但也许这只是一个开始。\n\n可能以后你会觉得这些工具都不能满足你了，\n\n这时候你还会知道有nansen、theblock、debank等工具。\n\n可能以后你会觉得很多信息都很浮躁，\n\n这时候你会更多关注链闻、深潮、Messari等平台的价值信息。\n\n可能以后你会觉得关注宏观信息也是有必要的，\n\n这时候你会知道有Coindesk、Decrypt等资讯平台。\n\n以上就是我们的道与术。\n\n希望给各位带来一些帮助。\n\n关于前文提到的材料，除资方排名、Defi指标外，\n\n还有一份How to Defi的中文版内容也将一并奉上。\n\n我们从来不做付费的事情，\n\n但我们也期望有更多的粉丝关注。\n\n所以获取方式是：\n\n**您只需要将我们「任意一篇文章、视频转发到任意群组/朋友圈」，**\n\n**或者「转推[钻石手小伙伴](https://twitter.com/real_xiong)的任一推特」即可。**\n\n**完成后截图发送到微信后台，我们将私发您材料链接。**\n\n> 鱼相忘于江湖，人相忘于道术。——庄子\n\n我们抛个砖，\n\n希望大家能建立自己的道与术。\n\n再次感谢大家的支持。\n\n电报群：\n\n[https://t.me/diamondhandsinvest](https://t.me/diamondhandsinvest)\n\nDiscord群：\n\n[https://discord.gg/6tVwE8nP](https://discord.gg/6tVwE8nP)\n\nYouTube视频链接：\n\n[https://youtu.be/Z9QpuqKH1eg](https://youtu.be/Z9QpuqKH1eg)\n\n哔哩哔哩视频链接：\n\n[https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16T4y1Z77h](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16T4y1Z77h)\n\n",

世上只有一种英雄主义，就是发现了生活的真相，依然热爱它。——罗曼·罗兰\n\n前不久我们做了一次社区调研，\n\n朋友们提到最多的建议就是：\n\n授人以鱼，不如授人以渔。\n\n很多朋友都想自己掌握发现好项目的途径。\n\n恰逢最近整体环境的变化，\n\n也许授人以渔还会具有特殊的意义。\n\n因此我们决定做本期内容，\n\n与社区的朋友们分享和交流。\n\n我们将分享一些基础和常用的找项目的方式，\n\n希望对大家有所帮助。\n\n因篇幅有限，只做一些基础介绍。\n\n当然这也只是一家之言，\n\n如果你还有更多好的方式，欢迎与我们的社区朋友一起交流。\n\n电报群：\n\n[https://t.me/diamondhandsinvest](https://t.me/diamondhandsinvest)\n\nDiscord群：\n\n[https://discord.gg/6tVwE8nP](https://discord.gg/6tVwE8nP)\n\n## 整体思路\n\n> 有道无术，术尚可求也；有术无道，止于术。——《天道》\n\n在解决单个问题之前，\n\n建议最好有一个系统的方法论。\n\n现在的项目层出不穷，\n\n有时候即使你采取守株待兔的策略，\n\n也会有很多项目自己找上门来。\n\n所以你需要的将不只是找项目一件事，\n\n你还需要知道如何快速筛选项目。\n\n而随着关注项目的增多，\n\n将来你还需要建立自己的信息聚合渠道。\n\n用来甄别哪些信息需要细看，\n\n哪些信息只需要快速浏览即可。\n\n因此本次内容将分为三个部分：\n\n* 广泛获取项目\n\n\n* 快速筛选项目\n\n\n* 持续关注项目\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PlxIP9E0NOMQUMPs37T9r.png?height=986&width=1192)\n\n# 找项目：广泛浏览、信息聚合\n\n### 推特关注\n\n很多人的项目信息来源于推特，\n\n看到某个大V转载、点赞或者follow了哪个项目，\n\n就会开始对这个项目产生兴趣。\n\n但是对于新手而言，\n\n这里的难点在于应该如何开始？\n\n或者不知道应该follow哪些人才正确？\n\n首先，从哪里开始，我们的看法是至少关注三类账号：\n\n* 资方及创始人\n\n\n* 公链宣发账号\n\n\n* 第三方工具\n\n**1-资方及创始人**\n\n比如Zhu Su、Dragonfly Capital等。作为资方，他们偶尔会为所投项目站台，或者转发所投项目的资讯。\n\n![Zhu Su & Dragonfly Capital转推](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ERuVs446wJsQfs7MAfUq5.png?height=638&width=1786)\n\n如果你发现好的资方或者创始人，\n\n正在转发某个你不知道的项目，\n\n也许你就可以先去了解一下。\n\n哪些是好的资方，我们在后面会谈到。\n\n**2-公链宣发账号**\n\n当你开始关注某个生态的时候，\n\n最有效的获取该生态即时资讯和项目的方式，\n\n就是关注其公链的宣发账号。\n\n如BSC Daily、Solana Daily、AVAX Daily等。\n\n![公链宣发账号](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RpgMzwggomBk9oo8vtRwD.png?height=694&width=2532)\n\n这些账号经常会告诉你，\n\n态上又有什么新的项目，\n\n或者某个项目取得了什么样的突破。\n\n等你关注多了以后，\n\n除了官方宣发账号外，\n\n你还会逐渐发现一些关注这些生态项目的发烧友。\n\n如果你觉得这些发烧友分享的内容还不错，\n\n同时关注一下他们也是不错的。\n\n**3-第三方工具**\n\n除了聚焦资方、聚焦公链生态外，\n\n还有一类账户必须关注，就是第三方机构。\n\n第三方机构更多是通过数据说话和事件说话。\n\n某个项目最近数据表现不错，\n\n或者拿了一笔不错的融资，\n\n这些账号都会进行分享。\n\n典型的有：DappRadar、Dapp.com、1C0 Analytics等。\n\n![DappRadar & Dapp.com & 1C0 Analytics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3Ystm5FQDpChHwoNh7DTk.png?height=676&width=2514)\n\n以上只是基础的一些账号类型，\n\n之后你还可以关注一些交易所账号、个人大V，\n\n或者关注项目官方及创始人账号等等，\n\n便于你了解更多项目上架信息或一些个人的观点。\n\n在解决从哪里开始之后，下一步还需要扩充覆盖面。\n\n最直接的方式就是，\n\n看看上面这些账号都关注了什么人。\n\n你可以把他们关注的人都简单浏览一遍，\n\n然后顺藤摸瓜，逐渐扩充自己的关注量。\n\n![Solana Daily Followers](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WZbKPysFKecqOD9Bsmd73.png?height=1386&width=1178)\n\n我们团队其中一个朋友也有自己的推特账号，\n\n以前从来没有宣传过。\n\n如果大家感兴趣也可以关注一下，\n\n从我们这里突破。\n\n感谢大家支持。\n\n[https://twitter.com/real_xiong](https://twitter.com/real_xiong)\n\n[https://twitter.com/real_xiong](https://twitter.com/real_xiong)\n\n## 平台快讯\n\n获取项目的另一个渠道就是资讯平台。\n\n尤其关注快讯。\n\n目前能用且有一定价值信息的快讯平台是[链闻](https://www.chainnews.com)和金色财经。\n\n如果你觉得每天弹窗信息太多，\n\n你可以选择集中抽一个时间，\n\n在平台上搜索「融资」快速查找项目。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/29IR4Ly-dcOa1xXxtrK33.png?height=920&width=1215)\n\n当然这里的项目依然只是为了扩充信息，\n\n毕竟融了资的也不一定都是好项目，\n\n你还需要在后续进一步筛选。\n\n## 工具筛选\n\n前面我们提到了Dappradar的工具。\n\n在筛选项目的时候，\n\n使用一些第三方工具，\n\n从数据角度出发也是一个不错的选择。\n\n[Dappradar](https://www.dappradar.com)、[Dapp.com](https://www.dapp.com) 可以帮助你从用户量、交易量等角度筛选项目。\n\n一般来讲数据不会骗人。\n\n在第三方平台上找到数据好的，或者增长趋势好的，\n\n但是你还不知道的项目。\n\n去了解一下，总不会是坏处。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z5YLUWzLVDC10oqcJ9RxR.png?height=816&width=1105)\n\n了解多了以后，\n\n你会发现数据其实也会骗人。\n\n因为太多项目会刷数据，博眼球。\n\n所以数据只是你的参考标准，而不是唯一标准。\n\n另外，Defi赛道的工具也非常多。\n\n这里我们介绍一个工具叫做：[DefiLama](https://defillama.com)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N5ef0vsJ7qpD3qfQ4Gp0v.png?height=879&width=1718)\n\n一般而言，锁仓量的大小会侧面反应项目的价值，\n\n而锁仓量的趋势会侧面反应项目的潜力及风险。\n\n比如在Trader Joe价格上涨之前，\n\n你会看到他的锁仓量正在上升。\n\n而在vee.finance价格下跌之前，\n\n你会看到他的锁仓量正在下降。\n\nDefiLama能够帮助你纵览锁仓量整体情况，\n\n以及按公链维度、Defi的细分赛道维度筛选项目。\n\n如果你是一个关注Defi的人，\n\n这个工具推荐你使用。\n\n同样，Defi的工具也非常多，\n\n我们后面还会谈到一些，\n\n但这也绝不是全部。\n\n在你不断深入的过程中，\n\n你还会有更多的新发现。\n\n# 筛项目：建立标准、快速过滤\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YBZi06pR0RDuFQiZkoYGW.png?height=820&width=1338)\n\n> 你的信息渠道越多，你知道的项目也就会越多。\n>\n> 同时，你能放在单个项目上的时间也会越少。\n>\n> 因此建立一些自己的标准，\n>\n> 快速筛选掉一些看起来不靠谱的项目，\n>\n> 把时间花在刀刃上，是很重要的。\n\n### 铁三角：固定标准\n\n对于我们而言，\n\n我们一般从资方、团队和产品三个角度做筛选。\n\n* 资方：至少1个靠谱的资方\n* 团队：成员背景好，有相关从业经历\n* 产品：产品体验好，赛道有前景且白皮书清晰。\n\n这里的三个维度都没有明确指标，\n\n而是需要在你看了足够多项目后。\n\n通过对比，你才会有一个比较直观的感受。\n\n加上现在很多区块链项目都是匿名团队，\n\n或者产品还没上就开始宣传卖货了。\n\n所以很多时候这样的铁三角，\n\n不一定需要三者俱全，\n\n而是至少占其一。\n\n另外关于资方，很多朋友也知道要看，\n\n但更多的问题是不知道哪个资方算好。\n\n我们提供三种方法：\n\n1-通过[block123](https://www.block123.com)查找资方情况；\n\n2-到资方官网，查看创始人及过往项目；\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SVns4trwhqlplJXXmjzkq.png?height=790&width=1245)\n\n3-第三方资料。\n\n我们之前拿到一份第三方做的资方排名，\n\n虽然不具备100%可信度，但仍然是一份不错的参考材料。\n\n`文章末尾会告诉大家获得此份材料的方式。`\n\n## 多维度：独立见解\n\n在快速筛选完项目之后，\n\n就到了各显神通的时候了。\n\n初步看起来不错的项目，\n\n值得你多花一点时间去了解更全面的信息。\n\n这里包括但不仅限于：\n\n竞争对手情况、该项目的优劣势、赛道发展前景及周期、代码审计/更新情况、经济模型/持仓占比等。\n\n这里再为大家介绍一个工具：[TokenTerminal](https://www.tokenterminal.com)\n\n这个工具在看Defi项目的时候会用的比较多。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s4D-qDEqwCsxAr6fFNN91.png?height=905&width=1648)\n\n他引入了很多重要的项目指标，\n\n并能够让你把多个项目放到同一张图里进行对比，\n\n让你快速了解相关项目的数据表现情况。\n\n至于哪些数据指标重要，\n\n我们之前看过一篇来自mint ventures的文章.\n\n`本文末尾会告诉大家获得此份材料的方式。`\n\n# 盯项目：固化渠道、每日精读\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hu7CZT4rzdQsyPvPzWTuM.png?height=986&width=1424)\n\n### 重点项目，每日必读\n\n有了前面的基础之后，\n\n随着时间的推移，你想关注的项目会越来越多。\n\n这时候你就需要有一个高效的方式，\n\n快速获取这些项目的重要信息。\n\n获取重要信息一般有四种方式：\n\n* 关注项目方[Medium](https://medium.com)\n* 加入项目方的电报Announcement频道\n* 关注Discord群Announcement信息\n* 订阅官方邮件推送\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H3SVBCp6c9KbOidef1v-A.png?height=668&width=770)\n\n这些渠道更新频率不一定快，但一定都是重要信息。\n\n### 建立分组，提升信息效率\n\n在你关注的项目多了以后，\n\n你还会遇到一个问题就是：\n\n你没有那么多时间去刷推特、工具等。\n\n这时候我们的建议是建立信息的聚合渠道，\n\n快速了解当天的重要信息。\n\n方法有两种：\n\n**1-推特建立分组；**\n\n**2-关注重要电报频道。**\n\n推特上将不同类别的账号进行分类，\n\n根据你的需求进行浏览。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s9IL6sGxo8ktkT850W7Jw.png?height=510&width=867)\n\n电报中也可以关注一些每日新闻的频道，推荐：[The Daily Ape](https://t.me/thedailyape)、[defiprime](https://t.me/defiprime)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3-PTz6r-5WP48CDO8DvMm.png?height=702&width=1280)\n\n# 写在最后\n\n写到这里，\n\n本次内容基本上就结束了，\n\n但也许这只是一个开始。\n\n可能以后你会觉得这些工具都不能满足你了，\n\n这时候你还会知道有nansen、theblock、debank等工具。\n\n可能以后你会觉得很多信息都很浮躁，\n\n这时候你会更多关注链闻、深潮、Messari等平台的价值信息。\n\n可能以后你会觉得关注宏观信息也是有必要的，\n\n这时候你会知道有Coindesk、Decrypt等资讯平台。\n\n以上就是我们的道与术。\n\n希望给各位带来一些帮助。\n\n关于前文提到的材料，除资方排名、Defi指标外，\n\n还有一份How to Defi的中文版内容也将一并奉上。\n\n我们从来不做付费的事情，\n\n但我们也期望有更多的粉丝关注。\n\n所以获取方式是：\n\n**您只需要将我们「任意一篇文章、视频转发到任意群组/朋友圈」，**\n\n**或者「转推[钻石手小伙伴](https://twitter.com/real_xiong)的任一推特」即可。**\n\n**完成后截图发送到微信后台，我们将私发您材料链接。**\n\n> 鱼相忘于江湖，人相忘于道术。——庄子\n\n我们抛个砖，\n\n希望大家能建立自己的道与术。\n\n再次感谢大家的支持。\n\n电报群：\n\n[https://t.me/diamondhandsinvest](https://t.me/diamondhandsinvest)\n\nDiscord群：\n\n[https://discord.gg/6tVwE8nP](https://discord.gg/6tVwE8nP)\n\nYouTube视频链接：\n\n[https://youtu.be/Z9QpuqKH1eg](https://youtu.be/Z9QpuqKH1eg)\n\n哔哩哔哩视频链接：\n\n[https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16T4y1Z77h](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16T4y1Z77h)\n\n",

{"id": "RCzEgH_basHHjoihiwYuwAvvUYJSYLetiexFbNOQgpg", "title": "「Pixel Pix」美麗な3Dピクセルを作って遊ぶP2EゲームがGamestarterからリリース！", "body": "NFT-based crowdfunding platform & marketplaceの『[Gamestarter](https://www.gamestarter.com/)』が制作開発をするNFTゲーム第二弾としてリリース予定の「[Pixel Pix](https://www.pixelpix.com/)」をご存知ですか？本作は、プレイヤーがプレイアブルなNFTを自ら作成し、NFTとして販売することができる初のPlay-to-Earnゲームです。近日IGOについての重要な発表があるとのことで、改めてホワイトペーパーの内容を中心に解説していきます。\n\n## 「Pixel Pix」美麗な3Dピクセルを作って遊ぶP2EゲームがGamestarterからリリース！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jW9S1-IDWM9yuKWNDao5v.jpg?height=699&width=1200)\n\nマインクラフトのような8-Bitな世界観が特徴の「Pixel Pix」は、ピクセルキャラクターにとても親しみが湧きます。このゲームの大きな特徴は、プレイヤーが作った「PIXIES（読み：ピクシー or ピクシス）をNFTとしてミントし、マーケットプレイスで販売することができる点です。\n\n### ゲームプレイについて\n\n本作の遊び方は3つあります。\n\n* 自分だけの「PIXIES」を作成し、名前を付けたら、プラットフォーム上で商標登録されたNFTを自動的に生成され、マーケットプレイスで取引が可能です。\n* プレイヤーは「PIXELVERSE（ピクセルバース）」と呼ばれるメタバースを探検することができます。\n* プレイヤーはアリーナで他プレイヤーと対戦ができ、またh作品を披露し合うことができます。\n\n### 「PIXIES」とは\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tnOcPXTev7o2fJLaboLDB.png?height=442&width=1000)\n\n「PIXIES」は、プレイヤーによって、生み出され、買うことも可能なプレイアブルNFTです。各プレイヤーは、1ピクセルから制作を始め、徐々にピクセルを増やしていくことが可能です。「PIXIES」を完璧に仕上げるには、より多くのピクセルが必要になります。ピクセルを手に入れる方法は、2つあり、アリーナでプレイヤー間で戦うか、**1ピクセル＝1 PIX**で購入することです。使えるピクセル数は10億個までですが、それ以外は何も制限はありません。\n\n### トークンエコノミーについて\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VsGE4MhFab1vrbECKWCY9.png?height=744&width=1080)\n\n「Pixel Pix」はデュアルトークノミクスで作動します。1ピクセル＝1 PIXとして「ピクセル」の売買に使用されます。プラットフォームのトークン・ゲームコイン（$GAME）はNFTのミントプロセスを強化するために使用し、ゲーム内の10億ピクセルは10億PIXに対応するように設定されます。\n\n### 遊び方\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uhBIEY4SElPOGwiG8Cfwy.jpg?height=583&width=1000)\n\n「Pixel Pixは」3D環境で動作し、プレイヤーは自分の「PIXIES」をあらゆる方向に動かすことができます。さらに、プレイヤーは所有するすべての「PIXIES」を自由に修正したり結合したりすることができます。また、必要に応じてピクセル数を増やし、自分の「PIXIES」を自由にアップグレードすることも可能です。\n\nピクセル数を増やしたい場合は、PIXELVERSEのアリーナに参加することができます。さまざまな環境でさまざまな物理特性を持つ「PIXIES」と交流したり、戦ったり、遊んだりして、より多くのピクセルを獲得するための新たな方法を創造することができるのです。\n\n「PIXIES」のレベルに応じて、プレイヤーは飛ぶ、歩く、ジャンプするなど、PIXELVERSEの環境の中で様々なことができるようになります。\n\n### プラットフォームについて\n\n[https://twitter.com/PixelPix_com/status/1442518166169587721?s=20](https://twitter.com/PixelPix_com/status/1442518166169587721?s=20)\n\n「Pixel Pix」のプラットフォームは、Unity 3Dエンジンを使用して構築されており、なんとモバイル、ブラウザベース、VRでプレイ可能となります。ユーザーは、いつでも自分の「PIXIES」を操作し、誰かと対話することができます。また、より良い体験をしていただくために、プレイヤーが自分の作品に触れることができるVRゲームアクセスもリリース予定です。\n\n### チェーン\n\n「Pixel Pix」は、誰でも簡単に利用できるようにするために、ゲーム内でポリゴン、バイナンススマートチェーン、イーサリアムブロックチェーン、ブリッジ技術を使用します。これにより、プレイヤーは異なるブロックチェーン間をシームレスに移動が可能になり、最も便利で安価な方法を選んで自分の「PIXIES」を移動させることができます。\n\n## まとめ\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/03vqeZ_IR3qIgEotkeAyx.jpg?height=700&width=1200)\n\nいかがでしたでしょうか？『Gamestarter』のプロジェクト第一弾となる「[Dark Frontiers](https://www.darkfrontiers.com/)（ダーク・フロンティア）」のIGOは既に大成功を収め、多くのクリプト&ゲームファンはそのゲームの次の展開となる「Pixel Pix」に大きな期待を寄せています。更に、第三弾となる「[Project SEED](https://projectseed.io/)」は外部との初の連携プロジェクトになり、こちらへの期待も高まります。\n\n本作は、まだこれからのゲームです。Play-to-EarnゲームはAxie Infinityをはじめ、人気ゲームは存在しているものの、まだ数としては圧倒的に少ない状況です。DappRadarを参照するとNFTゲームやブロックチェーンゲームは増加していますが、『Gamestarter』は、IGOを実施するクラウドファンディングとゲームプラットフォームの2つを掛け合わせた全く新しい存在と言えます。\n\n今後いくつもの人気ゲームを抱えていくのであれば、プラットフォームとしての可能性は非常に大きく、公式[Discord](https://discord.gg/zndUrvexcY)へも参加してみてください。\n\n### Gamestarter公式サイト一覧\n\nWeb (https://www.gamestarter.co/) \n Twitter (https://twitter.com/gamestarter_co) \n Telegram (https://t.me/gamestarter_co) \n Official Announcement Channel (https://t.me/gamestarternews) \n Whitepaper (https://gamestarter.gitbook.io/gamestarter/) \n Medium (https://blog.gamestarter.co/) \n TikTok (https://t.co/j9qFH3BhMP)", "timestamp": 1634025450, "digest": "ZLAp1eo2f_-jzMYJ7b9OQdLBFBvjy3V1Venp3b_pg1M", "contributor": "0x3A6De8266241991a94c1648e3BEc79cc06F0f38f"}

Rocket Pool 延迟和漏洞报告\n3. 合并工作坊\n\n## Altair 升级\n\n提醒一下，Altair 在信标链主网升级定在了 epoch 74240 (北京时间 2021 年 10 月 27 日，18:56:23am)。如果你在 Eth2 上质押了，你**必须**在这个日期前升级你的客户端。请看以太坊基金会的[这篇文章](https://www.ethereum.cn/Eth2/altair-announcement)，了解常见问题，以及你需要运行的客户端版本的细节。\n\nAltair 升级/分叉不是合并，但它的确新增了一些功能到信标链上 (比如同步委员会) 和其他一些改进。这是合并前我们有的唯一一次升级信标链的实战。如果进展不顺利 (大概是因为很多质押者没有及时升级他们的客户端)，那么它肯定会推迟合并的日期。我们已经提醒过了！\n\n## Rocket Pool 和其他质押池\n\n不幸的是，本周备受期待的 Rocket Pool 质押服务上线在最后一刻被中止了。\n\n以下是上线前夕 Rocket Pool 在 [discord](https://discord.com/channels/405159462932971535/405163979141545995/894769328858226728) 上的最初公告：\n\n> 我们刚刚被提醒，在协议的节点方面有一个潜在的关键漏洞，它可能会允许运行者提交之前制作的提款凭证给迷你池。这是一个非常复杂的漏洞，因此我将需要一些时间来分析和研究修复工作。这不是一个直接的智能合约漏洞。\n>\n> 很明显，在接近上线的时候发生这种情况并不是我们想要的，但我们极其重视安全问题，而且确保用户资金安全比其他一切都重要。这将影响我们的上线日期，因此我们将很快给出更新信息。\n\n该漏洞由 StakeWise 的 Dmitri Tsumak [发现](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io/status/1445475001696620550)，他非常负责地披露给 Rocket Pool。漏洞信息现在是公开的，Rocket Pool 也已经[发布了一些分析](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool-research/blob/master/Reports/withdrawal-creds-exploit.md)。\n\n简而言之，这次的问题是在一些质押池场景里，一个恶意的行动者有可能会抢在存款交易前把提款凭证设为他们自己的而不是预期的提款合约。这样，当押金最终要被提出时，ETH 会落在攻击者的手里，而不是质押者。这个问题实际上在两年前已经由可敬的 Jim McDonald [首次发现](https://ethresear.ch/t/deposit-contract-exploit/6528)。\n\n在 Immunefi 的协助下，质押池间的对话被公开了，[Lido](https://blog.lido.fi/vulnerability-response-update/) 和 [Stakefish](https://twitter.com/stakefish/status/1445807718892130304) 都宣布它们也有可能受到这个攻击。其他质押池也可能。目前这个漏洞还没有被利用过，且大家都正在采取措施防止它的发生。\n\nRocket Pool 正在[测试和审计](https://twitter.com/Rocket_Pool/status/1446300700661583876)它们的修复，并重新计划上线。请继续关注！\n\n## 合并工作坊\n\n出于安全性考虑，关于这个工作坊的消息不多，但在过去的一周里，Eth1 和 Eth2 团队、以太坊基金会研究团队、ConsenSys Quilt 研发团队和 ConsenSys TX/RX 的大约 40 名代表一直在希腊进行现场合作。等到大家都回家了，我将分享一些照片和记录。\n\n这次工作坊的最终目标是创建一个长期存在的多客户端合并开发网络。也就是说，一个包含多个 Eth1 和多个 Eth2 客户端的网络，已经经历了 PoW 工作量证明到 PoS 权益证明的切换，并且正在顺利地运行并处理交易。\n\n我们[做到了](https://twitter.com/benjaminion_xyz/status/1446516207159582743)！(在我们的闭幕晚宴前还有两分钟的空闲时间！) 三个执行客户端和四个共识客户端一起顺利地从PoW 工作量证明过渡到了 PoS 权益证明。这只是第一步，我们预计短期内会出现问题。但我们做到了，这是停用 PoW 工作量证明工作的巨大飞跃。\n\n要了解我们的工作，我强烈推荐观看Adrian Sutton 这个精炼的[视频演示](https://www.symphonious.net/2021/10/08/ethereum-merge-local-testnet-demo/) 。我们可以在 PoS 网络中看到以太坊交易的发生！\n\n在实现过程中，有很多关于进展顺利的报道。在此为大家提供一些背景信息，现在在发生的是各个 Eth2/共识客户端正在与各个 Eth1/执行客户端配对，并测试它们能否一起从 PoW 顺利过渡到 PoS。在此之后，再使用多种客户端组合构建更大的网络。关于客户端组合的命名，这里有一些[建议](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1445008969756467203)。\n\n以下是一些客户端成功配对的通告，大致按时间顺序排列：\n\n* [Nimbus 与

无法出席，但团队一直在[远程工作](https://twitter.com/terencechain/status/1445790942112325639)。\n\n在解决客户端之间许多不兼容的小问题时，最具挑战性的问题之一是有效地同步组合网络上的节点。Sigma Prime 团队的 Paul Hauner 针对这个挑战了[进行了不错的总结](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/2691)。\n\n我们还举行了许多分组会议讨论测试网自动化、API 定义、错误标准化、模糊测试和持续集成以及“从 Amphora 迁移到主网”等内容。本周是“合并概念证明”向前迈出的一大步，并迅速使客户端同步进度。但在稳健性和产品化方面仍有大量工作要做。到目前为止，我们只是测试了满意路径。\n\n本周也进行了以下其他工作：\n\n* [MergeMock](https://github.com/protolambda/mergemock) 可以模拟执行节点或共识节点，使得测试和漏洞隔离更容易。\n* [Merge Fuzz](https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/merge-fuzz) 对 Geth 的引擎 API (它与信标节点的接口) 进行了模糊测试。计划是扩展到所有 Eth1/执行客户端以执行差异化模糊测试。此处是[公告](https://twitter.com/vdWijden/status/1446461842977591297)。\n* [Ansible playbooks](https://github.com/parithosh/consensus-deployment-ansible/tree/amphora) 用以设置测试网。\n* 合并测试网的[共识监测器](https://mergenet.consensus-monitor.stokes.io/)正在监测当前的开发网络。目前一切顺利，我们应该会看到许多 Eth1 和 Eth2 客户端的组合在完美同步。此处是[公告](https://twitter.com/ralexstokes/status/1446460171077701634)。\n\n此处是 Sigma Prime 团队对[本周的记录](https://twitter.com/sigp_io/status/1446521008702246913)。\n\n最后但绝不是最不重要的，不妨看看我为这次活动制作的 [t

{"id": "HYjc6db1mbOR1Qk0mQYr5dyxlFz5OkA4U07isMfYHcM", "title": "Eth2 进展更新 (截至 2021/10/8)", "body": "来源 | [What's New in Eth2](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_211008)\n\n## Amphora 特别版🏺\n\n首先，从我开始写这个系列的文章到现在已经三年 (又一个星期)了，所以应该来一个 🎂 吧！[这是第一期](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fopen%3Fid%3D1kKYBVda4pHNa3nQqVHv6RfZqQuRZNRdTCG9Us_uvR54)。我真的没有预期我到现在还在继续写，但三周年就这样来了！\n\n这一期会尽可能精简，因为我整个星期都在和 Eth1 和 Eth2 的开发团队一起参与合并 (The Merge) 工作坊。后面会有更详细的内容。\n\n此次更新主要有三个主题：\n\n1. 准备 Altair 升级\n2. Rocket Pool 延迟和漏洞报告\n3. 合并工作坊\n\n## Altair 升级\n\n提醒一下，Altair 在信标链主网升级定在了 epoch 74240 (北京时间 2021 年 10 月 27 日，18:56:23am)。如果你在 Eth2 上质押了，你**必须**在这个日期前升级你的客户端。请看以太坊基金会的[这篇文章](https://www.ethereum.cn/Eth2/altair-announcement)，了解常见问题，以及你需要运行的客户端版本的细节。\n\nAltair 升级/分叉不是合并，但它的确新增了一些功能到信标链上 (比如同步委员会) 和其他一些改进。这是合并前我们有的唯一一次升级信标链的实战。如果进展不顺利 (大概是因为很多质押者没有及时升级他们的客户端)，那么它肯定会推迟合并的日期。我们已经提醒过了！\n\n## Rocket Pool 和其他质押池\n\n不幸的是，本周备受期待的 Rocket Pool 质押服务上线在最后一刻被中止了。\n\n以下是上线前夕 Rocket Pool 在 [discord](https://discord.com/channels/405159462932971535/405163979141545995/894769328858226728) 上的最初公告：\n\n> 我们刚刚被提醒，在协议的节点方面有一个潜在的关键漏洞，它可能会允许运行者提交之前制作的提款凭证给迷你池。这是一个非常复杂的漏洞，因此我将需要一些时间来分析和研究修复工作。这不是一个直接的智能合约漏洞。\n>\n> 很明显，在接近上线的时候发生这种情况并不是我们想要的，但我们极其重视安全问题，而且确保用户资金安全比其他一切都重要。这将影响我们的上线日期，因此我们将很快给出更新信息。\n\n该漏洞由 StakeWise 的 Dmitri Tsumak [发现](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io/status/1445475001696620550)，他非常负责地披露给 Rocket Pool。漏洞信息现在是公开的，Rocket Pool 也已经[发布了一些分析](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool-research/blob/master/Reports/withdrawal-creds-exploit.md)。\n\n简而言之，这次的问题是在一些质押池场景里，一个恶意的行动者有可能会抢在存款交易前把提款凭证设为他们自己的而不是预期的提款合约。这样，当押金最终要被提出时，ETH 会落在攻击者的手里，而不是质押者。这个问题实际上在两年前已经由可敬的 Jim McDonald [首次发现](https://ethresear.ch/t/deposit-contract-exploit/6528)。\n\n在 Immunefi 的协助下，质押池间的对话被公开了，[Lido](https://blog.lido.fi/vulnerability-response-update/) 和 [Stakefish](https://twitter.com/stakefish/status/1445807718892130304) 都宣布它们也有可能受到这个攻击。其他质押池也可能。目前这个漏洞还没有被利用过，且大家都正在采取措施防止它的发生。\n\nRocket Pool 正在[测试和审计](https://twitter.com/Rocket_Pool/status/1446300700661583876)它们的修复，并重新计划上线。请继续关注！\n\n## 合并工作坊\n\n出于安全性考虑，关于这个工作坊的消息不多，但在过去的一周里，Eth1 和 Eth2 团队、以太坊基金会研究团队、ConsenSys Quilt 研发团队和 ConsenSys TX/RX 的大约 40 名代表一直在希腊进行现场合作。等到大家都回家了，我将分享一些照片和记录。\n\n这次工作坊的最终目标是创建一个长期存在的多客户端合并开发网络。也就是说，一个包含多个 Eth1 和多个 Eth2 客户端的网络，已经经历了 PoW 工作量证明到 PoS 权益证明的切换，并且正在顺利地运行并处理交易。\n\n我们[做到了](https://twitter.com/benjaminion_xyz/status/1446516207159582743)！(在我们的闭幕晚宴前还有两分钟的空闲时间！) 三个执行客户端和四个共识客户端一起顺利地从PoW 工作量证明过渡到了 PoS 权益证明。这只是第一步，我们预计短期内会出现问题。但我们做到了，这是停用 PoW 工作量证明工作的巨大飞跃。\n\n要了解我们的工作，我强烈推荐观看Adrian Sutton 这个精炼的[视频演示](https://www.symphonious.net/2021/10/08/ethereum-merge-local-testnet-demo/) 。我们可以在 PoS 网络中看到以太坊交易的发生！\n\n在实现过程中，有很多关于进展顺利的报道。在此为大家提供一些背景信息，现在在发生的是各个 Eth2/共识客户端正在与各个 Eth1/执行客户端配对，并测试它们能否一起从 PoW 顺利过渡到 PoS。在此之后，再使用多种客户端组合构建更大的网络。关于客户端组合的命名，这里有一些[建议](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1445008969756467203)。\n\n以下是一些客户端成功配对的通告，大致按时间顺序排列：\n\n* [Nimbus 与

无法出席，但团队一直在[远程工作](https://twitter.com/terencechain/status/1445790942112325639)。\n\n在解决客户端之间许多不兼容的小问题时，最具挑战性的问题之一是有效地同步组合网络上的节点。Sigma Prime 团队的 Paul Hauner 针对这个挑战了[进行了不错的总结](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/2691)。\n\n我们还举行了许多分组会议讨论测试网自动化、API 定义、错误标准化、模糊测试和持续集成以及“从 Amphora 迁移到主网”等内容。本周是“合并概念证明”向前迈出的一大步，并迅速使客户端同步进度。但在稳健性和产品化方面仍有大量工作要做。到目前为止，我们只是测试了满意路径。\n\n本周也进行了以下其他工作：\n\n* [MergeMock](https://github.com/protolambda/mergemock) 可以模拟执行节点或共识节点，使得测试和漏洞隔离更容易。\n* [Merge Fuzz](https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/merge-fuzz) 对 Geth 的引擎 API (它与信标节点的接口) 进行了模糊测试。计划是扩展到所有 Eth1/执行客户端以执行差异化模糊测试。此处是[公告](https://twitter.com/vdWijden/status/1446461842977591297)。\n* [Ansible playbooks](https://github.com/parithosh/consensus-deployment-ansible/tree/amphora) 用以设置测试网。\n* 合并测试网的[共识监测器](https://mergenet.consensus-monitor.stokes.io/)正在监测当前的开发网络。目前一切顺利，我们应该会看到许多 Eth1 和 Eth2 客户端的组合在完美同步。此处是[公告](https://twitter.com/ralexstokes/status/1446460171077701634)。\n\n此处是 Sigma Prime 团队对[本周的记录](https://twitter.com/sigp_io/status/1446521008702246913)。\n\n最后但绝不是最不重要的，不妨看看我为这次活动制作的 [t

Players are invited to explore the dream realms and go on adventures by participating in quests, events and tournaments. The NFT game cards are dynamic and are impacted by unknown factors like weather conditions, temperature and storms. At the conclusion of every game, card attributes are written on-chain, storing permanent history of card changes over time as well as how cards have evolved or changed.\n\nPlayers are presented with a free deck to get started and are then given a variety of gaming style options to make the game even more engaging. These include completing quests, competing in battles or tournaments, or setting up a shop in the marketplace to become a local trader. The goal is to create both an in-game economy and a variety of fun and interesting ways to earn while playing. \n\nThe blockchain-based platform enables a decentralized gaming experience so players are in complete control over the ownership of their NFT cards while having a unique highly immersive experience.\n\n“After over a year of hard work, we are excited to finally be bringing this project to the market and to finally see our community coming to life.

Let's see if I can explain this without getting lost in the technicalities of bitcoin, about which I understood almost nothing until this week. It was on a mental list of global issues I would one day understand better.\n 2. Not going to get into the huge systemic economic, social and political debates around bitcoin today, which will be fascinating to watch and report on over the next few years.\n 3. A week ago, [Twitter announced](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/bringing-tips-to-everyone) it was introducing \"tips\" on people's profiles and that one of the options was going to be...bitcoin, with two bitcoin options: **standard bitcoin** and something called **lightning** bitcoin.\n 4. For standard bitcoin, Twitter lets you put a bitcoin \"address\" in a new profile field. To \"tip\" someone (send them some bitcoin, or bits of bitcoin, called \"**satoshis**\"), you copy and paste that address into your bitcoin \"wallet\" (but the easiest thing seems to be to scan a QR code on your phone)\n 5. There are several possibilities for a bitcoin \"wallet\". I installed an app on the phone called [Muun](https://muun.com/). Why? Because Twitter boss @jack [recommended it](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1441392255214964736) in a tweet. So it's probably not a terrible one.\n 6. Another Jack, the boss of **Strike**, also [mentioned Muun](https://twitter.com/jackmallers/status/1441089090628177933) in his new video talking about the Twitter-Strike lightning bitcoin option, which so far is only available in the US and **El Salvador**.\n 7. Why El Salvador? Because El Salvador has introduced bitcoin for everyone in the whole country, a new national payment system. The lightning version is about making bitcoin faster and the transactions cheaper.\n 8. The lightning bitcoin thing on Twitter seems to be about Srike using bitcoin to let people send dollars or euros to each other. But if you don't live in the US or El Salvador, you don't need to worry about that for now.\n 9. Some readers who understand bitcoin **sent me a few bits of bitcoin** (\"satoshis\") to test. It worked (of course it did, but it was new for new). The bits of bitcoin appeared in my \"wallet\" (the Muun app on my phone), along with a euro equivalent amount.\n10. So that was fun. The options for receiving bitcoin, for now, seem to be somebody copying pasting the address into their wallet, or me sending them a lightning bitcoin \"invoice\" first (another line of text or a QR code).\n11. Then I discovered a site called, [@bitrefill](https://twitter.com/bitrefill), which promised to turn bitcoins, or bits of bitcoin, **into Amazon vouchers** that I could spend on journalism stuff. The first little test [worked](https://twitter.com/matthewbennett/status/1442809182550429699).\n12. Some other readers sent more satoshis. Quite a few more. One person sent [nearly €200 worth](https://twitter.com/matthewbennett/status/1442932421293314048), which was very cool, but I know nothing about who they are. Man? Woman? Age? Country? Language? Job? Identity? No idea. Nothing. Zero. Completely anonymous. \\[Thanks if it was you.\\]\n13. Let that sink in. A completely anonymous private reader decided to send along some virtual money to guarantee more and better public journalism for all, in the physical world, with a journalist you can recognise.\n14. Amazon tells me that the **second batch of reporting objects bought with bitcoins** from readers who have guaranteed this journalism [is already on the way](https://twitter.com/matthewbennett/status/1443579995918532616). For now, some cables, connectors, a light and a cage for the phone for the new live streams, a better tripod to hold it all up.\n15. But those new objects will actually really improve things next week when I go and do a first real mobile live stream for you (there will be a big environmental march in Murcia on Thursday because of all the dead fish in the Mar Menor).\n16. So now we have another cool option for guaranteeing independent journalism. We can talk more about bitcoin another day.\n17. You will see the bitcoin addresses and QR codes on the bottom of every **article**, and in the **emails**, or you can find them on **Twitter**, as well as some other alternatives.\n18. Also, as you can see, we're going in a little bit of a different strategic direction with the **journalism-funding model** over the next few weeks and months. Same basic idea but more options, more distributed. Time to move up another level: more reporting, more photos and video and audio, more reporting trips around Spain. Will explain more in future posts.\n19. Fascinating coincidence that this happened the same week I went up to Alicante to speak at the national transparency congress.

Every equation in finance has interest rates in it, either explicitly or implicitly. Mortgages, student loans, business loans, government borrowings, and even equities and commodities are impacted by interest rates.\n\nBusinesses can avoid interest rate risk by engaging in fixed-rate borrowing. Fixed-rate borrowing is the most common form of borrowing in traditional markets. Per [Notional's terrific whitepaper](https://docs.notional.finance/developers/whitepaper/whitepaper), “In 2018, there was $15.3 trillion dollars of debt outstanding in U.S. corporate debt and mortgage debt markets. 88% of that debt was in terms of fixed rates.” However, fixed-rate borrowers may be unhappy with the terms of their loan (and/or have the view that rates across the economy will go down), and may swap their exposure with a different borrower who is currently paying variable but wants a fixed rate. Lenders who own fixed-rate bonds may have the view that rates across the economy will go up and desire to hedge that risk.\n\nToday’s DeFi markets are largely limited to variable-rate lending and borrowing. The two largest borrow/lend protocols, [Compound](https://compound.finance/) and [Aave](https://aave.com/), both support variable rates. While these products work well for users aiming to earn a decent yield, they don’t work for corporations or neo-banks who need predictability—both on the lending and borrowing side. As DeFi grows to serve more use cases, the ability to lock in an interest rate will be a key enabling technology.\n\nInterest rate swaps (IR swaps) are the most popular form of interest-rate derivatives. IR swaps account for [$6.5 trillion](https://stats.bis.org/statx/srs/table/d5.1?f=pdf) of daily traded volume, which represents [over 80%](https://stats.bis.org/statx/srs/table/d5.1?f=pdf) of the world's total derivatives volume. IR swaps serve a variety of use cases: 1) borrowers use IR swaps to lock in interest rates, 2) speculators can express capital efficient directional views using IR swaps, and 3) portfolio managers and lenders use swaps to manage interest rate risk.\n\nThere are a number of teams building fixed-rate lending products and IR derivative protocols in DeFi. In this essay we explore the design space for these primitives and the various choices made by teams building this future.\n\n## The Opportunity for IR Markets in Crypto\n\nThe vast majority of loans in DeFi today are variable rate. As a point of reference, there are $19 billion of loans [outstanding](https://dune.xyz/hagaetc/lending) across the three major lending protocols: 1) Aave - $7.9 billion, 2) Compound - $4.9 billion, and 3) MakerDAO - $6.3 billion.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jrfJL3Zil-5rvsJNWIePq.png?height=474&width=805)\n\n**Source**: [Dune Analytics, @hagaetc](https://dune.xyz/queries/13575/27235)\n\nOf these, 100% of Compound and MakerDAO’s loans are completely variable and open term. Additionally, of Aave’s 5 largest markets (DAI, GUSD, SUSD, TUSD, and USDC), only \\~1.5% of the loans outstanding were “stable rate loans” as of July 2021.\n\nThere are a few DeFi-native fixed-rate platforms live today, such as Yield Protocol and Notional Finance. Notional [has](https://defipulse.com/) $12 million of TVL, and Yield is currently in the process of building out V2. As such, it’s clear that the market for variable-rate loans is much more mature than fixed-rate loans in DeFi. However, we expect fixed-rate loans to become larger than variable rate loans as DeFi rails eventually power traditional financial markets.\n\nWe’ve chatted with many institutional funds and neo-banks who are exploring DeFi. One of the main concerns we hear from them is that interest rates in the lending and borrowing markets are quite volatile. There are many reasons for the volatility (basis trade compression and expansion, Grayscale arb closing, new yield farms with really high APYs, etc.), but the most important fact is that even if they get comfortable with custody and regulatory risk, the lending markets don’t offer them maximal utility. The below chart is a sample of some of the most liquid USDC borrowing rates in DeFi over the past few years:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PNbHVxFTm1H3hCzEN8EzG.png?height=462&width=850)\n\n**Source:** [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/defi-lending)\n\nIn order for large traditional businesses to borrow in DeFi, rates are going to need to be more predictable and stable. A business who borrows $100M on-chain paying 2% is very unlikely to be ok with the rate spiking to 20% a week later because an unrelated liquidity mining farm is now paying extremely high yield. The business will either want to 1) enter into a fixed-rate, fixed-term loan, or 2) have hedging access for their variable rate exposure from Compound and Aave.\n\nAs crypto grows, we also expect the market for on-chain DAO-to-DAO business lending to grow significantly. As businesses mature, debt financing becomes the major source of funding and DAOs will be no different.\n\nWe predict that many DAOs, such as the DAOs that [manage risk](https://multicoin.capital/2021/09/16/daos-manage-risk/) in large DeFi protocols and NFT platforms, will pursue debt financing. Imagine a world in which the SushiSwap DAO can borrow funds from a variable-rate lending protocol and encode logic that says “we will redirect 10% of our revenues from our staked xSUSHI to repay the loan.” This would expose the SushiSwap DAO to interest rate risk from the variable rate protocol, and they could use IR swaps to hedge it.\n\nFixed-rate lending and IR derivative protocols are about to explode in popularity as new products launch.\n\n## An Overview of Fixed-Rate Lending and IR Derivative Protocols\n\nThere are a handful of DeFi constructions that can produce fixed-rate loans and IR derivatives. Each construction has pros and cons.\n\n### Zero-Coupon Bonds (ZCBs)\n\nIn this model, borrowers create bond tokens (yDAI-2021-12-31, for example) by depositing collateral into smart contracts and borrowing yDAI against it. They then sell the yDAI on the open market which settles on a specific date. The effective interest rate paid by the borrower is determined by the discount at which yTokens can be sold on the open market, and the length of the loan. For example, Alice can mint 100 yDAI backed by $200 of ETH and sell the 100 yDAI in exchange for 97 DAI to Bob. Hence, Bob is lending $97 and will receive $100 at contract expiry.\n\nThere are many implementations of this approach, such as 1) trading bond tokens primarily on an AMM or CLOB 2) physical vs cash settlement 3) liquidation management.\n\nThe zero-coupon bond model is used by [Hifi](http://hifi.finance/), [UMA](https://umaproject.org/), [Notional](http://notional.finance/), and [Yield Protocol](https://yield.is/).\n\n**Pros:** 1. Simple construction 2. Supports both fixed-rate lending and borrowing 3. Overcollateralization improves safety for lenders 4. Can build a yield curve on top of the protocol 5. Native token value capture is clear through backstopping liquidation risk\n\n**Cons:** 1. Fragments liquidity across expiries 2. Need oracle for the collateral/debt ratio 3. Requires depositing collateral into a new smart contract system 4. Capital inefficient for speculators and liquidity providers 5. Liquidation risk\n\n### Yield Stripping\n\nIn this model, users can deposit a money market token such as Compound’s cUSDC into the yield stripping protocol’s smart contracts. The protocol then splits the deposited cUSDC into two tokens: 1) the principal token (PT), and 2) the yield token (YT).\n\nDepositors can then sell the YTs for cash upfront, allowing them to lock in a fixed rate for the duration of the contract. As an example, let’s assume that the current lending rate on Compound is 10%. If Alice deposits $100, her annual yield—should the blended Compound rate stay the same for the next 12 months—would be $10. She can trade this unpredictable $10 YT for $8 cash today.\n\nBob, who buys the YT from Alice, is taking a leveraged long view on Compound’s lending rate. To illustrate, imagine that Bob thinks Compound’s interest rate will double to average 20% for the next 12 months. He can deposit $100 into Compound and earn $20 over the next year. Or instead, he can buy 12.5 YTs for $100 ($100 / $8 = 12.5). If Bob is right and the blended rate is 20%, he will get back ($100 *20%* 12.5) = $250, a 150% return on capital. Of course, if he is wrong and the rate decreases to 5%, he will only receive ($100 *5%* 12.5) = $62.50, a 37.5% loss on capital.\n\nYield stripping is used by [Swivel](https://swivel.finance/), [Pendle](https://www.pendle.finance/), [Tempus](https://tempus.finance/), [Element](https://www.element.fi/), [Sense](https://sense.finance/), and [APWine](https://apwine.fi/). We are investors in Swivel, and are very excited about combining the yield stripping construction with a central limit order book.\n\n**Pros:** 1. Enables fixed-rate lending 2. Enables leveraged long speculation on interest rates 3. Requires no liquidation or oracle because principal is deposited upfront and leverage is implied 4. Capital efficient for speculators 5. Safer than ZCBs because collateral is contained with Compound, Aave, etc., which are trusted and established protocols 6. The market capitalizations and liquidity of AAVE and COMP (which act as [backstops](https://multicoin.capital/2021/09/16/daos-manage-risk/) to protocol risk) have achieved a level that is difficult to replicate for new protocols.\n\n**Cons:** 1. Does not allow for explicitly shorting of rates 2. Somewhat capital inefficient for rate trading because it requires the entire principal amount up front 3. Limited to principal assets and rates (no exotic rate exposure) 4. Does not allow for perfect hedging on the floating side because of the spread between Compound and Aave’s lending and borrowing rates 5. Fragments liquidity across expiries\n\n### Stable Rates\n\nAave piggybacks the protocol’s variable interest rates with their stable-lending feature. The basic idea is that when a borrower opens a new loan, she has the opportunity to select “stable rate.” Her origination rate will be higher (often substantially higher) than the variable rate she can borrow at. For example, the variable borrow rate for USDC is 5.4% and the stable borrow rate is 11.9%. The variable borrow rate for ETH is 0.25% and the stable borrow rate is 3.3%. This buffer ensures that the protocol remains solvent before a “rebalancing event” in which the stable rate changes for existing borrowers.\n\nUnlike the borrow rate for a variable user, the borrow rate for stable borrowers in most market conditions will not fluctuate with new borrows, new deposits, new liquidations, etc. into the core Aave market.\n\nThis is the model used by [Aave](https://aave.com/).\n\n**Pros:** 1. Trusted protocol in the Ethereum ecosystem, and AAVE has a large market cap and sufficient liquidity to backstop the protocol in size -- as such, likely safer than other models. See this post for more detail. 2. Enables users to borrow at a stable rate (though not guaranteed fixed in weird market conditions) 3. Lots of liquidity because it leverages Aave TVL 4. Highly utilized in more volatile rate markets on lower market cap and less liquid tokens 5. Liquidity concentration because of the loan’s perpetual nature (no fragmentation across expiries)\n\n**Cons:** 1. No ability to explicitly speculate on rates 2. Only applies to borrowers and not lenders 3. In adverse market conditions users’ rates may be “rebalanced” 4. Does not allow for synthetic rate exposure 5. Borrow rates for stable users are significantly higher than variable\n\n### Contracts for Difference (CFDs) and Interest Rate Perpetual Contracts\n\nIn this model, users deposit any form of collateral into a margin account and go long or short rates. This construction looks very similar to perpetual contracts on FTX and BitMEX. Funding is paid based on the underlying reference rate the contract points to versus the current mark interest rate on the protocol.\n\nThese products offer leverage, and thus require a liquidation engine. In the case of a trader’s account margin falling below its maintenance margin, the system unwinds the position against the perpetual contract AMM (or CLOB).\n\nThis is the model used by [Strips Finance](https://strips.finance/) and [YieldSwap](https://yieldswap.app/).\n\n**Pros:** 1. Explicit rate shorting is possible 2. Ability to get exposure to synthetic rates that are not derived on chain (e.g., LIBOR or FTX’s BTC perp funding rate) 3. Capital efficient because it does not require principal token up front and allows for two-sided leverage 4. Liquidity concentration because of the contract’s perpetual nature\n\n**Cons:** 1. Requires an oracle for off-chain rates 2. Liquidations are necessary because there is leverage 3. Requires separate perp contracts for Compound/Aave borrow and lend rates in order to create perfect hedging\n\n## Exploring the Trade-offs in Fixed-Rate Lending and IR Derivatives\n\nIn examining the various types of fixed-rate lending and IR derivative constructions in DeFi, it’s clear that there are many trade-offs based on design decisions in these systems. In our view, each of these types of protocols will carve out a niche for itself.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dbn8EeH-r2Xz7xgHpd-so.png?height=290&width=831)\n\n## DeFi Perpetual Contracts for Interest Rates\n\nThe flexibility of the synthetic nature of the perpetual contract enables speculators—and hedgers—to trade rates on any theoretical interest rate (e.g., Compound USDC lending rate, LIBOR interest rate, Fed Funds rate, FTX funding rate, ETH 2 staking yield, etc). Notably, there is no need to roll over a position because these contracts are perpetual in nature and do not expire. As such, there is no liquidity fragmentation across expiries. Speculators drive liquidity, and that drives value for hedgers and other organic users.\n\nImagine Alice is borrowing XYZ token from Aave to use for her trading strategy. She can, via interest rate perpetual contracts, go long the Aave interest rate for XYZ token such that she is protected in the event that her borrow rate increases and eats into the profitability of her trading strategy.\n\nThe perpetual swap contract is not perfect, but it offers a capital efficient way for market participants to bet on rates.\n\nIn our earlier post about the design space for DeFi derivatives (highly recommended read) we concluded that the perpetual swap contract will likely be the winning construction for DeFi derivatives. We believe this is likely also true for IR swaps. While the perpetual swap contract is not perfect, its weaknesses are manageable. While the stable rates model is safe for lenders in that capital is kept within Aave, it does not allow for two-sided leveraged exposure to rates and this reduces its utility. ZCBs enable perfectly predictable fixed-rate lending and borrowing, but don’t enable capital efficient rate speculation and therefore have less liquidity.\n\nWhile the perpetual contract construction for interest rates in DeFi is not yet live in meaningful size, we see a massive opportunity for it. We expect that the perpetual contract, which is already the dominant trading product in crypto, will also work very well for CeFi and Defi interest rates.\n\nDisclosure: Multicoin has established, maintains and enforces written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and effectively manage conflicts of interest related to its investment activities.

Let's see if I can explain this without getting lost in the technicalities of bitcoin, about which I understood almost nothing until this week. It was on a mental list of global issues I would one day understand better.\n 2. Not going to get into the huge systemic economic, social and political debates around bitcoin today, which will be fascinating to watch and report on over the next few years.\n 3. A week ago, [Twitter announced](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/bringing-tips-to-everyone) it was introducing \"tips\" on people's profiles and that one of the options was going to be...bitcoin, with two bitcoin options: **standard bitcoin** and something called **lightning** bitcoin.\n 4. For standard bitcoin, Twitter lets you put a bitcoin \"address\" in a new profile field. To \"tip\" someone (send them some bitcoin, or bits of bitcoin, called \"**satoshis**\"), you copy and paste that address into your bitcoin \"wallet\" (but the easiest thing seems to be to scan a QR code on your phone)\n 5. There are several possibilities for a bitcoin \"wallet\". I installed an app on the phone called [Muun](https://muun.com/). Why? Because Twitter boss @jack [recommended it](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1441392255214964736) in a tweet. So it's probably not a terrible one.\n 6. Another Jack, the boss of **Strike**, also [mentioned Muun](https://twitter.com/jackmallers/status/1441089090628177933) in his new video talking about the Twitter-Strike lightning bitcoin option, which so far is only available in the US and **El Salvador**.\n 7. Why El Salvador? Because El Salvador has introduced bitcoin for everyone in the whole country, a new national payment system. The lightning version is about making bitcoin faster and the transactions cheaper.\n 8. The lightning bitcoin thing on Twitter seems to be about Srike using bitcoin to let people send dollars or euros to each other. But if you don't live in the US or El Salvador, you don't need to worry about that for now.\n 9. Some readers who understand bitcoin **sent me a few bits of bitcoin** (\"satoshis\") to test. It worked (of course it did, but it was new for new). The bits of bitcoin appeared in my \"wallet\" (the Muun app on my phone), along with a euro equivalent amount.\n10. So that was fun. The options for receiving bitcoin, for now, seem to be somebody copying pasting the address into their wallet, or me sending them a lightning bitcoin \"invoice\" first (another line of text or a QR code).\n11. Then I discovered a site called, [@bitrefill](https://twitter.com/bitrefill), which promised to turn bitcoins, or bits of bitcoin, **into Amazon vouchers** that I could spend on journalism stuff. The first little test [worked](https://twitter.com/matthewbennett/status/1442809182550429699).\n12. Some other readers sent more satoshis. Quite a few more. One person sent [nearly €200 worth](https://twitter.com/matthewbennett/status/1442932421293314048), which was very cool, but I know nothing about who they are. Man? Woman? Age? Country? Language? Job? Identity? No idea. Nothing. Zero. Completely anonymous. \\[Thanks if it was you.\\]\n13. Let that sink in. A completely anonymous private reader decided to send along some virtual money to guarantee more and better public journalism for all, in the physical world, with a journalist you can recognise.\n14. Amazon tells me that the **second batch of reporting objects bought with bitcoins** from readers who have guaranteed this journalism [is already on the way](https://twitter.com/matthewbennett/status/1443579995918532616). For now, some cables, connectors, a light and a cage for the phone for the new live streams, a better tripod to hold it all up.\n15. But those new objects will actually really improve things next week when I go and do a first real mobile live stream for you (there will be a big environmental march in Murcia on Thursday because of all the dead fish in the Mar Menor).\n16. So now we have another cool option for guaranteeing independent journalism. We can talk more about bitcoin another day.\n17. You will see the bitcoin addresses and QR codes on the bottom of every **article**, and in the **emails**, or you can find them on **Twitter**, as well as some other alternatives.\n18. Also, as you can see, we're going in a little bit of a different strategic direction with the **journalism-funding model** over the next few weeks and months. Same basic idea but more options, more distributed. Time to move up another level: more reporting, more photos and video and audio, more reporting trips around Spain. Will explain more in future posts.\n19. Fascinating coincidence that this happened the same week I went up to Alicante to speak at the national transparency congress.

{"id": "HP8LISPFBBh-fykKaRLO697KBslI3bm4XTM1bnMn42I", "title": "UniPass - Your Universal Crypto Identity in Metaverse", "body": "Metaverse is a fantasy that gives people unlimited reverie. We yearn for its omnipotence, but also want it to be 'real', which means there are no godlike administrators controlling everything, making it just another online game. I'm sure you don't want to see the house you have spent several months hard work to buy be suddenly removed, or be copied 1 million times as incentive for new comers.\n\nBlockchain, the infrastructure of ownership, is a perfect solution. With cryptography and consensus, blockchain can give physical characteristics to key elements of the digital Metaverse: **FT (Fungible Token) for currencies, NFT (Non-fungible Token) for objects, and CID (Crypto Identity) for people**.\n\n![Crypto identity stands for people in metaverse](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/alOmARfQ2Hajz74JKFJa0.png?height=1503&width=2681)\n\n## What is Crypto Identity\n\nMaybe you have heard of [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) (Decentralized Identity), a concept that is a bit too generalized at present. In fact, DID first came as an Internet standard lead by W3C and Microsoft. Here we won't go into details about the specs, but only want to give the narrative of what we think the best solution for **CID —— Crypto Identity**.\n\nCID is DID based on cryptography and smart contracts. The most important part about CID is the complete self-sovereignty of people.「**Not your key, not your identity**」is what we believe the spirit of CID, and the identity should be both simple and flexible, most importantly, secure.\n\n![Not your keys, not your identity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PP4JF20PKZ-EuMJ8yeR-K.png?height=834&width=2500)\n\nThrough CID, people can finally get full control of the assets, objects, reputations and all other valuable stuffs in the Metaverse. And of course, it's not necessary at all for CID being mapped to your identity in reality. In fact, everyone is free to get multiple CIDs in Metaverse, just like what we are doing now on the Internet.\n\n## Where is the Challenge\n\nKey management is the basis to CID. However, it is very hard to manage crypto keys for general people who can not even manage their passwords properly. It wasn't a serious problem for early adopters, but now we are talking about mass adoption in Metaverse, and we can't assume that people suddenly become experts in cryptography and deal with their keys better than they do with passwords.\n\nThe challenge is obvious for practitioners with vision and ambitions, so there are already many solutions trying to solve it. But it is always a problem to balance security, convenience and autonomy. After all, if the solution still require users to keep a secret of any kind, and doesn't have a ultimate way to recover assets when users forget their secret, users will lose their identity and everything depends on it in Metaverse.\n\n![We need passwordless](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IXffidSDxs1NRgWQHi7Ay.png?height=799&width=1280)\n\n## What is Special about UniPass\n\nUniPass solved this dilemma with an innovative approach. With UniPass, users don't need to know what is crypto key pair or mnemonic. The only skill they need is sending emails. Send an email to create account, and send another one to login a new device. If you have no active devices and need a recover, still you can send emails (maybe several emails from different addresses, and with a lockdown period of 48 hours). Email is the most popular protocol of the Internet, and now we make it works directly in Metaverse.\n\nBesides email, we make a lot of efforts to achieve the ultimate convenience and security for the daily usage. First, UniPass is a pure web application, so there is no need to install and apps on your mobile phone or plugins in your browser, which also leads to a fragmented experience. Then, to improve security of key management, we adopt wildly used web crypto infrastructures to create unextractable local keys. We can even use your Face-ID and Touch-ID to provide a hardware level secure environment through [WebAuhtn](https://webauthn.io/). What's more, we ensure that even if the email is compromised, user won't lose their account or assets, and can take action when unauthorized attempts take place.\n\nOf course, we have also considered the needs of current crypto users, who will be treated as senior users in UniPass. If you are confident to manage private keys by yourself, but still want the concise and unified experience of UniPass, you can either use your current crypto keys directly as the admin key of your UniPass account, or export mnemonics for backup at any time. We can support various providers of multiple blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, EOS, and more of them are on the way includes Polkadot, Near, Solana, Avalanche, etc.\n\n## Why is UniPass Non-custodial\n\nEmail does the magic, but is suspicious for a non-custodial solution. The answer is [DKIM](http://dkim.org/) (Domain Key Identified Mail), a protocol for anti-spam. For example, when you send an email with gmail, the mail server will generate a digital signature covers key properties of the mail, such as `from`, `to`, `subject`, `body`, and `time`. The public key of this signature is publicly available in the DNS record of gmail.com, and everyone can verify this key with one line of command.\n\nWith the help of DKIM, we can verify content of emails in smart contracts without trusting off-chain authorities, which means an **on-chain 2FA method** is available now. This is the first social recovery solution that is both non-custodial and practical.\n\n![How DKIM works](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jM3OgEc0iq2JsRd-9Ox3-.png?height=600&width=800)\n\n## What Can UniPass Provide\n\nAs a practical CID solution, UniPass offers everyone free and easy-to-use autonomy identities in Metaverse, which is exactly the same with what email has done for the Internet.\n\nFor users, UniPass gives them the ability to fully control their identities, along with everything related to them in Metaverse. For builders, UniPass opens the door of dApp diversity by smoothing out the user barrier, letting in more scenarios other than finance.\n\nTo make UniPass easier to understand, we have divided UniPass into four parts:\n\n### Crypto Key Manager\n\nKey management is the basis of everything for crypto users, and the great wall against mass adoption of dApps. What UniPass has presented is a non-custodial solution with a 'keyless' experience for users, and cross-platform integration package for builders. We believe that the best key manager shouldn't be perceived by users, and this is what we are trying to achieve.\n\n### Identity Verifier\n\nSometimes we want to keep anonymous in Metaverse, but there are still situations that you need to prove yourself a real person, or ownership of a twitter account, or even a certain experience in other applications. UniPass can provide **cryptographic verification** of your multi-chain address, your email and social accounts, or even your e-passport and driver license. This strong verifier can help you build a valuable CID in Metaverse, and also can help applications find high-value users to airdrop their incentives.\n\n### Application Connector\n\nCID is for users, but also for applications. With the identity verifier, application can bind themselves with official websites and twitter accounts. UniPass can connect CIDs by NFTs or Social Tokens, in a protocol that everything is public and decentralized on the blockchain. UniPass would also offer a universal SSO service, which can provide not only **passwordless** login experience, but also **asset-based or action-based access control** for Discord channels, Zoom meetings and forums.\n\n### Reputation Aggregator\n\nIdentity carries reputation. UniPass is open to integrate various reputation services based on CID, including avatars, points, badges, tags, covering every aspect of your identity in Metaverse. A good reputation can provide you a better chance for airdrops and extra privileges from dApps.\n\n\n---\n\n## About UniPass\n\nUniPass is multi-chain unified crypto identity, the carrier for the concept of 'people' in Metaverse. With UniPass's unique **Non-custodial Email-based Social Recovery** solution, you can take full control of your crypto identity with a **keyless** experience. You can also authenticate multi-chain addresses and even social accounts cryptographically, making your identity verifiable and more valuable.\n\n🔶 Come here for a pleasant chat👇\n\n🌈 *[Join UniPass Discord](https://discord.gg/XaRMFW85P)*\n\n🦉 *[Follow UniPass Twitter](https://twitter.com/UniPassID)*\n\n[https://twitter.com/UniPassID](https://twitter.com/UniPassID)\n\n🔶 To learn more, please visit the links below👇\n\n[Website](https://unipass.id/) | [Medium](https://medium.com/unipass) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZ4GOghuCdxBazZXc4M41g) | [Email us](mailto:contact@unipass.id)", "timestamp": 1634028968, "digest": "nlOChs4GpIMnCkb84SJFlYh1W7_ocdghkkIjOrwqLHE", "contributor": "0x1daF53275C07fa8e34B11BBa0a01EF94699ed2EF"}

的元宇宙愿景与布局》\\\n撰文：Chenglin Pua\\\n审核：于百程**\n\n![号称要转型成元宇宙公司的 Facebook 是如何在该领域布局的？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/19d1816c70c027e0cbfe76226f00e006.jpg-article)\n\nFacebook，总部位于美国加州圣马特奥县门洛帕克市的社交网络巨头。2021 年，Facebook 月度活跃用户已高达 29 亿人，是个不折不扣的社交王国。然而自从其市值来到了万亿美元之后，人们都在询问 Facebook 的未来增长点在哪里。Facebook 也给出了答案，即转型成为一家元宇宙公司。\n\n### 视元宇宙为下一增长点的 Facebook\n\nFacebook 的营收模式非常依赖在旗下平台投放的广告。为了未来的持续发展，Facebook 将其目光投向了元宇宙。Facebook 在元宇宙的布局始于 7 年前，在 2014 年以 20 亿美元收购了 Oculus 公司。\n\n![号称要转型成元宇宙公司的 Facebook 是如何在该领域布局的？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/883b8abe8f8b54a40bb01319e854cf02.jpg-article)*Facebook 不断增长的市值 来源：Satista*\n\n2020 年 6 月底，扎克伯格表示，Facebook 的未来规划远不止是社交媒体，而是筑造一个元宇宙。在 2021 年 7 月 29 日的 Q2 财报会议上，扎克伯格更是提及「元宇宙」20 次，可见其对这一新兴概念的重视程度。\n\n在该会议上，扎克伯格也给出了具体时间表，希望在未来用 5 年左右的时间，将 Facebook 转型为一家元宇宙公司。他表示，构建元宇宙是当前许多科技公司甚至是整个科技行业的愿景，可以把它看作是移动互联网后的一次变革，但这不是一家公司就能实现的事情。\n\nFacebook 的目标是连接世界上的每一个人，给他们「与任何人分享任何东西」所需要的工具。扎克伯格曾说：「我们真正的目标是建立社区，很多时候，推进技术的最好方法就是将其在社区中使用。」\n\n站在 Facebook 的角度，元宇宙是个更大的社交平台，相比于如今的社交模式，元宇宙能够带来更多，更好的社交体验。成为元宇宙的巨头符合 Facebook 的核心使命与价值观。元宇宙是个护城河极深的产业。前期投入大，后期别人难以复制撼动地位。以上原因都促使了 Facebook 将元宇宙视为其下一增长点。\n\n### 硬件的布局\n\n未来人们将通过 VR/AR 连接进入元宇宙，该技术解决把虚拟世界展示给我们的问题。Facebook 正在显著加速其 VR/AR 硬件的布局。2017 年，旗下 Oculus VR 部门的员工超过 1000 人，而其全球员工总数为 18770 人，该部门员工所占比例超过 5%。而到 2021 年初，这家社交网络雇佣了 58604 人，参与 VR/AR 研发者占员工总数近 20%。\n\nOculus 是 Facebook 的子公司。该部门主要的任务是研发生产虚拟现实设备。2012 年 7 月，Oculus 在加利福尼亚州尔湾创立。2012 年 4 月，Oculus 推出 Rift，一款专为视频游戏设计的虚拟现实设备，并于 8 月发起了 Kickstarter 活动，筹集了 240 万美元。\n\n2014 年 3 月，Facebook 以 20 亿美元的现金和股票收购了 Oculus。2015 年，Oculus 收购了专注于 3D 重建和混合现实的英国初创公司 Surreal Vision。2016 年 3 月 28 日，该公司发布了 Oculus Rift CV1，采用全新设计，融合了专门的 VR 显示器、定位音频和红外跟踪系统。\n\n2020 年 10 月，Oculus 发布了 Oculus Quest 2，售价 299 美元。该产品一经推出，就收获了许多的好评。除了其相对非常亲民的价格之外，软硬件的升级，顺畅的画质以及非常少的眩晕感都成为其卖点。许多 VR/AR 设备网站都将 Oculus Quest 2 列为如今 VR/AR 设备的第一名。\n\n![号称要转型成元宇宙公司的 Facebook 是如何在该领域布局的？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/36ed1328d5cdf06d274e9a298b34c9c7.jpg-article)*来源：PC GAMER 网站*\n\nFacebook 在 VR/AR 的默默耕耘也得到了回报。Facebook 在虚拟现实相关产业的收入都在持续增长，无论是硬件、软件还是游戏收入。Facebook 在 2020 年第四季度一共售出 140 万台 Oculus Quest 2 设备。按照其售价 300 美元计算，Oculus Quest 2 一共创造了 4.2 亿美元的收入。Facebook 在当季度一共创造了 281 亿美元的收入，Oculus Quest 2 约占 Facebook 当季度总收入的 1.5%。\n\n![号称要转型成元宇宙公司的 Facebook 是如何在该领域布局的？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/d1199d039d340372dbfaff16fea47434.jpg-article)*来源：Cantor Fitzgerald，单位：百万美元*\n\n![号称要转型成元宇宙公司的 Facebook 是如何在该领域布局的？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/626734deba2f784521501ed311de324e.jpg-article)*Facebook 收入，黑色为广告收入灰色为其他收入 来源：Facebook 提交给 SEC 的 10-K 资料*\n\n### 高资金的投入\n\n既然 Facebook 要转型成为元宇宙公司，Facebook 在这方面的投入不会少。2014 年，Facebook 以 20 亿美元收购了 Oculus 公司，布局 AR/VR 硬件。2017 年，Facebook 宣布将会在 10 年内再投资 30 亿美元 , 力图把 AR/VR 带向数以亿计的用户。\n\n2020 年初，Facebook 宣布从 2014 年到 2020 年年初，已经在 AR/VR 业务上投入了近 50 亿美元。\n\n在 2021 年 Q2 财报上，Facebook 透露未来将以每年 50 亿美元的规模持续投入建设元宇宙。2021 年 9 月 27 日，Facebook 宣布了一项 5000 万美元的基金，专注开发「元宇宙」平台。该基金的官方名称是 XR 项目和研究基金，公司表示将在两年内投资于「项目和外部研究」。\n\nFacebook 在元宇宙中的投入可以说是其他中小企业所望尘莫及的。而 Facebook 的高投入，也将导致未来元宇宙的生态中有 Facebook 的一席之地。但这也将延伸出一个问题，即元宇宙很有可能被某些巨头企业所垄断，毕竟巨头企业有资本以及资源来建设元宇宙。更何况 Facebook 已经下定决心转型成为一个元宇宙企业。\n\n### Facebook 打造元宇宙的规划\n\n扎克伯格曾在财报会议上透露些许 Facebook 对元宇宙的投资所做的规划。Facebook 将出售硬件，但这不是真正赚钱的地方。扎克伯格在财报电话会议上表示，Facebook 的目标是尽可能便宜地销售其设备，并专注于通过元宇宙本身的商业和广告赚钱。\n\n扎克伯格在财报电话会议上表示：「我们的商业模式不会主要围绕试图以高价出售设备或类似的东西，因为我们的使命是为尽可能多的人提供服务。因此，我们希望让我们所做的一切尽可能负担得起，以便尽可能多的人能够参与其中，然后在其中扩大数字经济的规模。」\n\nFacebook 将竭尽全力改进技术，提升用户的体验感。扎克伯格说只有当硬件能够为用户提供数字世界中的真实存在感时，人们加入元宇宙的意愿才会提高。广告仍将发挥作用，但 Facebook 也会专注于虚拟商品的销售。扎克伯格表示，元宇宙中的广告将是 Facebook 从元宇宙中获利的战略的「重要组成部分」，但他更看好数字世界的商业。\n\n许多人认为当今的一些电子游戏，如 Minecraft、Roblox 和 Fortnite 是早期版本的元宇宙。那些免费游戏通过向玩家出售虚拟商品来赚钱。扎克伯格在财报电话会议上暗示，Facebook 将复制这一策略，在自己的元宇宙中赚钱，从每笔交易中分一杯羹。\n\n扎克伯格认为数字商品和创作者将是巨大的盈利来源。元宇宙体验都将围绕能够体验现实世界所不能感受的体验。人们通过拥有独特的虚拟头像、数字服装、数字商品来体验现实世界所不能感受的体验，例如将自己打扮成超人，享受在空中翱翔的感觉。\n\n根据 Facebook 的官网显示，Facebook 将与政府、行业和学术界的专家合作，思考元宇宙中的问题和机遇。例如，元宇宙的成功取决于建立强大的跨服务互操作性，因此需要协调不同公司可以协同工作建设元宇宙。Facebook 也在以下几个领域耕耘：\n\n*   经济机遇：如何为人们提供更多选择、鼓励竞争并保持蓬勃发展的数字经济\n*   隐私：如何最大限度地减少使用的数据量，构建技术以实现隐私保护下数据的使用，并让人们对其数据具有透明度和控制权\n*   安全和诚信：如何确保人们的在线安全，并为他们提供工具以在他们看到不舒服的事情时采取行动或寻求帮助\n*   公平和包容：如何确保这些技术的设计具有包容性和可访问性\n\n除此之外，Facebook 也与其他组织合作，希望解决元宇宙的社会与技术挑战。Facebook 在美洲国家与当地组织合作，为学生、创作者和小企业主提供职业培训和技能发展。Facebook 也与非洲组织 Africa No Filter、Electric South 和 Imisi3D 合作，支持使用沉浸式技术的创作者。\n\nFacebook 与首尔国立大学和香港大学合作，专注于安全、道德和负责任设计的元宇宙研究。与新加坡国立大学法学院合作，探讨隐私和数据使用等其他主题。Facebook 与美国霍华德大学将进行 IT 多样性的历史以及它如何为元宇宙中的访问和经济机会提供信息的研究。\n\n### Facebook 的货币梦\n\n既然是构建一个世界，那么就少不了货币的参与运作。而元宇宙该使用哪个货币，恐怕是个非常争议的话题。而为了抢占先机，使其建设的元宇宙能够使用自己推出的货币，Facebook 早早布局相关货币的推出，Libra 就是其计划的一环。然而此计划屡屡碰壁，但 Facebook 如今仍然不放弃其「货币梦」。\n\nLibra 是 Facebook 提出的一种基于区块链的许可支付系统。2019 年 5 月，Facebook 确认布局加密货币。2019 年 6 月 18 日，该项目正式宣布名为 Libra。该计划在 2020 年发布，但只发布了基本的实验代码。\n\n该计划背后有个协会支撑，由各大公司组成。每个协会成员都需要首先注资 1000 万美元，用以支持 Libra 的价值。然而该计划始终得不到监管机构的批准。2019 年 7 月 15 日，Facebook 宣布在所有监管问题得到满足且 Libra 获得「适当批准」之前，不会推出该货币。\n\n全球多国央行、财政部长、立法人员，以及全球多家隐私保护机构都对 Libra 提出了质疑，并列出了与 Libra 有关的多个问题，包括洗钱、恐怖主义融资和影响金融稳定等。\n\n最终因监管上的阻扰，多家公司陆续退出该计划。2019 年 10 月，多家公司离开了 Libra 协会：PayPal 于 10 月 4 日离开，eBay、万事达卡、Stripe、Visa 和 Mercado Pago 于 10 月 11 日紧随其后，以及 Booking Holdings 也于 10 月 14 日离开。\n\n截止到 2020 年 2 月，该协会只剩下一些公司仍然参会。\n\n![号称要转型成元宇宙公司的 Facebook 是如何在该领域布局的？](https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/a8da884b5d42bb86035fec4f1c4a82cc.jpg-article)*Libra 协会成员（截止到 2021 年 9 月）*\n\n虽然屡屡碰壁，但 Facebook 仍然不放弃其「货币」的野心。2021 年 8 月 27 日，Facebook 透露将全力以赴希望在 2021 年底推出数字钱包「Novi」，帮助公司的 29 亿用户存储数字加密货币。而 Diem （换名后的 Libra）将在 Novi 之后推出。\n\n数字钱包「Novi」的推出也意味着 Facebook 未来几个月将直接参与规模高达 2 万亿美元的加密货币市场，而数十亿人可能会因此而首次接触数字货币。而目前，数字钱包这个市场仍然由 Coinbase 和 Gemini 等加密货币钱包运营商主导。\n\n除此之外，Facebook 也于 2021 年在区块链领域进行了首次收购。Chainspace 是一家专门从事智能合约的区块链初创企业，由伦敦大学学院的研究人员创立，这暗示着 Facebook 对支付市场的兴趣日益增加。Chainspace 背后的研究人员也在研究如何将区块链和去中心化应用于支付以外的领域，例如投票。\n\n纵然推出自己的货币路上荆棘不断，但 Facebook 仍然没有放弃其野心。监管层面是 Facebook 始终绕不开的障碍。纵使美国批准了，其他国家也会跟进继续批准吗？\n\n### 场外麻烦不断的 Facebook\n\n元宇宙被许多人称为「下一代互联网」。元宇宙能够将许多人连接在一起。作为平台，元宇宙势必会记录许多隐私数据。然而近期 Facebook 在隐私问题上可以说是麻烦不断。\n\n2021 年 10 月 4 日，一名 Facebook 前员工（Frances Haugen）在电视访问中公开身份指控 Facebook「把利益置于安全之上」。她称 Facebook 早知旗下产品在助长仇恨并伤害儿童心理健康，但为了利益却始终不闻不问。\n\n该前员工呼吁 Facebook 接受管制，她说：Facebook 一而再、再而三地展现出它选择利益胜于安全，它是用我们的安全来获利。现存的 Facebook 版本正撕裂我们的社会，在全球制造种族暴力。\n\n她此前匿名向《华尔街日报》和美国国会议员揭露文件，内容显示 Facebook 早就知道旗下产品对年轻女孩有害，例如社群网站 Instagram。文件中也揭露了 Facebook 的研究结果，Facebook 发现挑起人们的怒火比激发其他情绪更容易。Facebook 发现，如果改成较安全的算法，人们花在网站上的时间就会缩短，点击广告的次数减少，他们赚的钱也就比较少。\n\n在文件中也披露 2020 年美国总统大选期间，Facebook 意识到挑起怒气的内容恐有危险，于是改用较安全的系统，以降低风险。然而，选举一结束，他们又恢复原制，或改回原先的设定，把成长看得比安全重要。\n\n此一消息爆出，Facebook 股票下跌 5%，扎克伯格个人财富一天之内缩水 70 亿美元。Facebook 正在剑指「下一代互联网」；然而场外麻烦不断的 Facebook 是否值得人们相信，这需要时间来告诉我们答案了。\n\n免责声明：作为区块链信息平台，本站所发布文章仅代表作者个人观点，与链闻 ChainNews 立场无关。文章内的信息、意见等均仅供参考，并非作为或被视为实际投资建议。\n", "timestamp": 1634029464, "digest": "Mg95WZqjrmLH59stCJKDacrmKrjseQ8xAn2SsfwjGik",

Publishing like never before. \n (いつも通りに書きつつも、今までにない出版を) \n ※引用：[Mirror | Writing as usual. Publishing like never before](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard)\n\n　　 \n うむ、、これだとよく分からんですね。 \n ニュースサイトでは、次のように言われています。 \n 　　\n\n> Medium, but make it crypto. \n (Mediumだけど、仮想通貨で作られている) \n ※引用：[Mirror, DAOs, and the Exclusivity Problem](https://bit.ly/3iPC2Hb)\n\n　　 \n これだと、理解しやすい人も多いはず。\n\n[Medium](https://medium.com/)というブログ用のプラットフォームがあるのですが、クリプト系のスタートアップでは「定番のブログツール」となっています。\n\nしかしMediumは、言うまでもなく仮想通貨には対応していません。 Mediumを仮想通貨に対応させて、同時に「イケてる感じのサービス」に仕立て上げたのが、今回紹介する「Mirror.xyz」ですね。\n\n*※注意点：ネットでググると「[Mirror.finance](https://mirror.finance/)」という仮想通貨の情報が出てきます。これは「Mirror.xyz」とは別プロジェクトなので、要注意。名前が同じなので、混乱しやすいですね。 \n 　　*\n\n### □Mirror.xyzは、どういった問題を解決するのか？\n\n海外の記事から、下記のとおりに引用します。 \n 　　\n\n> ・Your content being deleted or moderated. \n ・A ban from a platform. \n ・Misinformation and conspiracy theories. \n ・Weaponized comments pointed at you. \n ※引用：[The First Decentralized Writing Platform That Pays Writers Is Here](https://bit.ly/3BxHqWu)\n\n　　 \n 下記のとおりに、翻訳しておきます。 \n 　　\n\n> ・記事が勝手に消される or 修正される \n ・プラットフォームからBANされる \n ・フェイクニュースや陰謀論が広まる \n ・著者に対する攻撃的なコメント\n\n　　 \n 上記のとおりで、ライター経験のある人なら、分かるはず。 \n 僕も過去に散々、下記のような経験をしました。 \n 　　\n\n* 大手メディアで執筆したのに、勝手に削除される\n* 有料noteがBANされて、いきなり売上が消える\n* メディアが情報を切り取り、悪意ある記事にする\n\n　　 \n 上記のとおり。ライターじゃなくても、分かりますかね。 \n こういった問題を解決していくのが、Mirror.xyzです。 \n 　　\n\n### □具体的には、どういった機能があるのか？\n\nMirror.xyzのサイトには、下記のガイドがあります。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KXskDctmgz6hx8_1-JeSx.jpeg?height=814&width=1200)\n\n上記の８つが機能なので、順番に解説します。\n\n**✓その①：Editor（＝編集機能）**\n\n記事を投稿したり、編集したりできます。 \n 実際に使うと分かりますが、WordPressに似ています。 \n 　　\n\n**✓その②：NFTs（＝NFT機能）**\n\n自分の記事を「NFT化」できます。収益を得ることができます。 \n 　　\n\n**✓その③：Crowdfunds（＝クラファン機能）**\n\nアイデアを公開して、事前に資金集めができます。ライティング × クラファンという感じですね。*※ここは期待大なので、メルマガ後半で深堀りします。 \n 　　*\n\n**✓その④：Auctions（＝オークション機能）**\n\n自分のNFTをオークション販売できます。 \n OpenSeaでも可能ですが、より「ライティングに特化」という感じですね。 \n 　　\n\n**✓その⑤：Splits（＝収益の分配）**\n\nコラボ記事を書くときに、自動的に収益分配を設定できます。\n\n例えば僕が「Aさん」に執筆を発注して、僕がマーケティングして売ったとします。その際の収益分配を「50% : 50%」に設定し、自動化できます。 \n 　　\n\n**✓その⑥：Editions（＝コレクション販売）**\n\nコレクションNFTを販売できます。 \n OpenSeaでも可能ですが、より「ライティングに特化」してる感じ。 \n 　　\n\n**✓その⑦：Entry Editions（＝記事コレクション）**\n\n記事をNFT化しつつ、同時に「コレクション化」できます。 \n 要するに、記事を複数セットにして「本にして売る」感じですかね。 \n 　　\n\n**✓その⑧：Token Race（＝コミュニティ投票）**\n\nコミュニティ向けにコインを発行して、そこで「投票」を実行できます。\n\n例えば僕が「仮想通貨の学習サイトを作ります」と宣言して、その後に「マナブコイン」を配布します。マナブコインを持っている人は、学習サイトの構築において、投票権（＝自分の意見を通す権利）を持ちます。\n\nなおマナブコインの所有者が「なんか飽きてきたし、、もう抜けるか」と思ったら、所有しているマナブコインを転売することも可能です。 \n *※もちろん、ちゃんと流動性があることが条件です。 \n 　　*\n\n### □創業者と資金調達について\n\nプロジェクトを考察するときは、社長が大切ですよね。 \n というわけで、Mirror.xyzの創業者の情報です。 \n 　　\n\n* 名称：Denis Nazarov\n* Twitterフォロワー：1.7万人（[@Iiterature](https://bit.ly/3FsUPS6)）\n* キャリア：元a16zパートナー、2017年には自社サービスをSpotifyに売却\n\n　　 \n 上記のとおり。言うまでもなくですが、超優秀ですね。 \n また資金調達の情報に関しては、下記のとおりです。 \n 　　\n\n> Union Square Ventures Values Crypto Publishing Tool Mirror at $100 Million \n (Union Squareベンチャーズは、1億ドルの評価額でMirrorに投資しました)\n\n> Union Square Ventures, an early backer of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, has invested in crypto publishing tool Mirror.xyz at a $100 million valuation, according to two people with direct knowledge of the funding.  \n (Union Squareベンチャーズは、コインベースに初期から投資していました。そして同社は、Mirror.xyzに新規で投資をしました。評価額は1億ドル。)\n\n> The one-year-old startup has raised at least $10 million across two recent seed financings from investors including USV and Andreessen Horowitz, the people said. \n (設立から1年のMirror.xyzは、Union Squareベンチャーズやアンドリーセンホロウィッツから、少なくとも1,000万ドルを調達しています。) \n ※引用：[Union Square Ventures Values Crypto Publishing Tool Mirror at $100 Million](https://bit.ly/3avQpeQ)\n\n　　 \n 上記のとおりで、要するに「めちゃくちゃ優秀」ですね。 \n 過去に事業売却もしているので、普通に億万長者かもですね。\n\nSpotifyに事業売却した際の「価格」もググってみたのですが、残念ながら「価格は非公開」でした。 \n ※参考：[Spotify acquired blockchain startup

その③：NFTジャーナリズム\n\n　　 \n 上記のとおりなので、順番に解説です。 \n 　　\n\n### □その①：NFT小説家\n\nまずは、僕が最も期待する未来です。\n\n[https://twitter.com/manabubannai/status/1447425252615544835](https://twitter.com/manabubannai/status/1447425252615544835)\n\n上記のとおり。 \n そしてこれは「Mirror.xyz」で実現済みです。 \n 　　\n\n> Emily Segal, for instance, who is a publisher on Mirror.xyz, launched a crowdfunding effort for her upcoming novel titled “Burn Alpha.” As of June 2021, Segal has been able to raise 25 ETH through her $NOVEL token, which calculates to about $64,000.  \n (エミリーセガルは、Burn Alphaという小説のためにクラファンをしました。クラファンはMirrorの上で実行され、合計で25ETHを調達。日本円だと約1,000万円。クラファンでは$NOVELというコインも発行されました。) \n ※引用：[Mirror.xyz Review](https://bit.ly/3iMHF92)\n\n　　 \n 上記のとおり。 \n これって、最高じゃないですかね。\n\n例えば好きな小説家がいたら、その人のクラファンを支援します。 \n 今までは「支援して、見返りに本が届く」というのが普通だったはず。\n\nしかし今後の未来では「クラファンで支援 → 著者のコインが貰える → そのコインが値上がりしたら、自分の資金が増える」という状況が起きます。\n\nもしくは、ただ小説の完成を待つだけじゃなく、自分から「積極的なプロモーション活動」もできます。 著者のコインを持ちながら、同時に「ガバナンスの実行」をします。要するに、次のような動きです。 \n 　　\n\n* 手順①：まずは著者の「コイン」を買って支援\n* 手順②：専用フォーラムにて、次の投稿をする\n* 手順③：投稿内容：プロモーション部隊を作りたい\n* 手順④：著者が「OKサイン」を出したら動き出す\n* 手順⑤：全員が自分の利益のために行動をしていく\n\n　　 \n 上記のとおり。 \n こういった動きを「DAO（=自律分散型組織）」と呼びます。\n\n最も巨大なDAOが「ビットコイン」ですね。 \n マイナーはビットコインに雇われていません。\n\nしかし自分の利益のために動きますよね。 \n この流れを、出版業界にも持ってくることができます。 \n 　　\n\n### □その②：NFT漫画家\n\n続いては、、、NFT漫画家です。 \n といっても、これは「NFT小説家」と似てますね。 \n 　　\n\n**✓マンガの著者は、自費出版したら良い**\n\n今の時代って、お客さんへのリーチが簡単になりました。 \n なので漫画家の人は、別に出版社を使わなくていいと思うんですよね。\n\n例えば「同人誌系のマンガ」とかを作るなら、相性が良いかもです。 \n 濃いコミュニティから資金を集め、そこから執筆に取り掛かるなど。効率と収益性が高まります。 \n 　　\n\n**✓NFT漫画なら、漫画村も防げる**\n\n以前に「漫画村」というサービスが問題になりました。 \n 漫画村を無料でネットにアップして、荒稼ぎしたサイトです。\n\n漫画村の問題点は「収益が全て、サイト運営者に入る点」です。 \n しかし漫画をNFT化することで、こういった問題を防げるはずです。\n\nマンガNFTを仮想通貨のウォレットに紐づけておき、そのウォレット所有者だけがマンガを読めるようにするなど。\n\nこういった仕組みを構築することで、より「シームレス」に、漫画家の作品を世界に届けることができるはずです。 \n *※シームレス＝摩擦を減らす＝中間マージンを減らす、という意味 \n 　　*\n\n### □その③：NFTジャーナリズム\n\n最後に、、NFTジャーナリズムです。 \n ここが実現したら、僕は最高に喜びます。 \n 　　\n\n**✓ルトガー・ブレグマンさんを知っていますか**\n\n皆さんは「[隷属なき道](https://amzn.to/2Yy6iPo)」という本を知っていますか？ \n これはオランダ人のジャーナリストが書いており、良質な本です。\n\n最近は「[Humankind 希望の歴史](https://amzn.to/3p59227)」という本も出して、これは世界的にバズっていました。僕も購入し、読み、最高に感動＆驚きがありました。 \n 　　\n\n**✓現状のジャーナリズムには問題がある**\n\nぜひ「ルトガー・ブレグマンさん」の本を読んでみて欲しいのですが、たぶん驚きがあるはず。なぜなら「恐ろしいほどの労力をかけて、１冊の本を執筆している」という点です。\n\nしかしこれって、リスクが高いと思いませんか？\n\n１年くらい準備をして、１冊の本を仕上げたとします。 \n しかし全く売れず、資金もなく、すると著者は苦しむことになります。 \n 　　\n\n**✓それでは「NFTジャーナリズム」を使うとどうなるか？**\n\n例えばですが、ルトガー・ブレグマンさんがクラファンをします。 \n 　　\n\n* 自分は○○のテーマで本を書きたい\n* しかし膨大なリサーチが必須なので、資金が必要\n* 資金援助してくれた人には、見返りにNFTを渡す\n\n　 \n 上記のとおり。 \n こうなったら、僕は速攻で支援しますね。\n\nNFT所有者としては、次のような選択肢が生まれます。 \n 　　\n\n* NFTを売って、本を手に入れる\n* NFTを売って、利益を手に入れる\n* NFTを所有して、コミュニティに貢献\n\n　　 \n 上記のイメージ。 \n これって、楽しくないですかね。\n\n現状の「出版業界」は非効率が多いので、改善されるべき。 \n 僕は「Mirror.xyz」が生み出す未来に、期待しています。 \n 　　\n\nというわけで、本日のメルマガは以上です。 \n 最後まで読んでいただきまして、ありがとうございます😌", "timestamp": 1634029747, "digest": "LEtJ7iYKNoDN5ZWL6MYlGqfsgzGX1y61Q61gmaZ9q48", "contributor":

{"id": "QJogxrjpWyi79oTogx9V5w1ZCTrSkq6tyiDRbfL5RUE", "title": "Why I Fast", "body": "***Motivations for and Learnings from Consuming 0 Calories for 168 hours***\n\nLast month, I completed my 3rd 7-day fast in the last 4 years. Just good ol’ water, tea, and a few magnesium tablets for 168 hours. I want to shed light on why anyone would want to do this voluntarily by sharing my experience, what I learned, and some tips for the curious.\n\n> *Before I get started, I want to disclaim that, as always, you should do your own research before throwing yourself into unknown territory. Certain people might not be fit to fast and should consult their doctor before doing so.*\n\nAfter I quit my job last December, I wanted to deliberately take time to learn about myself: explore new hobbies, routines and also push myself. I knew this would be a unique time to experiment and hopefully also set the foundation for new healthy habits. I’ve dabbled in fitness, breathwork, and mindfulness practices, meandered and pondered while strolling hundreds of kilometers around Berlin, but also experimented with my diet.\n\nRecently, I’ve caught myself eating less consciously and sometimes even to seemingly no end. Shortly after returning from a recent vacation, I left the house with my shopping bag to head to the grocery store. I was considering experimenting a few weeks with the intermittent fasting routine “One-Meal-A-Day” (it’s exactly what it sounds like) to challenge myself and eat more consciously. Somewhere on the way to the store, the thought “why not go all the way and fast completely?” entered my mind. So I took a quick 2hr detour listening to various podcasts on fasting, snatched a celebratory burrito, enjoyed every bite of it, and set my fasting timer to 168 hours. Expert preparation, I’m aware. I obviously never made it to the grocery store.\n\n## Why bother?\n\nFasting has been practiced for thousands of years, often for religious reasons, and with some mindfulness and health motivations thrown in as well. I noticed my main motivation was three-fold: regaining an appreciation for food, setting and completing a personal challenge, and experiencing health benefits.\n\n### Re-appreciating food\n\nI am aware I am speaking only for a subset of the global population, but many are living in an age of abundance, especially in regards to their diet. In large cities, food can be found at every corner, visiting (or ordering from) restaurants is an integral social experience and even supermarkets now deliver food to your apartment door in 10 minutes.\n\nNot only is food available everywhere and at all times, but I’ve observed it to be consumed at an increasing speed and quantity. Hastily shoveling down lunch in front of laptops or devouring a frozen pizza while watching Youtube is an everyday occurrence for many. I catch myself in these moments more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nIf only for a limited time, I wanted to break this cycle to purposefully restrict my access to food in order to dramatically increase my appreciation for the delight that is fresh food. Of course (sadly), after resuming a regular eating schedule, this appreciation quickly drops to nearly pre-fasting levels. Nevertheless, I’ve observed a permanent increase in my appreciation for food after every fast.\n\n![My food-appreciation-over-time chart™ across my previous fasts](https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1L9CGwN5hkVfQ8qiJfr444GPSKRL8tyre9/photos/sTarnVSqz-Tsq8w6p0aR2/ZdFJmiwsQYEoE1uRyPEKw-Why%20I%20Fast%20-%20Graphics2.png)\n\n### Personal challenge + feeling of accomplishment\n\nLike many of my friends and the people I draw inspiration from, I believe in continuously pushing my boundaries to experience myself and my capabilities more fully. I appreciate learning about how my body and mind function and enjoy the satisfaction of setting goals and accomplishing them, no matter how large or small.\n\nThe world is rich in opportunities and experiences and I find it increasingly dull to simply stick to tried methods at all times. Seemingly daunting challenges look astonishingly less daunting in hindsight. I derive confidence from realizing my body and mind are capable of much more than I would intuitively think. Fasting is therefore an opportunity to break out of set routines, embrace discomfort, and come out slightly stronger and resilient on the other side.\n\n### Health benefits\n\nThe research is still emerging, so I will not go into too much detail here. First studies promote the potential benefits of (intermittent) fasting towards heart health, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, learning & memory, as well as longevity (see [Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415001865), [American Journal of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7415631/), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01102-4)). Fascinating experiments in [worms](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/11/intermittent-fasting-may-be-center-of-increasing-lifespan/) and [mice](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/fasting-increases-health-lifespan-male-mice) have shown that their life expectancy could be increased by up to 28% simply through reducing their food intake and frequency!\n\nOn top of the potential long-term benefits, simply the idea of temporarily capping the intake of all ingredients entering my body to enable a “full reset” seems intuitive to me.\n\n![List of ingredients of an average \"bread\" in the US](https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1L9CGwN5hkVfQ8qiJfr444GPSKRL8tyre9/photos/sTarnVSqz-Tsq8w6p0aR2/G9NHi_8gPgGW2EJgyrLJk-ingredients2.jfif)\n\nWhile the details of the processes within our bodies during fasting are still unclear, one can observe all body functions slowing down, as organs – especially the gut and digestive tract – are permitted to rest and the body excretes built-up toxins through the skin and tongue. To top it off, our cells enter a state of autophagy, which cleans out dead cells and helps with rebuilding new ones. The thought alone of positively influencing my body at a cellular level motivates me.\n\n## What does it feel like?\n\nIn my experience, you can separate an extended fast roughly into three distinct segments: struggle, flow, and excitement. Even though the duration of these stages varied quite significantly during my different fasts, I experienced them each time.\n\n### Days 1-3: The struggle is oh so real 😔\n\nI don’t want to gloss over this: depending on the timing of your last meal, the struggle kicks in a few hours after your body does not receive the next meal at the expected time. It’s not fun. You’re cranky as you are on the lookout for a Snickers. You struggle to focus, feel light-headed or even have headaches (often stemming from caffeine withdrawal), your stomach is grumbling, and every ounce of motivation feels zapped out of you. You constantly question why you had such an unnecessary and stupid idea. You are thinking about food non-stop and realize how prevalent food is in our everyday lives: walking past restaurants, scrolling through social media, asking friends to convert lunch dates to walking dates – the list goes on.\n\nThis is the state most people who haven’t fasted before expect to last for the entire duration of the experience. Luckily, this is not the case (and I doubt many people would be fasting if it were).\n\n### Days 4-5: Entering the flow 🧘‍♂️\n\nIt seems en vogue to experiment with how to enter a flow state (whatever that even means) and everyone seems to have tricks up their sleeve that work for them. To me, a state of flow is one of little distraction, even for brief periods of time. There are probably easier methods to achieve this, but not taking in any calories for three to four days usually does the trick for me. ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nEspecially on my first two fasts, I felt a distinct change in my body chemistry around the halfway mark. Time seemed to be moving slower, my desire to eat virtually vanished, energy levels stabilized, and a certain pleasant emptiness entered my mind.\n\nOn my first fast, I remember journaling and planning with a relaxed clarity I had rarely experienced before. The second time around I was working full-time, busting out presentations and analyses into the night. This year, my struggle period lasted all the way into days 4 and 5 and I am not sure why. Maybe it was the brutal summer heat or not having any fasting partner by my side (in contrast to the first two times). Still, I experienced glimmers of a flow state, just not for extended periods as during the two previous fasts.\n\n### Days 6-7: Excitement and ambitious self-narratives 🙌\n\nHeading into the final days of the fasts, my mood once again switched from a relaxed, focused, and almost stoic state to one of sheer excitement and happiness. As the end is coming clearly into sight I know I’ll be crossing the finish line successfully. No temptation can bring me to falter at this moment. I even permit myself to consciously think about food and plan how I might break my fast. At the grocery store, I only pick out the freshest, most natural items and am amazed at and grateful for this abundance of food.\n\nAt this point, my appreciation for food is at an all-time high and I formulate (overly) ambitious goals to truly cherish every bite of food forever. Thoughts like “how could I ever forget this feeling and eat a nasty portion of soggy french fries” enter my mind only to be quickly rationalized by the other side of my brain half, telling me that these feelings too will pass.\n\n![Final boss challenge: Enjoying a 0 kcal brunch with my girlfriend's family on day 6](https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1L9CGwN5hkVfQ8qiJfr444GPSKRL8tyre9/photos/sTarnVSqz-Tsq8w6p0aR2/0XLpq3F7nhZH_3PSIqYBG-brunchfinal.png)\n\n### Add-on: Breaking the fast\n\nMost people are curious as to how to break such a fast. Do you crave a massive steak? Treat yourself to a huge bowl of pasta or a deep-dish pizza to make up for the lost carbs? In reality, your desires and needs at this point are much more humble: I broke each of my fasts with a bowl of self-made apple sauce (cooking and blending a few apples, a hint of cinnamon and lime – voilà). Trust me, after not eating for a week, this simple meal ignited a firework of tastes and aromas in my mouth and I enjoyed it in the smallest spoonfuls you can imagine (taking roughly 30 minutes to finish a bowl!).\n\nIt is important to slowly “wake up” your digestive system, so, for the first days post-fasting, I stuck to eating plenty of cooked veggies, nuts, berries, fresh juices and shied away from caffeine, lactose, meat, alcohol, and other tougher to digest ingredients. The joy, satisfaction, and amazement I was able to derive from each of those first meal celebrations are difficult to overstate.\n\n## What did I take away from this ordeal?\n\nThis post is already getting way longer than I expected, so here are some insights, learnings, and stats from my fasts in no particular order. Maybe one or two stick out to you or make you curious? Let me know!\n\n### 🔮 Takeaways\n\n* It truly sucks to go to bed hungry, yet this is the reality for over [700m people every day](http://www.fao.org/state-of-food-security-nutrition) (roughly the population of all of Europe). I am incredibly humbled by and grateful for the level of comfort in my life.\n* Whenever someone gets overly dramatic and hangry/cranky after not having eaten in 5 hours (it seems socially acceptable to act this way – see Snickers ads) I often think: \"you could literally go 30x as long without food and be completely fine!\" (of course I don't actually say this, because I don't want to be THAT guy)\n* A massive portion of our day and mental space is occupied by the procurement, preparation, and eating of food (ranking 3rd behind sleeping and working for most)\n* In my urban bubble, eating is an integral part of social structure. What do you do with friends if consumption of calories is not an option?\n\n### 🔥 Tips\n\n* find a buddy/support system: sharing the experience is a huge bonding moment and extremely motivating. At the very least, understanding and mindful friends help in getting you through those first days.\n* plan ahead: wane off of coffee a few days in advance, make sure you have no social commitments during struggle days, empty fridge and snack-cupboard to reduce temptations, eat light meals in the last 1-2 days leading up to the fast.\n* use an app: it helps to track your progress, stay motivated, and educate yourself. I used [Zero Fasting﻿](https://www.zerofasting.com/).\n\n  ### 📊 Stats\n* Water consumed: \\~4L/day (mainly sparkling water to supplement some important minerals, especially Sodium)\n* Weight loss: 6kg (mostly water), regained 4-5kg after 1 week\n* Daily hours slept: 10+ during nights and 2-3 hour naps on top in the first days\n* Mood: shaky\n\n![My final “mood curve” captured in the Zero app. I definitely struggled a bit more this time around!](https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1L9CGwN5hkVfQ8qiJfr444GPSKRL8tyre9/photos/sTarnVSqz-Tsq8w6p0aR2/XR_wyBTPjb4EYpesN9Hbu-mood%20graph.jpg)\n\n## So, where does this leave me? And you?\n\nThe first time I fasted had a massive and lasting impact on my perception and relationship to food. I still eat junk food or shovel down a meal mindlessly every now and then, but it happens much less frequently and I am aware of this afterwards. This in itself is a huge improvement in my life, which I am not sure I would have appreciated if I had never fasted. I believe an extended fast every so often (whenever external circumstances are opportune) will be a part of my life for the foreseeable future – refreshing my appreciation for food, continuing to challenge myself, and treating my body to a zero input reset.\n\nSo, are you going to stop eating?\n\n*Shout-out to my chief reviewer Livia for her comments and feedback! 🙏*", "timestamp": 1634030945, "digest": "aaIWQQiD_qjuvl5cHxKa0kzEdS0gu7igh57dOi9ozPs", "contributor": "0x3d9899E70003D5E4EeEcD6B931Ba9c62a83B8375"}

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IqyvQzoYZBTrkAkTnw_ST.png?height=311&width=566)\n\n**没有可怕的深度，就不会有美丽的水面。（尼采）**\n\n★\n\n孔子讲过一句话，他说“君子有三戒：少之时，血气未定，戒之在色；及其壮也，血气方刚，戒之在斗；及其老也，血气既衰，戒之在得“。\n\n我觉得很有意思，发推问粉丝“你要戒的是什么”？除了一些比较普遍的”我与赌毒势不两立“、”男人永远是少年，一直在戒色“外，有一位朋友提到”戒大盘“。\n\n其实，这是很有道理的。\n\n每天看盘，关注各类消息，心情上下浮动，极为紧张，极易亏钱。\n\n我此前每天更新行情，对于会看的人来讲有一些帮助，但是非常容易对新手造成误导，比如当天的K线偏多，那么，新手就会认为是一根大阳线拉到天上，中间不会有一点波动。而偏空，就认为马上要100X梭哈做空，死了算了。\n\n实际上，交易是一个非常系统的事，价格本身无法预测，制订交易计划才是交易者唯一能做的事。\n\n当然，最重要的是，心态容易在不断的交易中崩坏。巴菲特作为全球最著名也最成功的投资人，他提到自己”每天跳着踢踏舞去上班“，也就是他每天的心情都很轻松愉快，这话其实是蕴含着投资的哲理的：良好的心态是取得长期投资胜利的关键。\n\n所以如何保持好心态？不懂交易的最好是不做波段，懂交易的，想交易的最好是控制好仓位。这个度如何把握每个人不同，比如索罗斯百亿做空，晚上到点仍然正常睡觉，被人赞叹。\n\n而我们，最好是以自己能够不盯盘、不看盘睡得香为界限。\n\n最近我更新行情观点极少，TV上有多条催更的信息，但是实际上，从比特币突破43000时，我指出大暴涨或许已经开始起，后面一切都是正常的向上，而且真正的行情其实还没有来。\n\n真正的大牛市应该是BTC 20W，ETH 1W，其他小币种平均10X的，下图刻舟求剑，但深合我意：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/95RFx45ud9HxNpBleW_Sm.png?height=509&width=876)\n\n \n 今天的文章我讲几个方面内容：**一是**财经发的\"正在研究打击交易和挖矿的司法解释“怎么看；**二是**为什么说大牛市刚刚开始？**三是**牛市的板块轮动怎么把握？**四是**混币圈必备的技能。\n\n**一、量罪虚拟币交易？**\n\n《财经网》发布有关虚拟币文章，原文标题惊悚，[《量罪虚拟币交易：24家平台中止服务中国客户》](http://m.caijing.com.cn/article/233168)，内容也比较专业全面，那么，如何看待？\n\n首先，可以强调的是，从大的方向上把握的话，本人在9月底的文章[《炒币犯法、OTC消失，火币清退用户？不能买不能卖，还怎么玩？牛市还有！》](https://bihu.com/article/1479408299)已经足够详细、全面了，没看过的先看一下。\n\n说回《财经网》，它和我多次强调的《财新网》完全不是一个量级的，后者与高层接触密切，金融圈中无数重磅大料往往由财新一手发出，所谓“手眼通天”，但目前《财新网》对于虚拟货币并未有发新内容。\n\n而这个《财经网》是一家财经证券股票门户网站，如果相比《财新网》，我认为简直可以说是没有什么背景，而它的文章复刻了财新网的经典说法“据《财新网》接近监管人士透露”，但我可以武断地推论，财经和财新接触的层级完全不同，你懂的。\n\n文章整体看起来措辞严厉，但是实际上还是老调重弹，没有什么新意。唯一备受关切的一条是《财经网》称“多名接近监管的知情人士告诉《财经》记者，央行《通知》下发后，公检法机关正对虚拟货币交易所及“挖矿”等相关情况进行研究，探索定罪量刑的具体路径，后续预计会适时出台相关司法解释。”\n\n这个话的份量如何去看待？\n\n首先，在我上一篇文章中已经讲过了，立法层面规范、出台司法解释等是必然的动作，但是从研究到立法跨度还是比较长的——另外，所谓的研究如何界定，是开过落实金融委文件精神的会？还是已经明确了任务分工，大家在各司其职推进？不好界定。\n\n不过，投资这件事，其实不要太在意短期各种各样的消息。投资大佬段永平说，如果你把投资的眼光放长一些，比如10年，很多决定做起来就变得容易起来了。\n\n无论是谁的观点，你都要关注其时间维度是怎么样的，都要考虑大的背景是怎么样的，比如下面这个分析文章，肯定也是经过了大量研究和科学思考的：\n\n那么，现在回头来看，根据这个文章炒个短线有什么意义？\n\n我们现在要知道的就是2020年，美国一年印的钱就超过了历史上所印钱之和，这些钱最终会去哪里？股市、房产、实体还有币圈。\n\n作为个人投资者，根本不用太关心对自身的影响，唯一要关心的是分清楚什么是真正的机会，什么是真正的陷阱。\n\n另外一些新手最担心的是，下一步无法出入金会怎么样？两个思路，一是为什么非要出金？元宇宙来临，虚拟币就是元宇宙的法币。二是办法总会有的，“只要精神不滑坡，办法总比困难多”。\n\n投资最难的事,就是在最艰难的时候,在正确的方向上坚持。\n\n**二是大牛市刚刚开始？**\n\n我此前在BTC跌到30000时，强调现货要买入，甚至认为出现无法预料的意外，跌到22000，也不影响牛市继续，因为我从各方面的数据和事件都得出同样的结论：牛市还未来，牛市定会来！\n\n此前，网友问我，我总是懒得解释，毕竟我录制了那么多视频发在油管，去看一下就明白了，而且我也有可能是错的，没有必要讲太多。\n\n今天我简单列一些数据和指标给大家参考。\n\n当然，在此之前，我们要搞清楚两件事：\n\n一是为什么会涨，为什么会跌？我的答案最为本质，买的人比卖的人更多，就会涨。反之，卖的人比买的人多，就会跌。这一条恰好因为区块链的关系，我们很容易找到过去的数据，也能预测将来一段时间的数据。\n\n二是牛市的定义是什么？怎么涨，涨多少才算牛市？所谓牛市，一个简单粗暴的说法就是，在真正的月级别主升浪前面，前面所有的波动都成了一条直线，比如我们看一下BTC前两轮牛市图：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FbLeAqgaPezlXGgs8A_H7.png?height=364&width=880)\n\n（上图为2013年牛市走势）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g8ZDn_wBgf3_RLuWNQY73.png?height=593&width=863)\n\n（上图为2017年牛市走势）\n\n下面，我们再看看本轮牛市（假定还有牛市）那么，要把前面要拉成一条直线，应该是这样子的：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BcPyt7NakvRRJO3zVNK7d.png?height=366&width=874)\n\n \n \n\n有网友做了更好的刻舟求剑图：\n\n当然，你可能说，几根线一拉就说有大牛市？就20W？是不是疯了？当然不是。\n\n先看第一组指标，PI循环指数指示器，\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/756rR9YiwsWif1Rkghc4i.png?height=416&width=871)\n\n这个指标使用红色的111DMA均线和350DMAX2均线来指示见顶，2013年和2017年都挺准，而当前，离见顶还早着呢。\n\n再看200周热力平均线，使用红色小球表示见顶，前面两轮表现良好。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jv_fmBNxQ8-rDnoXBDAYT.png?height=433&width=894)\n\n而目前离见顶还早着呢，再看一组我认为更加好用的指标：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2yr13LS7q2jYPRi2us0j5.png?height=427&width=876)\n\n在这个图表中，不但用红色预测顶部，还用绿色来指明底部，无论是2018年熊市底部还是312暴跌，都给出了很准的判断，而牛市的依据是K线运行到红色线上方，现在还在2条线的中间位置，离暴力拉升还早。\n\n当然，还有比如PLANB的预测模式，直接给出准确时间，比如9月份43000（最后一天神奇拉升到达），10月份63000，11月份98000，12月份135000……\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6XTNdcgGEATzx8TnsHxGR.png?height=440&width=892)\n\n我经常讲价格无法预测，但就有这样的神人敢于预测，我也想知道答案——不过还好，我方法不同，但结论类似。\n\n上面都是预测模型，我们再看看链上数据。\n\n下图为312以来，交易所BTC余额，呈现持续减少的态势。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4gKlAKtYVAtsAx4zetPC3.png?height=480&width=907)\n\n而从519以来，严打之下，BTC仍然在30000附近撑住，其实是因为没有币可以卖了，如下图：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/58gGR6X5xKGq4COkTinNr.png?height=487&width=896)\n\n可以看到，流入交易所的BTC持续减少，并稳定在去年10月大涨前的水平。\n\n我们再看看什么人在卖比特币，持币在10-100个比特币地址的人（矿工和少数大佬）中，他们的持币数量是这样的走势：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y1qI3EUtjYXZ8FMMYdtjg.png?height=483&width=885)\n\n从2020年暴涨开始，一路卖卖卖，到现在已经快没有了。而100至1000的地址数量呢（这一部分大多为机构）？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3gJ25E9xBsu7xpTQOCd0e.png?height=471&width=891)\n\n我们可以看到，与小户的完全不同，总是在回调后呈现较大增长，这就是机构一直在买买买。\n\n不过1000至10000及以上比特币地址的因为全网数量也不多，1000个以上的地址2000多个，10000个以上的地址才100多个，他们也呈现出减少的趋势，这种级别的巨鲸没有办法，虽然数量极少，但是这个生态中的顶级掠食者，他们就像有无数的币可以卖——这也是我曾经有些悲观，决定一定要学习交易的原因之一。\n\n上面这些数据如果在ETH身上则更加令人乐观，首先是燃烧数据，总量达到51万个，燃烧的ETH价值百亿，而通胀现在已经达到2.2%左右，和比特币产出已经接近，并在可预见的将来，会低于比特币，并直至并成无限通缩模型。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HOHGZakLD2aU4GxZaeq5B.png?height=568&width=871)\n\n而ETH谁在买谁在卖？下图可见2020年牛市启动以来，流入量呈减少态势，\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YeZqhsuHvN1mDwWBZYZMe.png?height=470&width=901)\n\n而特别有意思的是，在100个以下及1000个以上ETH的帐户数量呈现减少，这些人在卖ETH，但是下面这张图是机构进场的最有力证据： \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/onRlm1_9VAyUztQo7nnUU.png?height=480&width=897)\n\n我们可以看到自312以来，持有10000个ETH以上的帐户直线增长，而与之相对应的是散户的帐户变化：从去年10月上涨起，持续卖出。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GokeRJLOAlL0ajx6TrV9i.png?height=487&width=896)\n\n一边是销毁，一边是大户吃进，那么，交易所还有谁在卖币？我们再看一张图：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/scSbd926Kaa6pH4ieNYNN.png?height=497&width=883)\n\n上图是交易所ETH余量图，从去年ETH 10月左右上涨起，余额不断减少——卖的人越来越少。\n\n现在你知道机构真的进场了，你也应该知道为什么各种利空就是下不去了，你也要明白下次如果真的还有”利空“你得做点什么。\n\n金融市场，本质就是买和卖，那么，当卖的人少了，买的人多了，生态壮大了，那还有什么好担心的？\n\n**三是牛市的板块轮动怎么把握？**\n\n2020年以来的牛市其实和2017年那一波不同，节奏完全不同，过去我们总觉得BTC太贵，不如买别的，但我们可以看到从去年这一波上涨起，拿着BTC和ETH的吃到几十倍涨幅，又稳又香。\n\n山寨呢，很可能是一轮过山车，在你还没有来得及好好感受的时候，你的纸面财富回到了原点，而且看起来还疲劳无力。\n\n其理由其实就在上面的第二部分，买方的目光在哪里，哪里才能涨，2020年以来， 这一轮牛市，各方面数据都已经表明是机构和大资金主导的，他们在进场。\n\n而且，随着ETF的必然通过，传统基金还会再次入场，这是我认为下一波拉升20W的重要资金，也就是ETF通过会是一个起飞的信号。\n\n结合上面这些数据，我认为板块轮动的大致节奏是：\n\n一是BTC和ETH的暴涨，其中BTC先行，ETH后发，尤其是当前ETH兑BTC的比率已经来到关键位置，排除掉BTC的ETF会先通过的优势，ETH在当前比BTC更值得期待。\n\n但是ETH的ETF还可以说是遥遥无期，而BTC的已经快了，所以，当前重仓BTC是一个较好的选择，如果是长线合约，如果是市价，除非是出现大回调后的进场，否则要么短线，要么就是低倍弄到永不爆仓的价位，币本位获得更多利润。\n\n二是主流币的暴发，当BTC每大前进一步，比如到达98000之类开始横盘，那么，资金肯定是争先恐后去各种热点主流，比如DOT\\\\FIL\\\\AXS\\\\UNI之类，注意，具体币种仅为随意举例，大意就是市值大、热度高、有丰富应用场景或者说有好故事的币，相比BTC有滞涨的。\n\n三是山寨小币的暴发，此处也不用纠结太具体的，也就是没有什么太多应用价值，你也不知道它能做啥的小币种。\n\n四是垃圾币猛拉，市场动不动出现千倍妖币之类——这是因为前面三类中赚到的热钱疯狂寻找”新机会“导致的。\n\n最后，泡沫破灭，新一轮财富分配完成……\n\n板块轮动想要全踩中，那是不可能的，也没有意义，但可以大致作为参考，也可以平均分配仓位，无脑死等。\n\n特别提一下DG，我此前卖掉DG换仓DYDX收益不错，但总体来看，换仓并不适合新手，除掉手续费等，DG近段时间也上涨了20%，总帐户地址才1200多个，没人买，稍微买一点就涨了上去……\n\n所以，换来换去，届时能不能换更多回来，这对于新手来说，答案大概率是换不回。\n\n持有DG不是说DG就有多NB，只是这个项目目前的情况类似于还没有开始，从价格上来讲肯定是低估了，类似于3U的DOT，等到大家都看到动静了，价格也就上去了。\n\n**四是混币圈必备的技能**\n\n我发现目前圈内还是很多朋友后知后觉，比如火币李林，他都选择不玩了，一些新手还在火币玩着，不急着提币，反正官方说12月31日前——但你就没有想过到时你确定每一分钱都没问题？\n\n另外，对于科学上网，也存在不会、不懂等各类问题，随便网上发个链接就注册，殊不知，科学上网工具的安全性非常重要，免费的代价很有可能不小——尤其是本文第一部分如果成真，隐私的保护也至关重要啊。\n\n我梳理了一下，大概存在的问题，写了一个教程供大家参考[《入群、币安、华为下APP、安全令》](http://rich123.top/home/index/news_detail?id=448&url=/)，甚本上是一个非常全面的教程了，以下为内容节选：\n\n**我的电报、TV、[微博](https://weibo.com/btcdayu888) 、[油管](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9FfxkQZGNRjjKxxhU4PSRw)

<https://www.astrill.com/a/1aybs3uewtgc>\n\n**有什么特点，多少钱？**这是大名鼎鼎的软件**astrill，**特点是功能强大，隐私性高，安全性好，我们在币圈的操作都涉及金钱，如果胡乱使用FQ工具可能导致财产损失，所以我建议长期扎根区块链世界的玩家应该选一款靠谱的。作为世界最强的FQ工具，其缺点是费用较高，**一年120U。**\n\n**觉得太贵怎么办？**我个人觉得很好，但如果你嫌贵，可以直接翻看本文底部加入电报的方式，在我的电报群中向网友们询问他们使用的各类工具，其中很多很便宜，但是要谨慎点击陌生人的链接——这个我没有办法帮你分辨，请自己小心鉴别。\n\n**华为手机怎么弄？**FQ之后，使用华为手机的朋友会仍然会发现安装不了很多APP，访问不了谷歌商店，其实可以在FQ之后访问[apkpure.com](http://apkpure.com/)  或者h[ttps://apkcombo.com/zh/](http://ttps//apkcombo.com/zh/)\n\n上面这两个网站都可以下载你想要的任何正版APP的安装文件，传输到手机安装即可。\n\n**免责声明：以上软件为公开地址分享，仅作为学习研究，下载后请于24小内删除。**\n\n **\\*注册币安福利\\***\n\n监管越来越严，为了资金安全，请注册币安（世界第一大所），**通过我链接注册，永久省20%交易手续费，全网最高。**\n\n**一、注册方法：**使用任意VPN翻墙工具，比如Astrill.com等，使用一些如台湾、瑞典的服务器登录（美国、中国、日本、新加坡、韩国等均被禁止使用），访问币安主站www.binance.com  (点击右上角english可切换中文)，注册时在邀请码一栏填入**RWIMTPK2**  填后会立即显示将获得20%手续费优惠，注册请用Google邮箱，国内邮箱已经不被支持，注册方法参照这个：[https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/180329217](http://https//zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/180329217)\n\n当然，即使不是为了币安，也必须弄一个Google帐号，无论使用世界第一的Chrome浏览器，访问youtube，甚至很多币圈应用，都可以用Google帐号一键登录，十分必要和好用。\n\n另外，注册后，为了安全，大家都应该绑定一个谷歌安全令，苹果手机可以用香港ID直接在商店下载，而安卓手机可以访问此前的2个网址，直接搜索下载谷歌安全令即可。\n\n**二、已有帐号怎么办？**3分钟重新注册即可。尤其没有手续费优惠的，访问<https://www.binance.com/zh-CN/my/risk/delete-account-appeal>   （此网址仍然需要翻墙工具）可以注销，注销前须将资产提走，小额资产比较多的可以一键全部换为BNB。\n\n另有**欧易交易所邀请码，同样省20%手续费，**注册时填上2018936491\n\n**三、入群获取宝贵行情资讯。**注册后私聊我，可以加入电报和QQ的核心交易群，会每天给出交易计划表（目前仍然免费公开至各社群及微博，万人交流大群可随时加入，为[https://t.me/dayu222）](https://t.me/dayu222)\n\n几乎每天会更新如下图交易计划，下图日期大家注意，是在阶段高点48000给出的惊人回调点位40888和2888，二天后即崩盘到达，同时给出了DYDX 10U买入计划，跟上的在数天之内获得翻倍收益，此外大家可以关注我在TV和微博上发出的8月30日抄底SHIB，认为是历史大底，之后10月6号起暴涨5倍。10月8日提示卖出一半锁定利润之后数小时猛跌30%。\n\n**四、如何随时访问最新的交易所网址或下载最新版APP？**\n\n可以翻墙后直接访问feixiaohao.com  搜索交易所名称即可找到最新下载地址。\n\nQQ群：543226356  （推荐电报，微信和QQ将逐步全面退出） \n **一、安装电报**\n\n电报安装有两种方式：\n\n第一种是安装第三方电报。比如币用、海螺等，这些软件都已经内置了第三方代理，用户只需要正常安装APP就能访问了，非常方便，大多数新手直接用这种，缺点是有时访问慢，而且功能较少。我个人不喜欢用这种。\n\n第二种是官方电报安装，我用的是这种。优点是简洁、省心、安全。但不足的是必须用到FQ工具，否则是无法注册和访问的，实际上以后混币圈梯子是必备的。\n\n**第一种方式，第三方电报进群**\n\n**直接点击“<https://0.plus/dayu222>”入群！第一次点击会提示你安装，第二次再点就可以入群了。**\n\n**个别同学出现的提示说只能双向聊天之类，这主要是对中国手机号码的限制，可以点此阅读“[教程](https://www.mosq.cn/post-585.html)”解决。**\n\n**注意，我同步开通了电报的广播频道，类似于微信禁言群，但比禁言群高级：一是可以回看我的所有重要信息，二是还可以对我的信息进行评论。**\n\n**进禁言频道链接：[0.puls/btcdayu2](http://0.puls/btcdayu2)**\n\n**第二种、FQ后进群（推荐）**\n\n如果你是高阶用户，想体验原版电报，可以参考如下教程：\n\n**首先，安装好FQ工具。**网上有很多免费工具，大家可以自行搜索，或进群之后询问其他网友。注意仅可用于学习研究，不得利用工具行任何违法违规之事。astrill，价格比较贵，一年大概1500左右，支付多设备、多平台，提供类似本地访问的速度以及最好的安全性。\n\n**其次，访问电报官网，下载需要的客户端，我一般习惯用WINDOWS电脑使用，手机版也可以同样下载。**\n\n<https://telegram.org/>\n\n特别值得说明的是，如果是国内手机可能访问不了谷歌应用商店，下载不了很多安卓应用，那可以用此神器直接下载你需要的任何安卓手机安装文件，可能也需要翻墙，很好用推荐收藏，比如有时候我们需要下载谷歌安全令也要用到这个网站：\n\n访问这个网址：<https://apkcombo.com/zh-cn/>\n\n然后输入telegram，搜索并下载APK安装包，通过微信发送到手机上，就可以用了。\n\n最后，翻译电报。 \n \n\n电报安装好之后是英文的，使用上多有不便，如果需要使用中文，则可以直接将下面链接复制到电报的聊天框——任何频道、任何人的聊天框均可，然后点击此链接即变换为纯中文：\n\ntg://setlanguage?lang=zhcncc\n\n如果无效，直接在搜索栏输入@zh_cn 按提示操作即可。\n\n官方电报进群，可以直接在浏览器打开以下网址，会自动切换到电报进群：\n\n[https://t.me/dayu222  （交流群）](https://t.me/dayu222)\n\n[https://t.me/BTCdayu2（禁言群）](https://t.me/BTCdayu999)\n\n[https://t.me/dayu999  （矿业群）](https://t.me/BTCdayu999)\n\n**使用体验**\n\n从目前的体验来看，电报真的很好用，支持20万人的大群（不用担心群消息杂乱，我可以设置大家的发言频率，比如10分钟甚至1小时，这样能确保大家都进行高质量的发言，反而不再会出现微信群中乱刷图片的现象。）\n\n其实逻辑很简单，以后无论你是要参与项目，还是交易或者获取资讯，大概率都需要懂得科学上网，这是必备的，但因为公约的关系，此处不讨论。\n\n大家要注意，其中注册币安时，国内邮箱已经没用，强烈推荐GOOGLE邮箱注册，因为我们最经常用的CHROME浏览器，YOUTUBE视频网站以及很多的项目都可以直接用GOOGLE帐号登录，非常方便，教程可以参考[“这里”](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/180329217)。\n\n如果GOOGLE帐号你实在搞不定，可以考虑MSN邮箱之类，链接<https://outlook.live.com/owa/>\n\n如果你想和我获得更多联系，加入电报的核心群，可以注册一下币安后私聊我，注意，通过我链接注册，手续费永久8折，长期来看会是一笔巨款。FQ后访问币安官网：binance.com 注册，注册时填入邀请码**RWIMTPK2**      即可，注意不要有空格。\n\n**OKEX欧易交易所邀请码，同样省20%手续费，注册时填上2018936491**\n\n**目前这两个已经是中心化交易所的首选了，注册后可以来电报联系我。**\n\n**推特、电报、油管、微博，我的ID均为:BTCdayu**\n\n历史精选\n\n[1.《我曾有三个死党，现在只有一个》](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hUuTKQfbW1Yr9P0ReIxy5Q)（2021/08/22更新）

Layer1 较差的性能和高昂的成本，2017-2018 年募资的很多项目都无法落地，更不提实现商业闭环；基础设施使用门槛太高、体验太差，导致区块链应用将大部分真实用户拒之门外门。可以说，底层 Layer1 的性能问题是导致行业两年低迷的重要原因。 随着 Layer1 中实力最强的项目纷纷上线主网，抑或做出重大更新，或许会给整个区块链行业带来转机。\n>\n> 区块链投资基金 D1

如何「啃」区块链最硬核的难题？\n\n面对解决 **区块链最硬核难题** ，我们横向对比了 Cosmos、Polkadot、以太坊 2.0 与 NEAR 在解决数据可获得性、最终性与跨分片通信的思路与方式。\n\n#### 数据可获得性\n\nCosmos 除了负责达成共识和确保网络安全外，各链还负责 **存储各自的数据** 。如果一条链重组，它与其他节点的重新同步可能会遇到问题。\n\nPolkadot 的分片或并行链，拥有负责存储每条并行链交易数据的 **校对者** （collators） 。渔民 （Fishermen） 负责搜寻一个交易中丢失的数据，具体方式是通过追溯历史和编纂来自校对者的数据，当出现问题时会提交一个欺诈证明。\n\n以太坊 2.0 使用一种 Reed-Solomon 擦除编码的设计，将一小片数据扩展为一个更长的「 **扩展片** 」；区块需要提交给该扩展数据的根，然后轻客户端以概率方式去检查，扩展数据的大部分是否可在该网络上获得。\n\n在 NEAR 协议中， 组块 （chunk） 生产者为每个组块创建一个 **擦除码** ，将该码的一小片发送给验证人，再创建一个 Merkle 树。该 Merkle 树的各树叶，会作为 onepart 消息发送给验证人。一旦收到所有信息，区块生产者会拿取数据的其余部分，重建该区块。\n\n#### 最终性\n\nCosmos 的拜占庭容错 Tendermint 共识为每个区块提供了即时的最终性 （finality） ，可容忍多达 **1/3 的恶意节点** 。在出现网络分裂的情况下，Cosmos 没有办法复原，因为区块生产者不知道应该在哪条链上继续构建区块。\n\nPolkadot 拥有一种混合共识模型，即 **GRANDPA** ，通过一个链增长系统和一个最终性小工具，它将区块生产与达成最终性两者分开。这种分拆使得在出现恶意交易时能 **实现回滚** 。\n\n以太坊 2.0 的初始设计依赖于 **Casper FFG** ，将之作为一种最终性的工具，并使用工作量证明 （PoW） 链进行区块生产。此后，Casper CBC 将引领向权益证明 （PoS） 的全面过渡。Casper CBC 使用区块接收到的最后消息的一个权重来替代分叉选择规则。\n\nNEAR uNightshade 共识采用 **Doomslug** 和一个最终性工具，在一轮通信后提供可行的最终性，在第二轮通信后提供完整的拜占庭容错最终性。与 Tendermint 或 Libra 的 Hotstuff 机制相比，其时延并未改善，但 **吞吐量翻倍** 。\n\n#### 跨分片通信\n\nCosmos 所有跨链通信都通过 IBC 协议。比特币和以太坊之类的概率链，无法直接进行交互，而必须通过「 **锚定区域** 」进行交互。跨链构建原生应用不是其设计目标。\n\nPolkadot 用户可以将一个跨并行链的交易提交给一个校对者，后者在出口处生成一个区块，从 **中继链** 获得一个最终性收据， 并将其呈现给另一条并行链。需要为这些交易建立一些标准通信协议。\n\n以太坊 2.0 还依靠 **跨分片的交易收据** 来防止跨分片的原子性故障。其通信协议依赖于一种「朋友的朋友」模式，即验证人可以通过相关联的分片来路由其消息。由 Vlad Zamfir 领导的这项研究仍处于理论阶段。\n\nNEAR **动态调整** 分片间的网络资源的平衡， 随机指派验证人负责不同的分片。它采用和以太坊、波卡 Polkadot 类似的收据交易结构，但将分片整合成组块 （chunk） ，后者再被编写进单条区块链，使得跨分片交易的成本降低。\n\n### 对去中心化协议而言，以太坊 2.0 是一次有风险的升级\n\n以太坊 1.0 已经是最大、最活跃的区块链生态系统之一，但其技术已经过时。以太坊 2.0 宣称将为以太坊提供互联网规模的技术基础，但要构建一条新的区块链已经很难，更别提要升级一条已拥有 **成千上万的用户** 和各种智能合约的区块链。随着以太坊 2.0 的浮出水面，存在以下一些担忧：\n\n#### 以太坊 2.0 更看重去中心化和可扩展性，而不是生态系统的可持续性\n\n从 PoW 共识转为 PoS 共识，似乎是围绕以太坊 2.0 的主要话题，但全新的分片设计才能将以太坊扩容为互联网级别的基础层区块链。以太坊 2.0 的研发尚未将重心放在为第三方开发者和项目而服务的 **生态系统的优化** 上。\n\n#### 以太坊 2.0 的设计受到 ETH 1.x 的掣肘\n\n尽管以太坊 2.0 集中了该领域最优秀的一些开发者，但其中很多人只是专注于将以太坊从 1.x 过渡到 ETH2.0。而其他新的区块链则没有历史转换成本或技术欠债。围绕 ETH1 的规范，尤其是围绕状态的零成本和各类 ERC20 代币，已经 **限制了研究者的选择** 。以太坊 2.0 还继承了 ETH 1.x 麻烦的费用市场。而且，对于现有的 ETH 1.x 智能合约而言，转换至以太坊 2.0 可能需要重写合约。\n\n#### 以太坊 2.0 将状态成本推至应用层\n\n作为第一代区块链，ETH 1.x 上的状态不收费，这也使其变得臃肿。在以太坊 2.0 中，每个分片围绕一个 Merkle 状态树形成共识 （在它们就分片交易达成一致之后） 。本质上说，核心协议中完全删除了存储和存储费用。提交的交易必须包括见证 （witnesses） ，后者是完成交易所需的所有状态的历史。以太坊 2.0 目前的设想是， **链下中继者** 将会存储状态，并因为向用户提供见证而获得报酬。在以太坊 2.0 中，有一个复杂的、链下的、未经测试的模型，来协商在中继者和提议者之间提供状态的具体费用。\n\n#### 存储和恢复状态将妨碍以太坊上的第三方开发\n\n以太坊关于普通人利用笔记本电脑即可成为验证人的构想，将状态存储的责任推给了 **DApp 开发者** 、用户或一个独立的中继市场。ETH 1.x 的开发者资源已被 Gas 优化策略所统治，与此类似，在以太坊 2.0 上构建项目也可能意味着需要优化状态恢复策略。以太坊的无状态客户端对小验证人而言是好事，但对 DApp 开发者而言，则意味着复杂性的增加。\n\n#### 跨分片通信会影响可组合性\n\n以太坊 2.0 中的静态分片为 DApp 带来了 **不平等的经济格局** 。容纳热门智能合约的分片将变得拥挤不堪，为了控制交易时间和成本，各个 DApp 将聚集在一起。例如，容纳 MakerDAO 的分片将服务于在该分片上构建的 DeFi DApp，DApp 领域的新军将面临不平等的经济格局。\n\n#### 以太坊的通胀政策不确定\n\n以太坊缺乏连贯的货币政策，随着网络转向 PoS， **质押和通胀回报** 将成为一个争议不断的治理话题。\n\n### 头号公链 DApp 开发生态光谱\n\n#### 跨链平台：Universe of Chains\n\n* 要求配置与定制\n* 拥有安全性、加密经济学和治理\n* 对于特别用例和传统企业有用\n* 近似于构建预置硬件\n\n#### DApp 链：World of DApps\n\n* 对开发者而言的标准化环境\n* 配置、现有安全性、治理和加密经济都较低档\n* 开发者可以利用许多工具和其它 DApp 提供的基础设施而构建产品\n* 近似于云端部署\n\n### NEAR 协议的扩容技术和可持续生态设计能为 DApp 经济赋能\n\n最近几年密码学和区块链研究都取得了丰硕的成果。尤其是权益证明和分片区块链。两种设计都经过了严格的理论和实际开发。在这种背景下，NEAR 团队推出了 **Nightshade 共识设计** 。它具有新颖的跨分片通信方法，可以实现互联网级别的规模、可组合性、可预计的 Gas 价格以及经济上高效的跨分片交易。\n\nNEAR 的 Nightshade 共识假定，某个交易会牵扯多个分片，不会对跨分片交易进行差异定价。相反，如果某些分片的使用量和大小超过其他分片，它将 **重新分片** 或重新平衡该网络。\n\n和任何区块链一样， **状态** 是 NEAR 最具价值的长期资源。为状态存储付费，对于确保任何一个区块链的安全，都是至关重要的。NEAR 协议没有将这笔费用转嫁给开发人员和用户，而是为 **链上存储** 提供激励，为开发人员提供了一个更易于部署的环境。\n\n### NEAR 的分片设计像单条区块链一样运作\n\n与以太坊不同， NEAR 协议是 **单条区块链** ，而各个分片植根于其上。像传统的区块链一样，每个区块都包含所有分片的所有交易，但是此数据并不存在于单个物理区块中；因此，每个节点不用存储所有数据。相反，验证人仅存储其特定分片的交易，而且该区块中所有交易的列表是物理的存储在该网络的各验证人的「 **chunk** 」中。这一模式可以在不牺牲高吞吐量的同时，确保 NEAR 不会在跨分片交易中出现双花。「chunk」设计和 **资源的不断重新分配** ，使 NEAR 可以实现更高效的跨分片通信。\n\n#### NEAR 中的验证人角色\n\nNEAR 是一种 **PoS 区块链** 。每个节点都需要质押 NEAR 代币，才能参与网络的奖励过程。该网络每个 epoch 时间跨度为数天，在每个 epoch 中 NEAR 随机指派节点扮演以下角色：\n\n* **区块生产者** ：下载被指定分片在前一个 epoch 结束时的所有状态，负责收集所指定分片的交易，并将这些变化写入状态中。\n* **Chunk 生产者** ：所有 chunk 生产者都是区块生产者，但区块生产者不一定要存储状态或交易数据 （只改变状态） 。Chunk 生产者存储其指定分片在整个 epoch 中所有的交易列表。\n* **分片验证人** ：负责验证某个特定分片的所有交易，并发布该分片状态的 Merkle 根。每个 epoch 之间验证人实现轮换和再平衡，以确保网络资源的平均分配。\n\n### NEAR 协议对所有分片一视同仁，可实现快速而高效的跨片通信\n\n#### 跨链通信\n\n交易信息必须快速发送到所有 **必要的节点** ，而且还必须确保不会发生恶意交易或双花交易。对于 NEAR 上的一个跨分片交易，上一个区块处理完之后，会生成一个带有需要与之交互的各分片的收据。在下一个区块中，chunk 生产者收集其负责的分片中的常规交易以及跨分片交易的交易收据。\n\n#### 争议与挑战\n\n鉴于 NEAR 协议中的状态未集中存储，该协议包括一个健壮的质询系统以确保有效性。该网络中任何维护一个分片状态的参与者，都可以通过简单地提交无效 chunk 的证明来挑战某一 chunk 的有效性。一旦出现某个无效交易， **该 chunk 将回滚** ，并且包含该 chunk 的任何区块都被视为无效。\n\n### NEAR 的加密经济为第三方开发者创建了一个可持续生态系统\n\n#### 费用\n\n**计算和带宽**\n\n采用一个常数关系，将 CPU 指令和带宽字节结合成一个 **交易费用** 。其定义如下：\n\nNEAR 在网络中实现分片之间资源的动态再平衡，使得各分片能保持 **稳定的费用结构** 。重要的是，NEAR 努力确保一个 **可预测的 Gas 价格** ，而不是低廉的 Gas 价格。如果前一个区块使用的 Gas 限额超过一半，那么 Gas 价格将小幅上涨。否则， Gas 价格将下降。一个区块一个区块的调整，使 Gas 费用市场保持平稳。\n\n**存储**\n\n区块链存储的成本高昂，比特币和以太坊都未能对此合理定价。 **状态需要持续的存储** ，但费用只是为一次交易而收取。\n\n在 NEAR 协议中，用户可以质押 NEAR 代币来 **租赁一部分状态** 。比如 10 MB 的状态存储 , 需要 1,049 NEAR 代币。一个智能合约或用户需要保持最低的质疑额门槛才能维持一个状态。\n\n除了质押给验证人的 NEAR 代币，这一模式还会造成 NEAR 代币的一些沉积。另外，这一结构为那些通过质押 NEAR 代币发行自己的代币的项目，创造了一个 **共生的融资机会** 。\n\n#### 奖励\n\n对网络参与者的奖励在每个 epoch 中进行分配，只要区块 /chunk 生产者和验证人各角色都被指定。新的网络通常需要对 **早期参与者** 予以激励，比如通过增发原生代币的方法来补贴交易。NEAR 的模式也允许验证人从增发中获得奖励，但条件是，只有在常规交易费达不到奖励门槛时才可以。其年通胀率目标是 **5%** 。\n\n其奖励结构按如下公式定义：\n\n#### 依据交易量和质押额而产生的网络通胀\n\n*NEAR 质押百分比，来源：D1 Ventures*\n\n### NEAR 在高可扩展性区块链矩阵中的定位\n\n#### 头部区块链都是如何支持生态发展？\n\n我们横向对比了 Cosmos、Polkadot、以太坊 2.0 与 NEAR 在品牌定位、拨款和生态系统筹资与协议层的资助层面各自的策略与方式。\n\n#### 品牌定位\n\nCosmos 瞄准多链未来，主打「 **主权** 」和「 **互操作性** 」。旗下也有多个不同但相关联的品牌，例如 Tendermint、ATOM、IBC 和 Cosmos。它拥有强大的狂热 **开发者军团** ，并吸引到大型机构 （如币安） 参与，但尚未吸引到足够的企业。\n\nPolkadot 出现时，正值区块链极度渴求扩容和互操作性。Polkadot 架构更注重 **可扩展性** ，但在其营销策略中依然强调一个多链的未来。 **Gavin Wood** 为其带来极高的信誉，但对于不了解其过往辉煌的新开发者而言，还需要新策略才能吸引他们。\n\n以太坊 2.0 本身就是一个品牌推广计划，打包了以太坊的多项升级计划，包括转向 PoS 共识和分片技术。不过这一品牌计划主要还是针对现有社区。除此之外，以太坊还在使用 Gavin Wood 在以太坊基金会时提出的「 **全球计算机** 」叙事。但这一品牌定位正逐渐细化到比如 DeFi 金融领域，通过互操作性满足细分市场的需求。\n\nNEAR 品牌简单明晰，这四个字母既是协议的名字，也是基金会和代币的名称。它具有很好的品牌识别度。对现有社区而 言，NEAR 以先进的分片技术而著称，但在区块链之外的营销中，NEAR 主打「 **开放式网络** 」 概念，并将自己与 TCP/IP 协议和亚马逊云 （AWS） 相提并论。\n\n#### 拨款和生态资助\n\n跨链基金会 (ICF) 2017 年 4 月募集到 1700 万美元，截止 2019 年 11 月其资金额达到 **1.04 亿美元** 。Cosmos 可能不太看重价值生态的融资，更青睐自由主义风格的融资策略，这与其安全和经济模式相吻合。2019 年其 63% 的资金来自于服务合同，27% 来自拨款 （Grants） ，10% 来自股权投资。\n\n2019 年 10 月，Web3 与 Polychain 宣布了一项金额为「 **数百万美元** 」 的 Polkadot 生态系统基金， 将会直接持有股权。对于支付 **公共基础设施** ， Polkadot 应该不会有什么财务压力，他们主要致力于吸引项目，其方式与 Block.One 和 EOS 类似。\n\n以太坊 2.0 的所有研究及其资助来自 **以太坊基金会** ，该基金会持有 0.6% 的资金。以太坊还有企业以太坊联盟 （Enterprise Ethereum Alliance） 、以太坊社区基金 （ Ethereum Community Fund） 、MolochDAO 和 Gitcoin 匹配拨款 （Grants） 。不过其重点是 **公共品** ，而不是用来吸引企业家。也没有股权。\n\nNEAR 问世早于其他三家，但只到近期才成立 Open Web Collective， **以帮助企业家融资** ，以及在 NEAR 上构建项目。其生态系统主要聚焦于开发者和提供技术支持。在创世区块时，NEAR 基金会控制了 47% 的 NEAR 代币。\n\n#### 协议层的资助\n\nCosmos 没有链上金库 （treasury） 。它采用 **代币投票** 的信号作为主要治理机制。这些信号不会在链上执行。像比特币一样，这些信号应该会由验证人执行。\n\nPolkadot 有 **链上金库** ，主要来自于交易费、罚金和质押无效。有一个详尽的治理流程来管理这些资金及其投放，不论是基础设施开发，还是市场营销和广告等活动。\n\n链上资助是以太坊社区中最有争议的议题之一， 似乎也不会变成现实。解决方案 （见上一项） 已经推出，但没有哪个方案证明要建一个资助协议的基金会。核心开发人员与更广泛的社区之间一直 **存在分歧** 。\n\nNEAR 引导每个 epoch 中 **10% 的奖励** 分配至一个链上协议金库，这样就可以在不影响通胀率的情况下资助开发。其长远目标，是由一个去中心化的治理流程来管理这些资金。\n\n### NEAR 的融资和代币分配\n\n#### 以往融资纪录\n\n#### 投资机构\n\n#### NEAR 代币分配详情\n\n* $0.32 (主网上线后锁定 1 年)\n* $0.29 (主网上线后锁定 2 年)\n* $0.25 (主网上线后锁定 3 年)\n\n*NEAR 代币分配占比，来源：D1 Ventures*\n\n### 结论\n\n自从「区块链」概念出现以来，研究者一直在尝试提出新的区块链设计，以实现可扩展的全球化网络吞吐量，且不牺牲去中心化，防止垄断形成。随着 Cosmos、Algorand、Blockstack、Solana 以及 Polkadot、NEAR 和以太坊 2.0 即将推出， **互联网级别的基础层区块链时代** 已经开始。问题怎样设计最好，哪条公链会最终胜出？\n\n五年前，分片仍是一个计算机科学问题，权益证明尚未经过完全测试，智能合约没甚用处…… 如今，虽然比特币仍是「 **主权** 」数字资产、最重要的区块链，但并不意味着新一代区块链要重走比特币的设计与精神之路。\n\n加密领域已经出现了 Web3、DeFi 寒武纪，也诞生了一些具备市场化潜力的产品。行业里的创业者们建立新产品和业务的想法更显外向。他们 **创新的灵感源泉** ， **不是比特币** ， **而是互联网** 。众所周知，互联网可以吸引众多的用户与企业家，为他们提供了帮助创新的底层基础。最终可能会有 2 至 3 条区块链，以更加去中心、用户至上的方式，重建互联网的全新体验。\n\n分片技术的进步表明，这或将是现在与未来 10–20 年扩展区块链的最佳选择。以太坊 2.0 与 NEAR 都在使用分片，两个团队互相学习。\n\n以太坊拥有 **强大的开发者社区** 、 **广泛的代币分配** ，对实施 2.0 必有促进。至少在未来二三年，如何实现以太坊 1.x 至 2.0 的过渡，将成为人们关注的重点。\n\nNEAR 分片设计与 ETH2.0 的不同之处在于， **优先考虑跨分片间的网络资源平衡** ，且 **不区别对待分片** 。NEAR 的 Nightshade 共识与「大区块」设计，使其可以充当单条区块链，以达成互联网级别的规模。\n\n比特币显示了区块链最初的希望，但是花了十年的时间研究和构思如何修复到互联网级别，NEAR 凭借功能齐全的权益证明分片区块链进入市场，且 **没有其他链曾经的负担** ，有助于 **吸引 新的非加密领域开发者** 。", "timestamp":

NEAR 区块链上的以太坊轻客户端\n\n轻客户端本质上是一个智能合约，可以跟踪给定区块链的状态并以去信任方式对其进行验证，而且无需进行大量的计算。举个例子，NEAR 区块链上的以太坊轻客户端可以在 NEAR 智能合约中跟踪以太坊区块链的状态，这意味着 NEAR 应用程序可以轻松访问和加密验证以太坊状态并读取一些数据信息，比如合约余额、交易历史记录等。同样地，以太坊区块链上的 NEAR 轻客户端在以太坊上跟踪 NEAR 区块链的状态，从而允许以太坊应用程序从 NEAR 状态中读取相关数据信息。\n\n每个轻客户端都通过中继链接到自己需要跟踪的区块链上，该中继链将新的区块头从区块链转发到轻客户端。然后，这些区块头可以用于在轻客户端中以极低的成本验证区块链的状态，从而使应用程序可以信任轻客户端所在的区块链状态副本。每个轻客户端还与一个 Prover 合约相结合，该合约可以验证客户端跟踪的区块链上某些特定事件或合约的执行结果。\n\n*图表 1：支持彩虹桥的轻客户端 (资料来源：[NEAR 博客](https://near.org/blog/eth-near-rainbow-bridge/))*\n\n如果要在区块链之间转移资产，用户首先要将把自己的资产存入资产所属区块链上的「更衣室」（locker）合约之中，「更衣室」合约严格禁止这些资产转移到另一区块链之后再用于本地区块链，从而防止诸如双重花费（double-spending）之类的攻击。接下来，用户可以通过另一条区块链上的铸造合约来铸造等值的包装资产，然后就可以在另一条区块链上自由交易和使用这些包装资产了。不仅如此，轻客户端会验证用户锁定在原始区块链链上的资产，从而确保原始资产与包装资产之间始终保持 1：1 锚定关系。\n\n下面我们来举一个更具体的例子，如果用户想把 10 枚 DAI 代币转移到 NEAR，他们首先将资产存入以太坊的 TokenLocker 合约中，然后使用 NEAR 上的 MintableFungibleToken 合约铸造 10 个 nDAI （NEAR 区块链上 DAI 的包装资产）。如果用户想要把这笔钱转回去，只需简单地在 MintableFungibleToken 合约上销毁 10 nDAI，接着从以太坊上的 TokenLocker 合约中解锁本地 DAI 代币即可。\n\n*图表 2. 彩虹桥上通过锁定和铸造进行 ERC-20 代币转移 (资料来源：[NEAR 博客](https://near.org/blog/eth-near-rainbow-bridge/))*\n\n如果你现在就想使用彩虹桥在以太坊和 NEAR 区块链之间转移资产，那么可以点击此 [链接](https://ethereum.bridgetonear.org/) 并参考 [指南](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbmnITYLE-M)，没有 NEAR 账户的以太坊用户可以在此 [链接](https://faucet.paras.id/) 申请一个账户。\n\n### 彩虹桥与其他桥接器有何不同 ?\n\n其他大多数跨链桥接器使用的是一种称为权威证明（Proof-of-Authority）的验证方案，该验证方法将区块验证分配给已知的授权验证器，并由这些验证器负责验证区块链状态。权威证明逐个中继并验证区块链状态之后，才允许铸造 / 解锁包装资产。这种验证方式的安全性取决于验证器的安全性，如果已知的验证程序行为不当或无法正确验证区块链状态，这些跨链桥接器将容易遭受双花攻击，甚至其他更严重的攻击。\n\nNEAR 彩虹桥使用轻客户端取代了权威证明模型，这种客户端可以有效验证区块链状态，完全不需要授权的验证器，这意味着互联的两个基础区块链链安全性与彩虹桥的安全性是一致的，而且整个系统都是去信任的，每个区块链的状态验证都是通过本地验证进行。用户可以轻松地在两个区块链之间转移资产，而不必担心是否该信任新的验证器和新的验证程序。彩虹桥实现了真正的去信任、安全的互操作性、有助于构建新一代去中心化联网区块链。\n\n### Bridge 有哪些用例？\n\n彩虹桥让用户可以更好地访问 NEAR 区块链和以太坊区块链中的最佳资源，现在，拥有大量以太坊资产的用户可以利用 NEAR 区块链的可扩展性和交易效率等优势。举个例子，NEAR 区块链的交易速度很快，交易时间大概只需要 1-2 秒，而以太坊则需要几分钟；而且 NEAR 区块链的交易费用也很低，每笔交易大约不到 0.01 美元，而以太坊区块链的交易费用平均值基本上可以达到 13 美元左右。\n\n对于 NEAR 生态系统来说，彩虹桥带来了以太坊上巨大的流动性。由于以太坊用户可以将自己的 ERC-20 资产用于 NEAR dApp，彩虹桥也吸引了新一代 DeFi 借贷协议、交易所、流动资金池的兴趣，因为他们现在可以全部托管在 NEAR 区块链上。此外，这些协议还可以利用 NEAR 区块链的可扩展性和高效率，为用户提供比以太坊区块链上同类产品更高的回报和更好的用户体验，毕竟目前以太坊缓慢的交易时间和昂贵的 gas 费用已经被社区诟病。坦率地说，对于日常用户来说，他们更看重协议是否可以提供干净的用户体验、以及是否可以给予具有市场竞争力的奖励机制，而不会太过关注底层区块链技术，这意味着在彩虹桥的加持下，主流对 NEAR 区块链的兴趣会大幅增加。实际上，用户已经开始在许多 NEAR dApp 上支付包装 ERC-20 资产了，比如：\n\n* 去中心化预测市场 Pulse，\n* 交换桥接代币自动化做市商 [Ref.Finance](https://app.ref.finance/) ，\n* 数字 NFT 卡交易平台 [Paras](https://paras.id/)。\n\n随着彩虹桥的发展，还会有更多潜在的用例，比如：\n\n* 扩展到其他区块链的资产转移（包括 Celo、Solana、Polkadot 等），\n* 支持更多不同类别的代币（包括 ERC-721 NFT），\n* 构建不限于任何一个特定区块链的全新多链 dApp 模型。\n\n### 最后的想法\n\n随着加密技术的范围和规模不断扩大，未来 DeFi 协议很可能会加速拓展到 NEAR 这样的新一代区块链上，与诸如以太坊区块链之类的前代产品相比，新一代区块链将提供更显着的性能改进和更广泛的功能。尤其是考虑到最近以太坊网络已经出现饱和状态，导致交易时间过于缓慢和交易费用不断上涨，许多 DeFi 协议已经开始寻求更好、更用户友好的解决方案来构建核心金融功能。\n\n毫无疑问，彩虹桥提供了一个极具前景的桥接模型，为加密社区带来了真正的去信任和免许可区块链互操作性。通过精心设计，彩虹桥较好地维护了基础区块链的安全性，不仅可以实现加密资产在不同区块链之间的无缝、安全转移，还能确保各个区块链之间的状态同步。通过解锁新的流动性渠道，势必会刺激更多用户参与，彩虹桥正在 NEAR 区块链上推动新一波 DeFi 协议浪潮。重要的是，NEAR 彩虹桥较好地解决了以太坊区块链的低效率问题，让加密社区用户可以使用更具成本效益、更用户友好的金融工具。", "timestamp": 1634032368, "digest": "46w0MB_UScXya0eRIfHj5nPh__3G0feAalySUz_IKtw", "contributor": "0x0078217E7a592Ef35DF7E570C8AD785fceDaa675"}

{"id": "uAWgGit4p1LGS6bx9WfNqqCu5UuXGh5DEMrwDeIg29w", "title": "三分钟了解 NEAR 生态 NFT 市场 Berry Cards 特色功能\n", "body": "Berry Cards 是社区成员在 Berryclub.io 使用像素创作的生成艺术品的 NFT 市场，该市场基于 NEAR 协议运行，NEAR 的高 TPS，低 Gas，高扩容性，使得社区成员可以低成本进行 DAO，投票，购买他们喜欢的 NFT 作品，然后在市场上再次出售这些卡片。除此之外，Berry Card 还具有许多与其他 NFT 市场不同的功能。\n\n### 动态定价\n\n首先，NFT 的所有者无法为他们的作品定价，此项工作是由 Berry Card （又称贝瑞卡、浆果卡）完成的。社区成员投票选出自己喜欢的艺术品，一件像素艺术品便首次获得价值。每个拥有 NEAR 钱包的人都可以登录 Berry Cards 并对他们喜欢的卡片进行投票。进入官网首页，网站将向用户显示两张随机卡片，用户可以点击选择他们最喜欢的卡片。之后他们选择的卡片的价值将增加 10％，而另一张卡的价值将下降 10％。这是为 NFT 创建公平价格的一种简单而优雅的方法，因为它反映了整个社区（而不是一个人）认为最有价值的东西。从字面意义上讲，这是「用钱包投票」。\n\n### 卡片 = 共享画板\n\nBerry Card 不是由一个人制作的，它可能是由一群人共同努力设计制作的。BerryClub.io 的用户可以通过使用聊天室来组织协调，在画板上进行分工协作，讨论做出哪些改动或进行哪些设计。这样的设计会激发团队意识和合作精神。这使 Berry Cards 更加特别，这意味着已有很多人来使用这块共享画板，并将进行无限地创作、涂鸦和挖矿。这也是为什么没有人能够为 Berry Card 设置价格的原因之一，因为 Berry Cards 是由社区驱动的，因此，让社区来设置价格更加公平。\n\n人们可以使用牛油果（在 NEAR 主网上运行的令牌）在 BerryClub.io 的画板上绘画涂鸦。撰写本文时，1 枚 NEAR 通证可以兑换 250 个牛油果。当您将牛油果使用（或种植）到绘画板时，您每天都可以赚取收益。\n\n### 无法从市场撤售\n\n与 OpenSea 这样的市场不同，用户无法将从市场上购买的 Berry 卡退市。相反，用户购买了 Berry Card 后，该卡会自动重新添加到市场中，但其价格会上涨以反映用户的购买。Berry Card 并不希望大家争夺卡片的所有权，而是参与社区的互动，并在这样做的同时让用户赚取部分利润。当您购买 Berry Card 时，大部分资金将归之前的所有者，尽管其中 10％的资金将归于艺术品 DAO，而 1％的佣金也将归给应用本身。艺术品 DAO 是 NEAR 生态系统的重要组成部分，这部分资金随后将被用于鼓励新的艺术家进入 Berry Cards 和其他使用 NEAR 网络的 NFT 市场。当卡片被购买后，其价值会增加 20%。所以如果有人想从您的手中购买这种卡片时，您就会获得一部分利润。\n\n为了体验一下这款应用，我买了一张 Berry Card，价格为 2.41N。这张卡以前有一个所有者，因此尽管 DAO 也获得了 10％的收入，但前一个所有者还是从中获得了大部分利润。之后该卡以 2.89N 的新价格被重新投入市场。如果有人从我这里购买该卡，那么我将获得 2.57N。这看似不是很多，但是拥有较昂贵的卡时，这些利润会大大增加，如果 NEAR 的价值增加，那么这些利润也会增加。\\*注–卡片的价格可能会因人们的投票而上升或下降。\n\n不能将 Berry Card 退市的另一个原因是，它们一直存在。即使您购买了卡片，Berry Club 上的人们仍然可以使用牛油果添加像素来编辑制作该卡片。将该卡撤出市场将对整个社区造成损害，这与该项目连接他人和团结社区的设计理念是相违背的。\n\n### 不被任何人拥有\n\n如果您探索 Berry Cards 市场，您会发现许多卡片都不归任何人所有。这些是由 Berry Club 创建的卡片，但尚未在 Berry Cards 市场上被任何人购买过。默认情况下，这些卡属于艺术品 DAO，因此，如果您购买它们，则 99％的利润将进入该 DAO 账户，这些资金将用于支持其他艺术家，而 1％的收入将用于应用佣金，该佣金用于保持 Berry Cards 的正常运营并保持合约获得资金注入。\n\n### 为什么要使用 Berry Cards？\n\nNFT、币圈和链圈粉丝被 BerryCard 深深吸引的原因有以下几点。首先，NEAR 良好的扩容性和便宜的 Gas 费使此类深度互动的项目（如 Berry Cards 和 Berry Club）得以存在。这两个项目都会激发用户的活跃度，鼓励用户和应用积极互动，这是以太坊目前无法做到的。这意味着人们可以放心使用 Berry Card，因为它对交易者和 Berry Club 的创作者始终是友好且高效的。了解这些项目在很长时间内都会是价格低廉和运行速度快的状态，会在很大程度上激发人们去探索它们，坚信这些项目未来是不会过时的。\n\n### 定价公平合理\n\nBerry Cards 的另一个优点是定价公平合理。如果快速浏览 OpenSea 和其他 NFT 市场，您会发现大量艺术品的价格都存在虚高现象。这主要是因为人们追逐 NFT 热点潮流，并将他们的售价定得非常高，希望新来者会为此买单，以便他们也能赚钱。但是，Berry Cards 通过动态定价其作品来防止这种情况的发生，Berry Cards 的用户可以在其中帮助设置每件作品的价格。这意味着所有内容都是由算法和数学原理定价的。它可能是我遇到的所有 NFT 市场中最公平的定价系统。\n\n使用 Berry Cards 的最后一个主要原因是它旨在支持 NFT 数字艺术社区。如上所述，购买任何卡所获得的收入的 10％都流向了艺术品 DAO （如果没有人拥有该卡，那么 99％的收入将流向 DAO）。艺术品 DAO 持有的资金随后被 NEAR 开发者用来投入到不断增长的 NFT 市场，并鼓励艺术家参与 NFT 的世界。因此，通过买卖 Berry Cards，您正在积极支持数字艺术社区。\n\n### 写在最后\n\nBerry Cards 是在 NEAR 上运行的众多创新 NFT 项目之一。通过允许人们买卖社区驱动的像素艺术，使用其资金来帮助艺术家，并通过用户参与来动态设置价格，它创建了一个支持艺术世界，鼓励合作并为其内容设定公平价格的项目。这是一个十分具有创新性的项目，向大家充分展示了 NEAR 协议的效率高和成本低等优势。", "timestamp": 1634032474, "digest": "QpDXaOwled_lmR-WyoRayOLAD6RVsmRupRCU7De00fI", "contributor": "0x80a9b20FED31513e06aD079685c02Fa1C4bDDB14"}

The products we are trading are still the same: stocks, gold, and derivatives, but the logic behind them is brand new.\n\nThe creation of synthetic assets introduces the liquidity of traditional financial instruments into the DeFi world. Anyone can issue a new synth and trade it on-chain, mirroring all traditional products using smart contract tech. It makes both real-world finance and decentralized finance more scalable and efficient. Here, we will take a look at several major synthetic assets platforms, compare & contrast their differences and introduce the Duet protocol，a brand new synthetic asset protocol with a hybrid mechanism of 「over-collateralization and algorithm-pegging」.

However, the general trading volume at BSC is smaller than Ethereum.\n\nThe charts below show distributions of synthetic asset minted volume on Synthetix and Linear.finance respectively with the crypto assets taking the absolute dominant proportion.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*woCNgZ9ZCI3b0mA1ipccVw.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*D0hPsroQPPv64llw8ens8A.png)\n\nMirror protocol only offers US stock assets for now, and we’ve seen a dramatic difference between its trading volume and TVL (low velocity).\n\nWe could speculate that the potential market for traditional finance traders does exist, and decentralized synthetic assets could ease some possible pains in the real world. However, they may not perform as high-frequency trading products when compared to the velocity of traditional crypto assets.\n\nThere should be a more tailored and complete logic for synthetic assets and their traders.\n\n## ***Synthetix (SNX):* Synths as long-positions and iSynths as short positions**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*OhNpN1Ow9_FEl6APulleSg.png)\n\n**Synthetix**\n\n* **Actors involved: Stakers**\n\nOnce you participate in the Synthetix system, you are playing the role of stakers, minters and trading counterparties all together, taking the risk of underwriting the overall debt of the system. This means that if users’ synthetic assets appreciate in value, your debt increases.\n\n* **Eligible Collaterals**\n\n*a) SNX (750%)*\n\nDeposit SNX and get sUSD to purchase other synths at the market price, with a trading fee, but earn SNX staking rewards and fee cuts.\n\n*b) ETH (150%)*\n\nDeposit ETH and borrow sUSD/sETH directly, do not receive trading fees or any rewards as they take no risk for the debt pool\n\n*c) renBTC (150%)*\n\nDeposit renBTC and borrow sUSD/sBTC directly, do not receive fees or any other rewards as they take no risk for the debt pool\n\n* **Current holders** (Ethereum Only) ***76,191***\n* **There is no order book, which means all trades are executed against the contract (P2C).** This provides infinite liquidity up to the total collateral in the system with zero slippage for permissionless on-chain trading with a fixed rate trading fee.However, all synth holders are counterparties of all synth trades, which exposes all users to the whole market fluctuation risk.\n* **Synthetix daily active users** at Ethereum sits at \\~**1,400** and the average number of transactions is **7,000**, with all-time unique active interactors over **190k**, which makes sense as one of the older protocols.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*SbgZpaJSERxzw6DTTi-wag.png)\n\n## **Mirror (MIR), which provides a short-position against the reflected asset’s price direction**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*YoyySvJ-AhiZQXtrgrstzA.png)\n\n**Mirror Protocol**\n\n* **Actors Involved**\n\n*a) Trader*\n\nBuying and selling between mAssets and UST\n\n*b) Minter*\n\nEnter into a collateralized debt position (CDP) via UST in order to obtain newly minted tokens of an mAsset\n\n*c) Liquidity Provider*\n\nAdd equal amounts of an mAsset and UST to the corresponding Terraswap pool, which increases liquidity for that market\n\n*d) Staker*\n\nStake either LP Tokens (with the Staking contract) or MIR tokens (with the Gov contract) in order to earn staking rewards in MIR tokens\n\n* **Eligible Collaterals (Collateralization ratio)**\n\n*a) UST (150%)*\n\n*b) mAsset (150%)*\n\n* **Current holders (Ethereum & Binance Smart Chain) *27,390***\n\nFor Mirror, the majority of active addresses are on Terra (Luna), which doesn’t have total holders available. The latest 24H transaction count on Terra is **24,462,** which is almost 100 times compared with tx count of the protocol on Ethereum, so the final total tokens holders should be way more than the current one we have here.\n\n* **Mirror launched a UST pool at PancakeSwap on Binance Smart Chain** (BSC) in Jan 2021, where total MIR pools locked value hold over\\*\\* $100M\\*\\*, even though the minting protocol hasn’t launched on BSC yet. It has over **26K** active users and over \\*\\*2M \\*\\*transactions totally up to date. MIR was listed on 4/19/2021 on Binance, which helped boost MIR traffic.\n* **Trades are processed via liquidity pools**, which reduces the individual roles’ risks for active players in the ecosystem, compared with Synthetix, but increases the capital needed to provide liquidity. The model enables Mirro to limitlessly track any different assets in the real-world with less risk to minters.\n\n## **Universal Market Access (UMA)**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*bxS5ghAPTgqrBTU6E3U5DA.png)\n\n**Universal Market Access**\n\n* **Actors Involved**\n\n*a) Token sponsors*\n\nUsers who lock up funds in a smart contract to back the value of minted synthetic tokens.\n\n*b) Liquidators*\n\nMonitor and liquidate undercollateralized positions.\n\n*c) Disputers*\n\nMonitor contracts using UMA’s priceless financial contracts to determine if a liquidation was valid or invalid.\n\n*d) Data Verification Mechanism (DVM)*\n\nIntroduces a simple economic security framework for evaluating oracles.

It seems that even though DeFi is getting great popularity, the majority of active contributors are still preferring major centralized exchanges.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*V1s1eGSQTEWiOsYJWK4zuA.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*FWzTJ7jRdllzgzOeMI5hWA.png)\n\nIn a nutshell, the current synthetic assset protocols are facing similar bottlenecks, such as limitation of active users, capital efficiency, collateral liquidation risk, asset price pegging, and a hard cap of synthetic assets, etc. Duet is determined to introduce an innovative methodology for more assets in the crypto field.\n\n## **What is Duet Protocol and why is it different?**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*-_3GLtDJA9HLzMo_)\n\nDuet is a synthetic asset protocol based on a hybrid mechanism: **over-collateralization and algo-pegged model** that enables on/off-ramp between traditional real assets(Flat Assets) and high-growth crypto assets(Sharp Assets).\n\nCompared with the current methods mentioned above, Duet delivers a unique design to optimize minting and trading.\n\n\\*\\*Openness and user-friendly：\\*\\*Compared to Binance or FTX CM equity methods, on-chain synthetic assets minting is easier and friendly for investors, having no entry barriers, procedures cost, or single spot risk.\n\n\\*\\*Multiple collateral positions: \\*\\*Synthetix and Linear adopt the single asset deposit with sharing debt method. Compared to them, Duet chooses multiple collaterals with separated CDPs, which reduces minters’ risk and raises scalability.\n\n\\*\\*Assets diversity and compatibility: \\*\\*Compared with MakerDAO’s DAI and Mirror’s UST, Duet accepts various types of synthetic assets and embraces wider ecosystems, and supports Ethereum, BSC, and other EVM compatible blockchains.\n\n\\*\\*Compatibility: \\*\\*Duet provides transferable dAssets which could be leveraged in other DeFi protocols, compared with a perpetual-ish protocol which only supports long or short positions.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*RijtkbPovKkHPoWf)\n\n## **What is Zerogoki and why is it an experimental synthetic asset protocol?**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*yOgpSwgrti86bk-g)\n\n**Zerogoki(zerogoki) is the experimental protocol from Duet Protocol, which only has the Lite-minting and algorithm-pegged module of Duet Protocol.** Zerogoki offers a playground for various assets and experimental mechanisms to face the test in a real trading environment.\n\nZerogoki, a transliteration of “零号機’’ in Japanese, stands for the experimental model Unit-00, and its token REI is the pronunciation of the word ‘zero’ (れい)” in Japanese. Zerogoki is a leveraged token minting platform deployed on Ethereum and based on an algorithmic pegging mechanism, which can provide users with leverage tools for traditional assets such as foreign exchange, gold, and bonds. Users can use the platform token REI to cast leverage tokens or use the protocol’s synthetic dollar-zUSD to buy leverage assets directly.\n\nLike Kusama(KSM) and Polkadot(DOT), **Zerogoki is open and running as an independent project. Zerogoki’s purpose is to undertake a certain stress test function of Duet**, and its risk and profit structure are significantly different due to the difference in mechanism design. The synthetic assets are generated only by destroying the protocol asset-REI, and the volatile leverage tokens are chosen as the listed assets to increase the system test pressure. At the same time, the slower Ethernet main net with high cost is used to test if Duet can run smoothly in a harsh environment.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0\\*sga6qz8SbrHDX_6z)\n\nREI and zUSD are mainly oriented to traditional investment target derivative assets, providing many original investment targets for the crypto market, such as: zUST 20L US 10-year Treasury bond futures 20 times more, zXAUUSD 10L gold spot 10 times more, and zEURUSD 20L EUR/USD 20 times more such derivatives. Duet is currently mainly for synthetic assets in US stocks. Zerogoki will continue to maintain and operate steadily. If the subsequent Duet’s synthetic asset module protocol upgrades, it will also be tested on the Zerogoki first.\n\n## **Summary**\n\nObviously, Mirror improves the collateral logic to be more retail user friendly and takes more aggressive approaches than Synthetix. Considering Binance listed MIR, launching mAssets’ UST pair at PancakeSwap may help Mirror to build a virtuous circulation between BSC and Binance.com and attract new DeFi users.\n\nAlso, oracles are core to all synthetic systems, and the accuracy of this information is critical since it determines whether a CDP has enough collateral assets locked up, or else a liquidation will be triggered. Mirror launched a UST pair at PancakeSwap to increase the liquidity of the assets, but this didn’t solve the bigger gap between AMM price and the real oracle price. For example mGOOGL, the price at PancakeSwap is 2319.33 UST, while the real oracle price correspondingly is 2289.44 UST, around a 1.3% difference, which suggests that this model still deserves more design improvements.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Tc9-NyL0Zb0aH1hq6oK-og.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Fh1jl1hSgKHeWI-FXtm1Cw.png)\n\nThe design of synthetic assets is getting more and more robust, and we believe user-tailored and cross-chain compatible logic will construct a more sustainable synthetic Defi world.\n\nZerogoki is an innovative version of Duet, supporting larger categories of financial assets including cryptocurrency, commodities, forex, bonds, stocks, and financial index. In a step further, Zerogoki will also provide novel financial derivatives which offer users more vehicles to mint or trade and more earning strategies for other participants of the projects.\n\n> \\* All numbers are updated at the time of writing (5/12/2021)", "timestamp": 1634032600, "digest": "xiuQYkDgtWwXmF8KVjMgClH22Syl-mAH44icWSQUxGw", "contributor": "0xF8FB3eA6D4Af20cCF7f461861c5D9FC21E090193"}

RPC 将以太坊交易打包进 NEAR 交易并将其发送给 Aurora 合约。\n4. 在协议级别，RPC 签名被验证，初始的以太坊交易被传递给 Aurora 引擎合约。\n5. Aurora 引擎合约解析以太坊交易并执行该交易，并在此过程中计算 EVM gas 的用量。在以太坊交易执行结束时，NEAR gas 会按照 NEAR 协议的规则被销毁，而 ETH gas 只是存在于 Aurora 合约内部的一个经计算得到的数字而已。\n6. **为了支付 NEAR gas 费，我们使用了 ETH。**Aurora 合约计算交易费并将其从用户账户那里转移至 RPC 账户。\n\n**从用户的角度看我们只是向 NEAR 协议支付了 ETH，不过实际上被用来支付 gas 费的是 NEAR 通证，RPC 节点在用户和 NEAR 区块链之间扮演着代理 / 中继者（relayer）的角色。**\n\n作为第一步，RPC 将能够提供 ETH gas 费来支付中继服务的费用。此外，用户可以基于多个 RPC 节点的响应，自行决定使用哪一个节点的服务。未来中继服务可能会采用和 OpenGSN 一样的架构。\n\n有关 ETH 作为基础通证的更多信息，可访问以下网址：\n\n<https://gov.near.org/t/evm-runtime-base-token/340/38>\n\n**路线图**\n\n除了对 Aurora 进行完善，NEAR 团队还为 Aurora 规划了以下里程碑：\n\n**2021 年夏：**\n\n* **未做任何妥协的以太坊兼容性。**目前有关 NEAR 协议的几个小的更新会被包含在下一次协议升级里面，目的是让 Aurora 实现和以太坊 1.0 100% 的兼容性。\n* **DAO 的组建。**我们认为推动 Aurora 这样的项目不断向前发展的唯一方式是实现一种真正去中心化的治理和可升级性方式。为此我们打算成立一个 DAO 来对 Aurora 进行治理。\n* **发布 DAO 通证（待定）**。一旦 DAO 成立，将会有一个关于创建 Aurora 通证的决策。我们会在今年夏天进行相关讨论。\n\n**2021 年秋**\n\n* **快速的通证转账。**由于以太坊区块链的种种局限（高交易费、缓慢的交易最终性，缺少 EIP-665），当前通过彩虹桥从 NEAR 向以太坊转账的速度非常缓慢：由 NEAR 向以太坊转账可能需要 16 个小时才能完成。我们计划为同质化通证转账解决这个问题。\n* **gas 费再分配。**NEAR 区块链为合约创建者盈利提供了一个便利的选项，为开源项目提供了一种可持续发展的模式。这就是把 30% 的 gas 费支付给合约创建者。我们计划也为 Aurora 添加这一功能。\n* **非区块链的用户体验。**NEAR 拥有一套先进的账户模型，即使是不熟悉加密货币钱包和其他软件的用户也可以和 NEAR 进行无缝交互。事实上，NEAR 可以为终端用户完全隐藏区块链的细节。我们计划为 Aurora 引入一套相似的逻辑。\n* **以 ERC-20 通证支付的 gas 费。**Aurora RPC 运行的方式让我们能够很自然地向用户提议使用任何 ERC-20 通证支付交易费。换句话说，用户可以使用 USDT 或 DAI 支付他们的交易费。\n\n**2022 年：**\n\n* 横向扩容。NEAR 协议的主要功能为分片和动态扩容的能力。我们的最终目标是通过为 Aurora 激活分片功能进而为以太坊生态交付分片这一功能，提前完成以太坊 2.0 的终极目标。\n\n**现在就来体验 Aurora**\n\n**凭借低成本、一流的交易最终性和扩容性，**Aurora 重新定义了以太坊生态的种种可能，同时也进一步拓展了 NEAR 生态，使之可以吸收和接纳基于 EVM 的应用。\n\n以太坊用户可以通过 Aurora 操作熟悉的应用，同时从 NEAR 的性能优势中获益。**由于 NEAR 的交易成本要比以太坊低几个数量级，Aurora 为用户和开发者，尤其是为刚进入这个生态的新手们消除了财务方面的准入壁垒。**\n\n**我们的目标是打造一个互操作的未来，弥合区块链、开发者、用户之间的差距。**Aurora 可提供无缝的用户体验，同时允许资产在以太坊和 NEAR 之间畅通无阻，让上述愿景成为现实。逐渐兴起的加密货币经济会促进创造者社区的发展，把区块链技术带入主流。\n\n**Aurora 和以太坊 1.0 是完全兼容的，其中既包括使用 ETH 支付的基础费用又包括智能合约的即开即用，和现有钱包和其他工具互操作的特性。**", "timestamp": 1634032734, "digest": "mY9s8VYkkp0TbAZyHVM0Y94rtZGqZQhLkNijhXWQZDc", "contributor": "0x11C6643dFE5C02F616Fb4B83BFcb72D730003b64"}
{"id": "I2EYxMRUynBbDymwUCrxubSRZRWBkEfLdX24foZtb00", "title": "三分钟了解 NEAR 生态 NFT 市场 Berry Cards 特色功能\n", "body": "Berry Cards 是社区成员在 Berryclub.io 使用像素创作的生成艺术品的 NFT 市场，该市场基于 NEAR 协议运行，NEAR 的高 TPS，低 Gas，高扩容性，使得社区成员可以低成本进行 DAO，投票，购买他们喜欢的 NFT 作品，然后在市场上再次出售这些卡片。除此之外，Berry Card 还具有许多与其他 NFT 市场不同的功能。\n\n### 动态定价\n\n首先，NFT 的所有者无法为他们的作品定价，此项工作是由 Berry Card （又称贝瑞卡、浆果卡）完成的。社区成员投票选出自己喜欢的艺术品，一件像素艺术品便首次获得价值。每个拥有 NEAR 钱包的人都可以登录 Berry Cards 并对他们喜欢的卡片进行投票。进入官网首页，网站将向用户显示两张随机卡片，用户可以点击选择他们最喜欢的卡片。之后他们选择的卡片的价值将增加 10％，而另一张卡的价值将下降 10％。这是为 NFT 创建公平价格的一种简单而优雅的方法，因为它反映了整个社区（而不是一个人）认为最有价值的东西。从字面意义上讲，这是「用钱包投票」。\n\n### 卡片 = 共享画板\n\nBerry Card 不是由一个人制作的，它可能是由一群人共同努力设计制作的。BerryClub.io 的用户可以通过使用聊天室来组织协调，在画板上进行分工协作，讨论做出哪些改动或进行哪些设计。这样的设计会激发团队意识和合作精神。这使 Berry Cards 更加特别，这意味着已有很多人来使用这块共享画板，并将进行无限地创作、涂鸦和挖矿。这也是为什么没有人能够为 Berry Card 设置价格的原因之一，因为 Berry Cards 是由社区驱动的，因此，让社区来设置价格更加公平。\n\n人们可以使用牛油果（在 NEAR 主网上运行的令牌）在 BerryClub.io 的画板上绘画涂鸦。撰写本文时，1 枚 NEAR 通证可以兑换 250 个牛油果。当您将牛油果使用（或种植）到绘画板时，您每天都可以赚取收益。\n\n### 无法从市场撤售\n\n与 OpenSea 这样的市场不同，用户无法将从市场上购买的 Berry 卡退市。相反，用户购买了 Berry Card 后，该卡会自动重新添加到市场中，但其价格会上涨以反映用户的购买。Berry Card 并不希望大家争夺卡片的所有权，而是参与社区的互动，并在这样做的同时让用户赚取部分利润。当您购买 Berry Card 时，大部分资金将归之前的所有者，尽管其中 10％的资金将归于艺术品 DAO，而 1％的佣金也将归给应用本身。艺术品 DAO 是 NEAR 生态系统的重要组成部分，这部分资金随后将被用于鼓励新的艺术家进入 Berry Cards 和其他使用 NEAR 网络的 NFT 市场。当卡片被购买后，其价值会增加 20%。所以如果有人想从您的手中购买这种卡片时，您就会获得一部分利润。\n\n为了体验一下这款应用，我买了一张 Berry Card，价格为 2.41N。这张卡以前有一个所有者，因此尽管 DAO 也获得了 10％的收入，但前一个所有者还是从中获得了大部分利润。之后该卡以 2.89N 的新价格被重新投入市场。如果有人从我这里购买该卡，那么我将获得 2.57N。这看似不是很多，但是拥有较昂贵的卡时，这些利润会大大增加，如果 NEAR 的价值增加，那么这些利润也会增加。\\*注–卡片的价格可能会因人们的投票而上升或下降。\n\n不能将 Berry Card 退市的另一个原因是，它们一直存在。即使您购买了卡片，Berry Club 上的人们仍然可以使用牛油果添加像素来编辑制作该卡片。将该卡撤出市场将对整个社区造成损害，这与该项目连接他人和团结社区的设计理念是相违背的。\n\n### 不被任何人拥有\n\n如果您探索 Berry Cards 市场，您会发现许多卡片都不归任何人所有。这些是由 Berry Club 创建的卡片，但尚未在 Berry Cards 市场上被任何人购买过。默认情况下，这些卡属于艺术品 DAO，因此，如果您购买它们，则 99％的利润将进入该 DAO 账户，这些资金将用于支持其他艺术家，而 1％的收入将用于应用佣金，该佣金用于保持 Berry Cards 的正常运营并保持合约获得资金注入。\n\n### 为什么要使用 Berry Cards？\n\nNFT、币圈和链圈粉丝被 BerryCard 深深吸引的原因有以下几点。首先，NEAR 良好的扩容性和便宜的 Gas 费使此类深度互动的项目（如 Berry Cards 和 Berry Club）得以存在。这两个项目都会激发用户的活跃度，鼓励用户和应用积极互动，这是以太坊目前无法做到的。这意味着人们可以放心使用 Berry Card，因为它对交易者和 Berry Club 的创作者始终是友好且高效的。了解这些项目在很长时间内都会是价格低廉和运行速度快的状态，会在很大程度上激发人们去探索它们，坚信这些项目未来是不会过时的。\n\n### 定价公平合理\n\nBerry Cards 的另一个优点是定价公平合理。如果快速浏览 OpenSea 和其他 NFT 市场，您会发现大量艺术品的价格都存在虚高现象。这主要是因为人们追逐 NFT 热点潮流，并将他们的售价定得非常高，希望新来者会为此买单，以便他们也能赚钱。但是，Berry Cards 通过动态定价其作品来防止这种情况的发生，Berry Cards 的用户可以在其中帮助设置每件作品的价格。这意味着所有内容都是由算法和数学原理定价的。它可能是我遇到的所有 NFT 市场中最公平的定价系统。\n\n使用 Berry Cards 的最后一个主要原因是它旨在支持 NFT 数字艺术社区。如上所述，购买任何卡所获得的收入的 10％都流向了艺术品 DAO （如果没有人拥有该卡，那么 99％的收入将流向 DAO）。艺术品 DAO 持有的资金随后被 NEAR 开发者用来投入到不断增长的 NFT 市场，并鼓励艺术家参与 NFT 的世界。因此，通过买卖 Berry Cards，您正在积极支持数字艺术社区。\n\n### 写在最后\n\nBerry Cards 是在 NEAR 上运行的众多创新 NFT 项目之一。通过允许人们买卖社区驱动的像素艺术，使用其资金来帮助艺术家，并通过用户参与来动态设置价格，它创建了一个支持艺术世界，鼓励合作并为其内容设定公平价格的项目。这是一个十分具有创新性的项目，向大家充分展示了 NEAR 协议的效率高和成本低等优势。", "timestamp": 1634032783, "digest": "1l0iaIHB8LtSf6J9kAsvgY2oHivR8aAztdYaFsTDx68", "contributor": "0x5d3e2FdB210a117b4f6f30F93b21e303AF5a8beD"}

{"id": "MOcZUNa48RCM4ucDK0z9bA62NUBCBRVrdi_ETPIBvRw", "title": "罗杰·弗莱:社会主义中的艺术", "body": "西德尼·韦伯问“什么是艺术？”他对这个问题的看法不会拘泥在一个答案上，或者至少坚持认为：艺术不应该与一个纪律严明、属性分明的国家有瓜葛。广义上的艺术家给所有的社会主义造成了重大麻烦。艺术家是一个天生的无政府主义者，或者更确切地说，是那种社会主义必须镇压或者清除的无政府主义者。其他无政府主义者是疯子、信教者和哲学家。所有这些人都基于不同的理由否认了社会赖以成立的伦理教条的至高无上地位——而最完整诠释了社会概念的社会主义必定会坚持这一伦理教条。所有这四种人都出于各自的理由坚持认为：有一些价值是高于伦理价值的——对他们来说，伦理只是社会机制的性质，其本身不是目的。\n\n疯子（包括大多数罪犯）认为自己的个人欲望和信仰是最重要的，由于我们没有办法与这种人达成共识，所以我们把他们关在精神病院和监狱里。\n\n信教者认为，爱上帝、爱人类或爱自己的灵魂的心态具有至高无上的价值，并且他们几乎总是愿意忍受无尽的灾难和难以言喻的残暴，只要他认为这样做可能有助于达到这些心态。\n\n哲学家——我指的是热爱真理的人——相信理解宇宙的特定方式具有极高的价值，以至于可以为此让自己和其他生灵做出任何牺牲。\n\n而艺术家也同样是顽固和难以管束的。他们寻求一种现实的图景——相对于这种现实来说，我们表面身处的生活只是一种混乱的、难以参悟的幻象。难怪疯子是唯一一类完全按照自己的信念行事并为自己的异端行为承受全部惩罚的人。\n\n除了疯子之外的三种人每人都有一套哄骗和劝诱的话术来欺骗他们自己和其他人，让所有人相信实践他们的信念对社会有益。但如果他们是诚实并且有见地的话，他们将不得不承认这些好处只是偶然产生的；好处的实现并不是提倡信念所带来的结果；就算没有这些好处，他们也会坚定地追求他们的目标。\n\n现在，任何完全意义上的社会主义都必须考虑到这些人。他们都是不同种类的顽固分子和不愿意签署社会契约的反社会主义者，我很怀疑用似是而非的笼统说法和含糊不清的同情和善意来掩盖上述事实会带来任何好处。可以想象，社会主义可能会一视同仁地对待所有顽固分子，把他们都关在一起或分开关在不同的监狱。然后它就可以一致愉快地开展对所有现存人类活动进行完美调控的工作。社会主义将否认精神生活，除非它是由纯粹的人际关系所滋养并表现出来的。\n\n我并不否认这种状态是令人羡慕的，甚至是幸福的，但是我们也不能否认它存在不人性这一缺点的事实。事实上，无论人们如何反对，都不能否认人类除了人际关系之外还有精神生活，而且是以强烈的意志坚守这种精神生活，人类通常宣称他对上帝的职责或对宇宙的好奇心或对美的热爱高于他对邻居的责任。更重要的是，他倾向于崇敬更好地彰显了精神生活的人，比起民族或国家的功臣，他对前一种人记得更久，也更热爱。所以，像耶稣基督、乔叟和莎士比亚对我们来说会比哈德良、亨利二世和伊丽莎白女王更亲近、更可爱。现在来假设一下，我们的社会主义认为它不能压制或消除这些顽固分子，而必须以某种方式容忍和接受他们，那么，它可能对他们做什么呢？\n\n在现代生活中，这个问题主要是一个经济问题。很显然，从社会主义的角度来看，这些拒绝签署社会契约的顽固分子有些蛮不讲理。他们要求从社会的共同成果中获益——他们要求获得食物和衣服，却不贡献自己的一份力量。他们有底气提出这种有点荒唐的要求，因为他们宁愿挨饿也不愿意放弃自己独特的非社会机能。他们极度地缺乏其他工作能力而只能表达他们内心的精神生活，这使得他们往往采取这种不可能主义者立场。\n\n我认为，相比起其他任何类型的社会来说，现在的社会主义更不容易让单个公民挨饿。此外，近乎这个社会主义国家的每个公民都有一些精神生活的流露，尽管这种流露可能还不足以严重到干扰他们的社会实践生活，但他们还是难以自抑地对那些精神生活更为丰富的人感到某种敬意，甚至是一种特别的敬意，尽管这可能使他们变得不合群。那么，社会主义将不得不在其边界内建立某种飞地，而顽固分子在其中可以得以生存；在这块飞地上，对社会个体关系进行关涉的严正法令将无法实施。基于这点，我猜想我们的社会主义对付真理爱好者轻而易举，这有两个原因：第一，他们的活动有非常丰富的成果，给社会带来了物质利益（例如所有的应用科学），他们可能——起码一致地——被视为对社会做出了完全等额的贡献。当然，这只是一种表象，因为任何使他们为物质利益而不是为抽象的真理而工作的企图，最终都会扼杀他们的全部活动，如果他们被当做国家的仆人，他们就会背负上持续的压力，这会迫使他们中止那些没有希望带来红利的——诸如形而上学和高等数学之类的——推想。\n\n真理爱好者容易对付的另一个原因是，对每个追求真理的人的才能进行评估是比较简单的事情，因为他掌握已证实的真理的能力是可以粗略地判定的（由考官来判定），这也可以近似地作为他发现新真理的能力的标志。我无法猜测我们的社会主义将如何处理宗教顽固分子，但我认为这种人很罕见。某些有组织的或有用的宗教可能会在国家机构中得到保留，而这可能会使宗教情感得到彻底的疏通和消解，以至于它很少会满溢到心灵圣洁的境界。而我认为，只有心灵圣洁才会拒绝向我们的社会妥协。\n\n至于艺术家，也许是所有这几种人中最难对付的一个，因为艺术家虽然罕见，但比圣人更常见，而且就连艺术家自己也难以对付。为了理解这个问题，我们必须更全面地考虑艺术在我们高度发达的商业和资本主义国家的地位和功能。我将在最广泛的意义上定义艺术，即对实用物件做超出其必备用途的任何工作，以及对没有实用功能的物件所做的任何工作。因此，我把建筑或铁器上的任何装饰品、壁纸图案、地毯、纺织品、绝对必需之外的服装、所有图片、所有广告的装饰、电影摄影术、所有戏剧创作和表演、所有音乐、所有没有直接实用目的的文学都包括在内。\n\n我们可以看到，在艺术这个范畴下，大量的工作耗费了社会大量的成本。\n\n现在让我们考虑一下，在我们的资本主义国家，这种巨大而昂贵的工作耗费是出于什么动机和目的。我相信有两个主要目的，一是游戏、消遣或娱乐，二是这样或那样的声望或广告。\n\n以戏剧“演出”为例：某些显而易见的白痴作品连续上演数千天并使得演员-剧团总监大赚一笔，但我们有多少次听到他为此而道歉？“嗯，你看，人们在城里辛苦工作了一天，晚饭后不想做任何艰难的思考或深刻的感受；他们想要完全的放松，这就是我们给他们的。”他还会拍拍胸脯说，他也为公众利益做了分内的贡献，并且认为没有理由不该为此获得非常丰厚的报酬。\n\n还是上面这个例子，一种不安的感觉不断涌现，认为一切都不够好，剧院里说不定还有比这更好的别的东西——可能是一些积极正面的，一些不仅仅是比詹金斯先生第二天的工作还要次要的东西——一些甚至是可能让他第二天稍微缺席的正当理由。（译注：目前无法求证作者说的詹金斯先生出自何处，但从描述来看詹金斯先生有点像是大卫格雷伯在《狗屁工作》里提到的一则老笑话中的人物：一个男人，他的工作是在马戏团表演完后清理大象的粪便，身上沾满那股气味，做什么都摆脱不掉。换了衣服，洗了头发，上下前后刷洗，还是臭气熏天，女人都敬而远之。他的一个老友终于问他：“为什么要这样糟蹋自己？明明还有其他那么多工作能做。”男人答道：“啥？要我放弃演艺事业！？”）\n\n发行商也说了同样的话：唯一值得经销的商品几乎都是那些以某种方式转移和放松的商品。“电影” ，是一种很好的超现代，一种直白的资本主义关怀，没有其他令人难忘的烦忧，没有任何顾虑，也不需要任何道歉。到目前为止，电影院还不打算做任何或幻想任何使电影爱好者抵触我们纯粹的社会感的事情。\n\n现在考虑下另一个动机的例子——我们可以把它称为在上流生活和专业阶层中的声望，或者是商业中的广告。几乎所有所谓的装饰艺术都属于这个范畴，我本来想说所有的建筑，但这可能范围太大了，不过至少大部分的建筑都是如此。我从一个在建筑师工作室做学徒的人那里听到了以下故事。他是一位著名的、受人尊敬的建筑师，一位因为一些小意外而错过了爵位的皇家学院的院士。他正在建造一个巨大的保险办公室；设计的细节已经接近完成，这时传来消息，最近的一次董事会会议决定必须在外墙增加价值一万英镑的装饰。不用说，这个决定得到了快速的执行，而且不需要对已经制定的方案做任何大量的修改。\n\n村民家客厅的花边窗帘，旅馆里的装饰性黄铜床架，医生诊室里昂贵的蚀刻画和水彩画，公爵夫人的钻石头饰，所有这些以及其他无数被生产、销售和购买的艺术品，都是为那些富有到可以购买它们的幸福的人们的声望或广告服务的，并且他们的声望和幸福感在那些只能忍受“实用性替代品”的人的艳羡中变得更加强烈。\n\n在美国，居民们难能可贵的天真给我们的社会生活带来了更大的活力，艺术的声望价值得到了相当明确的理解和坦诚的接受。海勒姆·S·邦德（Hiram S. Bounder）先生仅仅靠广告就在中西部赚了许多钱，现在他把注意力转向了比广告稍微困难一点的声望。也许他一开始就买下了一些公司的大部分股票，并将报价提高到了一个前所未闻的地步；但他的声望并没有很大提升。在华尔街，他可能会被认为是一股新的力量，但他的风声不会传到大人物的会客厅，而且他的数百名同行也可以使同样的手段。如果他是一个聪明人，那么他可以尝试成为一个公共慈善家，但在美国，赠礼被视为一种武器——只有那些被授权携带武器的人（实际上是骑士）才允许使用——他很可能会发现，所有真正有利可图的慈善的大门都会关闭。但是没有人能够阻止他买到 \"迄今为止市场上最好的凡·戴克的作品\"，没有人能够阻止他和经销商串通起来，以迄今为止凡·戴克成交作品价格的两倍购买它，而且在美国没有人会质疑它比以前的作品要好一倍。不管怎么说，这条新闻这次会在所有的会客厅传得沸沸扬扬，不管邦德/无赖先生（注：bounder有无赖之意，因此也可以叫他无赖先生）的个人魅力在以前是多么的不受赏识，每个人都不得不去参加他之后的聚会，以便看看知名老大师的作品。\n\n因此，在我看来，这些消遣和声望几乎是资本主义国家艺术成果的唯一源泉。我想我们可以有把握地说，为了满足这两种需求而生产的艺术都不可能是好的艺术，但我们在海勒姆·S·邦德先生购买画作的例子中看到，好的艺术一旦创造出来，就可能会衍生出声望价值，就像在寻找纯粹真理过程中的发现会带来巨大的经济价值一样。当然，还有一个艺术创作的动机——即作为一种精神需要的对艺术本身的热爱。然而，与出于消遣和声望的动机而进行的大量艺术交易相比，能够敏锐地感受到这种精神需要并为满足此需要而花钱的人群是如此之少，以至于从经济学的角度看是可以忽略不计的。然而，从艺术家的角度来看，这并不是可以忽略的事。\n\n到目前为止，我们已经从需求的角度考虑了资本主义国家中的艺术经济学。现在让我们考虑艺术创造者以及他如何适应资本主义国家。我认为可以把那些自称是艺术家的人分为三类——如其所是的糟糕艺术家，自命不凡或名不副实的糟糕艺术家（在法国有一个方便的称号，叫 “冒牌货”），以及真正的艺术家，一般来说，只有真正的艺术家才是这群人中的好艺术家。\n\n当然，如其所是的糟糕艺术家是一个纯粹的商人。他通常提供娱乐需求，而且他坦然地尽力满足它。这就是歌舞喜剧、通俗戏剧、通俗小说或杂志故事的作者，以及制造了我们九成图像数量的画家。作为一个商人，糟糕艺术家绝不会对当前的商业社会有任何反社会性。他没有普通商人的底线。我看不出他和社会主义相处有任何困难——我们的社会主义会接管和经营他的生意，打个比方，就像接管和经营廉价玩具的批量生产一样。他一如既往地为生计而工作，如果国家为他提供收入，他将会和他为私人工作时做得一样好。他将成为提供和控制娱乐活动的国家部门的成员。\n\n名不副实的糟糕艺术家的工作主要不是为了提供娱乐，而是为了声望。他通过炒作声望价值而立足，而真正的艺术需要一段时间沉淀才能产生声望价值。由于他的作品不是货真价实的艺术，他的作品只有在各种机缘下才能获得更快的声望价值；而且他总是依赖于这样一个现实：他在一定时间内被误认为是真正的艺术家。一旦他被发现（一般是在他死后不久），他的声望价值几乎立刻就消失了。\n\n真正的艺术家要靠两样东西来维持他非常不稳定的生存。(1)有机会靠足够的生活费生存——成为社会的寄生虫，或者(2)那一小撮真正热爱艺术的人的热情。这一小部分人（通常他们都不富有）所能支配的资金是如此有限，以至于我们可以称之为当代艺术作品的纯艺术价值远低于它们后来获得的声望价值。\n\n让我给你举一个这方面的例子。亨利·马蒂斯多年在温饱线挣扎。后来，他遇到了一个住在巴黎的美国家庭。这些人对艺术有着高度强烈的热情，虽然他们并不富裕，但他们设法买下了几乎所有的马蒂斯的作品（以低于其纯艺术价值的价格），让他继续创作。随着时间的推移，他的作品开始被认可，并且有了相当可观的声望价值，因此现在世界各地的大收藏家都在购买他的作品。\n\n然而，通常出现的情况是，一个正经的艺术家的作品直到他死后才会获得声望价值。我并不想说声望价值是严格遵照真正的艺术价值来衡量的，即使在很久以后。我曾见过霍普纳的肖像画，它不比一般的沙龙画好，却能卖到2万英镑。各种令人不安的影响，经销商故意引导的时尚，以及诸如此类的原因都导致了这个问题。人们可以大胆地说，在经过相当长的时间后，可能是几个世纪后，声望价值倾向于或多或少地与真正的艺术价值相对应，尽管前者总是大大超过后者。\n\n到目前为止，我们已经考虑了出现在我们现代资本主义国家的艺术生产。\n\n现在让我们试着更清楚地了解一下在某种形式的社会主义下会发生什么。首先，关于满足放松和娱乐需求的艺术。我认为，随着财富的分配更加均匀，以及在这种状态下可以预见到的更多的闲暇，对这类艺术产品的需求将大大增加。对于我所说的如其所是的糟糕艺术家来说，会有比以往更多的工作——更多的小说杂志，更多的糟糕小说，更多的通俗剧，更多的电影作品。\n\n另一方面，为广告和声望而创造的艺术将受到很大限制。首先，字面意义上的广告将大量消失；它会被限制为提供必要的信息。所有那些精心编制的用来劝诱某人某事的肥皂剧，以及竞争对手公司用类似的劝诱手段造成的持续扩大的影响，都会消失，同时大量消失的还有这种艺术的交易。声望可能会受到的影响较小，但它也会受到波及。首先，像财富和社会机会之类的会更加平等。并且，没有人可以通过任何努力来积累大量的个人财产，而这些财产的挥霍是产生声望的唯一渠道。此外，在我们的资本主义国家，声望也有货币价值。例如，海勒姆·S·邦德先生可以通过他女儿大好的婚姻前景来很好地收回他购买老大师画作的成本，但在社会主义下，将不会有声望价值的金钱变现。\n\n按照我们的理解，现代建筑几乎肯定会被淘汰；不是立马淘汰，因为装饰建筑的习惯会因社会惯性而延续，但当广告的动机消失后，就会有放弃装饰的趋势。对塞尔弗里奇百货来说，把商店建得像罗马宫殿一样是值得的，因为它会吸引坐在“沿着牛津街行驶的巴士”上的所有人的目光；但如果它是一家每个人别无选择必须前往的政府商店，一些机灵而诚实的政府部门负责肯定会想到，他可以把它建成只有墙壁、窗户和屋顶的东西来节省资金，而不需要做多余的事情，而且前去买东西的人一个都不会少。政府办事处可能仍然会有建筑，因为官员们仍想宣传他们职能的重要性，但这就是全部。\n\n所以，在我们的社会主义中，我们会看到名副其实的艺术的声望价值会大幅下降，为声望而创作的艺术会受到很大限制。从名副其实的艺术的角度来看，这肯定是一件好事。艺术的土壤将被清理干净，大量的杂质将会被清除。\n\n一方面，我们应该有更多的艺术创作用来消遣——由更多的，也许是更有才华的 “糟糕艺术家” 进行创作，以及少数的真正艺术家——让我们暂且假设他们继续存在。这两个群体之间的对比将是相当鲜明和清晰的，因为我们应该已经根除了名不副实的冒牌货艺术家这一中间阶层。以现在的情况来看，冒牌货是真正艺术家的最坏的敌人。他通过精妙的保护性伪装方法，从真正的艺术家那里窃取了应得的认可和荣誉，而他的交易本能使他能够把这些赃物变成极大的实际利益。\n\n我们现在切入到了关键问题本身，即真正的艺术家——那种唯一真正反社会的顽固分子。我一直认为，我们确实希望他存在。无论我们是多么好的社会主义者，我相信我们内心都有一个坚定的无政府主义内核，主张个人精神的满足是一种生命中最高的善，而我们中的许多人知道，在这一点上艺术家是必需的。我有时认为瓦格纳的理论是正确的（我想他的理论是基于叔本华的），即艺术是那些获得解放之人的最佳精神食粮，而宗教绝对永远是人类大众的首要精神慰藉。在任何情况下，尽管我很讨厌我们的资本主义文明，但我很难改变它，因为社会主义是建立在消灭真正的艺术家的基础上的。\n\n现在我们资本主义国家在这方面的一个明显优势就是对社会寄生虫的容忍。在美国，公众舆论强烈反对懒散而无害的寄生虫，艺术家几乎无法生存——实际上，他们被迫在巴黎和伦敦过他们的寄生生活，在那里他们可以逃避人们的注意。\n\n我们得承认，艺术创作的天赋落在数量相对有限的寄生虫身上的几率很小，但这种情况确实发生了，不过这种很小的几率给了我们希望——这种寄生虫可能永远只够勉强生存。\n\n在我们的社会主义国家，这种机会被抹杀了。那么，对于真正的艺术家来说，在这里还有什么希望呢？第一个主意是——也许他可以作为一个 “糟糕艺术家” 谋生，在提供消遣作品的掩护下进行真正的艺术家的工作。这是一个有吸引力的想法，勾起了我们的浪漫想象力。然而，我认为这本质上是错误的。在这方面，莎士比亚在不知不觉中给我们造成了严重的危害。众所周知，莎士比亚确实做着着糟糕艺术家的行当，但人们也认识到，他在背地里成为了几乎最伟大的优秀艺术家。然而，在提名他作为案例时，人们忽略了莎士比亚在这方面是一个非常特殊的存在的事实。设想一下，例如让福楼拜去做这种双重工作，你会立刻看到灾难。我宁愿要莎士比亚也不要福楼拜，但我也不赞成一个自动谋杀所有福楼拜的社会。不，我们可能每一千年才有一个莎士比亚，而且对任何一个世纪来说如果产生了两三个阿诺德·本涅特和赫伯特·乔治·威尔斯就是一件很幸运的事，但老实说这在我看来还不够好。\n\n当人们想到绘画艺术和雕塑时，情况要比文学更令人绝望。因为：典型的艺术，文学和绘画，具有双重诉求，一个是通过形式，另一个是通过题材。现在可以肯定的是，只有通过题材才能满足人们对消遣的需求。在文学作品中，艺术家在形式表达方面的尝试受到的内容干扰要比绘画更小。文学可以有许多附加的与美学无关的趣味而不会它的损害形式，这比具象艺术宽容得多。\n\n现在我们已经把我们的问题精简到它的终极核心：如何给真正的艺术家提供生计；并且承认我们的社会主义国家愿意这样做，社会主义国家如何能够区分真正的艺术家，鉴于它不希望支持一大群懒汉在艺术家的头衔下游手好闲无所事事。在这里，我更多地是在征求建议，而不是开出任何处方。\n\n有许多挑选真正的艺术家的方法可供考虑：由专家对候选人进行审查，通过彩票进行捐助，或由国家高级官员提供赞助（如任命桂冠诗人）。我们曾建议通过审查来发现真理追求者，但我们对以同样的方法去寻找艺术家感到极度恐惧。什么都好过一个由官僚或行业专家组成的委员会。我宁可希望有一个彩票，它会很好地效仿资本主义的遗产继承，成为一种反复无常的恩赐。鉴于委员会会以无懈可击的确定性筛选并拒绝每一个真正的艺术家（这真的是毫不夸张），也许会有千分之一的运气让一个人通过。但我希望有一些更自动和机械的测试。以下这些做法可行吗？比如说，让艺术家经历一段非常贫穷的时光，或者真正的社会人会思虑的诸如：微薄的生活费，以及在他一生中完全不可能获得的——生产工人或官僚可能渴望的——荣誉或社会地位。在我看来，我们可以在艺术家的反社会飞地周围围上一些带刺的铁丝围栏，它会淘汰掉除了最坚定者之外的所有人。这至少是一种对我们现在的商业主义环境的刻意模仿，鉴于大家都公认商业主义使得真正的艺术家有了可以生存的可能性。有一点肯定的是：任何官僚、官方或行政机构都无权决定何种艺术才是有价值的。如果没有这样的限制性条款，没有比人身保护法更严格、更强制的法规，艺术在我们的社会主义国家就没有希望。\n\n我清楚地知道，我并没有解决我所提出的问题——也许应该由你们这一代人在实践中解决这个问题——我所希望做的是清除一些与艺术有关的误解，而这些误解源于我们对精神价值的极度漠视，源于我们草率的思维习惯，源于草率思维习惯导致的语言贫乏和混乱。\n\n*原文载自伯灵顿杂志，1916年4月*", "timestamp": 1634033035, "digest": "yieJGrExxCatIglJHLoAhsdk4PSzMljQBVyGwUqNHZM", "contributor": "0x572344161Ab937c2cd6cC479B4a46D52Df49B785"}

Bounder）先生仅仅靠广告就在中西部赚了许多钱，现在他把注意力转向了比广告稍微困难一点的声望。也许他一开始就买下了一些公司的大部分股票，并将报价提高到了一个前所未闻的地步；但他的声望并没有很大提升。在华尔街，他可能会被认为是一股新的力量，但他的风声不会传到大人物的会客厅，而且他的数百名同行也可以使同样的手段。如果他是一个聪明人，那么他可以尝试成为一个公共慈善家，但在美国，赠礼被视为一种武器——只有那些被授权携带武器的人（实际上是骑士）才允许使用——他很可能会发现，所有真正有利可图的慈善的大门都会关闭。但是没有人能够阻止他买到 \"迄今为止市场上最好的凡·戴克的作品\"，没有人能够阻止他和经销商串通起来，以迄今为止凡·戴克成交作品价格的两倍购买它，而且在美国没有人会质疑它比以前的作品要好一倍。不管怎么说，这条新闻这次会在所有的会客厅传得沸沸扬扬，不管邦德/无赖先生（注：bounder有无赖之意，因此也可以叫他无赖先生）的个人魅力在以前是多么的不受赏识，每个人都不得不去参加他之后的聚会，以便看看知名老大师的作品。\n\n因此，在我看来，这些消遣和声望几乎是资本主义国家艺术成果的唯一源泉。我想我们可以有把握地说，为了满足这两种需求而生产的艺术都不可能是好的艺术，但我们在海勒姆·S·邦德先生购买画作的例子中看到，好的艺术一旦创造出来，就可能会衍生出声望价值，就像在寻找纯粹真理过程中的发现会带来巨大的经济价值一样。当然，还有一个艺术创作的动机——即作为一种精神需要的对艺术本身的热爱。然而，与出于消遣和声望的动机而进行的大量艺术交易相比，能够敏锐地感受到这种精神需要并为满足此需要而花钱的人群是如此之少，以至于从经济学的角度看是可以忽略不计的。然而，从艺术家的角度来看，这并不是可以忽略的事。\n\n到目前为止，我们已经从需求的角度考虑了资本主义国家中的艺术经济学。现在让我们考虑艺术创造者以及他如何适应资本主义国家。我认为可以把那些自称是艺术家的人分为三类——如其所是的糟糕艺术家，自命不凡或名不副实的糟糕艺术家（在法国有一个方便的称号，叫 “冒牌货”），以及真正的艺术家，一般来说，只有真正的艺术家才是这群人中的好艺术家。\n\n当然，如其所是的糟糕艺术家是一个纯粹的商人。他通常提供娱乐需求，而且他坦然地尽力满足它。这就是歌舞喜剧、通俗戏剧、通俗小说或杂志故事的作者，以及制造了我们九成图像数量的画家。作为一个商人，糟糕艺术家绝不会对当前的商业社会有任何反社会性。他没有普通商人的底线。我看不出他和社会主义相处有任何困难——我们的社会主义会接管和经营他的生意，打个比方，就像接管和经营廉价玩具的批量生产一样。他一如既往地为生计而工作，如果国家为他提供收入，他将会和他为私人工作时做得一样好。他将成为提供和控制娱乐活动的国家部门的成员。\n\n名不副实的糟糕艺术家的工作主要不是为了提供娱乐，而是为了声望。他通过炒作声望价值而立足，而真正的艺术需要一段时间沉淀才能产生声望价值。由于他的作品不是货真价实的艺术，他的作品只有在各种机缘下才能获得更快的声望价值；而且他总是依赖于这样一个现实：他在一定时间内被误认为是真正的艺术家。一旦他被发现（一般是在他死后不久），他的声望价值几乎立刻就消失了。\n\n真正的艺术家要靠两样东西来维持他非常不稳定的生存。(1)有机会靠足够的生活费生存——成为社会的寄生虫，或者(2)那一小撮真正热爱艺术的人的热情。这一小部分人（通常他们都不富有）所能支配的资金是如此有限，以至于我们可以称之为当代艺术作品的纯艺术价值远低于它们后来获得的声望价值。\n\n让我给你举一个这方面的例子。亨利·马蒂斯多年在温饱线挣扎。后来，他遇到了一个住在巴黎的美国家庭。这些人对艺术有着高度强烈的热情，虽然他们并不富裕，但他们设法买下了几乎所有的马蒂斯的作品（以低于其纯艺术价值的价格），让他继续创作。随着时间的推移，他的作品开始被认可，并且有了相当可观的声望价值，因此现在世界各地的大收藏家都在购买他的作品。\n\n然而，通常出现的情况是，一个正经的艺术家的作品直到他死后才会获得声望价值。我并不想说声望价值是严格遵照真正的艺术价值来衡量的，即使在很久以后。我曾见过霍普纳的肖像画，它不比一般的沙龙画好，却能卖到2万英镑。各种令人不安的影响，经销商故意引导的时尚，以及诸如此类的原因都导致了这个问题。人们可以大胆地说，在经过相当长的时间后，可能是几个世纪后，声望价值倾向于或多或少地与真正的艺术价值相对应，尽管前者总是大大超过后者。\n\n到目前为止，我们已经考虑了出现在我们现代资本主义国家的艺术生产。\n\n现在让我们试着更清楚地了解一下在某种形式的社会主义下会发生什么。首先，关于满足放松和娱乐需求的艺术。我认为，随着财富的分配更加均匀，以及在这种状态下可以预见到的更多的闲暇，对这类艺术产品的需求将大大增加。对于我所说的如其所是的糟糕艺术家来说，会有比以往更多的工作——更多的小说杂志，更多的糟糕小说，更多的通俗剧，更多的电影作品。\n\n另一方面，为广告和声望而创造的艺术将受到很大限制。首先，字面意义上的广告将大量消失；它会被限制为提供必要的信息。所有那些精心编制的用来劝诱某人某事的肥皂剧，以及竞争对手公司用类似的劝诱手段造成的持续扩大的影响，都会消失，同时大量消失的还有这种艺术的交易。声望可能会受到的影响较小，但它也会受到波及。首先，像财富和社会机会之类的会更加平等。并且，没有人可以通过任何努力来积累大量的个人财产，而这些财产的挥霍是产生声望的唯一渠道。此外，在我们的资本主义国家，声望也有货币价值。例如，海勒姆·S·邦德先生可以通过他女儿大好的婚姻前景来很好地收回他购买老大师画作的成本，但在社会主义下，将不会有声望价值的金钱变现。\n\n按照我们的理解，现代建筑几乎肯定会被淘汰；不是立马淘汰，因为装饰建筑的习惯会因社会惯性而延续，但当广告的动机消失后，就会有放弃装饰的趋势。对塞尔弗里奇百货来说，把商店建得像罗马宫殿一样是值得的，因为它会吸引坐在“沿着牛津街行驶的巴士”上的所有人的目光；但如果它是一家每个人别无选择必须前往的政府商店，一些机灵而诚实的政府部门负责肯定会想到，他可以把它建成只有墙壁、窗户和屋顶的东西来节省资金，而不需要做多余的事情，而且前去买东西的人一个都不会少。政府办事处可能仍然会有建筑，因为官员们仍想宣传他们职能的重要性，但这就是全部。\n\n所以，在我们的社会主义中，我们会看到名副其实的艺术的声望价值会大幅下降，为声望而创作的艺术会受到很大限制。从名副其实的艺术的角度来看，这肯定是一件好事。艺术的土壤将被清理干净，大量的杂质将会被清除。\n\n一方面，我们应该有更多的艺术创作用来消遣——由更多的，也许是更有才华的 “糟糕艺术家” 进行创作，以及少数的真正艺术家——让我们暂且假设他们继续存在。这两个群体之间的对比将是相当鲜明和清晰的，因为我们应该已经根除了名不副实的冒牌货艺术家这一中间阶层。以现在的情况来看，冒牌货是真正艺术家的最坏的敌人。他通过精妙的保护性伪装方法，从真正的艺术家那里窃取了应得的认可和荣誉，而他的交易本能使他能够把这些赃物变成极大的实际利益。\n\n我们现在切入到了关键问题本身，即真正的艺术家——那种唯一真正反社会的顽固分子。我一直认为，我们确实希望他存在。无论我们是多么好的社会主义者，我相信我们内心都有一个坚定的无政府主义内核，主张个人精神的满足是一种生命中最高的善，而我们中的许多人知道，在这一点上艺术家是必需的。我有时认为瓦格纳的理论是正确的（我想他的理论是基于叔本华的），即艺术是那些获得解放之人的最佳精神食粮，而宗教绝对永远是人类大众的首要精神慰藉。在任何情况下，尽管我很讨厌我们的资本主义文明，但我很难改变它，因为社会主义是建立在消灭真正的艺术家的基础上的。\n\n现在我们资本主义国家在这方面的一个明显优势就是对社会寄生虫的容忍。在美国，公众舆论强烈反对懒散而无害的寄生虫，艺术家几乎无法生存——实际上，他们被迫在巴黎和伦敦过他们的寄生生活，在那里他们可以逃避人们的注意。\n\n我们得承认，艺术创作的天赋落在数量相对有限的寄生虫身上的几率很小，但这种情况确实发生了，不过这种很小的几率给了我们希望——这种寄生虫可能永远只够勉强生存。\n\n在我们的社会主义国家，这种机会被抹杀了。那么，对于真正的艺术家来说，在这里还有什么希望呢？第一个主意是——也许他可以作为一个 “糟糕艺术家” 谋生，在提供消遣作品的掩护下进行真正的艺术家的工作。这是一个有吸引力的想法，勾起了我们的浪漫想象力。然而，我认为这本质上是错误的。在这方面，莎士比亚在不知不觉中给我们造成了严重的危害。众所周知，莎士比亚确实做着着糟糕艺术家的行当，但人们也认识到，他在背地里成为了几乎最伟大的优秀艺术家。然而，在提名他作为案例时，人们忽略了莎士比亚在这方面是一个非常特殊的存在的事实。设想一下，例如让福楼拜去做这种双重工作，你会立刻看到灾难。我宁愿要莎士比亚也不要福楼拜，但我也不赞成一个自动谋杀所有福楼拜的社会。不，我们可能每一千年才有一个莎士比亚，而且对任何一个世纪来说如果产生了两三个阿诺德·本涅特和赫伯特·乔治·威尔斯就是一件很幸运的事，但老实说这在我看来还不够好。\n\n当人们想到绘画艺术和雕塑时，情况要比文学更令人绝望。因为：典型的艺术，文学和绘画，具有双重诉求，一个是通过形式，另一个是通过题材。现在可以肯定的是，只有通过题材才能满足人们对消遣的需求。在文学作品中，艺术家在形式表达方面的尝试受到的内容干扰要比绘画更小。文学可以有许多附加的与美学无关的趣味而不会它的损害形式，这比具象艺术宽容得多。\n\n现在我们已经把我们的问题精简到它的终极核心：如何给真正的艺术家提供生计；并且承认我们的社会主义国家愿意这样做，社会主义国家如何能够区分真正的艺术家，鉴于它不希望支持一大群懒汉在艺术家的头衔下游手好闲无所事事。在这里，我更多地是在征求建议，而不是开出任何处方。\n\n有许多挑选真正的艺术家的方法可供考虑：由专家对候选人进行审查，通过彩票进行捐助，或由国家高级官员提供赞助（如任命桂冠诗人）。我们曾建议通过审查来发现真理追求者，但我们对以同样的方法去寻找艺术家感到极度恐惧。什么都好过一个由官僚或行业专家组成的委员会。我宁可希望有一个彩票，它会很好地效仿资本主义的遗产继承，成为一种反复无常的恩赐。鉴于委员会会以无懈可击的确定性筛选并拒绝每一个真正的艺术家（这真的是毫不夸张），也许会有千分之一的运气让一个人通过。但我希望有一些更自动和机械的测试。以下这些做法可行吗？比如说，让艺术家经历一段非常贫穷的时光，或者真正的社会人会思虑的诸如：微薄的生活费，以及在他一生中完全不可能获得的——生产工人或官僚可能渴望的——荣誉或社会地位。在我看来，我们可以在艺术家的反社会飞地周围围上一些带刺的铁丝围栏，它会淘汰掉除了最坚定者之外的所有人。这至少是一种对我们现在的商业主义环境的刻意模仿，鉴于大家都公认商业主义使得真正的艺术家有了可以生存的可能性。有一点肯定的是：任何官僚、官方或行政机构都无权决定何种艺术才是有价值的。如果没有这样的限制性条款，没有比人身保护法更严格、更强制的法规，艺术在我们的社会主义国家就没有希望。\n\n我清楚地知道，我并没有解决我所提出的问题——也许应该由你们这一代人在实践中解决这个问题——我所希望做的是清除一些与艺术有关的误解，而这些误解源于我们对精神价值的极度漠视，源于我们草率的思维习惯，源于草率思维习惯导致的语言贫乏和混乱。\n\n*原文载自伯灵顿杂志，1916年4月*", "timestamp": 1634032973, "digest": "yieJGrExxCatIglJHLoAhsdk4PSzMljQBVyGwUqNHZM", "contributor": "0x572344161Ab937c2cd6cC479B4a46D52Df49B785"}

It’s so cheap that you can pay the gas fees by those Blocto points they send you when you register your account and complete the article missions.\nBlocto wallet is one of the few wallets that support Flow. You can buy NBA TopShots with Flow and get up to 20% discounts. You can simply buy Flow and FUSD, a stable coin that works like USDC, on Blocto via Moonpay. In addition, you can hit the “stake” button to stake and auto-stake (if it’s not in non-custodial mode) Flow and get rewards. There’s also another card that shows your “Locked Flow”, which allows you to manage your property easier.\nWhen it comes to bridge between networks, BloctoSwap as the only DEX that bridges Ethereum and Flow plays a vital role. It allows you to exchange your USDT on Ethereum to USDT (tUSDT) on Flow, which can later be swapped into FLOW tokens. Blocto states that BloctoSwap will soon support more networks such as Solana and Binance smart Chain in the very near future.\n\nIf you’re new to blockchain and crypto currencies, you may find it kind of scary not to see any tokens, even shitcoin balances displayed in your Blocto wallet using Blocto Smart Contract Wallet. Here’s how to view these properties…\nRead second article HERE\nThanks for reading. In this article (1) , I introduced the smart contract wallet, Blocto, and how to use it to interact with smart contracts on BSC.

In fact, in most cases, you can’t see tokens displayed in your wallet if staked. We usually use dApps such as [dApp Radar](https://dappradar.com/) and DEX to execute. LP tokens, known as the [Liquidity Provider Tokens (LP Tokens)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens), will only be shown in quantity instead of values in fiat token in your wallet.\n\nBlocto displays real-time property value conversion for every listing tokens and the property in sum. **Currently, Blocto only supports limited tokens on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum (ERC20).** Blocto will soon support a wider variety of tokens. What’s more, Blocto is working on a new product called Blocto Balancer, which allows users to stake different genres of tokens in various proportions across networks. The cross-chain functionality empowers users with more revenue potentials rather than a 50/50 yield farming. Once you’ve earned your profits, you can put your BLT into another product to come, Blocto Vault. Blocto Vault is a decentralized revenue sharing pool, which allows users to burn BLT and earn rewards. With its deflation mechanism, BLT has a bright future. [Read here for further information](https://token.blocto.app/).\n\nYou can easily view your unsupported tokens (ex: [poocoin](https://poocoin.app/)) on BSC and Polygo through a dApp. Simply pretend your wallet to be Metamask, itcan be connected to your web3 wallet. You can use Blocto to see all the tokens held by BSC, and all the token price charts, which is a convenient combination of self-managed wallet and token price browsing. Remember to switch your network to BSC on the top leftor use [dex.guru](http://dex.guru/). They also support ERC20 tokens.\n\nPoocoin, dex.guru are some common dApps to manage your on-chain \n assets.\n\nThx for reading.\n\nYou can tap this link to [register and download Blocto app.](https://blocto.app.link/register?ref=UZNIIJ) Note that BLT is a token on FLOW (FLOW FT) about to list on exchanges. The starting price would be $0.4 USD/each. In the future users will be rewarded with BLT when you stake, save, make transactions and even refer the app to a friend. [Read the whitepaper for further information.](https://token.blocto.app/) Stay tuned!\n\n# Introduction for some other features on Blocto\n\nEnter the token card, click “send”, then enter the address you prefer. Click the down arrow on the right and you will be able to see gas fee payment options.\n\nYou can always choose other tokens besides Blocto Points as a payment method.\n\n# Feature(4) Gas fees can be paid with other stable coins on the network. (But we recommend Blocto Points the most!)\n\nSince Blocto is a smart contract wallet, a gas fee is required when creating a new address on a new network, and it could only be paid with Blocto Points.The gas fees on Ethereum have skyrocketed these days, so it might be a burden for some users. Those who choose to use Polygon, BSC, Solana can pay the fee with the free blocto points when you complete registration.\n\nExcept for approving a new network, you can pay gas fees in many different ways other than Blocto Points. Gas fees can be paid with the native token of the supported network (e.g., BNB on BSC, MATIC on Polygon), and even some stable coins such as USDC, USDT and DAI.\n\nI personally recommend using Blocto Point. You can easily finish your in-app purchase like playing a mobile game. You can also buy other crypto currencies via Moonpay. All transactions can be easily completed using Blocto app. Just use Blocto, it serves everything you need.\n\n# Feature(5). Showcase and enjoy your NFTs like never before!\n\nNFT and GameFi have been a craze like never before. Artists and musicians craft and mint their own NFTs one after another, and what’s more, NFTs are integrated with online-games such as battles, and creates a “Play to Earn”norm. Blocto supports several NFT collectibles on Ethereum and Flow, including those iconic artworks on Versus, a marketplace on Flow.\n\nBlocto opens a new era for NFTs. Blocto is soon launching a new product called “Blocto Auction House”. It is a secondary marketplace for NFTs transactions across different networks. Users can now manage their NFT collections the same way as they would manage their tokens. Instead of adding IDs of your separate NFTs, you can now classify your collectibles by their genres.\n\nAppreciate your NFTs like never before.\n\n# What’s More: Introducing BloctoSwap, Cross-Chain (ETH-FLOW) dex made by Blocto. You can also stake your FLOW to earn revenues!\n\nYou can now buy and stake FLOW under the flow token page. Being a vital consensus node on Flow, Blocto is also few wallets supports Flow. You can teleport your property on Ethereum by swapping into USDT first, and teleport them using BloctoSwap as your bridge between Ethereum and Flow. The USDT teleported would be tUSDT (teleported USDT), can later be swapped into FLOW and FUSD(USD stable coins of FLOW). It’s still free to swap on flow in BloctoSwap. Blocto would pay for your gas fees by now.\n\nYou can see BloctoSwap and Stake page on the explore button in the toggle bar.\n\nEnjoy all the wonders of FLOW on Blocto.\n\nBlocto is one of the few official wallets on FLOW. portto (The company behind Blocto) is invested by Dapper Labs, the company that builds FLOW, NBA TopShot andCryptoKitties. Note that all gas fees on Blocto can be paid with Blocto points, since it’s a smart contract wallet. If you fall short in any, you can simply buy themvia in-app purchase. You can also use Blocto to buy SOL, ETH and other stable coins via Moonpay. Recently, they are about to launch their own token, $BLT, that can also be used as locto points. *[Take a look at it](https://medium.com/portto-tw)*\n\nwebsite — <https://blocto.portto.io/>\n\n[Blocto](https://blocto.app.link/register?ref=UZNIIJ) download link (with refer code) \n iOS users can change your lang using Settings.

Will \"$PoW\" kill PoW?", "body": "Not long ago, the BSV chain was attacked again by 51% in a very short time. To solve this problem, the entire network had to undergo a revert. I cannot help to raise my concern that whether it will still be a decentralized blockchain when all the PoW hashrate is willing to move to the US and then go IPO?\n\nThe BTC Hashrate used to be \"concentrated\" in China. Although it seems that they belong to the same Chinese community from the view of the western countries, the miners are non-integrated believers of BTC. they present a four-party equilibrium. They restrict each other and balance the pattern.\n\nOnce in 2017, Bitmain’s “Antpool” and “[BTC.com](http://BTC.com)” have been subject to community controversy after the hashrate exceeded 51% of the entire network. However, most of the hashrate at that time came from scattered users all over the world. If the mining pool did evil things, users would inevitably make their choice by leaving. The name of \"mining tyrant\" is totally vain.\n\nAt this time, Bitmain sales are deeply involved in North America to find a “solution“ for their clients. Meantime, the hashrate of the \"capitalist\" listed camp is spreading, who obviously believe in the \"dollar\" and want \"cash flow” comparing with bitcoin. So when most of the hashrate belongs to the \"listed company\" hashrate, who is listening to the order from the SEC, will “PoW” still be the previous PoW?\n\nBTC will become a new ledger, and the signature pen will be held in the hands of the United States.\n\nLet us boldly guess the future of the \"North American BTC mining compliance development\". \n\nWhen the hashrate of the “North American listed company hashrate alliance” is greater than 51% of the entire network, the US government is likely to formulate a set of \"mining pool standards\" to eliminate \"no-compliant” or the “Non-KYC“ one. The specific implementation path might be like this:\n\n1. The hashrate of NASDAQ-listed companies requires access to regulated and standardized mining pools, and the computing power needs to be under KYC process.\n2. When the hashrate of listed companies exceeds 51%, they are eligible to choose the longest chain.\n3. There are two options for the non-listed companies with less hashrate, to access to regulated mining pools or to refuse supervision.\n4. Blocks exploded by non-standardized mining pools that do not accept supervision will be directly ignored. No one will follow their blocks, which means that there is no profit for them.\n5. Immediately afterward, the standardized mining pool requires all transaction initiators to conduct KYC, and transactions that do not accept supervision will be discarded by the \"compliant mining pool\". \n\n   `Since then, the BTC ledger has been compiled by the United States.

{"id": "iBOJbjfwHOJyUSmtwSlYsLEIizhR_viD09ESTAHOvHU", "title": "OpenOcean Community Talk Recap", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D7FaKRqIEJBMCHHU2ZbYX.png?height=717&width=1400)\n\nOn 11th October, 10am UTC, a community talk was held on OpenOcean official Telegram group with the core members of OpenOcean team. Below are the details of the talk. This recap only covers the updates of OpenOcean core team and 6 questions from pre-collected Q/A. It is very informative and interesting to read. Enjoy!\n\n**Tina:** Today we have Cindy, Co-founder of OpenOcean and Mathias, Head of Global Market Strategy joining us. Mathias, I know you have some news and updates to share. Please go ahead!\n\n**Mathias:**\n\nHi OpenOcean community. It’s a pleasure as always :)\n\nFirst I want to recap our vision to demonstrate that our achievements reflect the original ideas and we still steer in the same direction.\n\nIn September 2020, a group of experts from traditional finance industries formed OpenOcean with the vision of building a full aggregator that serves as a bridge connecting the isolated islands in the current fragmented DeFi and CeFi markets. We set work to increase trading efficiency and profits, and capture trading opportunities for crypto traders. Everyone should have a chance to trade at the best prices and apply their investment strategies to various crypto asset classes.\n\nNow that OpenOcean has been around for a year, I would like to talk a bit about what we have achieved in this period of time.\n\nSince its inception, OpenOcean has successfully grown as the first and leading CeFi and DeFi aggregator, including aggregation of 50+ DEXes across 10 public networks — Ethereum & Layer 2, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Solana, HECO, OKExChain, Ontology, and Tron. Also, we aggregated Binance to provide users with the option to trade on a CEX after comparing the price between DEXes and a CEX. Deep liquidity from different sources and an optimized intelligent routing algorithm provide OpenOcean users with the best price at the lowest gas fee and slippage on their favorite assets.\n\nOpenOcean has facilitated more than 1.2 million transactions with an accumulated 3+ billion in trading volume since launch. In addition, the number of unique active addresses on OpenOcean has surpassed 350,000, and the number of CEX registered accounts has exceeded 8,000, continuing to grow at a healthy pace. As for social media, Twitter has grown to 170,000 followers, Telegram and Discord communities have exceeded 65,000 members, and our Medium has 7,800 subscribers.\n\nMost of you have probably already seen the pre-announcement for our Atlantic Version that will provide best final swap returns amongst all aggregators.\n\nI’m happy to share that the OpenOcean’s Atlantic Version upgrade will go live soon. It will route users to the best final returns through improved algorithms. The upgrade will go live on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, and Polygon. According to third-party testing, OpenOcean provides very competitive or better swap price returns than other DEX aggregators, including 1inch, Matcha, and Paraswap. Later on, we will also expand to Arbitrum. The upgrade provides users with maximum returns on a swap that outperforms other existing protocols and is still free to use.\n\nBesides that we have new revolutionary features coming up. Later this year, cross-chain protocol aggregation will launch, allowing users to transfer assets across chains and trade at the best price with low slippage. OpenOcean professional tools will also be ready to go online to support automatic arbitrage trading between DEXes and CEXes. Moreover, we will also aggregate derivative products and provide more advanced trading functions based on the aggregation. We have more exciting details to share, so stay tuned.\n\nFinally, a lot of you are OOE token holder. Let me talk a bit about what you can do as an OOE token holder\n\nAs OOE holders, you are shaping the protocol’s future by suggesting proposals and participating in voting. You can also utilize tokens to access different tiers of OpenOcean VIP membership to enjoy advanced trading functions such as access to SaaS tools for automated arbitrage trading, utilizing OOE as the gas fee to trade across multiple networks, gas fee subsidies, and more.\n\nCurrently, we have ongoing and highly profitable liquidity mining and staking programs on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Polygon. It is an excellent opportunity to make your OOE work for you! As outlined in the tokenomics, 33% of the total OOE token supply is allocated to liquidity and trade mining rewards. There are more programs on the way, and this will be a continued strategy to distribute OOE fairly, incentivize liquidity providers, and offset trading fees.\n\nAll aboard! We’re ready to set sail on the Atlantic Ocean. Thanks! This will conclude the first section.\n\n**Tina:** Wow, this is quite insightful and we’ve had a lot of transactions thanks to the community\n\nThanks Mathias. Now we will move on to the next section where we will answer some of the pre-collected questions. Cindy will take over from here. Here goes our first question.\n\n*Question #1 by @AdwiPumpsik \n You mentioned that OpenOcean is free to use, but how will you maintain the platform if you provide free services? Can we know the OpenOcean revenue model? I saw roadmap in Q2, Team will launch SAAS product that support automated arbitrage transaction between DEXes and CEXes. This is interesting. Can you tell me how it will work and how user can use that properly?*\n\n**Cindy:** Thanks for the question. It’s correct that OpenOcean swap function and API are free to use and it will continue to be. In the future we will have revenue streams from institutional investors that run investment strategy through our custom-made UI and API. Also we will launch several services, some of which you mentioned in your question, that will generate revenue. The services will both be accessible by subscriptions for access but also available for OOE token holders, in different tiers based on their holdings. Below are a few of the services:\n\nPME (Primary Membership Edition), which is a SaaS that captures arbitrage opportunities between DEXes and CEXes and executes automatically for users. In the future, the SAAS product function will also be expanded to capture arbitrage opportunity and assist arbitrage trading between spot and future, helping traders to execute CTA strategies etc.\n\nWe will launch combined margin products so users can trade different derivatives on different exchanges utilizing the same margin pool.\n\nBesides, we are planning to provide Intelligent wealth management service where users can deploy their digital assets to earn more for them based on different risk profiles.\n\nIf you are a VIP user of OpenOcean, you can enjoy certain profits in above mentioned functions.\n\n**Tina:** Thanks for the detailed answer. Here comes the second question:\n\n*Question #2 by @Ngan993 \n I noticed that your project is very active in holding giveaway and airdrop events for the Community. My question is, apart from airdrops and giveaways, what other marketing strategies have you implemented to increase community awareness of the potential that your project brings?*\n\n**Cindy:** A large part of our tokenomics is for liquidity mining and trade mining, which is a part of our strategy to fairly distribute the token. We believe the more distributed the tokens are, the better foundation we have for a sustainable project that’s partly run by token holders and communities.\n\nBesides that, we are very active on different social media where we talk with our communities e.g. TG and Discord. Also, we work closely with our project partners such as the public networks we aggregate and the DEXes/ad hoc projects on the networks in order to create awareness across the entire crypto universe we aggregate and where OOE exists.\n\nDeveloping meaningful partnerships is a main part of our current marketing strategies because it allows new users to get their hands on OpenOcean and see the value we bring.\n\n**Tina:** \n *Question #3 by*\n\n*[Mahdi Lahni](https://medium.com/u/5e3f55e54fd?source=post_page-----64776a82af45--------------------------------)*\n\n* \n What is the main differences between this openocean and the the new V2?*\n\n**Cindy:** We call it **OpenOcean Atlantic Ocean version**. This version routes users to the best final returns with improved algorithms and is scheduled for October 2021.\n\nIt will provide users with a superior algorithm and protocol upgrades to optimize trading for the best returns based on multiple parameters, including better price, lower gas fee, lower slippage and routes to maximum final return.\n\nThis means that you do not need to worry about the tradeoff between the best price from numerous routes and the higher gas fee that may come with more routes — OpenOcean’s Atlantic Ocean considers everything and offers the best solutions to you by choosing the route with maximize overall return.\n\nOn top of that, the intelligent routing algorithm has been upgraded to provide better rates with faster response times and much lower gas fees by using improved routes. Besides that, additional liquidity sources such as new DEXes and trading pairs have been aggregated in the Atlantic version to support lower prices and more choices.\n\nThe current OpenOcean trading terminals (Classic and Pro) will also get a significant makeover, along with new enhanced features such as advanced route visualization. You can see the route on Fantom now as a teaser.\n\nThe good news is the Atlantic version is still free for everyone. You can still trade transparently, with zero added fees. The API will also be available for use by all.\n\n**Tina:** I’m so excited about the Atlantic version on other chains. I’m sure the community is as excited.😂🥳🥳\n\n*Question #4 by @nmluthfi \n Regarding Q4, it stated it’ll focused on derivatives product and yield product, would you mind to elaborate more so we can have a bigger picture.*\n\n**Cindy:** As for derivatives, we plan to aggregate decentralized futures contracts in 2021 Q4. Here’s some information about derivative strategy and long term plans:\n\n* Assist one-stop trading on OpenOcean on various future products across various protocols;\n* Look for best price options with algorithm, split routes to assist best trades in all similar future products which include orderbook and AMM;\n* SAAS product to capture arbitrage opportunities and execute CTA strategies etc.\n\n**Tina:** *Question #5 by @waves_Em1 \n What problem is this project looking forward to tackle in the crypto space and what better feature have they got over an already similar existing project in the crypto space?*\n\n**Cindy:** Today’s crypto markets are fragmented with asymmetric information scattering everywhere which makes it difficult to trade efficiently across various exchanges and public chains. The many automated market-making exchanges are siloed from each other and have little interoperability. This forces traders to search for deep liquidity and deploy funds across different protocols and blockchains or carry the consequence of slippage and partial fills.\n\nThe OpenOcean team developed the protocol of [OpenOcean.Finance](http://openocean.finance/) to provide symmetric information and best price to users in the fragmented market and offer one-stop entrance for users to increase efficiency in trading.\n\nCompared to the other aggregations, we aggregate 10 networks and 45+ exchanges and once launch Atlantic Ocean we will provide users the best final returns with improved algorithms.\n\nOpenOcean’s Atlantic Ocean considers price and gas fee together and offers the best solutions to you by choosing the route with maximize overall return.\n\nWhat’s more, we are going to offer more revolutionary solutions such as derivative aggregation and intelligent wealth management services to benefit the traders.\n\nDone with this question.\n\n**Tina:** Since we received 2000+ really good questions, we’ve chosen to add one more rewarded Q&A.\n\n*Question #6 by @Ccyanogen \n When will the cross-chain swap function be released and online?I’v seen several dexs contain this recently although none of these runing well.Hope everything go well.*\n\n**Cindy:** Great! Yes we are still building our cross-chain swap functions. It will be launched after the arbitrum aggregation. We saw the needs for cross-chain swap aggregation solutions when nowadays various DeFi ecosystems are emerging from various public networks. Our solution will be based on the aggregation of cross chain protocols and best price swap on OpenOcean.\n\n**Tina:** Amazing session with Cindy and Mathias for the 2 segments.\n\n*Thank you for your time reading this recap!* 💙\n\n## openoceanfinance\n\nBest Gems Best Price&Best Experience\n\n[Follow](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fsubscribe%2Fcollection%2Fopenoceanfinance%2F64776a82af45&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.openocean.finance%2Fopenocean-community-talk-recap-64776a82af45&collection=openoceanfinance&collectionId=e2d282121f70&source=post_sidebar--------------------------follow_sidebar-----------)\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1634035545, "digest": "g-Rrgcj5IFnQ9FmPvFeJX1Ijcr7ZeFic9YkIkNMvxEs", "contributor": "0x0c07BD0a6F7E03cA61AFd5E7B8A84fbfCCCFea4d"}

With this integration, OpenOcean users can have no fear in finding the best trades of Fantom-based assets executed by OpenOcean’s new [Atlantic version](https://blog.openocean.finance/openocean-sets-sail-for-the-atlantic-ocean-upgrade-landing-you-the-maximum-returns-with-an-fb36043e3db9),** which optimizes trading for the best returns based on multiple parameters, including price, transaction cost, route, and slippage.\n\nThe OpenOcean community is at the center of our protocol and involved in critical decision making. After community votes and inquiries for Fantom-based assets, OpenOcean started work on the Fantom aggregation. The aggregation adds to the vast ocean of DEXs that OpenOcean supports across DeFi platforms and CEX support from Binance.\n\nOpenOcean has now become the first CEX and DEX aggregator to partner with Fantom. Due to its fast transaction speeds and low costs, while maintaining a high level of security, the Fantom ecosystem has attracted solid DeFi projects and new exciting gaming applications, opening the door for continued value for this partnership.\n\n> *“Fantom is an exciting scalable blockchain platform, which has already given birth to some of the most popular DEXes out there.

a company that is building creators economic agreements - explained to me: \"in order for the creator to their work tokens, and collateral to obtain funds, it need to have a set of intelligent contract, it can register assets on the chain, issuance of NFT, assets evaluation, and in the default management and liquidation of the mortgage.\"\n\nCredit framework for creator economy\n\nJust as it is possible to make loans against collateral in the real economy, so it is possible to do so in the creator economy.\n\nImagine a game developer (let's call them Jane) working on a side project.\nAfter a while, with the positive encouragement of her friends and family, Jane decided to turn her side project into a full-time job.\nBut over the course of a few months, Jane's funds began to dwindle as progress was slower than initially expected;\nThey are starting to think about full-time work again.\nThis is not uncommon for budding creators.\n\nHowever, with a decentralized platform for knowledge assets, Jane's progress can be evaluated by a decentralized evaluation system that brings together the expertise of people in the field to evaluate unfinished creations, guided by the intrinsic value of ideas.\nThis intrinsic value is used as input to the mortgage calculation, that is, the value of the loan that it can be issued.\nJane can use the loans made available to them for whatever purpose they like;\nIn that case, support them when they finish developing the game.\n\nIn addition, small loans can be made to new couples with or without collateral.\nIf Jane doesn't have any projects, off-the-shelf or partial creations, they still have a chance to get initial funding as a newcomer to the platform.\nThe loan amount will be small as it is unsecured and the loan itself is supported by the decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and budget derived from its Ecosystem Fund.\nThe fund is financed by transaction fees and bandwidth allocation payments from the underlying blockchain.\n\nIf the loan is repaid on time, Jane's personal credit rating will be improved.\nIn this case, if Jane wants to take out another loan, the mortgage coefficient will be reduced, allowing them to borrow more money.\n\nIf Jane defaults on her loan, any mortgage assets are assumed by the platform and can be sold to recoup the money through a smart clearing contract.\nIf Jane does not pledge anything, the default risk is implemented by the platform and borne by the DAO.\n\nAs long as the creator's credit history is solid and validated with each new loan, the next batch of loans can be issued on ever-improving terms and conditions.\nCredit history becomes an integral part of the creator's reputation status.", "timestamp": 1634039601, "digest": "xd4maytPWHRTUIqQhqNDRYaor_5pUSqnly4lw7AM-fg", "contributor": "0x4d740E9c7DA2341bf6E6B7f58228f65599c87016"}

I am a mid-forties guy and had a company for traditional business (acted as a distributor and sold a backpack brand in China) before. I put all my effort hard to promote the brand to become the top 3 selling brands in Tmall (the best online platform in China) in this category.\n\nWhen my business started to make profit, unfortunately, I have mistakenly not taken much are about the legal side of my business. To make it short, the brand owner got back the distributorship and drove me away.\n\nThe sudden change let me feel depressed, but I need to find a way to overcome the situation and quickly earn the money for my beloved family.\n\nSo, I have started to explore the market and accidentally get in touch with the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and then NFT and DAO and more… for last few months. This amazed me a lot as it is a decentralized world and no authority can easily manipulate (may be still not 100% perfect at this moment).\n\nAs I am a layman in technology, it is hard for me even to set up a Metamask wallet. So, I gradually learned more about blockchain and related knowledge through youtube and then knew more updated information through different social media, like medium, reddit, telegram, discord… I only use facebook and instagram before and all is new for me.\n\nThis story is not any dramatic and special but it is important to me. I recently read a book called Life3.0 from Max Tegmark, it discusses the impact to our life by Artificial Intelligence. He classifies the life into Life 1.0 (refer to biological origins), Life 2.0 (refer to cultural developments in humanity) and Life 3.0 (referring to the technological age of humans). For our virtual world, we also have web1.0, web2.0 and 3.0.\n\nSometimes I feel confused as the world is changing so fast, all the new idea and thought comes out aggressively and they need a new skillset to handle into it. It I stand still, I will soonly be eliminated in this competitive market. So, why not, I evolve myself from previous Me.1.0 and Me2.0 to new Me3.0.\n\nHow to learn? The best is practice. Writing is one of the tools to help us for organizing what you have learnt. Luckily, I found the Mirror and this platform allow me to share freely.\n\nI will keep my dream to build my own brand in the real world but keep my continuous learning in the web3.0.\n\nThis my first time to write an English article publicly, hope I can express my feelings and through clearly. Although this article is not about technology, money, blockchain, NFT, DAO. Hope you will not mind reading it.\n\nThank you Mirror again to provide this platform", "timestamp": 1634040725, "digest": "vNi2HmngsIBkpcl8t9E0qi5XW4NFXsQtZSEWT9-PDSQ", "contributor": "0x5EC3C2aA7ba40ff510Df8b767D32789F1280a796"}

although not everyone actually makes money from what they create.\nUsers make media on social networks, such as Facebook, and they are then able to sell their personal data to generate substantial revenues.\nThis is perfectly permissible because centralized companies own user data and all user-generated content.\nCensorship is somewhat removed in Web2, but it is largely platform dependent.\nAlthough users are both suppliers and consumers on the network, they devolve power, subject to where they create and consume.\n\nPlatforms are isolated in Web2, and users need to create an identity between each platform in order to interact, because platforms don't \"talk\" to each other.\nIn addition, capital accumulation is at the top.\nPrivacy is also a huge issue, although agents have a responsibility to protect our privacy.\n\nWeb3: Read-write-own\nOwnership is one of the biggest features of Web3 -- participants have full ownership of their content, data, and assets.\n\nLaunched in 2009, the Bitcoin network offers the spirit of the Web3 pioneers.\nIt is important to note that the Internet is not yet what we think of as Web3, but the products and services being built are considered \"Web3\".\nIt just means that, to varying degrees, they adhere to the principles of openness, decentralization, resistance to censorship, immutability, no trust and no permission.\n\nWe are slowly seeing Web2 platforms think about what it means to start building products and services that fit Web3, such as Twitter's Bluesky project, which aims to develop decentralized standards for social media.\nAs with the shift from Web1 to Web2, the shift from Web2 to Web3 is mainly due to infrastructure advances, but there will also be a shift in the mindset of builders and developers as governance becomes more user-centric.\nWith the man-in-the-middle removed and the data on an immutable infrastructure, the data cannot be controlled, so there is no censorship and the risk of data loss is lower.\n\nInteroperability is a major theme for blockchain as it will apply to Web3-based platforms.\nAlmost like the description of the meta-universe, different platforms can be pieced together to form a fluid space where one's identity can remain unchanged, i.e. there is no need to create an account across different platforms.\n\nMany claim that joining Web3 is as simple as setting up your encrypted wallet, or MetaMask.\nThere is a wallet that connects to a decentralized application for interaction and transactions.\n\nExamples of Web3 tools may help shape thinking.\nThis is an excellent mapping of the Web3 protocol and its Web2 equivalent:\n\nMedium, for example, is a centralised tool for authors to publish and earn some income, but have no say in its governance.\nMirrors, by contrast, allow writers to take full ownership of their work, have a say in its governance (being treated as co-owners), and make money directly from their audience.\nThat's what we'll continue to focus on as we all move to Web3.\nLike Web1, Web2 will always exist in some parts of the Internet, but will not dominate the space where we spend most of our future online.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ejt6NsEaCbyYBqnhZoaOL.jpg?height=471&width=942)\n\n", "timestamp": 1634041134, "digest": "djsqXDAEskn_0WBCENrd4RTywMcnrt_OQpU42pc-qS4", "contributor": "0x4d740E9c7DA2341bf6E6B7f58228f65599c87016"}

But whereas the Internet primarily changed the ways in which content is distributed, the blockchain will change the ways in which deals get made and people get paid (among other things). It will radically alter how value is transferred, stored and accounted for.\n\nThe blocks of data that are verified and recorded in the distributed ledger of a blockchain can contain virtually any type of information. For this reason, it permits a variety of digital assets to be securely exchanged, and makes the records of those exchanges virtually impossible to expunge. The word “immutable” gets thrown around a lot in the context of blockchain records, for good reason.\n\nIt is the capacity for these immutable transactions to carry information and move digital assets that has really fired the imaginations of people working in this space (a space which is rapidly becoming “everywhere”). Blockchain infrastructure may be able to support many types of applications, some of which are just beginning to be identified, including things as diverse as land registries, digital voting, self-executing contracts, and tracking systems for Internet of Things objects. For a sampling of those many possibilities, check out the following articles:\n\n* [Wall Street Journal](http://goo.gl/tbFXZ1)\n* [Wired](http://goo.gl/ZCOQBQ)\n* [Inverse](https://goo.gl/sHjlp0)\n* [The Guardian](http://goo.gl/XSnuuB)\n\nThat last article, in The Guardian, discusses a recent, eye-opening report by the UK government that demonstrates the breadth of the potential impact of blockchain technology, just in the field of government services. The report notes that\n\n> Distributed ledger technologies have the potential to help governments to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the integrity of government records and services. In the NHS, the technology offers the potential to improve health care by improving and authenticating the delivery of services and by sharing records securely according to exact rules.\n\nHere’s a [link to that report](https://goo.gl/b25BY5). But it’s just one of many recent analyses that suggest a “tip-of-the-iceberg” aspect to our current understanding of where blockchain technology may lead us.\n\n*Forbes* [recently described](http://goo.gl/GuBnaq) the current surge in blockchain companies, projects and ideas as a “Cambrian explosion”. The shockwave of that explosion is now reaching industries that initially saw Bitcoin as mostly irrelevant to their business models, but are beginning to now recognize that the underlying blockchain technology is likely to become a significant, disruptive force. One of those industries is the creative industry, by which we mean film, television, music, publishing, video gaming and, soon, virtual reality environments. Blockchain technology will almost certainly disrupt businesses and individuals working in these fields, sooner than many may think.\n\nIn our next post, we discuss ways in which this might occur.", "timestamp": 1634041484, "digest": "JzQh2fHzYyLn2qD93b_0v5Bm3fqkgyX0ObH7bfPf__8", "contributor": "0x538fDC0055fCeCe2e55e327A7673F9887FBC29c7"}

This was the first of a series of six articles laying out how blockchain tech could prove revolutionary for the content ecosystem.*\n\nby [Lance Koonce](http://creativeblockchain.com/about/)\n\nBlockchain technology allows the secure transfer and recording of information, including digital assets, without the need for middlemen. This opens up many possible use cases, some of which may have a significant impact on the arts and businesses involved in content creation, distribution, and management. While the number of possible applications with relevance to the creative industries is potentially enormous, at present they can be broken down into the following general categories:\n\n* Proof of Creation, Ownership and First Use\n* Transfers of Digital Works\n* Rights Management\n* Smart Contracts\n* Micropayments\n* Creative Collaboration\n\nThese categories overlap and interrelate, but it’s helpful to break them out in this way in order to understand what aspects of blockchain technology enable each of them. In our next few posts, we’ll devote time to each category. Let’s start with the first one.\n\nProof of Creation, Ownership and First Use. Fundamental to all creative industries is the fact that tangible products of the human intellect are protectable under most countries’ laws as property of the creator of that product. This includes all types of creative works, including books, films, and music, protected under copyright law, and new inventions, protected under patent law. Words and logos that are used to signify goods and services are also protected, under trademark law, although ownership of trademarks typically lies with the first user or the first to register the trademark with a central authority, for a particular category of goods or services.\n\nBecause these tangible expressions of human thoughts are treated as property, they can be bought, sold and licensed, just like real estate and personal property such as cars. This has allowed complex industries to arise around the use and transfer of intellectual property. But key to the operation of these industries is being able to determine the creator/originator as well as the current owner of a work, invention or trademark.\n\nAs a result of this need for proof of ownership, most countries have developed elaborate systems of centralized governmental registration, which in the US is dominated by the registries/databases overseen by the US Copyright Office and the Patent & Trademark Office, but also includes state trademark registries. One can also include entities such as ICANN, which oversees a system of registries for domain names, in this discussion. These registries are not dissimilar from the centralized systems for registering ownership of lands and other property.\n\nAnd just as blockchain-based solutions for land registration have been proposed (see [here](https://goo.gl/wYdes9) and [here](http://goo.gl/MbBxEM), but also [here](http://goo.gl/txbFvZ)), the blockchain holds immense promise for eliminating or reducing the need for centralized registries of intellectual property. Imagine a global, distributed database for all types of intellectual property in which — once the ownership information for a work is placed in the blockchain — that information is essentially immutable, and not subject to the control of any particular agency (or country, although we’ll address cross-border issues in later posts). In its purest, most utopian form, this would be a record of IP ownership held by the people, for the people, of the whole planet.\n\nSome companies are already proposing solutions for IP registration using blockchain tech. In fact, one of the earliest forks of the Bitcoin blockchain was Namechain, which enables a .bit domain system outside of ICANN..\n\nProof of Creation. For original intellectual property that is created in digital form in the first instance, blockchain-based IP registries make eminent sense. Creative projects that are created on applications and systems built on blockchain technology could be recorded essentially upon creation — indeed, even early versions and drafts could be recorded — leaving no question as to who created it, and when. There are companies working on precisely these types of applications for copyrightable works, such as [Monegraph](https://monegraph.com/), [Stem](https://stem.is/), [Verisart](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-21/a-tech-startup-is-trying-to-catalogue-every-piece-of-art-on-the-market), and [Ascribe](https://www.ascribe.io/).\n\nThe idea of IP registries is not without issues that will need to be overcome. A key concern is that while the record of works itself may be immutable once it hits a blockchain, for works that are not created on a blockchain-based system in the first instance, who will verify that the information entered into the record is accurate? While most services likely will require the purported creator to affirm that he or she is the author and owns all rights before the work is registered, there are limitations inherent in such a self-policing type of approach. For instance, what prevents someone from claiming ownership of a work that was actually created by someone else? This same problem exists for any registry of ownership, but if a gatekeeper is required for a blockchain registry, does that undermine its usefulness?\n\nFor instance, it is difficult as of yet to imagine a blockchain-based alternative to the patent registration system, given that the U.S. Patent and & Trademark Office — staffed by many thousands of patent examiners — carefully reviews patent applications for registrability. It’s not impossible that a blockchain-based solution might arise for patent registration, but unless the process for recognition of a patent itself changes, the USPTO’s gate-keeper function will likely remain intact.\n\nProof of First Use. For trademarks, in the U.S., “common law” trademark rights are acquired by the party to first use a particular word or logo (or any other source indicator) in connection with a particular category of goods or services. (The U.S. differs from other jurisdictions, where there is more of a “race to registration” approach, where the fact and timing of registration is key.) Proof of first use in commerce is thus key, and one can imagine a system in which blockchain technology might well play a role in confirming and time-stamping such use, as an inexpensive method of protecting businesses’ trademark rights.\n\nIn future posts, we’ll discuss different kinds of IP registries on the blockchain, as well as whether blockchain-based registries can ever replace the existing, government-run registries.", "timestamp": 1634042714, "digest": "Mb7zF_IimkJ9hNlx9IpRmd-mSHByB9ac6u8v0xbjIy8", "contributor": "0x538fDC0055fCeCe2e55e327A7673F9887FBC29c7"}

I’m reposting these here as a way to preserve them for posterity.\n\nBelow is the work of @diamondhandz707 based on the collective musings and ramblings of the #grailed channel in the 10ktf discord, if this is new to you go to 10ktf.com and follow the link to the discord.\n\n![toadz in wagmi's shop](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tmeS-6EegNRj0FIOUUTz0.jpg?height=1152&width=2048)\n\nHere is the recap we have worked out in the ✨︱grailed︱検証済み channel from today’s 10/11 posts. If your holding 10ktf and haven't verified yet, please do that and join us in the chat. This is derived from our community chat in ✨︱grailed︱検証済み and has not been confirmed by 10ktf at this time. To join the grailed chat, if your holding 10ktf (bag or shoes), please go to verify and join us over there for more in depth conversations and theory work. I went through the daily chat and summarized the following information. Feel free to add or suggest edits. Thanks Frens!\n\nWagmi had a new visitor at the shop today - The TOADZ are here. Hide your stuff! (delist all 10ktf items & update metadata on OpenSea). BOSS_TOADZ has got to go. He is not a fren! Who is the BOSS_TOADZ? <https://opensea.io/BOSS_TOADZ> - The toad is a loan shark. I’ve heard he may be the sharkiest of loan sharks even… Don’t know there are any new collections about sharks but could be worth looking into?   BOSS_TOADZ is coming looking for your stuff. Delist it and update your metadata on all your bags, shoes & materials!\n\nRoadmap Incoming! No dates set. But we have seen many good things. Please see update from 10/10 by searching “10/10” using the discord search tool and read up on what we have to currently there but seeing shop sweeper talk about a Roadmap is exciting!\n\nWe are in a game. We are headed to level 2 of 6 levels. We know Beeple, Figge and Wenew are connected to 10KTF. We also know Beeple and Figge run a digital marketing & services agency called Wenew. Wenew, LV, Beeple and Figge are working together on LOUIS THE GAME (an app you can play right now. This tells us infrastructure is built).\n\nSomething we can work on I think - We have verified this and yet we don’t have many people here. This is a project unlike any else where we will see weekly value if we continue to do the work. The community is the most important part of this game we are in but we expect this to extend to meta verse, and eventual physicals (real nice LV bags. Nike shoes, cool arts and possible Wenew moments or exclusive access to some of the world renowned music artists they work with and possibly much more). Point here: If you want to get your friends in on some verified Beeple Figge Wenew floor level entry (you think it’s ever coming back down this low? I sure as fuck do not.) then you should tell them now. Don’t go crazy but lets try to get the word out organically where we can. Only do what feels right to you but we hold valuable information at this point. Understand that please.\n\nSake is ordered for the Dance Party on Thursday!!! Tune in if/when you can and be prepared to Shake Ya Ass… Watch Ya Self! lol\n\nThursday is also the 1 year anniversary of Beeple discovering NFT’s. We have heard speculation that he is releasing something with pax through ash. Keep an eye out for stuff frens. I think it will be a crazy day Thursday.\n\nBeeple posted 2 days ago and said “We’ve got a big project in the works that will be unveiled in the next few weeks…” We are a few weeks out from completing these levels I think. Not a coincidence he said \"we\" got a big project... Let’s keep working y’all!\n\nRadio was fire all day today. Really amazing mixes lately. I recommend everyone tune in when they can. Shoutout to the DJ's mixing it up over there, thanks frens!\n\nDid I say we speculate a snapshot incoming really soon as well? The rocketship is taking off!

We yearn for its omnipotence, but also want it to be 'real', which means there are no godlike administrators controlling everything, making it just another online game. I'm sure you don't want to see the house you have spent several months hard work to buy be suddenly removed, or be copied 1 million times as incentive for new comers.\n\nBlockchain, the infrastructure of ownership, is a perfect solution. With cryptography and consensus, blockchain can give physical characteristics to key elements of the digital Metaverse: **FT (Fungible Token) for currencies, NFT (Non-fungible Token) for objects, and CID (Crypto Identity) for people**.\n\n![Crypto identity stands for people in metaverse](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/alOmARfQ2Hajz74JKFJa0.png?height=1503&width=2681)\n\n## What is Crypto Identity\n\nMaybe you have heard of [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) (Decentralized Identity), a concept that is a bit too generalized at present. In fact, DID first came as an Internet standard lead by W3C and Microsoft. Here we won't go into details about the specs, but only want to give the narrative of what we think the best solution for **CID —— Crypto Identity**.\n\nCID is DID based on cryptography and smart contracts. The most important part about CID is the complete self-sovereignty of people.「**Not your key, not your identity**」is what we believe the spirit of CID, and the identity should be both simple and flexible, most importantly, secure.\n\n![Not your keys, not your identity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PP4JF20PKZ-EuMJ8yeR-K.png?height=834&width=2500)\n\nThrough CID, people can finally get full control of the assets, objects, reputations and all other valuable stuffs in the Metaverse. And of course, it's not necessary at all for CID being mapped to your identity in reality. In fact, everyone is free to get multiple CIDs in Metaverse, just like what we are doing now on the Internet.\n\n## Where is the Challenge\n\nKey management is the basis to CID. However, it is very hard to manage crypto keys for general people who can not even manage their passwords properly. It wasn't a serious problem for early adopters, but now we are talking about mass adoption in Metaverse, and we can't assume that people suddenly become experts in cryptography and deal with their keys better than they do with passwords.\n\nThe challenge is obvious for practitioners with vision and ambitions, so there are already many solutions trying to solve it. But it is always a problem to balance security, convenience and autonomy. After all, if the solution still require users to keep a secret of any kind, and doesn't have a ultimate way to recover assets when users forget their secret, users will lose their identity and everything depends on it in Metaverse.\n\n![We need passwordless](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IXffidSDxs1NRgWQHi7Ay.png?height=799&width=1280)\n\n## What is Special about UniPass\n\nUniPass solved this dilemma with an innovative approach. With UniPass, users don't need to know what is crypto key pair or mnemonic. The only skill they need is sending emails. Send an email to create account, and send another one to login a new device. If you have no active devices and need a recover, still you can send emails (maybe several emails from different addresses, and with a lockdown period of 48 hours). Email is the most popular protocol of the Internet, and now we make it works directly in Metaverse.\n\nBesides email, we make a lot of efforts to achieve the ultimate convenience and security for the daily usage. First, UniPass is a pure web application, so there is no need to install and apps on your mobile phone or plugins in your browser, which also leads to a fragmented experience. Then, to improve security of key management, we adopt wildly used web crypto infrastructures to create unextractable local keys. We can even use your Face-ID and Touch-ID to provide a hardware level secure environment through [WebAuhtn](https://webauthn.io/). What's more, we ensure that even if the email is compromised, user won't lose their account or assets, and can take action when unauthorized attempts take place.\n\nOf course, we have also considered the needs of current crypto users, who will be treated as senior users in UniPass. If you are confident to manage private keys by yourself, but still want the concise and unified experience of UniPass, you can either use your current crypto keys directly as the admin key of your UniPass account, or export mnemonics for backup at any time. We can support various providers of multiple blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, EOS, and more of them are on the way includes Polkadot, Near, Solana, Avalanche, etc.\n\n## Why is UniPass Non-custodial\n\nEmail does the magic, but is suspicious for a non-custodial solution. The answer is [DKIM](http://dkim.org/) (Domain Key Identified Mail), a protocol for anti-spam. For example, when you send an email with gmail, the mail server will generate a digital signature covers key properties of the mail, such as `from`, `to`, `subject`, `body`, and `time`. The public key of this signature is publicly available in the DNS record of gmail.com, and everyone can verify this key with one line of command.\n\nWith the help of DKIM, we can verify content of emails in smart contracts without trusting off-chain authorities, which means an **on-chain 2FA method** is available now. This is the first social recovery solution that is both non-custodial and practical.\n\n![How DKIM works](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jM3OgEc0iq2JsRd-9Ox3-.png?height=600&width=800)\n\n## What Can UniPass Provide\n\nAs a practical CID solution, UniPass offers everyone free and easy-to-use autonomy identities in Metaverse, which is exactly the same with what email has done for the Internet.\n\nFor users, UniPass gives them the ability to fully control their identities, along with everything related to them in Metaverse. For builders, UniPass opens the door of dApp diversity by smoothing out the user barrier, letting in more scenarios other than finance.\n\nTo make UniPass easier to understand, we have divided UniPass into four parts:\n\n### Crypto Key Manager\n\nKey management is the basis of everything for crypto users, and the great wall against mass adoption of dApps. What UniPass has presented is a non-custodial solution with a 'keyless' experience for users, and cross-platform integration package for builders. We believe that the best key manager shouldn't be perceived by users, and this is what we are trying to achieve.\n\n### Identity Verifier\n\nSometimes we want to keep anonymous in Metaverse, but there are still situations that you need to prove yourself a real person, or ownership of a twitter account, or even a certain experience in other applications. UniPass can provide **cryptographic verification** of your multi-chain address, your email and social accounts, or even your e-passport and driver license. This strong verifier can help you build a valuable CID in Metaverse, and also can help applications find high-value users to airdrop their incentives.\n\n### Application Connector\n\nCID is for users, but also for applications. With the identity verifier, application can bind themselves with official websites and twitter accounts. UniPass can connect CIDs by NFTs or Social Tokens, in a protocol that everything is public and decentralized on the blockchain. UniPass would also offer a universal SSO service, which can provide not only **passwordless** login experience, but also **asset-based or action-based access control** for Discord channels, Zoom meetings and forums.\n\n### Reputation Aggregator\n\nIdentity carries reputation. UniPass is open to integrate various reputation services based on CID, including avatars, points, badges, tags, covering every aspect of your identity in Metaverse. A good reputation can provide you a better chance for airdrops and extra privileges from dApps.\n\n\n---\n\n## About UniPass\n\nUniPass is multi-chain unified crypto identity, the carrier for the concept of 'people' in Metaverse. With UniPass's unique **Non-custodial Email-based Social Recovery** solution, you can take full control of your crypto identity with a **keyless** experience. You can also authenticate multi-chain addresses and even social accounts cryptographically, making your identity verifiable and more valuable.\n\n🔶 Come here for a pleasant chat👇\n\n🌈 *[Join UniPass Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XaRMFW85Pg)*\n\n🦉 *[Follow UniPass Twitter](https://twitter.com/UniPassID)*\n\n[https://twitter.com/UniPassID](https://twitter.com/UniPassID)\n\n🔶 To learn more, please visit the links below👇\n\n[Website](https://unipass.id/) | [Medium](https://medium.com/unipass) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZ4GOghuCdxBazZXc4M41g) | [Email us](mailto:contact@unipass.id)", "timestamp": 1634042800, "digest": "nlOChs4GpIMnCkb84SJFlYh1W7_ocdghkkIjOrwqLHE", "contributor": "0x1daF53275C07fa8e34B11BBa0a01EF94699ed2EF"}

While the number of possible applications with relevance to the creative industries is potentially enormous, at present they can be broken down into the following general categories:\n\n* Proof of Creation, Ownership and First Use\n* Transfers of Digital Works\n* Rights Management\n* Smart Contracts\n* Micropayments\n* Creative Collaboration\n\nThese categories overlap and interrelate, but it’s helpful to break them out in this way in order to understand what aspects of blockchain technology enable each of them. In our next few posts, we’ll devote time to each category. Let’s start with the first one.\n\nProof of Creation, Ownership and First Use. Fundamental to all creative industries is the fact that tangible products of the human intellect are protectable under most countries’ laws as property of the creator of that product. This includes all types of creative works, including books, films, and music, protected under copyright law, and new inventions, protected under patent law. Words and logos that are used to signify goods and services are also protected, under trademark law, although ownership of trademarks typically lies with the first user or the first to register the trademark with a central authority, for a particular category of goods or services.\n\nBecause these tangible expressions of human thoughts are treated as property, they can be bought, sold and licensed, just like real estate and personal property such as cars. This has allowed complex industries to arise around the use and transfer of intellectual property. But key to the operation of these industries is being able to determine the creator/originator as well as the current owner of a work, invention or trademark.\n\nAs a result of this need for proof of ownership, most countries have developed elaborate systems of centralized governmental registration, which in the US is dominated by the registries/databases overseen by the US Copyright Office and the Patent & Trademark Office, but also includes state trademark registries. One can also include entities such as ICANN, which oversees a system of registries for domain names, in this discussion. These registries are not dissimilar from the centralized systems for registering ownership of lands and other property.\n\nAnd just as blockchain-based solutions for land registration have been proposed (see [here](https://goo.gl/wYdes9) and [here](http://goo.gl/MbBxEM), but also [here](http://goo.gl/txbFvZ)), the blockchain holds immense promise for eliminating or reducing the need for centralized registries of intellectual property. Imagine a global, distributed database for all types of intellectual property in which — once the ownership information for a work is placed in the blockchain — that information is essentially immutable, and not subject to the control of any particular agency (or country, although we’ll address cross-border issues in later posts). In its purest, most utopian form, this would be a record of IP ownership held by the people, for the people, of the whole planet.\n\nSome companies are already proposing solutions for IP registration using blockchain tech. In fact, one of the earliest forks of the Bitcoin blockchain was Namechain, which enables a .bit domain system outside of ICANN..\n\nProof of Creation. For original intellectual property that is created in digital form in the first instance, blockchain-based IP registries make eminent sense. Creative projects that are created on applications and systems built on blockchain technology could be recorded essentially upon creation — indeed, even early versions and drafts could be recorded — leaving no question as to who created it, and when. There are companies working on precisely these types of applications for copyrightable works, such as [Monegraph](https://monegraph.com/), [Stem](https://stem.is/), [Verisart](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-21/a-tech-startup-is-trying-to-catalogue-every-piece-of-art-on-the-market), and [Ascribe](https://www.ascribe.io/).\n\nThe idea of IP registries is not without issues that will need to be overcome. A key concern is that while the record of works itself may be immutable once it hits a blockchain, for works that are not created on a blockchain-based system in the first instance, who will verify that the information entered into the record is accurate? While most services likely will require the purported creator to affirm that he or she is the author and owns all rights before the work is registered, there are limitations inherent in such a self-policing type of approach. For instance, what prevents someone from claiming ownership of a work that was actually created by someone else? This same problem exists for any registry of ownership, but if a gatekeeper is required for a blockchain registry, does that undermine its usefulness?\n\nFor instance, it is difficult as of yet to imagine a blockchain-based alternative to the patent registration system, given that the U.S. Patent and & Trademark Office — staffed by many thousands of patent examiners — carefully reviews patent applications for registrability. It’s not impossible that a blockchain-based solution might arise for patent registration, but unless the process for recognition of a patent itself changes, the USPTO’s gate-keeper function will likely remain intact.\n\nProof of First Use. For trademarks, in the U.S., “common law” trademark rights are acquired by the party to first use a particular word or logo (or any other source indicator) in connection with a particular category of goods or services. (The U.S. differs from other jurisdictions, where there is more of a “race to registration” approach, where the fact and timing of registration is key.) Proof of first use in commerce is thus key, and one can imagine a system in which blockchain technology might well play a role in confirming and time-stamping such use, as an inexpensive method of protecting businesses’ trademark rights.\n\nIn future posts, we’ll discuss different kinds of IP registries on the blockchain, as well as whether blockchain-based registries can ever replace the existing, government-run registries.", "timestamp": 1634043498, "digest": "Mb7zF_IimkJ9hNlx9IpRmd-mSHByB9ac6u8v0xbjIy8", "contributor": "0x538fDC0055fCeCe2e55e327A7673F9887FBC29c7"}

Soudain il m'appelle pour me montrer ce qui se passe sur son écran. Il est sur Fortnite, et regarde un concert de Travis Scott, un rappeur nord-américain. Je comprends qu'il est en train de consommer du contenu audio-visuel sur une plateforme qui m'avait toujours semblé n'être qu'un jeu vidéo. Je suis intrigué par cette situation : s'il peut regarder un concert sur Fortnite pourquoi ne pourrait-il pas aller se balader dans un Monop' reproduit numériquement et recevoir ses courses ensuite chez lui. Directement, je fais le rapprochement avec le film Ready Player One de Steven Spielberg (28 mars 2018) et avec Matrix, deux films où les protagonistes se retrouvent plongés dans des mondes alternatifs. Je creuse un peu plus le sujet et ce qui existe déjà d'articles ; je tombe alors sur le terme de *métaverse* : de ce que j'en comprends, il s'agit d'une sorte de monde numérique complexe à l'intérieur d'internet. Certain le décrive comme le futur du *World Wild Web*. L'idée de métaverse me semble encore assez neuve, et ce n'est que depuis quelques mois que les média spécialisés s'emparent du sujet, c'est pourquoi dans cet article nous allons essayer de mieux comprendre de quoi il en retourne.\n\n### Définition du concept de Métaverse\n\n**Attention, pluie de concepts et déluge numérique : définition d'un métaverse :**\n\n🇬🇧 *(Science Fiction)A hypothetical future (counterpart or continuation of the) Internet, created by the convergence of 1) virtually enhanced physical reality and 2) physically persistent virtual space. It is a fusion of both, while allowing users to experience it as either.*\n\n**🇫🇷 (*Science Fiction*) Futur hypothétique d'internet (une part de ce dernier ou sa continuation), créé par la convergence 1) d'une réalité augmentée physique et 2) d'espaces virtuels physiques et persistants. La fusion des deux permet à l'usager de passer de l'un à l'autre sans distinction.**\n\n**Bon ok c'est un peu sportif mais on va détricoter la chose dans les prochains paragraphes.**\n\n### Origine des Métaverses\n\nTout d'abord, commençons par un peu d'étymologie. Le concept de métaverse est composé de deux termes, \\[méta\\] et \\[verse\\]. Méta est un préfixe qui provient du grec *μετά (après, au-delà de, avec)*. Ici il est signifiant de la notion de profondeur, de grandeur et d'universalité. On utilise régulièrement ce préfixe pour parler d'une auto-réflection sur un sujet ou encore d'une prise de recul sur un sujet, par exemple : *métadonnées* (Données traitant de données) ou *métalangage* (un langage permettant d'écrire d'autres langages). Verse provient d'une contraction du terme *Universe.* Les deux termes associés peuvent se traduire par *Univers dans l'univers.*\n\nLe concept de Métaverse peut être rapproché des œuvres de fiction et des œuvres mythologiques. La saga Arthurienne est un bon exemple de méta-univers qui emprunte à la fois au réel et à l'imaginaire pour construire un récit dans le quel les deux mondes s'entrecroisent et s'influencent. Il en est de même pour la mythologie Grecque : le mont Olympe est transverse au monde des dieux et des humains tout comme les héros. Achille est un demi-dieu, un pied (talon) dans le monde réel, l'autre dans la fiction. L'idée ici n'est pas tant de dire que tout récit fictionnel est un métaverse mais plutôt d'illustrer des caractéristiques communes à ces deux médiums et de montrer que la création d'univers complexes est une pratique ancrée depuis longtemps dans le champ de l'expression humaine. La première trace de l'usage du mot métaverse dans la littérature remonte aux années 70. Dans le milieu de la science-fiction, à cette époque, quelques œuvres font référence comme le décrit le chercheur François-Gabriel Roussel :\n\n> *Ainsi, parmi les principaux livres traitant des métaverse, nous avons, par ordre chronologique : Simulacron 3(1968) de Daniel F. Galouye, True Names (1981) de Vernor Vinge, Neuromancien (1984) de William Gibson, Le Samouraï virtuel (1992) de Neal Stephenson, La Cité des Permutants (1994) de Greg Egan, Les Extrêmes(1998) de Christopher Priest.* \n\n<https://doi.org/10.4000/communication.5227> Open edition : 2015\n\nDans la plupart des articles que j'ai pu lire à ce sujet, les auteur·trice s'accordent pour dire que Snow Crach (Le Samouraï Virtuel) de Neal Stephenson est l'ouvrage qui pose les jalons de ce qu'est un *Métaverse*. Il instaure aussi le concept *d'avatar* numérique. Mais pourtant l'auteur, bien que rodé à l'exercice de l'anticipation, ne pouvait pas savoir quel serait l'état de la technologie aujourd'hui et l'émergence de nouveaux médiums à quelques peu brouillé les pistes de ce que nous pouvons considérer ou non comme un métaverse.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WY5Mn543FFgkdtgVYCm2u.jpeg?height=1200&width=961)\n\n*La clé du travail jusqu'à ce point*, 1907 - Hilma af Klint\n\n### Les frontières du métaverse.\n\nCe paragraphe est repris d'un article écrit par Matthew Ball sur son site [www.matthewball.vc](http://www.matthewball.vc/) que je me permets de vous traduire afin de vous en faire partager toute la qualité. Dans ces deux listes, il s'essaye à la délimitation du concept de métaverse par ses frontières, listant ce qui semble ou non être constitutif de ce dernier.\n\n### Un métaverse est (selon lui) :\n\n* Persistant : Il ne s'arrête jamais, ne redémarre pas, ne se met pas en pause.\n* Synchrone : les événements se déroulent pour tous au même moment, comme dans notre quotidien.\n* N'a pas de jauge ou de limite de participation : tout le monde peut participer à un événement sans limite d'audience.\n* Une économie totalement fonctionnelle\n* Une expérience qui transcende les mondes digitaux et physiques, les plateformes, et les écosystèmes publics ou privés\n* Offrir une interopérabilité totale des données et des actifs numériques : par exemple vous pourriez acheter un skin (un habillage numérique) de voiture sur le site internet de Porsche et le retrouver de manière transverse sur Roblox ou sur Rocket League, voire même le partager à un de vos amis sur Discord sans avoir jamais à le convertir.\n* Peuplé de « contenus » et « d'expériences » créés et gérés par un très large éventail de contributeurs, dont certains sont des individus indépendants, tandis que d'autres peuvent être des groupes organisés de manière informelle ou des entreprises à vocation commerciale\n* Opérable grâce à un méta-avatar : comme votre compte G-mail qui vous sert à connecter tous vos comptes, notamment votre Facebook, qui vous sert lui aussi à vous identifier sur tout un tas de sites. On peut aussi qualifier cet avatar inter-opérable de *traveltar*, contraction de *travel* et *d'avatar.*\n\n### Un métaverse n'est pas :\n\n* Un monde virtuel : Les mondes virtuels et les jeux avec des personnages basés sur l'IA existent depuis des décennies, tout comme ceux peuplés d'humains « réels » en temps réel. Ce n’est pas un univers « méta », juste un univers synthétique et fictif conçu dans un seul but, en l'occurrence : jouer.\n* Un espace virtuel : Les expériences numériques comme Second Life sont souvent considérées comme des « proto-métaverses » parce qu’elles (A) n’ont pas d’objectifs de jeu ou de systèmes de compétences ; (B) sont des lieux de rencontre virtuels qui persistent; (C) offrent des mises à jour de contenu presque synchrones ; et (D) ont des humains réels représentés par des avatars numériques. Cependant, ces attributs ne sont pas suffisants pour remplir toutes les conditions d'existence d'un Metaverse.\n* De la VR (Virtual Réality) : La réalité virtuelle est une façon d’expérimenter un monde virtuel ou un espace. La sensation de présence dans ce monde numérique n'en fait pas pour autant un Metaverse.\n* Une économie numérique et virtuelle : Cela existe déjà. Les jeux tels que *World of Warcraft* ont depuis longtemps des économies fonctionnelles où de vraies personnes échangent des biens virtuels contre de l’argent réel, ou effectuent des tâches virtuelles en échange d’argent réel. En outre, les plateformes telles que Amazon Mechanical Turk, ainsi que des technologies telles que le Bitcoin, sont basées autour de l’embauche de personnes / entreprises / puissance de calcul pour effectuer des tâches virtuelles et numériques. Nous faisons déjà des transactions à grande échelle pour des articles purement numériques pour des activités purement numériques via des marchés purement numériques.\n* Un jeu : Fortnite comporte de nombreux éléments d'un Metaverse. Il (A) vous identifie grâce à votre adresse IP pour vous attribuer un Traveltar ; (B) à une identité cohérente qui s’étend sur plusieurs plateformes fermées; (C) est une passerelle vers une myriade d’expériences, dont certaines sont purement sociales; (D) récompense les créateurs pour la création de contenu, etc. Cependant, comme dans Ready Player One, elle demeure trop étroite dans ce qu’elle fait, dans son extension et dans les activités qui peuvent s'y produire (du moins pour l’instant). Bien qu'un Metaverse puisse avoir des buts ludiques et inclure des jeux, il n’est pas lui-même un jeu, ni n'est orienté autour d’objectifs spécifiques.\n* Un parc d’attractions virtuel genre Disneyland : Non seulement les « attractions » seront infinies, mais elles ne seront pas conçues ou programmées de façon centralisée comme à Disneyland. Elles ne seront pas toutes axées sur le plaisir ou le divertissement. En outre, la distribution de l’engagement sera d'une grande variété.\n* Une nouvelle boutique d’applis : Personne n’a besoin d’une autre façon d’ouvrir des applis. Le Metaverse est substantiellement différent des modèles Internet/mobiles actuels, de son architecture et de ses priorités.\n\n## Signaux faibles, bonne connexion.\n\nMaintenant que nous entrevoyons un peu mieux quelles sont les frontières d'un métaverse, il me semble intéressant de décoder ce qui dans notre société peut être lu comme un signal ou un frein de la potentielle émergence des métaverses.\n\nEn 2017, le jeu PUBG voit le jour, plus précisément son mode Battle Royal. Ce mode de jeu peut-être expliqué par une analogie avec le film (et le roman) Hunger Games. En effet, comme dans le film, on enferme des concurrents dans une arène et l'on attend que l'un d'eux sorte vainqueur du combat en ayant récupéré des armes puis tué tous ses adversaires. Les *Battle Royal* existaient déjà auparavant, notamment ARMA III, mais PUBG popularise grandement le genre et le transforme en un succès planétaire. Avec PUBG, puis ensuite, Apex Légend et Fortnite, la nécessité de puissance des serveurs qui hébergent les jeux augmente de manière exponentielle. Ce n'est que depuis ce moment-là que l'on assiste à la preuve que des serveurs soient capables de supporter autant de joueur·se·s en simultané. Même si en l'espace de dix ans la capacité de ces derniers a été considérablement décuplée, ils ne sont toujours pas capable de rendre l'expérience d'un métaverse et son caractère **persistant** et **non cloisonné** possible. Des jeux comme World of Warcraft découpent l'afflux de joueurs dans différentes \"salles\" (des serveurs) et simulent un monde permanent.\n\nPour pouvoir naviguer sur ces serveurs géants il faudrait que les protocoles technologiques soient partagés par tous les acteurs. On peut faire l'analogie avec les systèmes monétaires mondiaux. Lorsque vous partez à l'étranger vous devez changer votre monnaie pour la rendre utile dans le pays où vous vous trouvez. Sur internet c'est à peu près la même chose. Chaque acteur possède des technologies différentes qui ne sont pas toutes compatibles entre elles. Cela invalide une des conditions les plus importantes à mon sens pour la création d'un métaverse : **l'interopérabilité des données**. Aujourd'hui, [les GAFAM se lancent tous dans la construction de métaverses](https://www.protocol.com/tech-gaming-amazon-facebook-microsoft#toggle-gdpr) à grand coups de dollar. Cette bataille de géants compromet fortement la possibilité pour du contenu numérique de pouvoir transcender les mondes digitaux et physiques, les plateformes, et les écosystèmes publics ou privés. C'est pourtant la base d'un métaverse. Il n'y a qu'à étudier la [bataille](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/04/08/apples-battle-with-fortnite-maker-epic-games-intensifies-as-lawsuit-challenges-30-app-store-commission/) entre Apple et EpicGames pour comprendre les enjeux qui se trament lorsque l'on touche à des écosystèmes aussi gros et lucratifs que celui de la pomme (pas la chanteuse).\n\nPour assouvir ses ambitions et ses capacités techniques, Amazon a débuté un cycle de rachat dans l'industrie du jeu vidéo dont l'acquisition de Twitch - la célèbre plateforme de streaming - n'est que la partie émergée de l'iceberg. S'ajoute à cela l'[embauche des développeurs du jeu Rainbow Six Siège](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346484/amazon-games-montreal-studio-announced-rainbox-six-siege-developers) (Ubisoft) afin de développer la partie gaming du géant et tirer profit de sa position de leader dans l'économie des serveurs ([les services sont ce qui rapporte le plus à Amazon en 2020](https://www.lesechos.fr/industrie-services/conso-distribution/amazon-lannee-folle-du-geant-mondial-du-commerce-1167954)). Dans un autre registres, Facebook, fort d'une énorme base d'usagers, est déjà bien implanté comme un multiverse (une multitude d'univers). Nous oublions souvent que sur le réseau social nous pouvons d'ores et déjà : nous connecter avec d'autres personnes, vendre des biens, jouer à des jeux (rappelez-vous de FarmVille et ses [250M de joueurs](https://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2010/05/06/farmville-la-poule-aux-ufs-d-or-de-zynga_1347097_651865.html) mensuels), rejoindre des événements et des groupes, etc. Facebook vient d'annoncer son intention de construire un Métaverse, ce dernier portera le nom [d'Horizon](https://medium.com/swlh/facebook-is-building-the-metaverse-meet-horizon-c6107a093502). Quand on imagine que le compte Facebook d'une personne permet de se connecter à tout un tas de services et de sites internets, on comprend l'intérêt que porte le réseau social à un tel chantier. La position de ce dernier est au final : \" Nous allons construire un univers qui englobera déjà votre univers social digital\". Ce dernier passage est très centré sur les usages occidentaux du numérique (je suis biaisé, je dois l'avouer), mais si nous jetons un œil du côté de la Chine, WeChat fait figure de proto-métaverse. La super-app (ou méta-application) est devenu quasiment obligatoire dans les métropoles du pays tant l'agrégation de services qu'elle propose est grand. De la santé à l'immobilier, en passant par les informations quotidienne et le e-commerce, WeChat est partout et permet de tout faire. Tencent qui développe la super-application à fait de l'interopérabilité de ses données un vecteur commercial. Ils vendent à leurs clients la facilité d'interaction entre les différents organes de leur écosystème. Ces mêmes clients se retrouvent pas la suite bloqué dans un engrenage duquel il est difficile de s'extraire, revers de la médaille d'une commodité sans bornes. EpicGames, qui développe Fortnite et qui gère aussi l'outil de 3D (création/moteur de rendu) UnrealEngine a bien compris cela. Il utilise déjà cette technologie dans différents champs d'applications transverses. On retrouve des images 3D réalisées avec leur solution dans le *retail*, l'architecture, les effets spéciaux ou encore l'animation de lives comme pendant le [concert de Childish Gambino](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/childish-gambino-mesmerizes-fans-with-real-time-animation). Si autant d'éléments sont créés via la technologie Unreal Engine, on peut tout autant imaginer les retrouver dans un film comme dans un jeux-vidéo ou dans un monde virtuel. Epic tente d'abolir les limites posées par les divers médiums et plateformes. En rendant son jeux phare Fortnite jouable en *crossplatform -* c'est à dire sur portables, consoles, ordinateur et autres appareils, indifféremment de la marque ou du système d'exploitation (OS) - un premier palier a été franchit. Les joueur·euses, se sont accoutumés à la possibilité de retrouver leurs ami·es indifféremment du support de jeu.\n\nPlus loin que le cross-platforme, une nouvelle technologie vient repousser encore plus loin les limites imposées par le *Hardware* (le matériel) en proposant de dématérialiser la machine sur laquelle sera exécuté le programme. Que ce soit un jeu ou tout autre chose nécessitant une grande puissance de calcul comme les rendus 3D, le *CloudComputing* ou \"ordinateur dans le nuage\" permet de l'exécuter sur une machine distante de soi et d'interagir avec le flux vidéo envoyé par cette machine. Nous *streamons* donc du contenu, mais à la différence de Netflix ou de Youtube, nous pouvons interagir avec. Ce signal faible permet de pointer du doigt une nouvelle manière de consommer du contenu interactif ainsi que sa limite directe : Une connexion internet en béton armé est nécéssaire pour pouvoir profiter confortablement d'une expérience de *CloudComputing.* En miroir de cette nouvelle manière de jouer, qui à pour vertu de démocratiser l'accès à des biens culturels (pas de nécessité de s'équiper d'un matériel couteux), existe une réalité écologique moins glorieuse : cette dématérialisation est juste déplacée et rendue invisible aux joueur·euses. Pour chaque ordinateur dans le *Cloud*, il existe son alter-ego dans une ferme de serveurs.\n\nLe second palier franchit par Epic tient plus de la poule aux œufs d'ors que d'une véritable amélioration de l'expérience de jeu mais représente du point de vu du métaverse un point intéressant. Les équipes de Fortnite font rentrer de manière régulière et banalisée au sein même du jeu du contenu externe issu d'autres franchises, comme Star Wars, Borderland ou la marque de sport Jordan (Nike). Ce contenu n'est pas encore interopérable, mais le public commence à s'habituer à l'idée de pouvoir faire cohabiter différents univers qui par le passé ne se rencontraient que peu. Cela devient même un outil de notoriété pour des entreprise comme Michelin, qui a embauché une équipe pour créer des circuits pour le jeu de courses de voitures TrackMania. Derrière cela il y a aussi un système économique florissant, où le micro-paiement est roi et où les skins d'armes et de personnages commencent à se revendre à prix d'or. Si vous avez lu mon précédent article sur les NFT alors il vous sera facile de comprendre que les métaverse seront sûrement le lieu où ces derniers prendrons un usage courant et banal.\n\nUn troisième palier à été franchi dans l'établissement d'une autre des conditions de base d'existence d'un métaverse : la prise en main totale par les joueur·se·s des outils de création de contenu et leur usage massif. Cette fois-ci ce n'est pas de Fornite dont nous allons parler, mais plutôt de Roblox qui dans la même veine que Minecraft propose aux joueur·se·s de créer l'environement même dans le quel le jeu va s'opérer. Chez les jeunes générations cette conception participative du jeux me semble plutôt intéxgrée et les [investisseurs l'ont compris](https://web.archive.org/web/20200620052538/https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/roblox-raises-150m-series-g-led-by-andreessen-horowitz-now-valued-at-4b/?utm_source=planet_nl&guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDIwLzAyLzI2L3JvYmxveC1yYWlzZXMtMTUwbS1zZXJpZXMtZy1sZWQtYnktYW5kcmVlc3Nlbi1ob3Jvd2l0ei1ub3ctdmFsdWVkLWF0LTRiLz91dG1fc291cmNlPXBsYW5ldF9ubA&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJ2ljnU1WEgO81HrHRiXgjkYvOOZeMBGtTAKT6jrdzS8wg_zZdKrJhSIx7isoXA2iSvGFv2_ZzCH9aefU0M6r6M99SvhfceRtj1yHXgmqism1brqSjIsjA8mJ4lEztTj0JyJBjer4sTWvcwS9-mIYQ-zjxRM0N6CmEKiRFTyP01F). Si l'on s'éloigne un peu des jeux vidéos, le concept de création de valeur par les usagers n'est pas nouveau, c'est même le propre des plateformes. L'enjeu pour les métaverses sera d'engager leur usagers en ce sens s'ils veulent que leurs mondes digitaux restent attractifs et variés et qu'en fin de compte ces derniers y dépensent de l'argent. L'argent est en somme le but et le moyen des métaverse. Parmi les freins notables qui pourraient nous empêcher de naviguer avec nos *Traveltars* flambants neuf dans des serveurs tout chauds, il me semble que la guerre économique entre les GAFAMs est le principal. Peut-être verrons-nous advenir dans un horizons de cinq ou dix années le rachat d'un géant par un autre (car il est évident qu'ils sont bien trop gros pour \"mourir\"), cela pourrait être le rachat de EpicGames par Apple, Amazon ou Tencent.\n\n## Désirabilité et nécessité des métaverse\n\nAujourd'hui, l'intérêt que peuvent apporter les métaverse pour les particuliers me semble faible : un surcroit de fluidité dans nos expériences en ligne ainsi qu'un amenuisement des frontières entre numérique et physique. Rien ne viendra considérablement améliorer l'expérience que nous avons d'internet, qui est en quelques sortes le métaverse originel, peuplé de ses différents monopoles et multiverses. L'apparition d'un métaverse ne se fera par ailleurs jamais sans l'apparition d'une situation de monopole et cela remet à mon sens la désirabilté de ce dernier en cause. La beauté d'internet réside dans son apparente infinitude, dans ses méandres, dans ses sous-communautés et dans le sentiment d'immensité et de liberté qui en résulte. Nous sommes nombreux à être attaché à un internet vivant d'une multitude d'expérience créées par une multitude d'acteurs. Des collectifs ont décidé de prendre les armes contre cette mise en silos du web.\n\nContre les métaverse (mais pour un internet plus riche) nous pouvons nous poser de la question suivante : Est-ce que le mélange des médias apporté par le métaverse améliorera la qualité nos expériences numériques ? Si la réponse à cette question se trouve être \"oui\" nous devrons nous demander à quel prix. Le métaverse est un outil pour maintenir les joueurs dans des écosystèmes sans anicroches avec pour but principal de ne pas perdre leur attention. Ne pas perdre leur attention revient à gagner du temps, temps qui ne sera au final pas alloué aux services concurrents. L’adage le dit : le temps, c'est de l'argent. J'imagine qu'à l'opposé de cette nécessité d'hégémonie des pratiques qui séduit tant les *BigFive*(pas ceux du safari), d'autres acteurs vont se spécialiser, se nicher dans des pratiques spécifiques pour proposer des expériences singulières et riches et qui auront pour beauté de ne pas être au sein d'un ensemble numérique fouillis et commercial mais, d'exister pour elles-mêmes.\n\n \n \n\n\n---\n\n## Ouvertures\n\n### Comment un Métaverse peut changer le rapport que nous avons au concept de luxe ?\n\n### Une ouverture par Paul Mouginot\n\nDepuis déjà plusieurs années, la croissance du luxe semble être tirée davantage par le volet expérientiel que le volet matériel de l'industrie. Plus que posséder, il s'agit de vivre, être surpris(e), expérimenter. Dans le même temps, la science, l'informatique et la connaissance du virtuel sont de plus en plus exploités comme inspirations créatives par les maisons. Les métaverses arrivent donc, on peut l'affirmer, exactement au bon moment.\n\nDans une période où la circulation physique et les interactions sociales de beaucoup de populations sont limitées, ces univers offrent de nouvelles possibilités créatives et une vraie sérendipité. Pour le moment, le monde du luxe ne s'est pas saisi de cette opportunité, probablement pour des raisons politiques ou de manque d'agilité, mais à mon sens, ce ne saurait tarder. En attendant, certains explorateurs(trices) friands de luxe, munis de leurs chaussures virtuelles Gucci, arpentent déjà les rues de Cryptovoxels. Ils connaissent déjà les objets virtuels les plus recherchés des crypto-millionnaires : les NFT de Pak, un Cryptopunk alien -comme celui en vente chez Christies' ce mois-ci, une adresse en .eth, ou encore une parcelle bien située dans Origin City de Cryptovoxels. Il y a 6 mois, la quasi totalité de la planète n'avait aucune idée des cinq objets cités précédemment. Aujourd'hui pourtant, d'un métaverse à l'autre, ils symbolisent plus qu'autre chose le luxe, la puissance du \"first-mover\", celui ou celle qui était là avant, qui connaissait, ou de celui ou celle qui, désormais, doit succomber à la FOMO et doit payer des sommes de plus en plus folles pour y accéder.\n\n### Digital twins et métaverses\n\n### Une ouverture par Alexandra Radulescu\n\nUn concept qui émerge aujourd’hui est la notion de digital twin - jumeau virtuel ou double virtuel. Il s’agit d’accompagner la représentation d’un objet physique par la représentation des couches de datas qui tiennent de lui. Par exemple, un réseau de transports et ses données liées au trafic, à la météo, à l’impacte écologique, à l’impact sonore sur l’environnement, etc. À l’époque du Big Data, toutes ces bases de données ont besoin de représentations porteuses de sens afin que l’on puisse comprendre rapidement leurs dynamiques globales et leurs enjeux dans le territoire.\n\nCes jumeaux virtuels sont les briques de base de ce que l’on envisage comme les futurs métaverses. Par exemple, les Smart Cities sont des versions virtuelles des villes physiques, représentées ensemble avec les flux de données qui les parcourent. Les jumeaux virtuels des bâtiments, des réseaux de communications, des transports et des différents services de la ville sont actualisés dans le modèle virtuel en parallèle avec le monde physique. Ces entités deviennent des outils très puissants pour le design, l’analyse et le développement des infrastructures physiques.\n\nLes datas font le lien entre les deux écosystèmes et ce lien constitue la force principale de l’idée de métaverse. Il permet de rendre visibles les relations dynamiques entre les différents acteurs représentés et donne à voir non pas une image figée du monde, mais une continuité, des tendances, avec la possibilité de retracer l’histoire récente ou se projeter dans le futur.\n\nUn metaverse est une représentation virtuelle, souvent tridimensionnelle, d’un espace où l’on peut sociabiliser, travailler, ou jouer.\n\nPourquoi en 3D ? Parce que la 3D a des affordances similaires avec la navigation dans notre réalité primaire et permet donc un accès intuitif. La 3D permet également un encrage dans le territoire. Les sensations de la navigation en 3D / XR restent très puissantes et fonctionnent bien avec les possibilités de mouvement du corps humain. Aussi, nous sommes plus susceptibles d’assimiler dans la mémoire une information sous forme d’expérience spatiale qu’à partir d’un texte écrit ou une image. Il s’agit alors d’un média qui a fait ses preuves pour s’installer aujourd’hui en complément de la presse écrite, de la télévision, de la radio, etc.\n\nUn métaverse est fait de composantes et de couches d’informations multiples. Prenons l’exemple d’un smartphone. Si on donne le même smartphone à deux personnes différentes, leurs expériences seront différentes au bout de quelques minutes d’utilisation. Un métaverse permet des usages dans des domaines différents, avec, encore, des vues transversales. Il ne s’agit pas uniquement d’un jeu vidéo en réseau. Ni de remplacer des expériences de la vie physique ou d’ouvrir un espace de refuge dans une fiction. Mais d’une toute nouvelle modalité de représenter le monde, à base de simulations et de visualisations, qui prend sa place à côté des médias existants.\n\nUne plateforme d’une telle grandeur qui aurait l’unique vocation d’imiter la vie quotidienne, ce serait un échec sûr (même si la visualisation a beaucoup évolué depuis l’époque de Second Life).\n\nL’idée de metaverse a aujourd’hui un potentiel beaucoup plus solide et ancré dans la réalité.\n\nLe métaverse que l’on est en train de construire permet de rendre visible une couche très importante de la réalité : les données qui circulent dans notre monde, afin de mieux les comprendre et les valoriser. Ainsi, dans un monde informé par, entre autres, un ou des métaverses, l’information n’est plus une notion abstraite, invisible, mais elle est clairement déterminée et située dans le territoire, associée aux objets et aux groupes de personnes qui la génèrent. Il me semble très important de démocratiser la compréhension de ces datas et leur utilisation, sinon on risque d’arriver dans une position dangereuse où on laisse effectivement la place de s’en saisir aux grandes entreprises et à des gens qui ne fonctionnent que pour leur propre profit.\n\nÉgalement, dans un métaverse idéal dédié à l’échange, les réseaux sociaux redeviennent un espace public ; les interactions se passent à partir de positions égalitaires de chaque acteur ; on n’est plus en train de se parler chacun à travers les fenêtres de nos espaces personnels, mais on a un espace aménagé où l’on se retrouve tous, avec les mêmes référentiels. L’immersion et la participation dans ce monde a le potentiel de responsabiliser les gens envers la vie et l’espace public, en leurs donnant un certain pouvoir de parole et d’action. Bien sûr, ce n’est pas une solution de remplacement pour l’interaction en présence de nos interlocuteurs, mais une toute autre expérience qui permet de faciliter le contact à distance quand le déplacement est impossible ou coûteux. Elle rajoute en plus une couche de visualisation des sujets d’échange (issue des datas), la possibilité de participation de chaque interacteur sur une plateforme d’une taille considérable, des liens directs possibles avec n’importe quel autre interacteur membre de la plateforme et des systèmes de mise en valeur des informations/ranking efficaces.\n\nCependant, il ne faut pas tomber dans le piège d’idéaliser ou de diaboliser certaines technologies. Elles ne sont que des outils et n’ont aucune intention de départ, ni bonne ni mauvaise. Tout outil a ses pratiques excessives, ses détournements dangereux. Mais en balance avec le potentiel pour l’impact positif sur la société, je pense qu’il est important de continuer à développer ces idées. Il existe déjà des applications très intéressantes. Un exemple qui m’a impressionné est [celui-ci](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21184041/minecraft-library-censored-journalism-reporters-without-borders).\n\nUtiliser, un monde virtuel pour libérer la presse dans des pays totalitaires, c’est quand même très puissant comme démarche et comme réalisation.\n\n\n---\n\n### Merci beaucoup d’être arrivé jusque là ! \n\nJ’espère que vous avez aimé cet article, si vous notez une incohérence, ou des erreurs, ou si vous souhaitez obtenir le PDF avec les références, n’hésitez pas à m’écrire un petit message.

This was the second of a series of six articles laying out how blockchain tech could prove revolutionary for the content ecosystem.*\n\nAs we’ve discussed in prior posts, Blockchain technology allows the efficient, direct transfer of digital assets between parties. For our purposes, we’ll first define “digital assets” very broadly as any binary content that someone can own, or that represents content that someone can own. For instance, a music file is a digital asset, as are text files, photos, videos, computer programs and the like.\n\nA slightly more technical — but pretty widely accepted — definition of “digital asset” is any kind of content that has been formatted in binary code and *includes the right to use that asset*. So, a legitimately-downloaded music file would fit the definition, but a pirated copy might not, because while the person with the pirated copy would have a technical \\*ability \\*to use the asset, that person does not have the legal \\*right \\*to do so. The right to use the digital asset is typically included in metadata that accompanies the file.\n\nThis is analogous to many types of real-world assets; for instance, when I purchase a new car I receive papers that transfer title to me, demonstrating ownership. However, the transfer of assets in the real world doesn’t always involve the physical delivery of the underlying asset. Often the papers representing the asset change hands, but the asset remains where it is currently located — indeed, for real estate, that’s always the case, and what changes hands is the legal right to occupy it and exclude others.\n\nOf course, transfer of records and information that represent ownership of all or some fraction of an underlying asset also occurs digitally. Yet just as with physical documents, this almost always involves intermediaries to guarantee the transfer, which introduces inefficiencies and delay into the transaction; for instance, public equities have a lag time of three days before the final transfer of the underlying securities, after a commitment for sale is made.\n\nTransfer of assets poses additional complications when the asset is a form of intellectual property. It’s easy enough to transfer a physical copy of a creative work — such as a book or a DVD — and the courts recognize the legitimacy of such transfers under the [“first sale” doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine), which allows physical copies to be bought and sold despite the fact that the original author hangs onto the underlying copyright interest. But for digital copies, the lines may become blurred because when a copy is “transferred,” as a technical matter this usually means a new copy is made on the recipient’s device, with the first copy remaining on the transferor’s device until it is deleted. In other words, technically the subsequent copy is not the same file. For this reason, courts have been reluctant to apply the first sale doctrine to digital copies, and as a result many transfers of digital works are either not allowed, or are treated as licenses rather than outright sales or assignments so that restrictions may be applied to downstream transfers.\n\nSo, how does the blockchain promise to shake these processes up? Several possible ways. First, the blockchain can be used to record transactions in which ownership of underlying content is transferred, or use of the content is being licensed. Companies such as [ascribe](https://www.ascribe.io/), [Monegraph](https://monegraph.com/), [Ujo](http://ujomusic.com/) and others are doing just that. For example, ascribe allows content creators to upload digital content, from which a cryptographic signature (a “hash”) is generated that is permanently associated with the creator, and the resulting ID is then entered on the Bitcoin blockchain (see our prior post on blockchain registries). The ascribe system then facilitates future transactions relating to the work, each of which is also entered on the blockchain such that there is an immutable record and chain of title. For a technical look at ascribe’s system, see [here](https://github.com/ascribe/spool).\n\nSecond, the blockchain can be used to generate digital “[tokens](http://bitsonblocks.net/2015/09/28/a-gentle-introduction-to-digital-tokens/)” that actually represent some or all of the underlying asset; these are sometimes called “asset-backed” tokens (not to be confused with “intrinsic” tokens like Bitcoins themselves that are built into a blockchain system as incentives — essentially the coin of the realm for that ecosystem). Such a digital asset token would be encrypted and would require the owner’s private key to be transferred. These tokens act as an IOU; present the token to the party holding the underlying asset, and you can claim your share.\n\nHow might this work in practice, in the creative industries? Imagine that Company A operates an online video service offering feature films. It sells copies of a new film to 10,000 different users. But, like many services today, the user never actually downloads the film file but simply streams it from the cloud whenever the user wishes to watch it. Each user has the right to watch the video an unlimited number of times, because this is a purchase, not a rental. Company A issues tokens to each of its 10,000 customers. Those customers can hold onto their tokens, or if they tire of the particular movie, sell their token to another party in an after-market. Because there can only ever be 10,000 unique tokens in the market (unless and until Company A sells more copies), there can never be more than 10,000 owners of a digital copy. Users simply present their valid token to Company A to watch the film. Company A does not need to keep track of its purchasers, or require individualized authentication each time a purchaser wants to watch his or her film — it just checks the token against its own key.\n\nWhile the above might seem anathema to many digital content providers in the current market, where control over the transfer of copies is a key business consideration, it is little different from, say, the physical book market, where after a reader finishes reading a novel he or she can decide to keep it for further reading or reference, or sell it at a lower cost in the used book market. Still, it is also possible that providers could sell digital tokens with embedded restrictions, and since those restrictions would travel with the digital token, they then could be readily enforced (although this might make tokens more like a digital rights management system, something we cover in our next post).", "timestamp": 1634044802, "digest": "Xlxc3sNRHN8Mfy8evJUNyC_nQQn0Pgd7abiVJhuUBYQ", "contributor": "0x538fDC0055fCeCe2e55e327A7673F9887FBC29c7"}

月上线以太坊主网。届时，主网版本的 StarkNet Alpha 将支持 Goerli 测试网版本的同样功能，功能的引入将分阶段进行。公告中写道，需要强调的两个重要方面是：\n\n* 智能合约部署需要许可：初期，合约部署将需要被许可。在接下来的几周内，StarkWare 将公布如何申请部署合约的白名单。\n* 不保证向后兼容性：预计未来从 StarkNet Alpha 到 StarkNet Beta 的过渡将包括状态的重新创世。网络将从区块 0 开始，应用程序将不得不重新部署其合约。此外，开发者和用户应注意到预期的 StarkNet Beta 可能与 StarkNet Alpha 不向后兼容，例如，开发者可能需要修改他们的合约。StarkWare

Every day, I would hop into my Ford Taurus, and drive to bookstores and wholesalers across the mid-Atlantic, to show the proprietors our upcoming titles for the next few months. I’d talk up the titles and authors I liked, show them the cover art, and then tick off in a box — on actual, physical paper — the number of units of each they wanted. It was actually a pretty good gig.\n\nWhat does that have to do with rights management using the blockchain? Stay with me.\n\nThe three-letter acronym “DRM” is a four-letter word in some circles. Digital Rights Management has come to be associated with Orwellian control and restriction of content by media companies. For a public that wants access to whatever music, images, video and text it chooses, anywhere, at any time — and preferably at low cost — the use of DRM to track and manage the dissemination of content, and especially to disable that content when usage restrictions are violated, is a frustrating impediment to gaining free access to that content.\n\nTo the extent that this sentiment tips towards the idea that all content should be free — both free of any restrictions and free of charge — this undermines the very notion of intellectual property, which is that certain creations of the human mind can be owned and protected by the creator, in a similar manner as real estate, vehicles and personal effects. (All such property protections are enforced by governments, although for copyrights and patents arguably these constitute a *better* deal for the public at large than governmental protections for tangible property, because protection for IP is limited in time and at some point will be contributed to the public domain.)\n\nSo, unless you overturn the idea of protection for IP rights altogether, owners of such rights will need to manage how they license and assign their rights, and how those rights are used by other parties. But while sometimes the arguments drift in the more extreme direction noted above, most parties who object to DRM are really objecting to three things:\n\n* The role large corporations have in the ownership and control of most of the content the public wants to watch, read, see or hear.\n* *Unreasonable* restrictions on the use of content that a user purchases or rents.\n* Use of DRM to track users and their usage.\n\nThese points are related; as the argument goes, large companies can afford to acquire vast amounts of the best available content, and then wield something like a monopoly power to impose draconian restrictions on the use of the content, both to eke out more revenue from the same content and to tie users to a particular platform or service. Those against DRM argue that DRM restricts usage by legitimate owners/renters of content, rather than protecting against piracy. And that it’s further leveraged as a tool to examine users’ habits and activities.\n\nMedia companies of course see matters differently. They make tremendous investments in creating and/or purchasing content, and then must exploit it in a market in which revenues have been squeezed by a proliferation of content sources but especially by piracy, which is a huge threat given how easy it is to copy digital works. They believe DRM is a necessary tool to prevent users who acquire content legally from turning their legitimate copy into a seed for many unauthorized copies.\n\nNot surprisingly, those who are now proposing the blockchain as a means of managing copyright ownership sometimes walk a difficult line between these two camps. On the one hand, the blockchain’s first and best use is as an immutable ledger of transactions, so it lends itself well as a method of securely tracking what rights users have to a particular digital asset, such as a song or movie, and of recording further transactions involving that asset (or user). On the other hand, the blockchain can be seen as a sort of Gozer the Destroyer of intermediaries, so in its most Libertarian form a rights management solution for the blockchain would connect creators (authors, photographers, musicians, filmmakers) directly with their audience, eliminating media companies altogether.\n\nBut let’s stop for a moment, as we may be getting ahead of ourselves. The aspect of DRM that people dislike most is the technological component that interferes with the actual playback or use of content — that is, the technology that disables your song from streaming because you are trying to listen to it on an unregistered device. While blockchain solutions could enable such technologies, most companies working in the space today are working on different, “upstream” problems — how to identify and track ownership of the content itself, and then how to identify and track the flow of that content among users. While these may one day lead to a form of technological DRM, right now most startups are focused on untangling and making more transparent who holds which rights (especially in the music industry), and allowing creators to track usage and set licensing terms for that usage.\n\nMany of these companies are focused on giving power back to the artists themselves. As musician [Imogen Heap recently said at an event also featuring Benji Rogers](http://musically.com/2016/02/02/benji-rogers-and-imogen-heap-talk-building-the-music-blockchain/):\n\n> We need to set the ethical, technological and commercial standards around how our music is used… At the moment, artists, we’re first in and last out: first in with our work, and right at the end, if we’re lucky, we get some cash back.\n\nGeorge Howard has written extensively for Forbes.com on the use of the blockchain to address these issues in the music industry; see [here for a list](http://creativeblockchain.com/further-reading/) of his articles. See also [this article](http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6655915/how-the-blockchain-could-actually-change-the-music-industry) as well as [this one](http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6664006/colu-revelator-blockchain) from Billboard.\n\nSo what about the idea of the blockchain eliminating media companies? Won’t happen. What will happen is disruption, just as it occurred when the Internet first arose. Publishing companies once maintained vast distribution networks — and yes, traveling sales reps — to market their books. Those functions, perhaps never core to the business of making good books in the first instance, have been disrupted or eliminated. Yet there’s still a place for editors who can find good authors and help them shape books into bestsellers, just as there’s still a need for companies who can marshal the resources necessary to create high-quality television series and motion pictures. Nimble companies shift their focus to the areas where they bring unique expertise and value, and embrace new technologies when disruption is inevitable.\n\nBy all appearances, the blockchain is one of those technologies.", "timestamp": 1634046686, "digest": "_V-bWgFBwqSuK5IehMwxWoDAidZ8_fNwvZCpf1tOVDY", "contributor": "0x538fDC0055fCeCe2e55e327A7673F9887FBC29c7"}

{"id": "TNBkgY49l8n3-G0FGWOugxDBrfi1Ywf0_fe1d9_HZ_Y", "title": "¿Cómo analizar datos de redes sociales?", "body": "Recientemente fue publicado un estudio de [Movilizatorio](https://www.movilizatorio.org/) en el cual se analizan diferentes conversaciones en torno a temas específicos para evaluar la polarización. Si bien celebro que haya nuevos actores en el campo y me parece fantástico que el análisis de redes se vuelva parte importante del debate público, considero que debemos someter al más alto escrutinio un informe con los sellos de calidad que ostenta y demandar de la naciente (asumo) ONG un estándar de calidad muy alto. En mi opinión, el informe no cumple con esos estándares, se limita a una estadística descriptiva en la cual se enuncia \"force atlas 2\" como una metodología (es un algoritmo para visualización, muy útil, pero no es una metodología). El informe cuenta con un modelo simple pero eficiente para definir polarización: el % de contactos que tengan lugar entre grupos o al interior de grupos. Define unos umbrales sin una justificación muy detallada (puede que sí la haya pero no está en el documento al que yo tuve acceso), y con esa métrica, sin comparar contra otras medidas de polarización, modelos mucho más elaborados (no por eso más acertados) llega a unas conclusiones bastante interesantes (como cualquier estudio empírico, con una larga lista de limitaciones que quizás falta enunciar más claramente).\n\nNo quiero sonar, tampoco, como el viejo quejumbroso que a surgido en mí durante la pandemia (quizás desde antes, la pandemia solo lo hizo evidente). Como dije, me gusta la idea de que haya actores no académicos en el análisis de redes y que fundaciones tan importantes le dediquen parte de sus recursos a estudiar el tema de las redes. Yo, personalmente, considero que la crisis de información es un reto tan grande para la humanidad como la crisis climática (y no lo digo a la ligera, lo he pensado bastante), y entre más actores, mucho mejor para todos. Necesitamos un Green Peace, un Nature Conservation Society, o equivalente, para la crisis de información. Necesitamos una convención mundial tipo Río, Johanesburgo, París, para solucionar la crisis de la información. Pero mientras eso sucede, solo nos queda la acción colectiva de la sociedad civil.\n\n[Andrés Lombana](https://twitter.com/vVvA), también ver sus [publicaciones](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3XJ0W1oAAAAJ\\&hl=es\\&oi=ao) desde una perspectiva más cualitativa y enfocada, por su interés persona, en desarrollar habilidades de tecnología en los jóvenes.\n\nDesde las ONGs y la sociedad civil, recomiendo mucho ver el trabajo de [Cristina Vélez](https://twitter.com/farfalev) de [Linterna](https://twitter.com/linterna). \n\nSin duda se me quedarán muchos nombres por fuera de esta lista, estos son apenas algunos colegas con quienes he trabajado (o intentado por lo menos), y cuyo trabajo me parece que pone en perspectiva el de Movilizatorio. \n\nPor ello he decidido hacer un taller para enseñar a usar algunas herramientas para el análisis de redes y que cualquier persona con un poco de tiempo y paciencia para configurar algunos ajustes en su computador, pueda realizar informes comparables con el de Movilizatorio o con lo que yo mismo publico con frecuencia. La idea es que entre más informes, más personas escudriñando las redes para encontrar diferentes temáticas, pues va a ser más fácil identificar esas amenazas que vivimos por cuenta de la acción colectiva perjuiciosa en redes sociales. \n\nEste texto, básicamente, un compendio de links y tutoriales para instalar y usar 2 herramientas gratuitas para el análisis de redes. No se necesita experiencia en programación. Es probable que las instrucciones no cubran casos de uso (en ciertos sistemas operativos, o errores), pero realmente son cosas que se pueden solucionar en su gran mayoría muy fácilmente, con una búsqueda en Google.\n\nEl proceso consiste en 2 fases, Instalación, y Uso, de 2 herramientas: DMI-TCAT (captura) y Gephy (visualización). Es posible usar solamente Gephy aunque de una manera mucho más limitada. \n\nIntentaré hacer unos talleres periódicos para ayudar a quien necesite instalar o analizar este tipo de información.\n\nINSTALACIÓN\n\nCREDENCIALES DE TWITTER (puede demorar \\~3 días en recibir las credenciales)\n\nAntes de empezar deben [solicitar credenciales de Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/). Para ello, ayuda dar todos los detalles que puedan, personales y de la motivación que tienen para hacer este análisis. Pueden poner un link a este tutorial y a mis páginas de investigación (quizás eso ayude un poco aunque no tengo idea), diciendo que van a tomar un taller abierto para \"Network Data Literacy to Fight Missinformation\". Entre más detalles den sobre ustedes mismos, los propósitos que tienen, y la empresa donde trabajan o estudian, más fácil le queda a Twitter saber que ustedes no son una bodega rusa. \n\n\\\nEs frecuente que Twitter responda con algunas preguntas en los próximos días antes de activar la cuenta y darles credenciales, es necesario estar pendiente del mail que llega a spam. En ocasiones esta comunicación puede tener varias interacciones donde Twitter solicita aún más información, por ello es conveniente dar toda la información posible (links a la página del trabajo, universidad, personal, etc.).\n\nDMI-TCAT\n\n[TCAT](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-tcat)\n\nEsta es la mejor herramienta que he encontrado, es una especie de front-end para manejar las bases de datos de tweets de una manera profesional. Hay que seguir los pasos para instalarlo, requiere una máquina virtual Ubuntu 18.04 (**no puede ser otra y debe ser recién instalada**). Se puede instalar en un servidor (ideal) o en una máquina virtual que corra en un computador personal. Instalar en una máquina local tiene limitaciones: seguir los tweets de las protestas, por ejemplo, puede involucrar más de un millón de trinos al día, esto rápidamente colapsa una máquina virtual local. Sin embargo, puede ser más que suficiente para un usuario que no quiera tener que lidiar con armar un servidor online. \n\nAWS\n\nPara quienes quieran instalarlo en una máquina virtual en AWS, [acá hay un tutorial.](https://archives.williamwolff.org/dmi-tcat/)\n\nWINDOWS\\\nInstalar [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)\n\nInstalar una máquina virtual de [Ubuntu 18.04 ](https://supercontra.blogspot.com/2021/07/Ubuntu%2018) : acá hay un video tutorial de cómo instalar una máquina virtual Ubuntu (el video muestra una 20.04 pero no funciona para DMI-TCAT) en Windows.\n\n[YouTube video player](https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5MhydijWmc)\n\nAbrir una terminal en la máquina virtual UBUNTO  y pasar al punto: COPIAR Y PEGAR ESTOS COMANDOS\n\nMAC\n\nPara instalarlo en un Mac, deben instalar primero [Multipass](https://multipass.run/) (es la manera más fácil que he encontrado).\n\n\\\nluego, pueden dar Manzana(command) + espacio y escriben \"Terminal\", espichan enter. Esto despliega una terminal de su Mac. En ella deben copiar y pegar este texto (editando según la capacidad de su propia máquina):\n\nmultipass launch 18.04 -n palmira -c 3 -d 20G -m 8G\n\n Esto inicializará una máquina llamada \"palmira\" con ubuntu 18.04 (los otros no funcionan) con 3 cores, 20Gb de disco y 8Gb de memoria. Yo uso un iMac con alta capacidad, esto puede ser demasiado para ciertos computadores, por ejemplo un Macbook Air. Sugiero usar 1 core y 5Gb de disco, 4Gb de memoria para empezar si no están seguros: \n\nmultipass launch 18.04 -n supercontra -c 1 -d 5G -m 4G\n\nINSTALACIÓN DMI-TCAT \n\nUna vez uno tiene la máquina virtual creada, se debe abrir una terminal de esa máquina para configurar el DMI-TCAT. No es necesario \"descargar\" DMI-TCAT, los siguientes comandos lo harán desde la terminal, son tomados del [wiki de instalación de la herramienta](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-tcat/wiki/Installation-Guide): \n\nLas instrucciones solas para los perezosos:\n\nCOPIAR Y PEGAR ESTOS COMANDOS\n\n    sudo apt-get install curl\n\n<!---->\n\n    curl -O \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-tcat/master/helpers/tcat-install-linux.sh\"\n\n``\n\n    chmod a+x tcat-install-linux.sh\n\n``\n\n    sudo ./tcat-install-linux.sh\n\nEl texto de cómo instalar, tomado del blog: \n\nTo use *curl* to download the install script, if *curl* is not not available install it using:\n\n    sudo apt-get install curl\n\nDownload the install script (the `-O`, capital-o, option saves it to a local file with the same name as the remote file):\n\n    curl -O \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-tcat/master/helpers/tcat-install-linux.sh\"\n\nMake it executable:\n\n    chmod a+x tcat-install-linux.sh\n\n#### Step 2: Run the install script\n\nThe script can be run in interactive mode, where it prompts the user for the parameters it needs:\n\n    sudo ./tcat-install-linux.sh\n\nNote: it must be run with root privileges. The above example uses the *sudo* command to do this.\n\nIt will prompt for:\n\n*   Twitter API consumer key;\n*   Twitter API consumer secret;\n*   Twitter API user token;\n*   Twitter API user secret;\n*   Mode of tweet capture to perform (phrases/keywords, follow users, or 1% sample);\n*   Whether to expand URLs in tweets or not;\n*   The name of the server;\n*   Whether to allow TCAT to automatically upgrade itself or not; and\n*   Other advanced parameters (but usually the default values for these can be used).\n\nThe name of the server is very important. It will be the name of the machine in the URL used to access the TCAT Web pages. It must be the host name or IP address of the machine TCAT is being installed on.\n\nThe script will confirm the parameters before proceeding with the install. If the values are incorrect, answer \"n\" to edit the values. Answer \"y\" to start the installation process.\n\n#### Step 3: Wait for the installation process to finish\n\nWait while the install script downloads and configures the required components. These components include the TCAT files, MySQL/MariaDB database, PHP and the Apache Web Server.\n\nThe install script, by default, will run `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade` at the start of the process, to ensure the system is up to date.\n\n**Note for Debian:** when installing on Debian, the installation process it will prompt for a \"MySQL product to configure\" when *mysql-apt-config* is installed. Press the down key on your keyboard to select \"Apply\" and then press the return key to continue.\n\nLuego de instalar DMI-TCAT, salen unas direcciones que uno debe anotar (con passwords que también deben anotar y guardar). Al copiar las direcciones y abrirlas en un navegador, vamos a tener acceso al front-end de la herramienta, la cual interactúa con una base de datos SQL generada a partir de los datos descargados de Twitter. \n\nEn la herramienta de configuración (un link en la parte superior derecha de la pantalla) debemos agregar un \"bin\" con las palabras \"keywords\" que va a descargar. La herramienta descarga automáticamente y genera una base de datos con estas keywords. **SUGIERO EMPEZAR CON 2 ó 3 SOLAMENTE**. Agregar demasiadas puede resultar en bloqueos a la cuenta.\n\nEste es un video para interactuar con la herramienta (que al principio debe estar vacía):\n\n[YouTube video player](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ex97eoorUeo)\n\nVISUALIZAR LAS REDES\n\nPara visualizar las redes, la mejor herramienta es [Gephi](https://gephi.org/), un programa en beta desarrollado como un ejercicio de verano en Google, sobre Jython. Está lleno de bugs y no es muy intuitivo, pero vale la pena porque son las mejores visualizaciones que se pueden hacer de redes, y muchas veces un análisis descriptivo como el que se hace en Gephi es suficiente para representar fenómenos de redes que se hacen muy evidentes. \n\n[YouTube video player](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vryp2yCgC4Y)\\\n\n\n[YouTube video player](https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSx5\\_PjaWVE)\n\nPara participar en los talleres (que sucederán esporádicamente, cada vez que pueda), pueden llenar este formato para que les compartamos un link.\n\nNOTA: Acepto ayuda de personas que ya hayan instalado la herramienta y quieran ayudar, estos talleres son más útiles si hay varias personas en la sala respondiendo preguntas. \n", "timestamp": 1634047720, "digest": "o8LW7h4vdP2psWN0cFT435iS9Le2Py_qSh3WE-xWOa8", "contributor": "0xe990946FB4D405486Fb97ddf642d3550477cE12A"}

This was the fourth in a series of six articles laying out how blockchain tech could prove revolutionary for the content ecosystem.*\n\n> The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.\n\nThus says Shakespeare’s Dick the butcher in *[Henry VI](http://goo.gl/R6ByXz)*[, Part 2](http://goo.gl/R6ByXz). It is unlikely that the Bard of Avon was predicting the Blockchain back in 1591, but when it comes to the concept of smart contracts, it must be noted that in some capacities attorneys are intermediaries, and as we’ve discussed in prior posts, you don’t want to be a middleman when B-Day arrives for your industry.\n\nBut we don’t have to write off the legal industry just yet. While smart contracts mediated by the blockchain may soon supplant some types of existing agreements, we have a very long way to go before a smart contract on the blockchain will be able to take the place of an arms-length negotiation between parties involving complex terms.\n\nStill, the concept of smart contracts is rapidly advancing, and has the potential to cause significant disruptions to the creative industries, especially in the context of rights management and royalty payments systems.\n\nSo what is a smart contract?\n\nJust like pretty much everything else in the blockchain world, a smart contract is a piece of code. Software. It’s not a true contract, in the legal sense, at least as of yet. In its simplest terms, a smart contract is a piece of code that two or more parties program to cause certain actions to happen as a result of specific conditions that occur or do not occur. A simple Bitcoin transaction is essentially a smart contract — two parties agree that a certain amount of Bitcoins will pass from one to the other upon signature by both parties.\n\nHere’s an example of a slightly more complex smart contract. I sell a piece of digital artwork to a collector. The purchase price is to be paid in installments. The payment schedule is baked into a smart contract, and as the dates come up, the payments pass to me. After a certain amount of payments are made, the artwork itself passes to the collector (see our prior post on asset transfer).\n\nYou might be asking: but what’s the difference between this and just having the collector set up automatic payments to me from his bank? And couldn’t I set up a system with an escrow service to transfer the artwork once my account hits the right balance? Maybe I could even create computer script to automate that transfer on my end, if I was so inclined.\n\nThe short answer is, yes, all of this is possible using other methods. The difference is that without a smart contract, each party is conducting separate transactions, and each party (or its agent) controls those independent transactions. The collector can always call his or her bank and cancel the payments. I can change my own system so that transfer occurs on a different trigger, or not at all. To overcome these possibilities, the collector and I will have entered into a legal contract promising to uphold our portions of the bargain (which may or may not specify the technical means by which we comply). If one of us fails to live up to our side of the bargain, the legal document will give us the right to enforce the contract’s provisions in court. It cannot actually physically stop one of us from reneging.\n\nBy contrast, a smart contract is an agreement that “lives” on a system that is not controlled by either party or that party’s agents. Ideally, both the digital asset being transferred and the currency/assets used for the purchase also live on that system. The contract itself is a self-executing transaction between the parties triggered by events that can be definitively determined to have happened or not. For instance, April 7 arrives, a payment amount is transferred. When the amount transferred equals a certain amount, the underlying asset transfers. No other parties are involved — the distributed ledger ensures that all transactions are verified by multiple participants, and only transactions that follow the smart contract’s rules will be confirmed.\n\nSmart contracts thus lend themselves to definable conditions, and fairly straightforward “If X then Y” logic. Once a condition or “input” becomes subject to any type of judgment call for which a human might be needed, smart contracts cease to be a viable solution (at least at present; one can certainly imagine a future where artificial intelligence agents make some of those calls).\n\nOne often-discussed “use case” for smart contracts is that of music royalties, the theory being that self-executing contracts on the blockchain will allow for a more transparent flow of royalties with fewer intermediaries between the copyright owners and artists and the consumers.\n\nHere’s the idea. It takes multiple parties to create a sound recording. There is the composer of the music and usually a separate lyricist who must together grant a composition license to any party that wants to make the sound recording. To make that sound recording, multiple artists/performers will be involved, along with producers and others. But that’s just the beginning of the story; as Jamie Barlett writing for *The Guardian* recently put it:\n\n> The structure of modern music production is Kafkaesque. An artist might sign a deal with a record label. In between them and the music fan there could be the label’s parent company, distributors and hundreds of music services, each taking a cut. There are sync rights, mechanical royalties, performance royalties. Consumers and music services pay different amounts for streaming, downloads and physical sales, and different amounts again to songwriters via collecting societies and publishers. Different deals can be struck in different territories. Add to that a mild obsession with non-disclosure agreements and it can be close to impossible for musicians to work out what they are owed.\n\nOthers, including [the U.S. Copyright Office](http://goo.gl/obhR6m) and the [Rethink Music Initiative at the Berklee Institute of Creative Entrepreneurship](https://goo.gl/htZlSR), have recently addressed the state of the music industry in this regard.\n\nBut the point in the context of smart contracts is that the parties who create music can embed licensing terms into these self-executing contracts, and when consumers purchase music the royalties can flow immediately to each of the participating parties. No middlemen will be needed to process the transactions or, possibly, the distribution of the content itself. [Imogen Heap](http://imogenheap.com/mycelia/), working with start-up [Ujo](http://ujomusic.com/), recently released a single, *[Tiny Human](https://alpha.ujomusic.com/#/imogen_heap/tiny_human/tiny_human)*, as a test case for a blockchain-based distribution and royalty system. Articles on that effort [here](http://www.theguardian.com/membership/2015/oct/02/live-stream-imogen-heap-releases-tiny-human-using-blockchain-technology), [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgehoward/2015/07/17/imogen-heaps-mycelia-an-artists-approach-for-a-fair-trade-music-business-inspired-by-blockchain/#48e8e5c55912), and [here](http://goo.gl/O0iGlP).\n\nWhere does the law itself come into all of this? That’s still an open question. Companies currently offering smart contract solutions approach the legal overlay in different ways. We’ll address this important issue in later posts. Suffice it to say that there will likely be somewhat of a messy interface, at least initially, between the somewhat Utopian vision of a freely operating system of smart contracts and existing laws.\n\nInterestingly, that quote about lawyers from Shakespeare comes on the heels of a speech by Jack Cade, a rebel against Henry VI, who in a comic scene lays out his personal Utopia, where England is reformed for the common people (but with Cade as king), with inexpensive food, and good beer. Jack says:\n\n> there shall be no money; all shall eat and drink on my score, and I will apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree like brothers….\n\nMaybe Shakespeare was thinking about the blockchain after all.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\n* [A Gentle Introduction to Smart Contracts](http://bitsonblocks.net/2016/02/01/a-gentle-introduction-to-smart-contracts/)\n* [Nick Szabo’s 1997 seminal piece on smart contracts](http://goo.gl/MkXXiW)\n* [What Are Smart Contracts?

This was the fifth in a series of six articles laying out how blockchain tech could prove revolutionary for the content ecosystem.*\n\nWould you be willing to pay me **a couple of cents** for reading this article?\n\nIn a nutshell, that’s the premise of micropayments: Everyone pays a small amount — potentially fractions of a cent — for each piece of digital content they consume.\n\nThere are essentially three revenue models for digital content:\n\n1. **Offer a specific piece of content for purchase or rent at a set price.**\n2. **Offer a larger pool of content for a subscription fee.**\n3. **Offer content for free, supported by ad revenue.**\n\nThe beauty of micropayments is that theoretically they can open up the first revenue model to a wider array of content. If adopted widely, they can also potentially allow for more dynamic (or at least much lower) pricing for **all** types of content, including professionally-produced music, television, film and books.\n\nThe idea of micropayments is hardly new. They’ve existed in the physical world for a long time, anywhere that high volume and cash payments come together. Even better, they exist where the payments can be made and the products can be delivered mechanically, without human intervention. Here’s a classic example:\n\n![gumball](https://miro.medium.com/max/520/0\\*6RpW2hBgzWU0qJuM.jpg)\n\nFor digital content, micropayments were first proposed in the 1990s as Internet usage was burgeoning, and many large companies began developing micropayment solutions in anticipation of widespread adoption. That never happened. The closest we’ve come to micropayments in broad use is the 99 cents (sometimes even a bit less) that consumers routinely pay for apps and songs on the various online stores offered by Apple, Google, Amazon and the like.\n\nNewspapers, magazines and other text content have had more difficulty finding a similar model, although the start-up [Blendle](https://launch.blendle.com/) is one of the [latest attempts to make micropayments work](http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2014/05/online-media) (in Blendle’s case, by having consumers pre-fund an account from which the payments are taken).\n\nWhy has the promise of micropayments not been borne out in the past, and why does blockchain technology offer a new hope for this concept? Two words: ***Transaction costs***.\n\nLet’s take Apple’s iTunes store, one of the few successful models. If a consumer buys a song for 99 cents, Apple [reportedly keeps about a third](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/11/steve-jobs-tries-to-downplay-the-itunes-stores-profit/?_r=0) — maybe around 35 cents. The rest goes to the labels and music publishers, and finally a portion to the artist (estimates suggest around 10 cents per download). For each individual transaction, however, credit card companies apparently [charge Apple around 25 cents](http://www.thevlyhouse.com/2011/01/the-itunes-business-model-and-its-widespread-effects/).\n\nWhile Apple has developed software that delays payments and groups together transactions from a particular user over a few days, so that Apple only pays one transaction fee for multiple transactions, as you can see, it’s difficult to drive payments much lower using traditional billing methods. And remember, for Apple, the driving reason for the store is not to make money from downloads, but to drive sales and adoption of its much more expensive devices.\n\nAs we’ve [discussed previously](http://goo.gl/N918Bk), **blockchain technology theoretically reduces transaction charges by allowing trusted transactions directly between parties, without the need for intermediaries**. There’s still a cost involved in transactions — essentially the infrastructure costs of whatever blockchain network is being used — but it can be magnitudes lower than current transaction costs. For instance, small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain currently might cost a few cents. But there are [solutions being developed](http://www.coindesk.com/lightning-duplex-scalable-bitcoin-micropayments/) that might drop even these costs dramatically.\n\nUltimately, a micropayment system can be combined with a [digital asset registry](http://goo.gl/VTds2U) and a [rights management](http://goo.gl/VRFhmc)/[smart contract](http://goo.gl/18Yn8h) system, all using blockchain technology, to allow a content provider to release new content with embedded mechanisms for how underlying rights are transferred and used, and how payments are made to each of the parties responsible for developing the content. That’s precisely the type of structure being developed by companies like [Monegraph](https://monegraph.com/), [ascribe](https://www.ascribe.io/), [Ujo](http://ujomusic.com/), [Stem](https://stem.is/), and others.\n\nOne can imagine a future where micropayments become the norm for all digital content, leading to a true consumption-based model that means consumers pay only for the content they actually care about, rather than subscribing to packages of content or wading through advertisements in order to consume individual pieces of content.\n\nBut there are many issues yet to be worked out before that can occur. Some are systemic, reflecting many years of doing business in a particular way, resulting in a bias against change. But others may be fundamental to user behavior. For instance, while Apple’s 99 cent music downloads can be deemed a success on some fronts, it is also widely blamed for severely damaging the music industry, by simultaneously driving up demand and consumption, while ripping apart the prior pricing structures. By convincing consumers to pay 99 cents for a single song, Apple caused more lucrative (to the artist and label) album sales to plummet.\n\nIn other words, when consumers can access only the specific content they truly want, and operate in a kind of online echo chamber, they may go looking for (or stumble across) other content less often. Newspapers and magazines know this well, and have resisted breaking apart their content into smaller consumable pieces, lest the scope of their coverage shrink towards the vanishing point.\n\nAnother question is whether consumers themselves will ever be ready for micropayments. In 1996, [Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo) — the creator of Bitcoin forerunner Bitgold, an early proponent of [smart contracts](http://goo.gl/18Yn8h), as well as a candidate for the still-anonymous creator of Bitcoin itself, “[Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto)” — wrote about the “mental transaction costs” of micropayments. In his [paper](http://szabo.best.vwh.net/berlinmentalmicro.pdf), Szabo argued that the ability of humans to work out whether a transaction makes sense itself imposes a barrier on adoption of micropayments.\n\nIn 2000, Craig Shirky wrote [an influential article](http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/12/19/micropayments.html?page=1) on the mental cost of micropayments, also arguing that users hate them and that they will never be adopted:\n\n> \\[U\\]sers want predictable and simple pricing. Micropayments, meanwhile, waste the users’ mental effort in order to conserve cheap resources, by creating many tiny, unpredictable transactions. Micropayments thus create in the mind of the user both anxiety and confusion, characteristics that users have not heretofore been known to actively seek out.\n\nOne could argue that Apple solved this mental transaction problem by creating the flat price of 99 cents for music downloads. Had it instead implemented dynamic pricing, one can imagine that consumer confusion over pricing — even if in the long run it might drive individual prices lower — might have killed the whole thing right off the bat.\n\nBut one can also imagine systems where micropayments much lower than 99 cents, with some form of dynamic pricing working behind the scenes, might become the norm. Combined with smart contracts and blockchain-based management systems, they might well come to define a new ecosystem of content consumption.\n\nAnyway, that’s my two cents.", "timestamp": 1634048938, "digest": "2cizzyY-uCwPhyNB7MB8edDAYMuNLK5-h-Che_DBOG8", "contributor": "0x538fDC0055fCeCe2e55e327A7673F9887FBC29c7"}

This was the last in a series of six articles laying out how blockchain tech could prove revolutionary for the content ecosystem.*\n\nOver the past few weeks, we’ve introduced one by one the primary ways in which blockchain technology may impact the creative industries. To recap, here are the areas we’ve covered:\n\n* [Proof of Creation, Ownership and First Use](http://goo.gl/DzbuJx)\n* [Transfers of Digital Assets and Tokens](http://goo.gl/VTds2U)\n* [Rights Management](http://goo.gl/VRFhmc)\n* [Smart Contracts](http://goo.gl/18Yn8h)\n* [Micropayments](http://goo.gl/Ps50J6)\n\nAs discussed, there are individuals and companies focused on all of the above areas — for the growing list, check out our [Current Blockchain Projects In The Arts page](http://goo.gl/HyjAua) (and if we’ve left yours out, please let us know).\n\nThe areas we’ve discussed for the most part involve what happens to artistic works ***after*** they have been created — how are they registered, transferred, managed, paid for, etc. But a technology that provides for secure transactions between parties may also provide a platform for parties **who wish to work together on creative projects**, and also for parties **who wish to incorporate existing works into new and different works**. So today we’ll discuss:\n\n**Creative Collaboration**\n\nFirst, bear with me for a little copyright background. Jump past the italicized text below if you know all of this already\n\n*There are a variety of ways in which parties collaborate to produce artistic content:*\n\n***Joint works.***\\* Two or more individuals may contribute to a unified work and agree that their contributions be deemed as equal — under copyright law, this is known as **joint authorship**. An example is two screenwriters collaborating on a script, where both share credit as authors.\\*\n\n*The U.S. Copyright Act defines a “joint work” as*\n\n> *a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole. \\[Note that in the copyright context “author” always means any creator of original content, whether it’s a photographer, sculptor, filmmaker, etc.\\]*\n\n*If this mutual intent exists, both authors will be considered joint owners of an **undivided interest** in work, meaning that either author can exploit the whole work without consent of the other author(s), with only a duty to share equally any royalties earned. However, a joint author can only license the work on a nonexclusive basis to third parties — in order to give a third party the exclusive right to use the work, all of the joint authors must agree.*\n\n***Collective works.***\\* Authors and artists and musicians and filmmakers can also make their own contributions to a collective work, such as a compilation. In this case, the individual authors retain copyright in their contribution, but the party that puts together the collection will be deemed the author of the whole, including edits, the selection and arrangement of the pirces, introductory and connecting material, etc. The creator of the collective works is given the right to use the individual contributions only in the collective work, as well as in later editions of that collective work.\\*\n\n*The Copyright Act defines “collective work” as*\n\n> *a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole*\n\n***Derivative works.***\\* The history of artistic creation is also the history of borrowing and building upon the work of others. The concept of a derivative work recognizes that some new works are based heavily on an already-existing work. A film derives from a screenplay. A musical arrangement derives from the original composition. A YouTube video mash-up **may** be seen as derivative of multiple underlying pieces of music and video.\\*\n\n*To create a derivative work, the creator must have permission to use the underlying, original work, unless he or she “transforms” the underlying work so substantially that the law will recognize it as its own, unique new creation. Thousands of pages of ink have been spilled by litigants and judges over where to draw this “fair use” line, and we won’t delve into that here. Today, we’re more concerned with collaborative efforts where a new author wants permission to incorporate an existing piece of text, music, photography, art, film, etc. into a new work.*\n\n*The formal definition of “derivative work” under the Copyright Act is*\n\n> *a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted.*\n\n## **Creative Collaboration Using Blockchain Technology**\n\nWhen disputes arise between joint authors, between authors and creators of collective works, or between authors and creators of derivative works, those disputes generally boil down to either a misunderstanding as to the parties’ rights and interests (sometimes because those rights have not been carefully set forth), or a deliberate attempt by one party to exceed the scope of their rights. Thus, any system that promises more transparency into initial ownership, what rights have or can be granted, and what transactions have occurred involving those rights, stands to curb such disputes.\n\nThe blockchain does promise this transparency. Let’s start with joint works. The key legal issue in determining joint authorship is the parties’ **intent**. To the extent that blockchain-based systems make it easier for collaborators to create works with rights information baked in at the inception, authors can clearly indicate their intent to create a joint work as it’s created.\n\nI think that it’s quite likely that we’ll see word processing programs, music and video production platforms, and other content creation systems built on top of blockchain technology in the near future (or maybe at least plug-ins that allow a work being created to be registered and/or imbued with key rights info at a click? Where’s a blockchain developer when I need one…).\n\nWhile centralized client-server systems may still be preferable — for multiple technical reasons — in local environments like the workplace, at the very least collaborative efforts between users in different locations could well benefit from a blockchain-based underpinning, which would allow owners/creators to mutually decide how to proceed and lock their decisions in place.\n\nThis would not just be for joint works. Works contributed to a collective work would also be more traceable and identifiable — which for instance could be very valuable if a third party later saw a particular piece they liked in the collective work and wanted to use it themselves for some other purpose, and could easily identify the owner and license the necessary rights. More importantly, creators will be able to embed terms regarding how works can be used (or not) for subsequent derivative works, and easily track the usage of their works in such derivatives.\n\nWith the ability to securely identify, record and track each contributor a particular creative works creation and developments, one can imagine that many platforms could be built that might enable forms of collaboration we have not even dreamed up yet.\n\nHere’s a far-flung example. One concept that’s been discussed in the blockchain context is a [distributed autonomous corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization), which is sort of a company run without human control (and without a centralized control at all, but rather operating pursuant to a distributed set of rules). For a DAC, humans contribute specific tasks that cannot be performed by computers, and are automatically paid for performing those tasks. In the future, the production of digital films or musical works might be a candidate for a DAC, at least in part — humans would perform all of the various creative tasks (including editing or mixing etc. through to the final version) but automated agents would handle transmission of portions to the various collaborators, record interim versions to the blockchain, and might for instance finalize the ultimate digital files for distribution. The point is there would be no production “company” overseeing things, but rather an assembled group of humans who each agree to perform their own creative tasks under an agreed set of rules with a clear view of how much they will be paid and what rights they will have in the released content. Almost like a co-operative association, but decentralized and partially automated. And the collaborators could do the work from anywhere in the world.\n\nSounds a bit sci-fi, and for now it probably is. When I open the first Decentralized Autonomous Law Firm™, I’ll let you know.", "timestamp": 1634049550, "digest": "ysD1_tDCtNMczY6M4n51H-0gQcmzaXaw3gZYkDbpnQc", "contributor": "0x538fDC0055fCeCe2e55e327A7673F9887FBC29c7"}

Please don't take automation as the bible for passing audits you must ensure that controls that are inline with your industry and your organization in most cases controls are related to regulations.**\n\nCloud Security Compliance in a lot of enterprises has not been planned and thought out ahead of time. Basically, organizations wait until some audit comes around and then everyone rushes to ensure they are compliant, just to pass either their internal audit or external audit.\n\nHumans start running around in a circle to remediate issues that that they deemed related to “compliance” or “security”, hiring vendors and contractors to perform in this elaborate production to ensure that they pass their audit, but in reality it’s just another play going on at The Risk [Management Theatre](https://continuousdelivery.com/2013/08/risk-management-theatre/).\n\nIn [Agile compliance](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/compliance/) focused enterprises and business, compliance and security solutions are incrementally built, and in most cases codified. Now the Security team members are no longer just actors performing, but they are truly implementing value added actions, thus the illusion of security and/or compliance is not just a bunch of written documentation that can’t be measured or validated.\n\nThe traditional way of implementing security compliance the waterfall model, whereas full patterns and controls must be defined and committed in detail. This is not the agile model nor can it scale in this fast pace ever changing public cloud environment.\n\nI do understand that not all companies are ready to move to a strictly automated event driven security model, nor do I recommend it. However, I do recommend at least a partially automated workflow to optimize security team capabilities.\n\nThis article is the first of a two part editorial for those companies that still follow a quasi-waterfall model and want to enhance their compliance posture by using an automated workflow solution.\n\nIn this article, I will describe a few components to integrate your Cloud Continuous Security model. The bulk of these services are native to the AWS environment, and are often overlooked for vendor tools. In most cases these vendor tools integrate with AWS native Security solutions.\n\nFor this solution, I will be using AWS Config, Config Rules, AWS System Manager, SSM Automated Document, and Jira.\n\nBelow is a description of each service in more detail:\n\n**AWS Config — **AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations [\\[source\\]](https://aws.amazon.com/config/)\n\n**AWS Custom Config Rules -**AWS Config provides *AWS managed rules*, which are predefined, customizable rules that AWS Config uses to evaluate whether your AWS resources comply with common best practices. For example, you could use a managed rule to quickly start assessing whether your Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes are encrypted or whether specific tags are applied to your resources. You can set up and activate these rules without writing the code to create an AWS Lambda function, which is required if you want to create custom rules. The AWS Config console guides you through the process of configuring and activating a managed rule. You can also use the AWS Command Line Interface or AWS Config API to pass the JSON code that defines your configuration of a managed rule. [\\[source\\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_use-managed-rules.html)\n\n**AWS System Manager- **AWS Systems Manager gives you visibility and control of your infrastructure on AWS. Systems Manager provides a unified user interface so you can view operational data from multiple AWS services and allows you to automate operational tasks across your AWS resources. With Systems Manager, you can group resources, like [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instances, [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) buckets, or [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) instances, by application, view operational data for monitoring and troubleshooting, and take action on your groups of resources. Systems Manager simplifies resource and application management, shortens the time to detect and resolve operational problems, and makes it easy to operate and manage your infrastructure securely at scale. [\\[source\\]](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\n\n**AWS System Manager Automation Document -**Systems Manager Automation document defines the Automation workflow (the actions that Systems Manager performs on your managed instances and AWS resources). Automation includes several pre-defined Automation documents that you can use to perform common tasks like restarting one or more Amazon EC2 instances or creating an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Documents use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or YAML, and they include steps and parameters that you specify. Steps run in sequential order. [\\[source\\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html)\n\nNow that you are familiar with the tools that I will utilize for this solution, in the following article [Remediating Noncompliant AWS Resources using AWS Native Tools](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/remediating-noncompliant-aws-resources-using-native-tools-artis/) I walk through the implementation.\n", "timestamp": 1634052102, "digest": "ULawMO3jH55XC3ERje-fLB3VOUEgo36mL2lx2g8qHwE", "contributor": "0xBA555C40F3B1A87a4835BF134e7B3E56c57EbC4A"}

The Security Compliance team has mandated that all resources in AWS be tagged. If a resource is not tagged a Jira Issue should be created and assigned to the SOC team.***\n\n***The Cloud Operations team has already enabled AWS Config in all accounts as their Cloud Asset and Resource management tool. The organization has requested that the Cloud Security Engineers implement a solution that will be used as the automated baseline.***\n\n### AWS Config\n\n![AWS CONFIG ENABLED](//:0)\n\nIn Jira, create an API token and make sure that you copy the key, as this key will be used in the next step.\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](//:0)\n\n**AWS System Manager Parameter Store** provides secure hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management.

IvacyVPN\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*3GL4Nqaxcq2Yyu5mgBhtmw.jpeg)\n\nIvacyVPN是**最便宜**的VPN（5年的套餐价格），同时也支持翻墙国外和翻墙回国。在官方推荐的国内可用的服务器中，基本都能快速连接上，速度都还不错，观看Netflix流畅。但要注意的是：在中国国内某些地区，速度会不太稳定，需要自行测试，如实在不行，可以利用30天无条件退款。\n\n**[访问IvacyVPN官网>>>](https://5best1s.com/IvacyVPN)**\n\n👉 IvacyVPN详细评测，请查阅**[Ivacy VPN — 在中国国内可用吗？](https://5best1s.com/is-ivacy-vpn-available-in-china/)**\n\n## 功能说明\n\n## 退款保证\n\n由于中国地幅辽阔，而且宽带服务提供商众多，所以最稳妥的方式就是用户在实地进行安装测试，以保证最佳体验。上面介绍的VPN中，只有AstrillVPN不提供退款保证，**[PandaVPN](https://5best1s.com/PandaVPN)**提供7天内的退款，其它的都至少提供30天无条件退款。\n\n## 月度计划\n\n如果您只是去中国短期旅行，那么购买一个月的VPN服务是您的最佳选择。由于各大VPN服务商的月度计划非常相似，建议您使用**[ExpressVPN](https://5best1s.com/ExpressVPN)**。\n\n## 年度计划\n\n不同VPN服务商的年度计划，价格差异非常大。**[威伯斯云](https://5best1s.com/vps000-review/)**只需预付180天即可享受最优惠的价格，**[低至￥21.6/月](https://5best1s.com/VPS000)**，十分人性化的订购时长和价格。**[IvacyVPN](https://5best1s.com/IvacyVPN)**有个5年计划，价格低至每月1.33元美金，可以说是所有正规VPN服务商里，价格最便宜的（需注意Ivacy VPN在中国国内某些地区不太稳定）。\n\n> **友情提示：有时VPN服务商会有个隐藏计划，当您在页面停留10秒钟以上，或移动鼠标到关闭页面的位置（假装退出的动作），就会有不定期的优惠隐藏计划弹窗出来。**\n\n## 支持\n\n由于中国国内严格的审查制度，当VPN无法使用时，很多时候需要支持团队的协助。根据我的使用经验，以及网友们的反馈，**[ExpressVPN](https://5best1s.com/ExpressVPN)**一直都提供最快速有效的支持，而**[威伯斯云](https://5best1s.com/VPS000)**全年都能保持稳定高速，神一般的存在。\n\n## 服务器数量\n\n服务器越多，意味着使用同一服务器的用户的可能性越小，从而减小速度变慢和连接中断的可能性。在这方面，**[NordVPN](https://5best1s.com/NordVPN)**是提供服务器最多的一家，**[ExpressVPN](https://5best1s.com/ExpressVPN)**是服务器分布最广且合理的服务商，**[威伯斯云](https://5best1s.com/VPS000)**由于其特性，并不用服务器中转，而是直接走Cisco路由器，因此在全球任何地区都能使用。\n\n## 有服务器的国家/地区\n\n当您需要访问特定的国家/地区时，此项指标非常重要，意味着你可以变身更多国家的IP地址。同时，当您在不同国家公干或旅游时，可以找到物理距离尽可能近的服务器，提高访问速度。在中国附近，拥有最多服务器的VPN服务商是**[ExpressVPN](https://5best1s.com/ExpressVPN)**。而**[威伯斯云](https://5best1s.com/VPS000)**在全球任何地方皆可使用。\n\n## 浏览器扩展程序\n\n**[Google Chrome](https://5best1s.com/vpn-for-chrome/)**, Mozilla Firefox, Safari是目前使用最多的浏览器，我推荐大家使用**[Brave](https://5best1s.com/Brave)**浏览器，它最大的优点是除了浏览速度是Chorme和Firefox的三倍以外，还能有效地阻止广告和跟踪，最大限度地保护用户隐私！具体可参阅**[我的常用软件 | 常用软件清单](https://5best1s.com/my-favorite-software/)。**\n\n这些浏览器都支持添加小程序（扩展程序），这些小程序能在浏览网页时，提供更方便快捷的工具。某些VPN为这些浏览器提供了扩展，这些扩展用于控制VPN并在浏览网页时轻松地从浏览器查看连接状态。尽管这不是必需的选项，但是它能让您使用VPN变得轻松，**[ExpressVPN](https://5best1s.com/ExpressVPN)**是支持浏览器扩展最多的一个。\n\n## 加密协议\n\n**[加密协议](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china/#%E4%B8%BB%E8%A6%81%E5%8A%A0%E5%AF%86%E5%8D%8F%E8%AE%AE%E8%A7%A3%E9%87%8A)**对于避免审查和提高安全性很重要。拥有多种加密协议将确保您有更多武器来躲避长防火墙，因为某些加密协议有时可能无法正常工作。在中国国内，**[ExpressVPN](https://5best1s.com/ExpressVPN)**新推出的**[Lightway](https://5best1s.com/lightway%e5%b7%b2%e6%ad%a3%e5%bc%8f%e4%b8%8a%e5%b8%82/)**表现最好。\n\n\\*\\*延伸阅读：\\*\\*👉 **[Lightway VS Wireguard VS OpenVPN比较](https://5best1s.com/lightway-vs-wireguard-vs-openvpn/)**\n\n## 同时连接设备数量\n\n由于个人拥有的电子产品越来越多，个人电脑、手机、平板等设备都需要使用VPN，因此同时连接这些设备到VPN是必需的，这样可以让您不必退出某些设备的账号。\n\n## 是否保留日志（零日志）\n\n大多数VPN服务商都宣称自己不保留日志，这不仅是为客户着想（也是一个很好的卖点），而且对他们自身也很有好处（因为快速增长的日志记录会极大地消耗服务器磁盘空间）。\n\n但如果**[VPN服务商出于贩卖用户数据为目的](https://5best1s.com/5-signs-if-vpn-is-trustworthy-or-not/#%E6%A3%80%E6%9F%A5%E8%BF%87%E5%BE%80%E8%AE%B0%E5%BD%95)**，那就另当别论了。所以我们应选择专注于提供VPN业务的服务商。\n\n## 基本概念\n\n突破**网络审查**或**网络封锁**，就是俗称的**翻墙**、**科学上网**、**魔法上网**等。\n\n突破网络审查的软件通常被称作**翻墙软件**、俗称**梯子**。\n\n**加速器**，分为两种情况：\n\n1. 打擦边球，其实就是VPN，但在国内政策越来越严格的大环境下，许多服务商已经被封禁；\n2. 专门用于游戏加速，不能用于访问国内封锁的网页或内容。\n\n翻墙软件指通过网络代理（比如**[VPN](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china/#VPN%E6%98%AF%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%EF%BC%9F)**）突破某些国家对于的网络屏蔽。常见的翻墙软件如下：\n\n* 由服务商打包好直接给用户用于翻墙，及保护个人隐私和数据加密的**[VPN工具](https://5best1s.com/#vpn_ranking)**。\n* 服务商只提供可供连接的服务器，需要用户自行下载软件配置的工具，较著名的此类工具**[Shadowsocks 、 ShadowsocksR、V2Ray](https://5best1s.com/ssr-node-recommended/)** 、**[Trojan](https://5best1s.com/trojan-go/)**等。\n* 有些服务商也会将SSR/V2ray封装成一个类似VPN的商业软件，省却用户自己设置客户端的麻烦，如**[PandaVPN](https://5best1s.com/pandavpn-review/)**就是属于这类。\n\n注：上述第2种的服务商其实就是俗称的**[机场](https://5best1s.com/ssr-node-recommended/)**。\n\n## VPN是什么？\n\n**[VPN](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E8%99%9B%E6%93%AC%E7%A7%81%E4%BA%BA%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF)**是**V**irtual **P**rivate **N**etwork的英文缩写，中文称为虚拟私人网络。\n\n在中国国内，VPN应用得最多的是作为翻墙软件（虽然VPN的作用远不如此，具体查阅本文的**[VPN优缺点](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china/#vpn-advantages)**），也就是俗称的科学上网，以帮助用户跨越国内防火墙的封锁，访问**[Google](https://www.google.com/)**（谷歌）、**[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)**（脸书）、**[Twitter](https://twitter.com/)**（推特）、**[YouTuBe](https://www.youtube.com/)**（油管）、**[Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)**（奈飞）、**[维基百科](https://zh.wikipedia.org/)**等平台。\n\n虽然翻墙的工具五花八门，但在中国国内，使用VPN作为翻墙或科学上网的工具占50%以上。\n\n为什么会有如此众多的人使用VPN呢？主要原因如下：\n\n* VPN历史悠久，早期翻墙的用户都是使用VPN，已深入民心，被广大人民所接受。\n* VPN厂商众多，打开Google应用商店，搜索VPN的结果有一大堆，可惜的是绝大部分都不能在中国国内顺滑地使用。\n* VPN安装设置都很简单，无需太多技术知识都可以安装使用。\n* 有的服务商使用的协议并不是VPN（例如本文介绍的**[PandaVPN](https://5best1s.com/PandaVPN)**），但出于认知度的原因，也利用VPN的名称来推广。\n* 还有一些服务商，改叫为加速器，例如游戏加速器或上网加速器。\n\nVPN的流量特征十分明显，其实几年前已被GFW识别并被封锁，这也是为什么从那时起，很多国内的VPN厂商被迫关停的最大原因。当然，也和政府出台了相关法规有关。\n\n这也就引申出了VPN之外的翻墙手段，目前主流的翻墙方式是，采用基于Socks5代理的Shadowsocks、ShadowsocksR、V2ray、Trojan。\n\n## VPN的优缺点\n\nVPN的优点除了上面分析的原因外，VPN相对于基于Socks5代理的工具，**主要优势**有以下几点：\n\n* 原理上，由于VPN是较为底层的协议，又或者说可以虚拟出一个网卡进行连接，所以是真正意义上的全局代理，这意味着网络设备上几乎所有的流量，都会被VPN接管。**应用场景**：游戏或媒体直播等，都需要用到底层协议，所以使用VPN可以无缝连接。还有就是Windows应用商店和UWP应用，都需要用到底层协议。\n* **[真正做到隐身](https://5best1s.com/hide-ip/)**，在外部第三方检测你的网络设备时，设备的IP地址只会显示VPN服务器的地址。**应用场景**：在**[观看Netflix](https://5best1s.com/watch-netflix-in-china/)**或Hulu等流媒体服务时，可以使用VPN“欺骗”它们，以观看其他国家/地区的节目。同理，也适用于电商平台促销时，只针对某一国家/地区的打折活动。还有就是加密货币爱好者，在**[Bybit](https://5best1s.com/Bybit)**上进行加密货币交易时，美国、魁北克（加拿大）、新加坡、古巴、克里米亚、塞瓦斯托波尔、伊朗、叙利亚、朝鲜、苏丹这些国家/地区不能进行交易，就要用到VPN。最后就是**[种子下载](https://5best1s.com/best-torrent-sites/)**，由于涉及版权等原因，需要隐匿自己的身份，以保证安全。延伸阅读：**[如何购买比特币并保存？- 币安购买比特币及转入Ledger冷钱包完全指南](https://5best1s.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin-and-storing/)**。\n* 大型的VPN供应商，通常都**拥有更多国家/地区的服务器**；SSR（V2ray）机场主要都是针对网上受限国家/地区的翻墙，所以**服务器基本都位于与受限国家物理位置较近的国家/地区**。例如针对中国翻墙的服务器主要集中在香港、台湾、日本、新加坡、韩国、俄罗斯、土耳其、美国西部城市，其他国家/地区就没有服务器。**应用场景**：如果经常需要出差或旅游，VPN的优势就体现出来了，服务器选择多、匿名、数据加密不被泄露。\n\n**负面影响：**\n\n* 流量特征明显，容易被封杀。这也是能在中国国内存活的VPN厂商并不多，他们有着自己的混淆服务器或协议，又或者不断更换IP地址，以绕过日益加高的防火墙。\n* 加密是把双刃剑，一方面保护数据不被泄露，另一方面会降低网速（降低10\\~25%），通过VPN传输都会有速率损耗，不能跑满带宽。\n\n**备注**：\n\n* **[Netflix有IP黑名单](https://5best1s.com/watch-netflix-in-china/#%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E7%BF%BB%E5%A2%99%E5%B9%B6%E8%83%BD%E8%A7%A3%E9%94%81Netflix%E7%9A%84VPN%E6%8E%A8%E8%8D%90)**，一旦连接的VPN服务器IP地址符合黑名单，将不能访问Netflix，因此大型的、有信誉的VPN服务商才能不断增加或更换IP地址，以解锁Netflix访问。\n* Paypal和一些在线银行机构，如果发现您是从外部IP登陆，将会暂时锁定账户的访问，此举是出于安全方面的考虑，以防止国际欺诈者登录您的帐户。此时，您只需要联系银行解锁即可，并通过自己国家的服务器访问账号。\n\n延伸阅读：**[中国大陆如何观看Netflix（奈飞|网飞）](https://5best1s.com/watch-netflix-in-china/)**\n\n**备注：千万不要以为有了VPN就可以高枕无忧，毕竟VPN只是保护我们本地电脑到目标网站之间的通道，但如果是本地电脑已经中毒，又或者上了“钓鱼”网站，又或者登陆了社交媒体平台，您的行踪依然在监控范围内。**\n\n通过以上的解释，我们也就很容易理解，在中国国内可以长期稳定、速度快的VPN服务商，价格一直居高不下的原因。因为要与国内GFW抗争的成本实在太多太高，需要购买优质的服务器、优质的线路、培养高素质的技术团队等等。\n\n**VPN对于不熟悉技术或不想倒腾的人来说，十分友好，使用起来非常方便**，这也导致了VPN在国内一直是使用人群基数最多的工具。\n\n**VPN最大的优势在于服务器众多，数据私密，而SSR（V2ray）更着重于翻墙**。\n\n## 如何选择翻墙软件？\n\n讲了这么多，也许您该糊涂了，我到底应该选哪个翻墙软件？是VPN？还是**[SSR（V2ray）](https://5best1s.com/ssr-node-recommended/)**?\n\n好吧，先说说我自己，我自己大部分时间会使用**[ExpressVPN](https://5best1s.com/ExpressVPN)** + 2个**[SSR（V2ray）机场](https://5best1s.com/TuoPu)**（亦可使用本文开头介绍的**[PandaVPN](https://5best1s.com/PandaVPN)**）。\n\n👉 延伸阅读：**[SSR（V2ray）翻墙-高速翻墙利器](https://5best1s.com/ssr-node-recommended/)**\n\n对于需要输入银行账号等重要隐私的数据，或使用公共网络WIFI时，我会用ExpressVPN；对于平时在家工作和学习时，会使用SSR（V2ray）机场。\n\n本文**[特殊时期应如何度过](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china/#spectial-time)**里提到过，应至少拥有2个以上的服务商互为备份，保证工作和学习不受影响。另一方面，VPN和SSR（V2ray）的使用场景也稍有不同，具体如下：\n\n## 适合使用VPN的用户\n\n* **经常出外公干或旅游。**如果您要去国外（例如**[中国](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china-that-still-work/)**，**[阿联酋](https://5best1s.com/vpn-for-uae/)**，**[伊朗](https://5best1s.com/vpn-for-iran/)**等），VPN可以帮助您访问该国家可能不提供的服务。VPN还可以让您在世界各地，都能像在家里一样，**[观看Netflix](https://5best1s.com/watch-netflix-in-china/)**等流媒体。VPN最大的优势是世界上分布的服务器远多于SSR（V2ray）的服务器，这意味着您在世界任何地方，基本都能找到物理位置最近的服务器，从而提高您的连接速度和访问Internet的速度。旅行者使用VPN 能帮您找到便宜的机票，或有折扣的商品，因为不同地区的价格可能会有所不同。\n* **远程工作者。**新冠病毒期间，许多人被迫呆**[在家办公](https://5best1s.com/need-vpn-working-at-home/)**，出于安全原因，许多雇主要求使用VPN远程访问公司服务。连接到办公室服务器的VPN可以让您不在办公室时访问公司内部的网络和资源。\n* **注重隐私的用户。**即使在自己舒适的家中，使用VPN进行常规的互联网操作也不是一个糟糕的主意。VPN将使您避免在网络上留下足迹，防止**[ISP](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E4%BE%9B%E5%BA%94%E5%95%86)**恶意读取。\n* **加密货币爱好者。**由于大多数**[加密货币交易所](https://5best1s.com/best-bitcoin-trading-platform/)**都有一些限制交易的国家/地区，如果您正好在这些国家/地区居住或逗留，那么VPN必不可少（由于VPN支持的国家/地区要比SSR/V2ray多得多，且数据私密性和安全性高于SSR/V2ray，所以不建议使用SSR/V2ray）。\n* **Torrent种子下载。**由于**[种子下载网站](https://5best1s.com/best-torrent-sites/)**拥有大量免费的电影、音乐、书籍、游戏等资源，深受网友喜爱，但出于版权的原因被当局封锁，且有严厉的法律制裁或高额罚款，这时就需要适合种子下载的VPN来保证自己安全，这里使用SSR/V2ray并不安全，强烈建议只使用**[VPN排行](https://5best1s.com/)**前2名的厂家。\n\n## 适合使用SSR（V2ray）的用户\n\n* 使用设备的环境主要集中在家里或公司，网络相对较为安全的区域。\n* 自媒体创作者。因VPN的速度始终受限于加密，速度不能跑满带宽。而使用SSR（V2ray）可以高速上传或下载相关媒体文件。由于这些媒体文件容量较大，使用SSR（V2ray）将大大提高工作效率。\n* 对匿名或隐私不太敏感的人群。\n* 经常出外公干或旅游。理由同VPN。\n\n## 小结\n\n## SSR/V2ray与VPN的相同点\n\n* 都可以用于翻墙；\n* 都可以加速网络（指由于ISP限速的情况）。\n\n## SSR/V2ray与VPN的不同点\n\n* VPN可以匿名，SSR/V2ray不可以；\n* VPN可以加密数据，SSR/V2ray不可以；\n* VPN经过多年的商业运作，更加安全可靠，不容易跑路；SSR/V2ray只是由网友开发用于翻墙，出现漏洞的机会更高，如果**[购买机场](https://5best1s.com/ssr-node-recommended/#SSR%EF%BC%88V2ray%EF%BC%89%E8%8A%82%E7%82%B9%E8%B4%AD%E4%B9%B0-%E5%A4%A7%E5%9E%8B%E3%80%81%E8%80%81%E7%89%8C%E3%80%81%E9%AB%98%E9%80%9F%E8%8A%82%E7%82%B9%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%BA%E5%9C%BA)**，则容易出现机场主跑路的现象。\n* 大多数SSR/V2ray的服务器都位于网络受限的国家/地区的附近，而VPN服务器遍布全球。\n\n大家可以根据自己的实际情况使用：\n\n👉 **[中国可用的最佳VPN推荐](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china-that-still-work/)**\n\n👉 **[SSR/V2ray机场](https://5best1s.com/TuoPu)**\n\n## 翻墙方式如何分类\n\n## 软件翻墙\n\n上面介绍的VPN和SSR（V2ray）都属于软件翻墙。\n\n这里要特别说明一下，许多人（也包括我）容易产生的**误区**：\n\n1. 以为SS、SSR等早期出现的工具和协议，都已被GFW探测并封锁。主要表现在许多人反馈说，刚搭建好的SSR服务器，用了10分钟就被墙……其实这是不对的，真正的原因是，早期的加密协议和混淆等参数的设置过于老旧，导致十分容易被墙。只要设置得当，SSR照样可以正常使用。\n2. 许多人认为只要使用V2ray、Wesocket+TLS等所谓最新技术，就可以高枕无忧。要知道新工具或协议只是因为新，用的人少，GFW懒得管你而已，当用的人开始增多时，GFW的大数据和AI智能（下面会讲到）就会分析并封锁。\n3. 觉得越新的工具或协议，就是越好的，老的工具和协议就不行。首先，就像第2点提到的，只是使用的人少，所以相对安全。但是，新的加密算法由于较为复杂，需要用到设备的CPU进行运算，所以你的手机、PAD或路由器发热会很厉害，而且用电量也会大增，这都会大大影响设备的上网速度。所以，还是**适合自己使用的工具和协议才是最好的，不要人云亦云**。\n\n时刻谨记，**任何形式的协议或加密算法，都不是百分之百安全并有效**（下面的**[GFW工作原理](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china/#gfw-working-principle)**会解释）。\n\n**[中国可用的最佳VPN推荐](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china/#best-vpn-in-china)**里介绍的VPN，全部支持**[Windows（PC）电脑](https://5best1s.com/vpn-for-windows/)**、**[Android手机](https://5best1s.com/vpn-for-android/)**、**[iOS](https://5best1s.com/vpn-for-iphone/)**（iPhone and iPad）、**[Mac电脑](https://5best1s.com/vpn-for-mac/)**、**[Linux](https://5best1s.com/vpn-for-linux/)**，有的还支持**[Chrome（Firefox）扩展插件](https://5best1s.com/vpn-for-chrome/)**，所以可以满足您目前主流设备的需求，而无需在不同设备上安装不同的软件，真正做到1个软件，同1个账号和密码满足所有设备的翻墙需要。\n\n还有就是，本文介绍的VPN都支持路由器安装，使用上会更方便快捷，速度上也会有质的提升。具体看下面的硬件翻墙。\n\n## 硬件翻墙\n\n硬件翻墙也就是指路由器翻墙。\n\n## 为什么要使用VPN路由器\n\nVPN路由器是一种专门设计的路由器，可连接多台 VPN 终端设备。\n\n* 使用VPN路由器可保护Wi-Fi网络上的所有设备。\n* 只要支持**[OpenVPN](https://5best1s.com/%e4%bb%80%e4%b9%88%e6%98%afopenvpn/)**的路由器，都可以安装设置本文介绍的VPN。\n* 使用单个VPN路由器，您不再需要在每个设备上安装单独的VPN应用，这也意味着某些无法安装VPN应用程序的设备，也可以通过VPN路由器实现翻墙。\n* 一个帐户可同时使用设备的数量通常都有限制。而VPN路由器可以连接不超其负荷的无限设备！\n* 实现真正意义上的全局代理，例如玩游戏、Microsoft应用商店里的UWP应用、Oculus的VR设备客户端、网上银行、Netflix和YouTuBe应用程序客户端、Apple TV智能电视等，都可以实现无缝连接。\n\n哪些路由器支持VPN安装设置\n\n虽然上面提到，只要支持OpenVPN的路由器，都可以完美安装设置本文介绍的VPN，但如果需要使用SSR（V2ray），就需要购买一个能刷第三方固件的路由器（不是市面上那种普通的路由器），例如：斐讯路由器、小米路由器、华硕路由器等。所以我建议直接购买此类路由器，完美支持目前主流的翻墙方式。\n\n> **备注：普通的路由器由于不支持安装第三方固件，CPU算力太低等因素，导致不能正常翻墙。**\n\n然后在路由器里刷入如Openwrt、梅林、老毛子（Padavan）等的第三方固件。\n\n大部分固件都自带VPN、SSR或V2ray，直接在里面设置VPN的登陆账号和密码，SSR或V2ray订阅地址即可使用。\n\n具体安装和设置就不在这里赘述了，不懂操作的话，直接在购买路由器时，让商家帮你安装设置。建议直接在**[威伯斯云官网](https://5best1s.com/VPS000_HomePage)**购买路由器+线路时长的套餐，VPN和设备质量都有保证，官方网站也有详细的安装设置教程。\n\n## 网关模式翻墙\n\n网关模式就是在您的家庭或办公室网络里，无需路由器硬件，而只是通过一台计算机上的软件，来实现路由功能。\n\n例如Windows版的Clash，Mac版的Surge，运行这些软件之后，只需“允许局域网模式”就可以把安装软件的电脑作为网关，接管本地网络里所有设备的所有流量，实现翻墙。具体设置可以参考**[如何在局域网共享SSR？](https://5best1s.com/ssr-node-recommended/#%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%9C%A8%E5%B1%80%E5%9F%9F%E7%BD%91%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%ABSSR%EF%BC%9F)**\n\n此办法优点是设置简单，完美实现全局代理，计算机的性能碾压路由器的硬件配置。缺点是需要多加一台闲置的电脑，而且要全程开机。\n\n## 翻墙软件下载\n\n翻墙软件（工具）的下载，在中国国内等网络审查严格的国家/地区会十分困难，因为所有带VPN等相关关键字的搜寻结果，都不能在搜索引擎或论坛里找到。就算您可以在某度里能找到，我相信您也不敢用，因为钓鱼或流氓软件的机会相当高。\n\n那怎样才能在国内安全又方便地下载VPN软件呢？这里介绍两个最简单的方法：\n\n1.

**[中国VPN下载及购买完整指南](https://5best1s.com/vpn-download-guide/)**\n\n上面的指南，有详细的教程，不但包含翻墙软件电脑版下载，还包括较麻烦的**苹果手机翻墙软件下载**、**安卓手机翻墙软件下载**、**路由器翻墙软件下载**、Chrome浏览器扩展翻墙软件下载等介绍。\n\n## 主要加密协议解释\n\n选择翻墙工具时，加密协议是一项必不可少的功能，因为它决定了VPN或其他翻墙工具的安全级别，以及克服中国及其他国家/地区互联网封锁的能力。\n\n## VPN加密协议\n\n## PTTP\n\nPTTP代表**点对点隧道协议**，是最早发明的加密协议之一（1995年）。\n\n具有128位的PTTP是最弱的加密协议，也由于此，它比其他协议要快。除了其速度外，它还具有受到大多数设备支持的优势。\n\n***PTTP优点：***\n\n* 速度快；\n* 对CPU处理器要求低。\n\n***PPTP缺点：***\n\n* 被发现有许多漏洞；\n* 不支持苹果设备。\n\n出于安全的因素，目前许多VPN服务商已摒弃PPTP协议。\n\n## OpenVPN\n\n**[什么是OpenVPN](https://5best1s.com/%e4%bb%80%e4%b9%88%e6%98%afopenvpn/)**？\n\nOpenVPN可以为160或256位的加密协议，可提供很高的安全性并具有理想的速度。它的主要问题是许多移动设备（尤其是iOS系统）通常不支持。\n\n但OpenVPN是目前服务商主流采用的协议，并不是说它有多厉害，而是大多数在中国国内的科研机构、外资公司或需要使用VPN访问外网的公司，基本都采用该协议，所以长城防火墙对该协议的掌控最松，这也是为什么在敏感时期，大多数的VPN服务商建议用户采用手动配置的主要协议。\n\n***OpenVPN优点：***\n\n* 高效；\n* 在使用VPN服务时，可以在较多的服务器上部署；\n* 支持几乎所有的数据加密标准；\n* 许多路由器都支持安装OpenVPN；\n* 开源代码，因此没有漏洞。\n\n***OpenVPN缺点：***\n\n* 通常，需要额外安装OpenVPN应用程序（它不是Windows、macOS或Linux内置程序）。\n* 多年来，OpenVPN源代码因不断增加额外代码而变得臃肿，以至于安装起来很笨重，影响速度。\n\n由于其易用性、多任务处理、灵活性、可靠性和允许创建自己的协议等特点，OpenVPN是现代VPN主要选择。\n\n## StealthVPN\n\n基于OpenVPN的加密协议，带有附加的流量混淆层。StealthVPN可以与TCP和UDP一起使用，同时在通过防火墙时，有专门设计用于防止被检测到的连接。这也是**[AstrillVPN](https://5best1s.com/AstrillVPN)**得意之作。\n\n## OpenConnect\n\n可与TCP和UDP一起使用的开源协议。它旨在替代思科的AnyConnect SSL VPN。该协议使用TLS身份验证系统和DTLS来加密流量。具有类似于OpenVPN的性能。\n\n## L2TP / IPSec（IKEv2）\n\nIPSec是一组协议和身份验证的方法，它是在Internet刚刚诞生时为数据保护而开发的，基于操作系统的内置功能来使用。\n\nIPSec/IKEv2被认为是快速、现代的(2005年开发，2014年更新)。只要配置正确，它是一种保护性能良好的VPN协议。由于IKEv2不会使处理器过载，这也使它在移动设备上被广泛应用。\n\n***IPSec优点：***\n\n* 高效；\n* 支持所有平台，而无需其它附加软件；\n* 支持现代加密标准；\n* 十分可靠；\n* 可有效利用CPU处理器。\n\n***IPSec缺点：***\n\n* 不支持iOS<9的版本，且IKEv1已过时；\n* 仅适用于UDP；\n* 没有开源代码，因此不能用于创建自定义协议。\n\nIPSec是在VPN中以隧道加密方式和IKE密钥交换算法的现代多功能协议集。作为非商业产品，它被集成在所有操作系统中。\n\nIPSec在Apple设备商上很普遍。\n\n## SSTP\n\n这是最快的协议之一，甚至比PTTP更快。而且，它提供的加密几乎与LTP2 / IPSec一样强大。但是，该协议很难在大多数系统上实现，通常仅与Windows兼容。\n\n## WireGuard\n\n**[什么是Wireguard](https://5best1s.com/%e4%bb%80%e4%b9%88%e6%98%afwireguard/)**？简单地说，它是一个很有潜力的新开放协议，尽管目前只有少数VPN服务商（如**[Surfshark](https://5best1s.com/surfshark-review/)**、**[NordVPN](https://5best1s.com/NordVPN)**）正式开始应用，但或许不久的将来就会广泛应用。\n\nWireGuar最大优点：它是一个非常快速和极小的处理器负载，可以直接在操作系统内核级别上工作。\n\n该协议仍需要一些改进，因为目前，它在保护匿名性方面做得还不够好（这对于绕开长城防火墙的限制至关重要），并且在商业化之前必须对其安全性进行全面测试。\n\n## SSR、V2ray、Trojan加密协议\n\n就像上一节提到的那样，SS和SSR并没有失效，只是加密协议和混淆没有设置好，过于老旧而已。\n\n## SS、SSR\n\nSS和SSR接近20种加密算法，大致分为AEAD加密和非AEAD加密，请务必使用AEAD加密算法，目前xchacha20-ietf-poly1305和aes-256-gcm是最佳的选择。\n\n## V2ray\n\n对于V2Ray而言，有三种加密方式：AES-128-CFB、AES-128-GCM、ChaCha20-Poly1305（当然还有不加密）。\n\n目前主流的都是采用AES-128-GCM。因为对于普通电脑和手机这些常用设备来说，该协议会更高效。\n\n我们也整理了**[VPS上搭建Xray，使用最新协议VLESS](https://5best1s.com/vps%e4%b8%8a%e6%90%ad%e5%bb%baxray/)**的办法，网友们可以根据需要自己搭建。\n\n## Trojan\n\nTaojan模仿了互联网上最常见的 HTTPS 协议，从而有效防止流量被检测和干扰。喜欢折腾的网友可以参阅**[VPS+Trojan-Go+WS+CDN的方案](https://5best1s.com/trojan-go/)**（仅建议作为备份翻墙工具，具体可参阅**[为什么不建议自己搭建VPS翻墙服务器](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china/#%E4%B8%BA%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E4%B8%8D%E5%BB%BA%E8%AE%AE%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BAVPS%E7%BF%BB%E5%A2%99%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%99%A8)**）。\n\n## 翻墙是否违法？\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ZQKTbesoVo5e2JGT4RQJnA.jpeg)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*XfO0WendxYEXx6um6t2Xbg.jpeg)\n\n从法律层面上理解，**翻墙访问被禁止的网页或服务，是涉嫌违法的**。\n\n至于**违法行为如何处罚，视乎具体的违法情节和危害程度来定**。\n\n我们作为个人的一般用户，如果只是浏览信息（不浏览政治敏感信息），并**不参与散布和传播**，一般不予处罚。\n\n**如果在未经允许的情况下，提供翻墙服务，则一定会构成违法和犯罪**。\n\n> **这里再解释一下：如果我们只是翻墙浏览信息，例如工作或学习有关的资料，不去触碰、散布和传播危害国家的信息，就不会有问题。搭建服务器并提供给他人使用，则构成违法犯罪。**\n\n## 每年的特殊时期应如何度过？\n\n每年的6月前后，都是特殊时期，这时许多不怀好意的境外机构或舆论，都会趁此机会抹黑中国，GFW都会在此期间封锁大批VPN或IP地址。\n\n因此许多小的VPN服务商会因为自身技术或实力不够，而导致跑路，一旦过了风头，又会换个名字重建。这当中会有很多猫腻出现，我们作为用户，每当遇到以下情况，就需要提高警惕。\n\n* 突然提高价格。\n* 突然降价促销。\n* 突然推出无年限会员制度。\n* 速度开始不稳定，经常更换线路。\n* 客服反应时间开始滞后。\n\n因此，我们**选择VPN服务商，都应该选择大型并经过多年验证的服务商**。\n\n我们应如何应对VPN服务商跑路的问题？\n\n* 首先，像上面提到的那样，选择大型的VPN服务商，降低跑路的风险。\n* 每到敏感时期，都不要急着购买长期服务，过了敏感期后，例如到了6月中\\~7月，才购买。\n* 在敏感时期，找2\\~3家支持月付的VPN服务商，只购买一个月的服务，互为备份。\n\n总的来说，我们作为用户很难避免VPN服务商跑路，只能**选择规模较大，服务时间较长，口碑和信誉较好**的服务商。另一方面，**避免在敏感期购买长期服务**，只购买月付，并**至少拥有2个以上的服务商**互为备份，只有这样才能保证自己的工作和学习不受影响。\n\n每月只支付几十元的服务，却可以帮我们省却大量的时间和精力，让我们可以专注于自己工作和学习，这是十分划算的。\n\n👉 **[中国可用的最佳VPN推荐](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china-that-still-work/)**\n\n👉 **[SSR/V2ray机场](https://5best1s.com/TuoPu)**\n\n## 为什么不建议自己搭建VPS翻墙服务器\n\n从以上介绍我们可以了解，自己搭建VPS翻墙服务器有很多弊端：\n\n* 从法律法规上来说，自己搭建服务器有很大的违法犯罪嫌疑，如果服务器被黑，变成黑客手中的“肉鸡”，那更麻烦，有可能间接协助他人做出违法犯罪的行为。\n* 在敏感时期，VPS服务商的IP地址段极有可能会被大面积封锁，导致你的VPS立马瘫痪，不要迷信所谓的CDN、WS+TLS的功效，要知道GFW的大数据和自我学习的深度，已经足够强大，我们根本不可能可以分析出具体被封的原因是什么。\n* 线路没有进行专门的优化，速度不稳定。\n* 如果自己并不熟悉或理解自建服务器的原理，一旦出现问题，根本无从解决。\n\n所以说，无论从法律角度，还是自己的时间和精力上，**自建翻墙服务器都是吃力不讨好的选择**。当然了，如果您是技术高手，可以利用VPS服务器做很多其他的工作，翻墙上网只是其中一个很小的功能而已，那就另当别论了。\n\n> **最新消息：由于目前在国内可长期稳定使用的VPN越来越少，机场安全性较低，且经常出现跑路情况，我们越来越感受到需要学习自建VPS服务器，以满足我们日常翻墙的需要。目前VPS已经十分便宜，而且翻墙技术也越来越成熟，许多协议都有一键安装版本，只要设置得当，被封的概率也不大，可以说只要您稍微有点动手能力，基本都能搞定。**\n\n**相关阅读：**\n\n👉

\\*\\*DNS劫持和污染。\\*\\*例如当访问的网址是谷歌，GFW会返回一个错误的IP地址，导致不能正常访问。\n* \\*\\*关键字过滤阻断。\\*\\*由于HTTP流量是明文的内容，当出现敏感词时，GFW会中断连接。\n* **IP地址和特定端口的封锁**。用于切断VPN、SSL、SSH的连接。同时，GFW也会主动搜集大量的IP地址，不断加入到黑名单里，这也是许多知名的VPS供应商，都会有大量的IP网段被封锁的原因。\n\n以上只是GFW最基础的工作方式，其实在目前大数据及人工智能的时代背景下 ，GFW的工作方式已经有了很大的进步，只是民间日益频繁的数据交换、学术交流及商业来往，导致GFW也不能一杆子打死而已。这里也就解释了为什么**[威伯斯云](https://5best1s.com/VPS000)**可以全年保持稳定高速的原因：Cisco是这些大型机构、院校的主要网络供应商，而威伯斯云采用的Cisco架构正是利用了此优势。\n\n## 翻墙软件工作原理\n\n首先，要明确一个概念，GFW并不是解密网络数据包的数据，而是分析数据包的真实意图。\n\n以下将主要阐述VPN和SSR（V2ray）机场的区别。\n\n## VPN翻墙原理\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*5aU6x1o8LFtQJ2aVcSvh5g.jpeg)\n\n1. 首先，您与VPN服务器之间建立一个加密隧道。此时，您的设备相当于和VPN服务器是处于同一个局域网，您的IP就是VPN服务商的某一台服务器的IP地址，\n2. 加密后的数据经过GFW传输出去，到达您要求的站点。这个过程是成也加密，败也加密。一方面，加密是指不但数据加密，同时还要能欺骗GFW。另一方面，GFW也会根据此明显的加密特征，采取封锁行动。因此，能在中国国内可用的VPN，都具有独特的加密方式或数量众多的IP地址，才能规避GFW的拦截。可想而知，这种激烈的博弈会一直存在。\n\n这也解释了为何大部分的VPN服务商都会倒在长城下，只有那些熟悉国情、资金雄厚、并拥有独门秘籍的厂商，才能翻越如此强大的长城。\n\n👉 **[中国可用的最佳VPN推荐](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china-that-still-work/)**\n\n## SS、SSR、V2ray翻墙原理\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*xs7Mhvi4Z-TsoeYJLbZUDQ.jpeg)\n\nSS、SSR、V2ray的工作原理都差不多，简单地理解就是，把代理服务器拆分成本地和远程两个，实现经过GFW的流量全部加密，从而消除明显的流量特征，以达到穿越GFW的效果。\n\n我们从上图可以看出，SSR客户端就是您电脑或手机的SSR（V2ray）软件，或翻墙路由器（软路由），在通过GFW之前，就可以瞬间在这些本地设备上进行加密。\n\n经过加密的数据包，在通过GFW时，由于GFW探测不到具有明显特征的流量，就会放行，到达远程中转服务器端，即远程的SSR服务器（也就是机场的服务器，或者是自建的VPS服务器），在这里进行数据解密，并转发到目标网址，从而实现科学上网。\n\nVPN和SSR（V2ray）最大的区别就是，VPN有十分明显的流量特征，就是建立一个加密通道的数据包；而SSR（V2ray）是首先在本地完成数据加密，然后才通过GFW。\n\nSSR（V2ray）机场该如何选择，以及直连线路、中转线路、CN2和IPLC线路的介绍，可以参阅**[SSR（V2ray）翻墙-高速科学上网利器](https://5best1s.com/ssr-node-recommended/)**。\n\n👉

💥VPN无法使用怎么办？\n\n由于长城防火墙的不断地升级加高，即使最好的VPN也会出现连接困难甚至失败。我们首先思想上不要慌张，先试试以下介绍办法，通常都能很快地恢复。1. 更新到最新版本。始终让软件处于最新的版本很重要，因为服务商随时会根据需要，更新许多配置，以适应最新的情况。2. 更改服务器。虽然很多VPN都会自动连接最佳性能的服务器，但在特殊时期，手动连接服务商建议的服务器是最有效的解决办法。3. 更改加密协议。按照以往的经验，在特殊时期，最有效的方式就是进行手动连接，也就是利用OpenVPN进行连接。除此之外，您也可以按顺序尝试以下的协议：OpenVPN UDP，OpenVPN TCP，IKEv2，L2TP / IPSec和SSTP。4. 联系官方客服。如果以上办法都不能成功，可以联系官方客服寻求支持，并获取最新的配置和建议连接的服务器。优质的VPN服务商会在防火墙升级加高时，快速响应解决问题。对于**[ExpressVPN](https://5best1s.com/ExpressVPN)**：最新的配置信息，我会在**[ExpressVPN设置 |

❓在中国如何下载应用程序\n\n首先，在没有翻墙工具的帮助下，Google Play不能使用，Apple Store虽然能用，但不能找到任何VPN程序，就算有，也不要下载，您明白的……其次，我们可以访问**[本文](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china)**所列的镜像网站，下载应用程序。如果还是不行，可先利用手动配置VPN，进行连接，然后回到**[本文](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china)**下载。最后，如果还是不太会手动配置，可以利用**[DNSCrypt防止DNS污染](https://5best1s.com/dnscrypt-to-prevent-dns-spoofing/)**里的工具，即可顺利访问**[本文](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china)**下载。详情请参阅**[中国VPN下载及购买完整指南](https://5best1s.com/vpn-download-guide/)**。\n\n## 💥在中国是否需要购买VPN\n\n如果您希望在中国访问谷歌、脸书等外网，或个人信息和数据较为敏感，那么您需要购买VPN。具体可参阅**[本文](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china)**或**[VPN值得付费购买吗](https://5best1s.com/why-you-should-use-a-vpn/)**？\n\n## 💥哪个VPN具有中文服务器\n\n由于法律问题，许多VPN在中国不提供服务器。如果您有翻墙回国内的需求，可以参阅**[VPN翻墙回国-海外华人轻松解锁BiliBili等区域限制](https://5best1s.com/which-vpn-chinese-expats-can-access-bilibili-without-regional-restriction-in-china/)**。\n\n## 💥中国香港最佳VPN推荐\n\n2020年5月，突然许多香港同胞开始了解并使用VPN。主要原因是国安法的推出，让港人开始担心自己的在线安全、数字隐私。作为中国的一个行政区，无论从物理位置上和文化背景上，都和中国国内十分相似，所以本文介绍的**[中国可用的最佳VPN](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china/)**，同样也适合中国香港。详情请参阅**[最佳香港VPN推荐](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-hong-kong/)**。\n\n## ❌哪些VPN在中国不推荐使用？\n\n市面上还有很多**[便宜的VPN](https://5best1s.com/cheap-vpn/)**，也有很多博客主推荐，但经我测试，虽然可以在中国使用，但性能很差，购买后甚至一连数周不能使用。最近测试的VPN例如**VyprVPN**，就是属于这类，**不建议使用。**\n\n## ❓很多VPN否定者有一个论点，即大多数网站已采用https保护，VPN只是摆设\n\n其实这种观点，是对**[VPN的作用](https://5best1s.com/best-vpn-in-china/#VPN%E7%9A%84%E4%BC%98%E7%BC%BA%E7%82%B9)**还没有了解深入，以下是一些例子：1. 没有VPN，许多第三方都会知道我们每天访问哪些应用程序和网站。2. 即使我们没有授权给这些应用程序和网站，它们也能对我们的地理位置作出准确的定位。3. 许多网站和硬件设备都无法充分保护我们的数据，即我们经常听到的安全漏洞。4. 有架设网站的朋友就会知道，HTTPS证书其实很容易申请，如果网站架设者在设立网站时图谋不轨，您电脑极易感染病毒，导致数据和信息丢失。（**务必不要在不熟悉的网站或邮件里，点击来路不明的链接**。）以上这些情况，如果有了VPN的保护，将大大降低用户受到攻击及暴露身份的危险。\n\n说了这么多，主要还是想把各种工具或协议的原理了解清楚，好让自己选择最适合自己的翻墙姿势。如果确实理解不了，或懒得看，建议直接购买**[ExpressVPN](https://5best1s.com/ExpressVPN)**

The funding will be used to further develop a new web3-native social media experience and empower curators across the web.\n\nThe funding round was also joined by major players in the blockchain and tech space, including [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), LD Capital, and various founder angels.\n\nYup is a social network that rewards and recognizes tastemakers for curating content across web2 and web3 platforms like Twitter, Youtube, Opensea, Mirror, and others. The protocol aims to monetize the value generated by influencers and social media users who surface quality content. Most social media platforms today focus on content creators first, with curators and tastemakers often getting overlooked despite providing massive value to their platforms and following.\n\n> “In our view, Web3 social is one of the most exciting categories and we believe Yup is positioning itself to be a leader”, said Johnny Steindorff of Distributed Global.\n\nSince launch, Yup has distributed over $1.6 million in curator rewards. We’ve built a particularly strong relationship with the NFT community, rewarding over $300,000 to NFT curators, with some individuals earning thousands of dollars in YUP.\n\n> Web3 offers an opportunity to curate with clear financial incentives *and* social status.

Para ello, ayuda dar todos los detalles que puedan, personales y de la motivación que tienen para hacer este análisis. Pueden poner un link a este tutorial y a mis páginas de investigación (quizás eso ayude un poco aunque no tengo idea), diciendo que van a tomar un taller abierto para \"Network Data Literacy to Fight Missinformation\". Entre más detalles den sobre ustedes mismos, los propósitos que tienen, y la empresa donde trabajan o estudian, más fácil le queda a Twitter saber que ustedes no son una bodega rusa.\n\nEs frecuente que Twitter responda con algunas preguntas en los próximos días antes de activar la cuenta y darles credenciales, es necesario estar pendiente del mail que llega a spam. En ocasiones esta comunicación puede tener varias interacciones donde Twitter solicita aún más información, por ello es conveniente dar toda la información posible (links a la página del trabajo, universidad, personal, etc.).\n\nDMI-TCAT\n\n[TCAT](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-tcat)\n\nEsta es la mejor herramienta que he encontrado, es una especie de front-end para manejar las bases de datos de tweets de una manera profesional. Hay que seguir los pasos para instalarlo, requiere una máquina virtual Ubuntu 18.04 (**no puede ser otra y debe ser recién instalada**). Se puede instalar en un servidor (ideal) o en una máquina virtual que corra en un computador personal. Instalar en una máquina local tiene limitaciones: seguir los tweets de las protestas, por ejemplo, puede involucrar más de un millón de trinos al día, esto rápidamente colapsa una máquina virtual local. Sin embargo, puede ser más que suficiente para un usuario que no quiera tener que lidiar con armar un servidor online.\n\nAWS\n\nPara quienes quieran instalarlo en una máquina virtual en AWS, [acá hay un tutorial.](https://archives.williamwolff.org/dmi-tcat/)\n\nWINDOWSInstalar [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)\n\nInstalar una máquina virtual de [Ubuntu 18.04 ](https://supercontra.blogspot.com/2021/07/Ubuntu%2018) : acá hay un video tutorial de cómo instalar una máquina virtual Ubuntu (el video muestra una 20.04 pero no funciona para DMI-TCAT) en Windows.\n\n[YouTube video player](https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5MhydijWmc)\n\nAbrir una terminal en la máquina virtual UBUNTO  y pasar al punto: COPIAR Y PEGAR ESTOS COMANDOS\n\nMAC\n\nPara instalarlo en un Mac, deben instalar primero [Multipass](https://multipass.run/) (es la manera más fácil que he encontrado).\n\nluego, pueden dar Manzana(command) + espacio y escriben \"Terminal\", espichan enter. Esto despliega una terminal de su Mac. En ella deben copiar y pegar este texto (editando según la capacidad de su propia máquina):\n\nmultipass launch 18.04 -n palmira -c 3 -d 20G -m 8G\n\nEsto inicializará una máquina llamada \"palmira\" con ubuntu 18.04 (los otros no funcionan) con 3 cores, 20Gb de disco y 8Gb de memoria. Yo uso un iMac con alta capacidad, esto puede ser demasiado para ciertos computadores, por ejemplo un Macbook Air. Sugiero usar 1 core y 5Gb de disco, 4Gb de memoria para empezar si no están seguros:\n\nmultipass launch 18.04 -n supercontra -c 1 -d 5G -m 4G\n\nINSTALACIÓN DMI-TCAT\n\nUna vez uno tiene la máquina virtual creada, se debe abrir una terminal de esa máquina para configurar el DMI-TCAT. No es necesario \"descargar\" DMI-TCAT, los siguientes comandos lo harán desde la terminal, son tomados del [wiki de instalación de la herramienta](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-tcat/wiki/Installation-Guide):\n\nLas instrucciones solas para los perezosos:\n\nCOPIAR Y PEGAR ESTOS COMANDOS\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install curl\n```\n\n<!---->\n\n```\ncurl -O \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-tcat/master/helpers/tcat-install-linux.sh\"\n```\n\n\\`\\`\n\n```\nchmod a+x tcat-install-linux.sh\n```\n\n\\`\\`\n\n```\nsudo ./tcat-install-linux.sh\n```\n\nEl texto de cómo instalar, tomado del blog:\n\nTo use *curl* to download the install script, if *curl* is not not available install it using:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install curl\n```\n\nDownload the install script (the `-O`, capital-o, option saves it to a local file with the same name as the remote file):\n\n```\ncurl -O \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-tcat/master/helpers/tcat-install-linux.sh\"\n```\n\nMake it executable:\n\n```\nchmod a+x tcat-install-linux.sh\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Run the install script\n\nThe script can be run in interactive mode, where it prompts the user for the parameters it needs:\n\n```\nsudo ./tcat-install-linux.sh\n```\n\nNote: it must be run with root privileges. The above example uses the *sudo* command to do this.\n\nIt will prompt for:\n\n* Twitter API consumer key;\n* Twitter API consumer secret;\n* Twitter API user token;\n* Twitter API user secret;\n* Mode of tweet capture to perform (phrases/keywords, follow users, or 1% sample);\n* Whether to expand URLs in tweets or not;\n* The name of the server;\n* Whether to allow TCAT to automatically upgrade itself or not; and\n* Other advanced parameters (but usually the default values for these can be used).\n\nThe name of the server is very important. It will be the name of the machine in the URL used to access the TCAT Web pages. It must be the host name or IP address of the machine TCAT is being installed on.\n\nThe script will confirm the parameters before proceeding with the install. If the values are incorrect, answer \"n\" to edit the values. Answer \"y\" to start the installation process.\n\n#### Step 3: Wait for the installation process to finish\n\nWait while the install script downloads and configures the required components. These components include the TCAT files, MySQL/MariaDB database, PHP and the Apache Web Server.\n\nThe install script, by default, will run `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade` at the start of the process, to ensure the system is up to date.\n\n**Note for Debian:** when installing on Debian, the installation process it will prompt for a \"MySQL product to configure\" when *mysql-apt-config* is installed. Press the down key on your keyboard to select \"Apply\" and then press the return key to continue.\n\nLuego de instalar DMI-TCAT, salen unas direcciones que uno debe anotar (con passwords que también deben anotar y guardar). Al copiar las direcciones y abrirlas en un navegador, vamos a tener acceso al front-end de la herramienta, la cual interactúa con una base de datos SQL generada a partir de los datos descargados de Twitter.\n\nEn la herramienta de configuración (un link en la parte superior derecha de la pantalla) debemos agregar un \"bin\" con las palabras \"keywords\" que va a descargar. La herramienta descarga automáticamente y genera una base de datos con estas keywords. **SUGIERO EMPEZAR CON 2 ó 3 SOLAMENTE**. Agregar demasiadas puede resultar en bloqueos a la cuenta.\n\nEste es un video para interactuar con la herramienta (que al principio debe estar vacía):\n\n[YouTube video player](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ex97eoorUeo)\n\nVISUALIZAR LAS REDES\n\nPara visualizar las redes, la mejor herramienta es [Gephi](https://gephi.org/), un programa en beta desarrollado como un ejercicio de verano en Google, sobre Jython. Está lleno de bugs y no es muy intuitivo, pero vale la pena porque son las mejores visualizaciones que se pueden hacer de redes, y muchas veces un análisis descriptivo como el que se hace en Gephi es suficiente para representar fenómenos de redes que se hacen muy evidentes.\n\n[YouTube video player](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vryp2yCgC4Y)\n\n[YouTube video player](https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSx5_PjaWVE)\n\nPara participar en los talleres (que sucederán esporádicamente, cada vez que pueda), pueden llenar este formato para que les compartamos un link.\n\nNOTA: Acepto ayuda de personas que ya hayan instalado la herramienta y quieran ayudar, estos talleres son más útiles si hay varias personas en la sala respondiendo preguntas.", "timestamp": 1634053948, "digest": "IBBa8gzvFuurLxjArBiBej7IaNDhPloyt6cPofouwKc", "contributor": "0xe990946FB4D405486Fb97ddf642d3550477cE12A"}

The funding will be used to further develop a new web3-native social media experience, expand the Yup community, and empower curators across the web.\n\nThe funding round was also joined by major players in the blockchain and tech space, including [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), LD Capital, and various founder angels.\n\nYup is a social network that rewards and recognizes tastemakers for curating content across web2 and web3 platforms like Twitter, Youtube, Opensea, Mirror, and others. The protocol aims to monetize the value generated by influencers and social media users who surface quality content. Most social media platforms today focus on content creators first, with curators and tastemakers often getting overlooked despite providing massive value to their platforms and following.\n\n> “In our view, Web3 social is one of the most exciting categories and we believe Yup is positioning itself to be a leader”, said Johnny Steindorff of Distributed Global.\n\nSince launch, Yup has distributed over $1.6 million in curator rewards. We’ve built a particularly strong relationship with the NFT community, rewarding over $300,000 to NFT curators, with some individuals earning thousands of dollars in YUP.\n\n> Web3 offers an opportunity to curate with clear financial incentives *and* social status. Curation will go beyond blogs and newsletters, where you can tip creators, earn money via curation, and create massive economic graphs. For example, Yup, is a curation protocol that provides an opportunity for users to curate and build their influence accordingly.  - [Kinjal, Blockchain Capital](https://kinjal.mirror.xyz/UpJ_v1fDH_gwNcC3ebSB3rXn544G77MlbbV5rJJF-u8)\n\n“We’re big believers in bringing blockchain to everyday users,” adds Anuke Ganegoda, Business Lead of Dapper Labs,  regarding the raise. “Coupled with the exciting growth of the NFT space, social media and NFT curation might push web3 to the mainstream.”\n\n### Strategic Partners\n\nDistributed Global, Dapper Labs, LD Capital, Ambush Capital\n\n### Angels\n\nDanny Zuckerman (3box), Patrick Rivera (Mirror), Alex Gausman (NFTX), Bill Block (Miramax), Scott Moore (Gitcoin), Joe Lallouz (Bison Trails), Nader Al-Naji (Bitclout), Stefen Delev (Caribbean Blockchain Alliance), Tomer Ben-David (Bunches), Scott (Genie), Carlos Diaz-Padron and Gail Wilson (Metaphor), and more.\n\n> “Traditional social networks thrive on privileged and minimally accessible user data silos. Their business models depend on them. Yup, as a fully open and composable Web3 social network has the opportunity to empower builders and visionaries of the next great social applications,” says Alex Price, who pre-seeded Yup and is currently a Special Advisor at A16z Crypto. “I’m excited to see what kind of feeds, interfaces and more are built on top of Yup’s fully open social graph.”\n\n## Yup and its Protocol\n\n[Yup](https://yup.io/) is a social network for curators that rewards users for liking and sharing content across the web. The Yup Protocol provides new opportunities for curators to get paid for sourcing quality content, while rewarding creators for producing it.\n\nCuration has its own roles in social media and curators represent a large and powerful demographic. Web3 protocols provide curators with new opportunities to monetize and provide creators with opportunities to form their communities around curation. Platforms also benefit from leveraging web3 curation and moderation protocols for their content feed.\n\n## Join Us\n\nWe’re incredibly excited to start this next chapter for Yup, and to continue working to build the infrastructure and insight needed for curators and communities to thrive. But we need help, and our hope in publishing this is to encourage more great people to join in the process.\n\nSite\n\n[https://yup.io/](https://yup.io/)\n\nApp\n\n[https://app.yup.io/](https://app.yup.io/)\n\nDocs\n\n[https://docs.yup.io/](https://docs.yup.io/)\n\nExtension\n\n[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yup/nhmeoaahigiljjdkoagafdccikgojjoi?hl=en&authuser=0](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yup/nhmeoaahigiljjdkoagafdccikgojjoi?hl=en&authuser=0)\n\n", "timestamp": 1634054038, "digest": "rzRK52lDvnsO3Hxp8Tctdt2gjcVVmb4Jp6mxGVSi1KQ", "contributor": "0x30E838D51c61811d382962B4e0699715462DcdE1"}

It must be the host name or IP address of the machine TCAT is being installed on.\n\nThe script will confirm the parameters before proceeding with the install. If the values are incorrect, answer \"n\" to edit the values. Answer \"y\" to start the installation process.\n\n#### Step 3: Wait for the installation process to finish\n\nWait while the install script downloads and configures the required components. These components include the TCAT files, MySQL/MariaDB database, PHP and the Apache Web Server.\n\nThe install script, by default, will run `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade` at the start of the process, to ensure the system is up to date.\n\n**Note for Debian:** when installing on Debian, the installation process it will prompt for a \"MySQL product to configure\" when *mysql-apt-config* is installed. Press the down key on your keyboard to select \"Apply\" and then press the return key to continue.\n\nLuego de instalar DMI-TCAT, salen unas direcciones que uno debe anotar (con passwords que también deben anotar y guardar).

The funding will be used to further develop a new web3-native social media experience, expand the Yup community, and empower curators across the web.\n\nThe funding round was also joined by major players in the blockchain and tech space, including [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), LD Capital, and various founder angels.\n\nYup is a social network that rewards and recognizes tastemakers for curating content across web2 and web3 platforms like Twitter, Youtube, Opensea, Mirror, and others. The protocol aims to monetize the value generated by influencers and social media users who surface quality content. Most social media platforms today focus on content creators first, with curators and tastemakers often getting overlooked despite providing massive value to their platforms and following.\n\n> “In our view, Web3 social is one of the most exciting categories and we believe Yup is positioning itself to be a leader”, said Johnny Steindorff of Distributed Global.\n\nSince launch, Yup has distributed over $1.6 million in curator rewards. We’ve built a particularly strong relationship with the NFT community, rewarding over $300,000 to NFT curators, with some individuals earning thousands of dollars in YUP.\n\n> Web3 offers an opportunity to curate with clear financial incentives *and* social status. Curation will go beyond blogs and newsletters, where you can tip creators, earn money via curation, and create massive economic graphs. For example, Yup, is a curation protocol that provides an opportunity for users to curate and build their influence accordingly.  - [Kinjal, Blockchain Capital](https://kinjal.mirror.xyz/UpJ_v1fDH_gwNcC3ebSB3rXn544G77MlbbV5rJJF-u8)\n\n“We’re big believers in bringing blockchain to everyday users,” adds Anuke Ganegoda, Business Lead of Dapper Labs,  regarding the raise. “Coupled with the exciting growth of the NFT space, social media and NFT curation might push web3 to the mainstream.”\n\n### Strategic Partners\n\nDistributed Global, Dapper Labs, LD Capital, Ambush Capital\n\n### Angels\n\nDanny Zuckerman (3box), Patrick Rivera (Mirror), Alex Gausman (NFTX), Bill Block (Miramax), Scott Moore (Gitcoin), Joe Lallouz (Bison Trails), Nader Al-Naji (Bitclout), Stefen Delev (Caribbean Blockchain Alliance), David Phelps, Tomer Ben-David (Bunches), Scott (Genie), Carlos Diaz-Padron and Gail Wilson (Metaphor), and more.\n\n> “Traditional social networks thrive on privileged and minimally accessible user data silos. Their business models depend on them. Yup, as a fully open and composable Web3 social network has the opportunity to empower builders and visionaries of the next great social applications,” says Alex Price, who pre-seeded Yup and is currently a Special Advisor at A16z Crypto. “I’m excited to see what kind of feeds, interfaces and more are built on top of Yup’s fully open social graph.”\n\n## Yup and its Protocol\n\n[Yup](https://yup.io/) is a social network for curators that rewards users for liking and sharing content across the web. The Yup Protocol provides new opportunities for curators to get paid for sourcing quality content, while rewarding creators for producing it.\n\nCuration has its own roles in social media and curators represent a large and powerful demographic. Web3 protocols provide curators with new opportunities to monetize and provide creators with opportunities to form their communities around curation. Platforms also benefit from leveraging web3 curation and moderation protocols for their content feed.\n\n## Join Us\n\nWe’re incredibly excited to start this next chapter for Yup, and to continue working to build the infrastructure and insight needed for curators and communities to thrive. But we need help, and our hope in publishing this is to encourage more great people to join in the process.\n\nSite\n\n[https://yup.io/](https://yup.io/)\n\nApp\n\n[https://app.yup.io/](https://app.yup.io/)\n\nDocs\n\n[https://docs.yup.io/](https://docs.yup.io/)\n\nExtension\n\n[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yup/nhmeoaahigiljjdkoagafdccikgojjoi?hl=en&authuser=0](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yup/nhmeoaahigiljjdkoagafdccikgojjoi?hl=en&authuser=0)\n\n", "timestamp": 1634054444, "digest": "rzRK52lDvnsO3Hxp8Tctdt2gjcVVmb4Jp6mxGVSi1KQ", "contributor": "0x30E838D51c61811d382962B4e0699715462DcdE1"}

My senior year of college, in an animal communication seminar that nudged out foreign language training — casting once again my sights too far, perhaps, and missing trees for forests — I learned that lies will never go away entirely, as they’re an “evolutionarily stable strategy” (or ESS). An ESS, to get game theoretical about it, is a viable approach to play the game of living long enough to reproduce, in given systems, such that new mutations can’t disrupt the balance or invalidate the strategy. It is the stable basin of attraction round which all contingency unfurls and whirls, like stable ratios of predators to prey depending on metabolism, or the shape of wings evolved to suit specific flying gaits. The parts may change; the pattern stays the same (with variations).\n\nThe classic situation is the endless “hawks and doves” dispute, in which opposing tendencies toward war and peace reach equilibrium in fluid fractions. There will always be some balance, in which bellicose and peaceful personalities exist in right proportion as the aspects of a meta-peace — dynamic, turbulent, disrupted, yes, but meta-stable. Peace within which war exists in perfect portion. Alive and held in tension, like a runner’s leg. The muscles don’t accomplish anything if they don’t pull in opposite directions.\n\nThe ESS is why we’ll never be completely rid of cults, for minds and cultures also follow evolutionary patterns, and a cult is often quite a fine idea when faced with the realities of mystery and power. (We forget that. We don’t intervene in cultish thoughts when we’re in the bubble of the cult itself, or notice how they’re just a reflex action of the brain while being human. Hopefully at least a few of “us,” whatever that means, do this on the regular in distant futures, catching fictions in the making, turning intellect upon itself to weave a platform for the spirit of the age to anchor even deeper and the World Soul to recognize itself in many bodies…)\n\nThe ESS is why we’ll never be completely rid of lies. The lie is so sustainable because it’s so ephemeral. It is so easy, cheap, and quick to lie, on average, it cannot *not be*. A truth *implies* a lie. Communication’s based entirely upon the pretense, the agreement, of our signs, and thus upon the risk of our deceit. We trust that words communicate the truth more often than they don’t, because they do; and if we notice signs transforming in their meaning, then we all adapt. So nothing can remain a lie forever; misinforming signals ultimately bend to irony, as villagers begin to notice that when boys cry “WOLF!” it doesn’t mean that there’s a wolf. Lies die or they evolve to serve the signal they were made to thwart; but lying is forever, since communication makes a trust surplus that life can’t possibly resist exploiting.\n\nAn ESS exists in an ecology, not in a vacuum, and members of a population (e.g., the hawks and doves above) assume opposing stable strategies that complement each other, but tend to make both sides seem crazy to each other. The liars and the cheats think straights are fools for buying it, and those of us excluded from the play of falsehood by our oath to truth all seem to loathe or envy criminals for not abiding by the social contract. But actually, the contract is with *physics*, as it happens that the ESS for maximizing entropy in dissipative structures, like the USA, is *more of* *everything*, including both sincere attempts at intimacy and disinformation of the kind that all of us now take for granted.\n\nLying will persist as long as there are lines to cross, as long as there are others to communicate with. So you cannot really say *and mean* that lies are fully false; for each of them contains the truth, reflects it, and says yet more about the hidden mind that models and presents such falsehoods. (You *can*, but then you would be lying to your self, aware of it, and holding both perspectives from opposing banks across an oxbow of your fractal subjectivity, and only *ritually* “siding” with one view to immanentize and involve and push-against, cuz God gets bored, so what?)\n\nOur trans-ironic (or is it merely post-ironic?) present is the greatest indicator that the future will be true *and* false: when jet fuel will not melt steel beams, but did; and when rebooting *Cosmos* means rewriting scientific history; and when our daily life’s a perfect sphere of equal and opposing experts telling us that cell phone radiation does *and doesn’t* give us cancer, fracking does *and doesn’t* lead to earthquakes, that we have *and haven’t* met ET…then everyday existence is a chance to watch the paradigm shifts in real-time, as our competing explanations for the most complete but parsimonious description of experience appear both outwardly, as scientists and priests, and inwardly, as myths and theories. Incumbents versus young bucks, precious selves and hallowed old traditions versus the implausible, impractical, or even imperceptible…just don’t believe what all you think. (Or do; because although the virtuality of private intuitions versus common objects of consensus shows a gradient of being, curving from what “isn’t” to what “could be” to what “is,” consensus could itself be just hallucination, and *you have to be okay with that*. It’s all a little dreamy, really.)\n\nAs we become transparent to the information processing from which our selves and stances grow like automatic daisies in the field, the simple and traditional “true/false” no longer cuts it. At this depth we can’t even say for sure what “it” is that needs cutting, so we waste less time on clashing certainties against the shore of other truths (truths just as vulnerable to essential doubt), and get on with the business of a practical, provisional, and hypothetical relationship to Being.\n\nAs every question answered generates more questions, and the shores of the unknown climb up an asymptote approaching infinite unknowability, our most authentic scientists and priests will drop the pretense and embrace their former foes as fellow seekers. We’ll get more comfortable with the dynamism, turbulence, and transformation of a digital society (dispersed in cloud computing, wireless networks, peer-to-peer instruction, horizontal gene transfer, the blockchain, and our always-split attention) as it melts whatever solid ideologies we stand upon, until we’re back to swimming in a fluid network — fish again, or maybe playful squid with flashing colors, ready for the Mystery to take us all to school.\n\n*“Do I contradict myself?

{"id": "SO9_qj67VOfipXW6NfZ0xvF6NPDg-XqCsSrSuf5AvUE", "title": "DAOs Are Eating The World", "body": "## DAOs Will Replace Companies In Our Lifetime\n\nWe learned a lot from the Covid pandemic. Governments ran the money printing machines on full steam. There’s more [money in the economy](https://www.cityam.com/almost-a-fifth-of-all-us-dollars-were-created-this-year/) than ever before in history. and it’s only getting worse.\n\nUnderstandably, millions have abandoned government-backed fiat in favor of Bitcoin and [cryptocurrency](https://medium.com/the-capital/what-the-heck-is-cryptocurrency-54a9001b83c3).\n\nBy every measure, Bitcoin is objectively better [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money) than US dollars.\n\nBut there is an even more exciting innovation right around the corner. They’re called [DAOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)).\n\n# DAOs Are Crypto-Native Companies\n\nDAO stands for *decentralized autonomous organization*. It’s decentralized because there’s no formal leadership. It’s autonomous because it can do anything the members decide. And basically, it’s just an organization.\n\nThe best way to understand DAOs is like a company. They have many similarities. Here are just a few.\n\n* Organize individuals for a cause\n* Solve society’s problems by creating value\n* Provide an opportunity for wealth generation (both individually and for society at large)\n\nTo better understand the similarity, we need to look at the history of companies. It’s a social construct that’s much older than you might think.\n\n# Early Companies\n\nIndividual humans can’t do very much. Even today, we have tools and technology offering infinite leverage. And yet, most people fail to make a lasting impact. Individuals were even more limited before the industrial revolution.\n\nIn order to have real power, you need leverage. Today, there are 4 ways to get leverage.\n\n* Labor\n* Capital\n* Media\n* Code\n\nThe oldest form of leverage is labor. We’ve been taking advantage of that leverage for thousands of years. We did this with the invention of governments. This helped large groups of people coordinate toward a common cause.\n\nThis largely explains why we saw relatively no innovation for most of history. But one day, everything changed.\n\nThe British created the [East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company) in 1600 AD. This was one of the earliest joint-stock companies. And it changed the world.\n\n*But why?*\n\nInvestors could buy shares in the company. This represented *ownership*. If the company made a lot of money, they could trade those shares for a profit without having to do any work.\n\nBut it was also good for the founders. The business would have a much harder time getting off the ground without investors.\n\nIn practice, it combined labor and capital leverage.\n\nCompanies became the most powerful entity in the world. Which largely explains why the British Empire, an early adopter of this new way to organize, colonized a fourth of the planet.\n\nIt wasn’t through military force at first. It was through company-sponsored colonies. Military occupation happened only after the locals rebels.\n\nThe East India Company dissolved in 1873. But concept of companies combining labor and capital remained. And they’ve become a cornerstone of our lives.\n\n# Companies Today\n\nThere have been millions of companies since the 1600s. They continue to exist because they *successfully coordinate large groups of people*.\n\nAmazon has nearly 1,000,000 workers. The company provides an easy way to get goods to consumers. It works like a well oiled machine. You can order a book off Amazon tonight and expect to get it within a week.\n\nCompanies form the basis of our modern society. Do you work for a company or do you own one? What is your position in the company? What products do you buy from companies in your free time?\n\nWe interact with companies every day. And the entire concept of a company is from the 1600s. Combining capital and labor leverage is a tried-and-true practice. But it doesn’t end there.\n\nThe most powerful companies today use new forms of leverage. *Media and code.*\n\nCompanies in the 1600s combined labor and capital. This was an innovation for the time. But the most successful companies in the last 2 centuries have taken advantage of media and code for more leverage.\n\nLet’s continue with our Amazon example. Amazon uses every form of leverage effectively. It uses capital to get new projects off the ground. Labor to build and keep everything running. Code to allow anyone to order anything online. And media to get the word out.\n\nAfter all, [software is eating the world](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460). That’s because software companies effectively combine every form of leverage.\n\nThese companies created a lot of wealth. However, companies have downsides as well.\n\n# Problems with Companies\n\nCompanies are a powerful social construct. But they have many significant problems. This is hardly a comprehensive list. But these are 3 pressing problems facing companies today.\n\n1. Investor upside\n2. Barrier to entry\n3. Profit-driven\n\n## Investor upside\n\nCompanies created 2 classes of people. Those who own the company. And those who make it work.\n\nCompany owners fall into one of two categories. Investors or co-founders. Investors buy stock in the company and expect a return on their investment. Co-founders help build the company and typically receive partial ownership.\n\nThe only objective of the company is to produce capital. Each part of the business is expendable. Unfortunately, that includes the human beings who make the company function. The workers.\n\nCompanies pay workers the bare minimum amount of money to get them to do the job. As the population has increased with more efficient farming methods, there’s never been a real shortage of labor in the developed world.\n\nThis results in low wages for workers.\n\nThis dynamic creates a stark contrast between those who own the business and those who work the business. You can work for the most profitable company on Earth. But the upside (wealth generated by the company) is limited to the owner class.\n\nAmazon is the perfect example. It’s extremely valuable. Uses every form of leverage. And generates ungodly amounts of wealth. But all that surplus value is captured by the owner class. It’s not uncommon to see Amazon workers living in poverty. Amazon is the top employer of [SNAP recipients](https://thecounter.org/15-minimum-wage-amazon-top-employer-snap-recipients-walmart-mcdonalds/) across the country. Amazon workers are paid so little they qualify for government welfare.\n\nThis is hardly a new problem.\n\nThe most popular [revolutionary ideology of the 20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) sought to end private companies altogether. However, this movement failed to produce a coherent alternative. Which means we live in a world where their opposition won. And many of their criticisms still ring true.\n\nIn the decades following the collapse of the Soviet union, we have failed to adequately address the contrast between the owner and working classes.\n\n## Barrier to Entry\n\nHumans are logically incentivized to become company owners. Meekly accepting the alternative is to subjugate their life to circumstances beyond their control.\n\nEveryone understands that it’s better to be a business owner than a worker. The smallest business owner is higher status than the most well-compensated worker.\n\nHowever, getting a company off the ground is difficult. These are a few reasons most people fail to launch a successful company.\n\n* Lack of education\n* Lack of financial safety net (business failure can result in financial ruin)\n* Legal difficulty (companies often need an entire legal department)\n* Lack of geographic opportunity (poor access to pools of talent or customers)\n* Expertise in a stagnant industry (achieving success is unlikely if not impossible)\n\nThe state mandated education fails to teach anything about business. The consequence is that company ownership will be a privilege limited to a small percentage of society.\n\n## Profit-Driven\n\nCompanies exist to produce profit. Nothing more. Nothing less. This often results in poor resource allocation and price-gouging.\n\nVacant homes [outnumber the homeless](https://www.self.inc/info/empty-homes/). Companies throw away [millions of calories of food](https://www.rts.com/resources/guides/food-waste-america/) while the impoverished starve. Companies [destroy their own products](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543527/amazon-unsold-products-destruction-investigation) to artificially decrease supply, resulting in a higher price.\n\nThese actions are taken in the name of profit. Companies are not charities.\n\nThey are *for-profit businesses*.\n\nThe best example of price gouging comes from the American medical industry. Americans pay [more for healthcare](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/#:\\~:text=Health%20spending%20per%20person%20in,highest%20per%20capita%20health%20spending.) than every other developed nation. Despite the heavy price tag, Americans receive some of the worst treatment.\n\nAn ambulance ride is more than a month’s salary. Medical bills [create 62%](https://medalerthelp.org/blog/healthcare-statistics/) of all bankruptcies. And roughly [30% of all healthcare costs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertszczerba/2013/10/22/six-frightening-facts-you-need-to-know-about-healthcare/?sh=67b1535ec24c) are completely wasted.\n\nAll these problems stem from the inherent structure of companies. It is simply more profitable to destroy their own products or charge $20,000 to treat a heart attack.\n\nCompanies have existed for 400 years now. If we haven’t solved these problems yet, it’s unreasonable to expect we ever will.\n\nI feel the need to clarify that I do not blame company owners for these problems. They are playing the game to the best of their ability. And more power to them.\n\nThe problem exists in the *game design*. Not the *players* in the game.\n\nThankfully, DAOs provide a better game to play. A game that adequately addresses every problem with companies.\n\n# DAOs Are Better Companies\n\nDAOs have countless benefits compared to companies. There aren’t formal roles or hierarchy. And decisions are made by community opinion.\n\nDAOs rely on voluntary labor. People show up to provide value because they *voluntarily* choose to do so. This results in *exponentially higher quality labor*.\n\n> It’s the difference between clocking in and doing the bare minimum compared to working on a passion project. There’s simply no comparison.\n\nThe best example is comparing [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) to [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). Both organizations offer the ability to trade cryptocurrency.\n\nCoinbase is a publicly traded company with thousands of employees. Uniswap is a DAO with \\~20 core engineers.\n\nDespite the different amount of labor, they handle *similar levels of volume*. There have even been days when [Uniswap’s volume is higher](https://cryptobriefing.com/uniswaps-daily-volume-overtook-coinbase-more-80-million/).\n\nWhich organization sounds like a better investment?\n\nAnd mind you, Coinbase runs a tight ship. They are the largest American cryptocurrency exchange and provide a safe and convenient user experience.\n\nThe difference between Uniswap and Coinbase illustrates the difference between DAOs and companies.\n\nDAOs also solve the 3 most pressing problems facing companies today.\n\n## Investor upside\n\nCompanies are investor-owned. All the captured value goes directly to them. While the workers are paid the bare minimum.\n\nDAOs are community-owned. All the captured value goes into the DAO as a whole. This is primarily done with a native token.\n\nUniswap does a good job? Every token increases in value. It doesn’t matter if you built the smart contracts or wrote the copy on the website. You capture just as much value.\n\nThe only way to become a community member is by owning the token. This ensures every member is *financially incentivized* to contribute their best labor to the DAO.\n\nIn time, DAOs will replace every company for this reason. It’s not a mild improvement. *It’s a revolution of efficiency.*\n\n## Barrier to entry\n\nCompany ownership is a privilege few will ever know. There are simply too many barriers to entry.\n\nAnyone can start a DAO. The only barrier to entry is will-power. This means DAOs will be in fierce competition with each other. Only the best will rise to the top. They’ll attract the best labor, capital, and members. And once part of the DAO, they each have a stake in its success.\n\nA similar dynamic played out between Hollywood and YouTube. Hollywood operates much the same way companies do. There’s a massive barrier to entry. Even bigger than to start a company.\n\nThis resulted in decades of stagnation, remakes, and nonsense.\n\nYouTube allowed anyone to become a video-creator. Suddenly, millions of independent creators were locked in fierce competition to entertain the world. It wasn’t just a mild improvement. It was a *revolution of efficiency.*\n\nToday, movies are an occasional pleasure. Meanwhile, YouTube is so entertaining that it’s [addictive](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/03/youtube-addiction-mental-health).\n\nRemoving the barrier to entry exponentially increases the quality of the competition. *A similar dynamic will play it with DAOs.*\n\n## Profit-driven\n\nProfit is the only goal of companies. Resource allocation and human lives come second. Always have and always will.\n\nDAOs are mission-driven. The primary goal is to solve a problem or create value. *Profit comes second.*\n\nThe profit is a byproduct of creating value.\n\nIf a DAO put profit before its mission, members would leave. That’s not what they joined for.\n\nAdditionally, competitor DAOs could position themselves as a better alternative. This would attract those members, and create a better public perception.\n\nLet’s imagine Uniswap became profit-driven. Let’s say they tacked on a 25% fee on all transactions. Uniswap users would drop like flies. They would flee to a competitor.\n\nLet’s also acknowledge that this wouldn’t happen anyway. The community makes collective decisions in the best interest of the DAO. It would require the majority of Uniswap members to vote in favor of this decision.\n\nTheoretically, this could happen. But a competitor would immediately capitalize on it.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nCompanies play an important role in our modern societies. And they have for 400 years. It was a useful social construct that combined different forms of leverage. And created the wealthiest human civilization we have ever seen.\n\nHowever, companies are an outdated tool. They create many problems that plague our society. They create rampant wealth inequality, prevent competition, and will sacrifice anything for profit.\n\nDAOs address each of these issues and more. They are more efficient, encourage competition, and emphasize mission over profit.\n\n**DAOs will replace companies in our lifetime. The structural efficiencies are too powerful to ignore.**\n\nIf you’d like to learn [how to join a DAO, check out this article.](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-join-a-dao-cfae5577e8f9)", "timestamp": 1634057250, "digest": "81oDlls5x199Wi3D_3yrVmaFZ8rdqnD46Zn5eMCN7dw", "contributor": "0x7afF5FdE4312Ac9874b89B2ba0cE1FA269B80de1"}

I also dug a lot of Wal’s and swapped them for grapefruit when the price of the platform was high. Then the cetacean exchange does things like send grapefruit accounts. The whale exchange was still very early, with very few users and not enough currency. But over the past two years, the CETX has been making continuous improvements. With the over-the-counter trading function, cross-links have been added, and mainstream currencies can be purchased. The current CETX has excellent liquidity and a very rich variety of currencies, it has even launched a variety of wealth management products on rival platforms.\n\n之后币乎上在宣传一个去中心化交易所鲸交易所，各路大佬甚至币乎的老板咕噜都在做宣传，扫他们的红包，就可以领到平台币，每天只要你扫就能领好多次，一时间币乎里面的人都在发他们的红包。后来交易挖矿就开始了，只要你在里面交易就可以挖到和手续费等价的平台币wal。我当时也挖了很多wal，而且在平台币价格高的时候出掉换成柚子了。接着鲸交所又做送柚子账户之类的活动。当时的鲸交所还是很早期，用户非常少，币种不够丰富。但是鲸交所这两年也在不断的进行改进，有了场外交易功能，增加了跨链，可以购买主流币，现在的鲸交所的流动性非常棒棒，币种非常的丰富，甚至还上了其他竞争对手的平台币，推出了各种各样的理财产品。\n\n500元人民币\n\n500 RMB\n\n不久之前和之后，有一个叫做直比的平台。就是所谓的雨天打孩子，闲着就是闲着，所以我在这个平台上玩，经过不断的耕耘，我渐渐挣了很多钱，然后我开始释放。在打开里面的硬币后，我把我赚到的所有硬币都换成了柚子。然后平台货币的价格继续下跌。这个平台再也无法忍受了。它实际上做了一个愚蠢的举动，迫使人们赚取的大部分硬币被冻结，然后被扣除一部分，平台的可信度被抹去，尽管平台尝试了很多事情，它无法阻止货币回归零。更有甚者，有些人卖掉房子来换掉硬币锁，然后在这个平台上玩。然后就什么都没有了。所以我们必须注意投资的配置，非主流货币是不能重新打开的。\n\n知币小赚500人民币\n\n500元人民币\n\nNot long before and after there was a platform called zhibi.

There weren’t many people playing on that platform, but I believe it was a good platform, and I couldn’t get much money for the coins I earned, but in March, April, April, and May of the following year, those coins turned out to be a huge fortune, i’m close to making half a bitcoin, about one hundred and three a day over winter break. For a student, this is indeed a great fortune.\n\n过年的时候，我在褥羊毛赚币打算换柚子，当时是熊市底部。那个平台根本没多少人玩，但是我相信，这是一个不错的平台，我赚的币换不了多少钱，但是来年年三四月份四五月份，那些币变成了，一笔巨大的财富，我接近赚了半个比特币，大概一算寒假时每天能赚个一百二三。对于一个学生而言，这确实是一笔巨大的财富。\n\n6月1日柚子暴跌损失惨重\n\nAt that time, the grapefruit rose slowly. B 1 was going to release some blockbuster product on June 1, so I stayed up late looking at it, and I had a lot of orders on an exchange, and as a result, the market went up, and the damn sharing mechanism spread out, and I predicted that there would be a big market for pomelo, and I kept going, unfortunately, the results were revealed, at this time, I was surprised to find that my original many orders have not been spread out, has not found the transaction records, but I clearly remember in an hour, my contract income has been increasing constantly, so I confronted the customer service, who told me to take a screenshot and ask what I wanted. I had to remove the APP from the exchange, and never went to the exchange again to cash in my money.\n\n当时，柚子慢慢的涨起来了。B1打算在6月1日，发布一些重磅的产品，于是我熬夜在看，而且手上在某交易所开了多单，结果，行情上涨，该死的分摊机制分摊了，我预测柚子会有一波大行情，继续开多，结果不幸被爆，就在这时，我惊讶的发现，我当初的多单并没有被分摊，已经找不到交易记录了，但是我明明记得在一个小时的时间里，我的合约收益一直在不断的增多，于是我质问客服，客服让我拿出截图证据并问我有什么诉求。，我只得心塞的删除了这家交易所的APP，从此再也没有去这家交易所变现币乎赚的key了。\n\nLater, I was watching the press conference, only to see the foreigners on the stage talking, suddenly stopped, the live commentator said it seemed to be over, and then the grapefruit continued to fall, fell to my heart hurts. The Message to me this time is, 1. A central exchange is a god’s vision, and you can’t help it if he says so. Two. To pay attention to the configuration, the currency of any track should be configured a bit, heavy position of a currency, too big risk. (gradually, I began to configure other coins, so that if the grapefruit went to zero, I could get my money back as soon as the bitcoin went up.)\n\n后来我又在看发布会，只见台上的外国人讲着讲着，突然停了，讲解直播的人一脸懵逼说好像结束了，然后柚子继续下跌，跌得我心口都疼。这次给我的感悟是，1。中心化的交易所的确是上帝视角，他说什么就是什么，你也没有办法。2。要注意配置，任何赛道的币都要配置一点，重仓某一种币，风险太大。（后来我渐渐的，配置了一些别的币，即使柚子归零，只要比特币涨起来，我就能回本）\n\n加BitcoinClub群，慢慢明白了比特币是个财富仓库\n\nLater on Weibo, someone posted that if you join his group, you can send 2,000 smart bitcoins. And then I added it, and there were a lot of big shots in there. They all have high levels of bitcoin awareness, and some people have a lot of bitcoin. At the same time, I was reading some coin circle books, such as the self-cultivation of leeks, the investment notes of the old cat and so on. Gradually I realized that bitcoin is indeed an excellent storehouse of wealth, you can transfer money without going through the agency. And I learned that nine gods, according to him, if the stored value function of bitcoin is widely recognized 20 years from now, the price of bitcoin will be 160 million RMB per coin. (and this is his most conservative estimate.) I wouldn’t believe it if I didn’t have a deep understanding of bitcoin, but, as I’ve learned more and more about bitcoin, I’m sure it’s going to go up to a price that’s going to raise everyone’s eyebrows, it’s not necessarily that expensive.\n\n后来在微博上，有人发帖子说只要加他的群，那就送2000聪的比特币。后来我加了进去，发现里面确实有很多大佬。他们的对比特币认知都挺高的，而且有的人有很多比特币。与此同时，我在看一些币圈的书，比如韭菜的自我修养，老猫的投资笔记之类的，渐渐的我明白了，比特币的确实是个优异的财富仓库，比特币不可增发，不可被抄没，可以不经过机构就可以转账。而且我还知道了9神，据他所说如果20年后比特币的储值功能得到广泛公认的话，比特币的价格将会是1.6亿人民币一枚。（而且这是他最保守的估计）如果没有深刻的了解比特币，我是不会信的，但是，经过我对比特币的不断了解，我相信他会涨到一个，所有人都瞠目结舌的价格，虽然不一定是那么贵。\n\n加场外杠杆加仓主流币\n\nBefore long, the price of bitcoin was falling. I borrowed some money off the market and bought Bitcoin, and then bitcoin went down, and I bought it, and I bought it, and I bought it, and I got trapped.\n\n不久之后，比特币的价格不断下跌。我在场外借了点钱买了，买了比特币，不久之后比特币又跌了，我又买，又跌了，我又买，然后就被套了。\n\n孙宇晨巴菲特慈善午餐爆仓\n\nAt that time, I played some capital plate, a few hundred dollars into the money but can not withdraw, but a pity my several hundred dollars of living expenses. Later, some people said that Buffett’s charity lunch may let Sun Yuchen on camera, after my research, I think this matter, basically can confirm the city really. One Night Sun Yuchen finally tweeted, so he immediately do more wave field. I was very careful, I was only 10 times as careful, I just opened my front hand, a few seconds later, I was half-eaten, and then it exploded, and then the text came. The lesson for me this time is that contracts are really not for the average person to play with, even if you make a lot of money in front of you, you can take it away if you make a mistake once. Of course, there is no right or wrong way to use a contract as a tool. You can use it to magnify your gains or to hedge your risks.\n\n当时我玩了一些资金盘，充了钱几百块钱进去却提不出来，可惜了我那几百块钱的生活费。后来，有人说巴菲特的慈善午餐有可能让孙宇晨拍上了，经过我的调查研究，我觉得这件事，基本可以确定市真的。有一天晚上孙宇晨终于发微博了，于是立马做多波场。当时我还是非常谨慎的，只开了10倍，我前手刚开，几秒后就腰斩，接着立马爆仓，然后短信来了。这次给我的教训是，合约真的不是普通人能玩的 即使你前面赚了无数的财富，后面只要错一次就能一把带走。当然，合约作为工具本身没有对错，你可以用来放大收益，也可以用来对冲风险。\n\n玩力场，加仓力场\n\nPlaying force field, plus warehouse force field\n\n然后我又开始玩力场，后来我发现力场还挺不错的，于是就开始逐步加仓，锁仓。我大概买了100万的lc，虽然按柚子本位没有赚多少，但是我相信，这一类的币在牛市高点，你特别不怎么长的时候，才是lc大放异彩的时候，\n\nAnd then I started playing with the force field, and then I found that the force field was pretty good, so I started adding positions and locking positions. I bought about a million LC, although the grapefruit standard does not earn much, but I believe that this type of currency in the Bull Market High Point, you are not very long, that is when LC shine,\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20200425/7ca0063d7286ad3be60caf446c0d817f_GIZDAKRSGIYA.jpeg)\n\n20年\n\n鲸交所最低杠杆质押柚子加仓比特币，3.12差点爆仓\n\n过年前后比特币终于涨破1万，所有的人都兴高采烈，看好减半牛，不久行情回调，可遇不可求的机会出现了。我鲸鱼交所按最低的杠杆抵押了几乎所有的柚子换成了比特币，随着疫情的发展，加上当时所有的人有过分的乐观，市场流动性危机，所有的币都开始下跌，跌到6000的时候有人看5000，4000。结果真的跌到了5000，所有的人都看的更低了，早上起来，比特币继续下跌。我绝望了，柚子的质押率从50变成了60，70，接近嗯，80，接着继续跌。我想要不要把手上的比特币卖了，增加质押率，防止爆仓，然而我想到还要还场外杠杆的钱，于是我心一横我就不看了。终于比特币在3800美元企稳，然后慢慢上涨，虽然后面还跌了一次，但我已经放开了。当时群里都开玩笑说，这几天就不要出门了，免得上气不接下气，让别人误以为得了新冠状肺炎。接着行情就不断的回暖了，不断的有人踏空。这次给我的教训是，囤币是不能带一点杠杆的，而且低杠杆也是非常危险的，你会忍不住的增加质押，而高杠杆虽然容易爆仓，却能被动的止损。还有一点就是比特币是风险资产，即使说他是避险资产，也只能说是避货币增发的险，流动性危机啥都得跌。\n\n慢慢回血加仓\n\n后面就是慢慢的加仓，有点闲钱就买柚子了。\n\n守币如守寡，太难了。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20200425/74db5eca0976a45ab8acb591a3af7909_GY4DIKRUGMZA.jpg)\n\n总结，展望牛市：\n\n1\\.注意配置，我们要赚的是数字货币，区块链产业发展的红利，而不是赌某一个币，将来会暴涨，这样风险真的太大了。\n\n2\\. 不要玩杠杆，最好囤主流币。杠杆风险真的太大了。数字货币将来的涨幅绝对是非常大的。如果牛市来了，你的币没了，不很可惜吗？\n\n3\\.就是不要看空任何的项目，任何项目只要牛市来了都会涨，就是涨多涨少，涨早涨晚的问题。\n\n4\\.不要相信任何的交易所，要去中心化交易所，三大交易所加冷钱包分散储存。\n\n5\\.共识不是靠大家认可，而且靠事实。黄金是物理事实，大饼是数学事实。数学可能比物理更可靠。而且现在币圈的资金盘骗局，都在拿比特币的各种优点来哄骗老人，如果你还体会不到比特币的优越性，说明你确实需要好好的学习一下了。\n\n6\\.就像世纪末的互联网泡沫，虽然当时泡沫破灭了，但是总的方向是正确的，只不过需要时间不断的发展，因此不能追涨杀跌，要囤主流币，做时间的朋友。\n\n币圈大佬分享\n\n1\\.江卓尔 ，江卓尔是莱比特的创始人，比特币投资者，科普者。他创呢的莱比特矿池是国内顶尖的矿池，2017年牛市最高峰时曾达到过全球算力第一，2017年他在知乎上写的文章，《比特币是什么》<https://www.zhihu.com/question/22076666/answer/69638270> 截至目前已经有600万的浏览量，而且他在17年年底比特币价格高点成功逃顶，18年，成功预测比特币可能跌到3000美元左右。但是他短期预测的并不太行，而且他不知为什么，异常的看好比特币的分叉币bch。虽然我认为bch在明年的涨幅可能会超过比特币，但是我认为，bch就是bch。\n\n2\\.9神（微博ahr999）9神是囤比特币的创作者，他提出的ahr999指数非常适合于只是比特币最近的价格的高低，适合囤币，他似乎把囤比特币做成了一生的事业，别的任何币都不碰。虽然他这样会错过很多的机遇。但是比特币的储值功能是区块链世界最最最长久的。其次，他在非比特币领域的发言的确是，让人大跌眼镜。\n\n3\\.区块链威廉  文章认识很高，我关于法币以及比特币的很多知识，都是来源于他，推荐大家关注。\n\n4\\.梓岑  当初就是他提出的奶王语录，<https://bihu.com/article/1731012719> 虽然柚子的价格现在并不显眼，但是柚子确实是最有希望成为下个以太的公链。梓岑每周六都在一直播毫无保留的直播分享他的观点。我觉得他的直播很值得看。<https://bihu.com/article/1704552228>\n\n5\\.比特傻  比特傻是币乎认知特别高的存在。他写过的文章都特别的好，认知也很新颖，而且他提出的空谷钱雨理论，引领我不要脸的找同学要手机号，验证码褥羊毛。他写的《人间奥义资金盘》<https://bihu.com/article/1153441858> 让我对这个世界有了更深刻的认知。\n\n币圈好书分享\n\n1\\.《比特币白皮书》，https://[www.8btc.com/wiki/bitcoin-a-peer-to-peer-electronic-cash-system](http://www.8btc.com/wiki/bitcoin-a-peer-to-peer-electronic-cash-system) 这是比特币创始人中本聪写的关于比特币的论文，首次提到了比特币，这一伟大的发明。区块链世界所有的一切，最初的根本。\n\n2\\.《精通比特币》，这本书非常详细的写了比特币的各种架构原理，加深了我对其安全性以以及未来无限可能的认同。\n\n3\\.《韭菜的自我修养》，这本书是李笑来老师的著作，是我看的第一本有关币圈的书，我们可以从书中找到很多有用的东西。\n\n4\\.《猫说投资笔记》，这是老猫写的自己的投资笔记，我是在这本书中找到“数字货币是更好的钱”这一观点，这本书也写了，老猫自己的投资认知。也推荐大家阅读学习。\n\n5\\. 《比特币是什么》江卓尔<https://www.zhihu.com/question/22076666/answer/69638270> 这个链接，之前提到过，也推荐大家阅读，学习。\n\n好评送key\n\n币乎：\n\n20字以上评论即可，分别发放\n\n10\\*500key＋18\\*300key  总共10400key\n\n欢迎大家点赞评论和转发，最终解释权归作者比特币收割机所有。\n\n力场\n\n20字以上评论即可，分别发放\n\n20\\*1000lc+30\\*800lc  总共44000lc\n\n欢迎欢迎点赞评论和转发，最终解释权归作者比特币收割机所有。\n\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20200425/a830925e2def690f48ebbcfb8b25f3d2_GIZDAKRSGIYA.jpg)\n\n好评奖励将在27号24点前发放完毕", "timestamp": 1634057275, "digest": "6uKBacxdKPSUeb9EF0GjjyuWriaKipSEPcmheDX9RJI", "contributor": "0x374cB27a8753520bb153906a0a34Cc823cEA3C3e"}

Mirror とは\n\n* イーサリアムベースの分散方ブログプラットフォーム\n* イーサリアムウォレット所持者が投稿できるブログ\n* 記事をNFTにできる\n* クラウドファンディング、オークションなどができる\n\n仮想通貨投資をしている人なら簡単に使えるブログで、WordPressがブロックチェーン上にあるみたいなものです。後半2つは、ナゾですよね、、それでは、説明にはいります。\n\n### ■ 2. Mirror の始め方\n\nまずは、公式のページにいきます。\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/](https://mirror.xyz/)\n\n画面の右上の \\[Connect Wallet\\] をクリックします。\n\n自分のウォレットと同期させます。（自分はメタマスクで同期しました）\n\nそして、アカウントを設定しましょう！\n\nこちらは、名前、プロフィール画像設定します。\n\n以上です！！（簡単）\n\n### ■ 3. Mirror の使い方\n\nではでは、ブログの書き方になります。\n\nダッシュボードの、\\[Entries\\] をクリックします。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GHFdrL3lkjRkiueak6Xzl.png?height=619&width=1366)\n\nこれで、ブログを書くページになります。\n\nでか目のタイトルが書けるスペースがあり、あとは、すらすらと本文を書くだけです。\n\n冒頭に、ツイッターやVoicyのリンクが貼ってありますが、リンクをコピペするだけで、ブログっぽくイイ感じになりました。\n\n続いて、ページの下には、 \\[**Blocks** ⌘+/\\] という機能があります。\n\nクリックすると、こんな画面が出てきます。\n\n![Creating blocks](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3dnRW2fnfrRrPE9ZIB3l5.png?height=318&width=370)\n\n上から順番に解説していきますね。\n\n* \\[Heading 2\\] ・・・ 中サイズの見出しです。文中のこれです。\n\n## (例) ✔目次\n\n* \\[Heading 3\\] ・・・ 小サイズの見出しです。文中のこれです。\n\n### (例) ■ 3. Mirror の使い方\n\n* \\[Image\\] ・・・ 画像の挿入です。ファイルを選択するか、画像をドラック＆ペーストするか、リンクをペーストするだけです。（超絶かんたん）\n* \\[Bulleted List\\] ・・・ 小見出しの前にある灰色のポッチです。 \\[・\\] こんなやつです。\n* \\[Blockquote\\] ・・・ 左側にある青色の線です。引用とかに使えそうですね。\n\n> ### Creating blocks\n>\n> To easily create a media or economic block, first click inside your entry to place the curser where you’d like the block to appear. Next, click the **Blocks** area of the Toolbar, or focus with the keyboard shortcut `⌘+/`. The blocks menu will appear, showing you all available blocks. Selecting a block prompts you for secondary information. Once you’re satisfied, confirm the information to insert the block into your entry.\n\n* \\[</> Code\\] ・・・ 初心者はなくても良きです。要勉強ですね。\n* \\[Crowdfund\\] ・・・ 資産を集めるクラウドファンディングです。リンクが貼れるようになります。この辺りはやりたいですよね。まだまだ先ですが、、、以下、引用と翻訳です。\n\n> On Mirror, anyone can raise funds for an idea or project using the Crowdfund block. Under the hood, a Crowdfund is a smart contract on Ethereum. Backers deposit ETH to fund your idea in exchange for a token. The token represents a proof of patronage and a stake in the potential success of your project. Crowdfunds can be embedded into any entry on Mirror, alongside text and other media blocks that tell your project's story.\n>\n> ミラーでは、誰でもクラウドファンディングブロックを使用してアイデアやプロジェクトの資金を調達できます。内部的には、クラウドファンディングはイーサリアムのスマートコントラクトです。支援者は、トークンと引き換えにあなたのアイデアに資金を提供するためにETHをデポジットします。トークンは、プロジェクトの潜在的な成功へのご愛顧と利害関係の証拠を表しています。Crowdfundsは、プロジェクトのストーリーを伝えるテキストやその他のメディアブロックとともに、Mirrorの任意のエントリーに埋め込むことができます。\n\n* \\[Edition\\] ・・・ NFTを固定の金額で個数を指定して販売出来るようです。日本でいう、elu(エル)のNFT版ですかね？！今後は、調べて活用したいですね。以下、引用と翻訳です。\n\n> Editions are a way for creators to mint a limited supply of identical NFTs at a fixed price. If a 1/1 NFT is a Picasso at Sotheby's, Editions are like the thousands of first-edition holographic Charizards released.\n>\n> エディションは、クリエイターが固定価格で同一のNFTの限られた供給をミントするための方法です。1/1 NFTがサザビーズのピカソである場合、エディションは、リリースされた何千もの初版ホログラフィックリザードンのようなものです。\n\n* \\[Auction\\] ・・・ NFTオークションです。独自のオークションを開催出来るので、多くの人に認知されれば期待大ですね。コツコツ頑張りましょう。\n\n> Mirror supports auctioning off NFTs using reserve auctions. Reserve auctions are configured with two main parameters: the reserve price and the auction duration. Like other economic blocks on Mirror, your auction is deployed as a smart contract and can be embedded inside any Mirror entry.\n>\n> ミラーは、リザーブオークションを使用したNFTのオークションをサポートしています。リザーブオークションは、リザーブ価格とオークション期間という2つの主要なパラメータで構成されます。ミラーの他の経済ブロックと同様に、オークションはスマートコントラクトとして展開され、ミラーエントリ内に埋め込むことができます。\n\n* \\[Split\\] ・・・ こちらは共同でプロジェクトを立ち上げたりした場合に、資産を分配出来るみたいです。以下、引用と翻訳です。\n\n> Splits on Mirror are a way to automatically share the value you produce with multiple entities. A split is a payable smart contract that routes value to multiple addresses on Ethereum.\n>\n> Splits can be used as a way to reward your collaborators, the people that have inspired you, or to donate proceeds from your work.\n>\n> Create a split by going to the Splits tab in your dashboard. A split needs to be made between at least two addresses and the percentages must add up to 100%.\n>\n> ミラーでの分割は、生成した値を複数のエンティティと自動的に共有する方法です。分割は、イーサリアムの複数のアドレスに値をルーティングする支払い可能なスマートコントラクトです。\n>\n> スプリットは、あなたの協力者、あなたにインスピレーションを与えた人々に報酬を与える方法、またはあなたの仕事からの収益を寄付する方法として使用できます。\n>\n> ダッシュボードの\\[分割\\]タブに移動して、分割を作成します。少なくとも2つのアドレス間で分割を行う必要があり、パーセンテージの合計は100％になる必要があります。\n\n* \\[NFT Preview\\] ・・・ こちらはMirrorの醍醐味と言ってもイイのではないでしょうか。ブログコンテンツをNFT化出来るサービスですね。この先は、NFTについて話していきます。\n\n以下、引用と翻訳です。\n\n> Entries on Mirror can be minted as NFTs. In order to mint your entry as an NFT, check off the NFT checkbox in the top right corner of the entry editor. Upload a cover image for your entry so it can be rendered across different NFT platforms. Once your NFT is minted on-chain, you'll see confirmation in the byline of your entry.\n>\n> You can retroactively mint a previous entry by editing it, checking the NFT checkbox, and saving the entry. To see which of your entries have been minted as NFTs under the Entries tab in the dashboard.\n>\n> ミラー上のエントリは、NFTとして作成できます。エントリをNFTとして作成するには、エントリエディタの右上隅にある\\[NFT\\]チェックボックスをオフにします。エントリのカバー画像をアップロードして、さまざまなNFTプラットフォームでレンダリングできるようにします。NFTがチェーン上で作成されると、エントリの署名記事に確認が表示されます。以前のエントリを編集し、\\[NFT\\]チェックボックスをオンにして、エントリを保存することで、過去にさかのぼって作成できます。ダッシュボードの\\[エントリ\\]タブで、どのエントリがNFTとして作成されているかを確認します。\n\n### ■ 4. Mirror のNFTコンテンツ化\n\nMirrorの醍醐味、ブログコンテンツをNFT化するについてです。\n\nこれは何かというと、イーサリアム上にブログを作成し、iFrame、動画、NFT、ツイート、クラウドファンド、オークションなどのソーシャルメディアの投稿に至るまで、メディアブロックをブログに埋め込むことができます。\n\nSubstackやMediumなどの他のプラットフォームからブログをインポートすることもできます。\n\n最も重要なことは、ブロガーがブログを「エントリーエディション」として作成できることであり、これは、コンテンツのNFT化であり、それらを収益化することができます。\n\nすばらしい！！パチ、パチ、パチ、パチ（拍手）\n\n* Mirrorは業界のリーダーやDAOによって使用されてきました。\n\nイーサリアムの共同創設者のVitalikButerinのような業界リーダーや、Aave Grants DAOのようないくつかの分散型自律組織（DAO）は、Mirrorを使用してコンテンツを公開してきました。\n\n2021年のイーサリアムの開発に関するドキュメンタリーは、Mirrorのクラウドファンディング使用してを通じて1,036ETH（約4000万）を調達しました。\n\n> ## Mirror has been used by industry leaders and DAOs\n>\n> イーサリアムの共同創設者であるVitalikButerinのような業界リーダーや、Aave Grants DAOのようないくつかの分散型自律組織（DAO）は、ミラーを使用してコンテンツを公開しています。\n>\n> 今年の7月、イーサリアムの開発に関するドキュメンタリーは、ミラーを使用してクラウドファンディングを通じて1,036ETHを調達しました。\n\n(引用:bitcoinethereumnews.com)\n\n### ■ 5. 未来予想\n\nワクワクするようなプロジェクトですよね。\n\nユーザーが書いたブログ記事は、NFTに紐づけることで、その記事を世の中に唯一無二のものとして、公開することができるようになりました。\n\nMirrorで書かれた記事に価値を見出す人が存在すれば、その記事に価値が付き、所有権をNFTで売買できるようになります。\n\n所詮、テキストなので、コピペすれば元も子もないですが、どの記事が本当の原本になっているのかを証明することが可能になりました。\n\nツイッターの創業者、ジャック・ドーシーの初ツイートNFTが高額で取引されたこと覚えてますか？\n\nMirrorのようなNFTを使ったサービスは、デジタル化によってコンテンツの複製が容易になった時代に、新しい価値を見出してくれると思うんですよね。\n\nMirrorの今後は不明ですが、おっちゃんは注目しています。\n\n※余談ですが、集中して書いていたのでPCの電源落ちるまで気付かなかったです、、、8割まで書いて消えました。涙\n\n対処法は、小まめに保存すること。歯車マークをクリックして、パブリックかドラフトか選択して、Saveしてください。下書きはドラフトです。\n\nセーブして思ったのですが、パーマリンクで投稿を見ると、改行して、スペース開けたのに元に戻っていたり、 \\[Bulleted List\\]の・と数字がうまく表示されず、断念しました。（技術不足）\n\n2回も書いたのでより理解が深まったので良きです。\n\n何事も手を動かさないとですね。とりあえずやってみる。\n\n※2. このあと、NFT化して投稿しようとしました。が、ガス代高くて諦めました。\n\n１投稿$100したら、稼ぐまで道のりが、かなり無理ゲー感ありますよね。\n\nですが！！、土日はガス代が少し安いので、土日に投稿しましょう！\n\nただ、投稿する分には大丈夫です。（無料でできます）\n\nそうそう、投稿する画面で、ブログのトップ画像もアップ出来ます。サイズは１：２です。\n\n最後に、イーサリアムのアドレスをコピペして投稿完了です。\n\nそれでは、ネガティブ要素も克服しつつ、コツコツやっていきましょう！\n\nおわり", "timestamp": 1634060684, "digest": "C97VsqUxx88BOYKpK1jBBbzQNZ-vpldG6Qi4SOfB8Xc", "contributor": "0x6c9801C090DD8BfEBE45a63EeF187CeaaE3d2f00"}
{"id": "KepeAk5gEq7m-64eAZLbkntSjMiEkYiJ7nsX7mOKHCw", "title": "Optimizing DAO Delivery", "body": "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are the next evolution in human organization. They are enabled by the Internet and will, most assuredly, have an impact just as large. While their present state is one of early infancy, they are the ground soil from which the world’s first true digitally native nations will emerge. It’s in their core design to enable outputs and outcomes of greater efficiency than traditional organizations could ever hope to imagine. \n\nThis is wrought through at least three unique mechanisms made possible by the peculiar characteristics of blockchain and smart contract technology. These three mechanisms are dramatically improved coordination through programmable agreement, aligned incentivization through shared tokens, and radical inclusivity made possible through permissionless membership and global digital access. To put it simply, the purpose of a DAO is to accomplish more. More info: [State of the DAO](https://banklessdao.substack.com/p/state-of-the-daos-0-oct-6th-2021)\n\n## Promise vs Reality\n\nUnfortunately, the experience for many new DAO members can fall short of this lofty vision. Coordination overhead can feel even higher than traditional organizations, investment criteria for projects can be less than explicit, and new members can struggle to find their place and remain engaged in the chaos. If the very purpose of a DAO is to mitigate these shortfalls but they are growing worse, we must ask why.\n\nMany suggest that things will naturally and inevitably get better with time but the persistent existence of the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) says otherwise. If it is assumed that efficient and virtuous structures will emerge naturally with time, then one must ask why they didn’t in the old system. What can be done about this? \n\n## Structured for Delivery\n\nFunction follows form. How people are organized will determine the limits of what they can produce. This has been stated in [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) which states that product architecture will match organizational structure. Org structures determine communication lines and those lines will determine the shape of what's produced. It’s conceivable then that some of the DAO shortfalls might be addressed by restructuring how a DAO is organized. \n\nThere are [two kinds](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/features-and-components/) of organizational building blocks and organizations tend to favor one. The first kind is the specialist team, also known as a component team. Classical organizations heavily relied on these through the use of departments. The second and alternative kind is the feature or product delivery team. These are cross-functional units that possess the skills necessary to deliver an outcome from soup to nuts. They are solely responsible for the success or failure of a product's launch and support.\n\nWhile specialist units do have their place, they suffer from deficiencies that make them death sentences to organizations that try to leverage them as their primary building blocks. The biggest deficiency is that they dramatically increase coordination overhead. Product teams, on the other hand, need no extraneous external assistant communication to deliver value. They are, by definition, self-governed atomic units that possess all the resources and talent to deliver the promised output. They are the ultimate [engines of organizational delivery](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-benefits-of-feature-teams). It's also for this reason why many of the world’s most successful product companies organize around them and why they are the basis for ideas like [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Eric-Ries-audiobook/dp/B005MM7HY8/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwkvWKBhB4EiwA-GHjFm_eOzmvsbB5qgk4UIEVOK-8K7xgnWB1sF71FJ3WlQNYRmQgIj2MdBoCDaUQAvD_BwE&hvadid=241655092244&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9052407&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=8660640402272623034&hvtargid=kwd-26937775299&hydadcr=21875_10169765&keywords=the+lean+startup&qid=1633556668&sr=8-1). (It’s also why technologies like [micro front-ends](https://micro-frontends.org/) will play a much bigger part in application architectures of the future.)\n\n## ‘Eliminate’ Coordination\n\nCoordination overhead is reduced by eliminating dependencies. Too much time is spent on *managing* dependencies when we should be talking about eliminating them. This can be seen in [Brooks Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law) which states that adding more manpower to a late project makes things even slower. This is primarily due to the combinatorial explosion in communication channels as more resources are added. This is exactly the culprit that rears its ugly head in a specialist group-dominated organizational structure. Let’s say your organization has 8 specialist groups. How many groups need to be coordinated to deliver a single product deliverable? The answer is all of them. Add another product and you have just doubled the overhead. Once this trend starts then more organization units will be birthed in an attempt to deal with the overhead and the pointed horns of Moloch, the god of coordination failure, once again emerge. \n\nThis was the genius of Jeff Bezos’s famous API mandate which stated that all cross-team communication had to happen via API, not interpersonal meetings, and then anyone failing to do so would be promptly fired. With one fail swoop, Jeff Bezos disintegrated an order of magnitude of coordination management. \n\n“It might seem improbable, but Amazon’s incredible growth can largely be attributed to the API Mandate. To paraphrase Benedict Evans, it has turned Amazon into ‘a machine for making more Amazon’.” - [Chrislaing.net](https://chrislaing.net/blog/the-memo/#fn:1)\n\nFollowing this train of thought, [Jade Rubick](https://twitter.com/JadeRubick) insightfully observes in [How to build silos and decrease collaboration (on purpose)](https://www.rubick.com/how-to-build-silos-and-decrease-collaboration/) that silos rightly exist to compensate for limitations in human cognition and argues that we should be strategically using them to maximize collaboration within teams and minimize collaboration between them. All of this becomes possible when an organization is built around execution teams. Coordination can be minimized while delivery becomes supercharged. \n\n## Implementation\n\nThe question then arises of how to implement the above knowledge in an already functioning DAO that has been predominantly structured around specialty groups. Like all things blockchain, DAOs can pose a natural resistance to cross-cutting changes as processes and procedures have likely evolved through layers of consensus. With this consideration in mind, I suggest the following non-controversial steps to raise the prominence of the DAOs existing execution teams:\n\n1. Establish visibility. Move the main DAO projects/products to your DAOs wiki and/or website homepage. To further increase visibility, create dedicated channels for each product and make their development and progress the primary emphasis of the DAO’s regular community call. \n2. Differentiate by tooling. Create dedicated Github repositories for all funded projects under the DAO’s official organizational account. This will introduce concrete feature team membership through repository access and make team progress transparent. This also has the benefit of introducing project boards that can have concrete assignees and release target dates.\n3. Prioritize product funding. As a DAO, increase focus on funding products with clear revenue models and proven execution teams. This doesn’t mean specialty groups can't be funded on the basis of public goods but that should not be the major thrust of funding. \n\n## Benefits\n\nIn conclusion, let me suggest the several benefits that should come from such a strategy. \n\nFirstly, your DAO will be structured for effective delivery. If you organize around user-facing value, you will inevitably improve that delivery. \n\nSecondly, with such a straightforward organization, new members can clearly see where the existing need is and can join teams and contribute without having to understand everything that’s happening across the DAO. This makes for easier onboarding and lends itself to sustained engagement. \n\nThirdly, the DAO will be adequately structured for scalability through new products and services with their own respective executions teams. You will have effectively map-reduced the productive output of the DAO. \n\nLastly, the investment criteria for projects will be made patently clear because it will have been boiled down to a fundamental question of ROI (return on investment).

{"id": "EHGpBM2kR9RKmblx58ruNM32ZfxIU6-9rIdB_bpwva8", "title": "Five Reasons I Am Pursuing a Career in Web3", "body": "For those following my journey, you may have noticed I knew absolutely nothing about blockchain technology before August 2021. I was on my way to becoming a full-stack web developer, creating cute little CSS references, and tweeting the most cringe jokes about JavaScript.\n\nAfter this, I dove into what is Web3 and how it could impact the world at large. I saw numerous posts detailing how Web3 is the next revolution in technology and how its technology will enable the creator economy. This innovation piqued my interest; we deserve a world where everybody can thrive and participate in this tech revolution in multiple capacities. I want to build a world like that.\n\n### 1. Decentralization is a start to a more equitable world.\n\nThis is my first and foremost reason for moving into Web3. If you are not making a positive impact with the work you do, why do it? \n\nWorking for non-profits and small companies has made me realize the profound impact technology has on our society. After all, modern technology emerged to solve problems and improve our world. \n\nOne of the many well-known applications of this technology we observe is cryptocurrency or DeFi (decentralized finance). This medium of digital currency is slowly disrupting traditional financial institutions and paving the way towards an equitable world.\n\nHow does cryptocurrency drive us towards more equity?\n\nFor starters, cryptocurrency has the potential to break financial barriers across borders. People across the globe can trade with each other, potentially stimulating economic growth in every area that participates.\n\n \n In addition to this, it reduces overall transaction fees in the long run. Most of our transactions currently are processed by some central institution or third party, often requiring real estate, employees, utilities, etc. With lower transaction fees, trading goods will cost less over time, benefiting the consumer. It will also decrease the time required to process transactions as automated systems are available 24/7 and not closed after 5 pm.\n\nLastly, the transparency that blockchain technology offers is essential in reducing fraud. Investigating transactions from an entity such as the government will help reduce corruption, as more people will see how their contributions get distributed. These transactions cannot be manipulated by any corporation or individual since it is all immutably stored on the Blockchain. \n\n### 2. I believe you should own your data.\n\n \n In this day and age, our data is passed around to advertisers and third parties like a giant game of corporate hot potato. Not only do these corporations profit off this data, but your data also is not always secure under their systems. As developers, we may have seen how difficult it is fully secure software.\n\nConsider something like our medical records stored in some hospital's software system. To move this data to a new location, we have a tedious process. Sometimes, this process even involves manually adding that data again to a new system. Records can get lost, and it requires dedicated labor to maintain these storages of information.\n\nHow secure our data is in these systems is another question we should be pondering. We see news of data breaches very regularly and realize how little control we have over these attacks.\n\n \n With blockchain technology, it would be possible to hold your medical records privately and securely. You would give certain entities access to it, ensuring the right party receives the data and stores it securely on the Blockchain.\n\nThe application of security, transparency, and owning your data does not only benefit medical records. Imagine this technology applied to government-issued IDs, passports, or any other applications requiring magnitudes of sensitive data. This system makes it not only convenient but also provides security.\n\n### 3. I want to introduce more people to the Blockchain.\n\n \n Blockchain is not always easy to understand, especially for those who are not technically literate. This unease causes apprehension and a rise in misinformation. Not to mention, many people are intimidated by Blockchain and its impacts on our society or environment. A lot of this stems from clickbait headlines and emotional decision-making based on misinformation. My goal is to understand and decrease the apprehension by bringing awareness of how Web3 works and the actual positive and negative implications. \n\nAfter that, anyone can decide for themselves how they feel about the technology. My mission isn't about conversion and creating a cult of blockchain enthusiasts; it's about awareness of a technology that can potentially change the world. \n\n### 4. I want to challenge myself.\n\n \n In all honesty, ever since I started doing computer science, I have struggled a lot. There were times when I felt I wasn't fit for the field. I stuck to what I was good at and never tried new things.\n\nI quickly learned that staying in your comfort zone stagnates growth. In a world where technology is constantly changing with new systems surfacing, it's vital to understand them and how they impact you as soon as possible.\n\nLearning Blockchain is indeed a marathon that I intend to carry out as a personal and professional goal.", "timestamp": 1634062030, "digest": "xvByH-8qplXCmEqiN05BQHiwBjVniFyeKDVlqJ4D-mc", "contributor": "0xcFc3BBa684D839B9340CddACeD2161E85593a167"}

{"id": "eRJ1CmD8dq2SL_tmIrvMolwgXvx3dlG11zCW57-6PX8", "title": "DAY 35", "body": "DAY 35 04.19.2020\n\n \n \n\nIt’s amazing how nature's littlest creatures can ruin something for you (I’m not talking about the you-know-what). Yesterday It was 35 degrees with 4 inches of snow on the ground. We woke up to a gorgeous winter wonderland vista. This morning it had all melted as if nature flipped on its underground heating coils. We went on another hike to a different trail. The temperature at hike time: 60 degrees. If you were to concoct the ideal recipe for breeding gnats or other micro-flying monkeys overnight, this two-day scenario would pretty much be it. The snow added that extra oomph the gnats needed to come out in droves when they looked at their weather apps and saw how lovely and soaking wet everything was. The lake was also offering a free buffet of hikers desperate like us to get the hell out of the house.\n\nGnats are not quite as bad as mosquitoes, but they run a close second because of their size and menacing hovering. Given a choice of trading the google amount of gnats with one single Bengal tiger lurking somewhere in the 300-acre park, I probably would have chosen the tiger. Even the one like the guy in Harlem kept in his apartment—although in fairness that was a Siberian-Bengal mix that weighed 450 pounds. Weighing in at three tons (according to Rainer) I could have taken him easily.\n\nI noticed recently how I’ve been taking liberties in terms of how I speak to my son in this time of crisis. Specifically, I'll use some colorful language both casually, and when I need to get a point across when the regs stuff simply doesn’t stop the speeding bullet that is him. As we gnatted along, Rainer said “Hey dad, these look like the kind of berries you can eat”, as he referred to the omni-mouse red bb-like ones on the ground. As much as I suspected he was saying it to get a rise out of me, I still replied “Actually Rainer, those look like the kind of berries that make you shit yourself right before you die.” I’ve made a decent amount of remarks like this since we’ve been up here as if we had been forced into the wilderness during an apocalypse, and I needed him to grow up faster, and in doing so at times I forget he is my 10-year-old son, and say things to him more as if he were my hunting buddy. I’ve caught myself remarking on more than one occasion, after him displaying all the relentless warning signs that he would interfere with something important I was doing: “Don’t fuck with that” Sometimes I add a \"Pease.\" A good argument could be made that a parent or guardian needs to keep a sense of decorum especially in times of a crisis such as this, but on a scale of the most important lessons I need to teach by example these days, the occasional curse word, used with the best of intentions, just doesn’t rank high enough to stop them from slipping out of my mouth. I tend to say things with a combination of my dad‘s thoughtful grace and cadence, and my mom's Bronx sharp-tongued wise bluntness. I fall somewhere between being Ken, Tony, and Bea, whether it’s talking to my kids, or even to strangers. On the way to the other side of the Lake, a local was fishing, so I engaged him in a friendly manner. “What do you catch here, trout?” Without missing a beat, he responded with the same dry humor as the fridge delivery guy did (see DAY 11): “Allegedly” he replied. He then volunteered how someone told him he’d find a bunch of basses there, but that he hadn’t found a thing. I quickly said “They’re all social distancing”, which I thought was a pretty funny comeback. He just grunted. I’m jealous of the economy of conversation in these parts as if the initial settlers experienced a run on words at the supermarkets, and the supply was never quite replenished, so you had to make do with what you had, kind of like eating Stouffer's frozen lasagna instead of Trader Joes.\n\n“Hey dad, I found some Lake Monkeys.\" Rainer chirped, as he poked the shoreline with a stick. Apparently, these are the lake equivalent of sea monkeys (not to be confused with their flying gnat counterparts). But these actually hatch, as opposed to the ones in the small terrarium-shaped habitat that is still sitting on our Manhattan coffee table, empty as a ghost town because apparently we didn’t properly aerate the water, set the right temperature, and sing Frank Sinatra to them upside down on the full moon when we put the eggs in it. Who knew breeding sea monkeys would be as difficult as hiding a Bengal tiger in your Manhattan apartment? Ruby gathered a bouquet of pine needles, and Delia found a cute ball of moss, became instantly attached to it, and announced she was naming it Gerald. It’s only a matter of time before Gerald takes my place. As we got back to the car, I spotted a family making its way to the marshy side of the lake path, where we had been attacked, after which we sought the higher ground of the other side of the lake, which was significantly better. I shouted to them had they been to the park before, and they said yes. Crestfallen, I still mentioned the difference in bug nuisance, but again in probably too many words. I wanted so bad to say in the vernacular “That way: Many bugs. This way: Fun” but they nodded and waved, and still continued on. After we ate our snacks in the car due to less than ideal picnic conditions, I spotted them coming back as we drove away. Yes, I thought. Me wise monkey.", "timestamp": 1634066131, "digest": "7B9oPjIfdhBuCPNvrGItxUea5y7Df2LPjjp-QfuQ_Fs", "contributor": "0x525dBd6005aFf707c92bCCAd1E593F99F6F14E96"}

Cheaper pricing is one small factor that may get you a few clients but in order to run it as a successful business, you will need a lot more things. Some checklist:\n\n* What significant advantage are you offering over existing ones that you are cloning ? Please tell me pricing is not the only differentiator. Most clients won't care. Trust me.\n* What is the reputation of your company ? Even if you are starting out, you need to show that people can trust you.\n* How easy is your UI/UX ? Are you creating a better clone or a worse clone ?\n* Can you win on customer support ? Lot of people want to switch from their current provider due to customer support. Pricing does influence that decision but not a whole lot.", "timestamp": 1634067558, "digest": "0uP9HCF4d7gmRoDGih9fFIMghgn1Ga4shVHlBl_mTk8", "contributor": "0xF659845726BFA7088CdDd29C2B625240eC003066"}

Xbox Live Gold member for 11+ years. Xbox Insider for 5+ years. Big Team Battle is my passion. I create gameplay opportunities through teamwork and leadership. I persevere by being mentally stronger and more mature than the opposition. The light in the dark. The point between rage and serenity.\n\nMy Halo Timeline: Beat Halo CE & Halo 2's Campaigns on solo Legendary (PC) before buying an Xbox 360 & Halo 3 in early 2009. Focused mainly on collecting achievements. I then discovered competitive Halo (MLG at the time) & began watching online tournaments every chance I got. Since then I've kept up with the competitive Halo esports scene closely & am a dedicated spectator/fan of many players. Due to school & a lack of close immediate support I would never compete in tournaments myself, but I've always had a strong interest in playing Halo competitively no matter the situation. For me, having fun in any multiplayer game means winning & learning how to do so in the most skillfully efficient & teamwork oriented way possible. My Halo \"timeline\" in chronological order:\n\nUnlocked all achievements in Halo 3 (+DLC).\nBought Halo 3 ODST day one & unlocked all achievements acquiring Recon armor in Halo 3 (noteworthy at the time).\nPlayed the Halo Reach Beta & hit max rank.\nBought Halo CE Anniversary day one & unlocked all achievements.\nBought Halo Reach day one & unlocked all achievements (+DLC). I climbed to \"Reclaimer\" rank. I had 70,000+ kills with over a 1.9 K/D. Discovered my love for Big Team Battle.\nBought Halo 4 day one & unlocked all achievements (+DLC). Hit SR130 within two months of the game's release. I have 103,000+ kills, over a 2.3 K/D, and a 50CSR in BTB, CTF, Race, OG Slayer, ect.\nPlayed the Halo 5 Beta & achieved Semi-Pro rank in Slayer & Breakout.\nBought Halo MCC day one & mainly stuck to the BTB playlist. Due to the incredibly broken nature of the game I refused to get all the achievements. There is a lot I could say here. This was by far the lowest point in my experience with the Halo franchise.\nBought Halo 5 day one & unlocked all achievements. Joined ExO Delta Gaming on 10/22/2016. Formed Formal Focus on 8/20/2020. Placed Champ #13 in BTB during the Preseason & later Champ #43 in only 24 games during the Summer 2019 Season on my alt HybridSupport76. Publicly credited on Halo Waypoint for having majorly impacting the 2019 \"BTB Refresh\" update (awarded 343 Fire Unicorn AR skin). Placed Champ in BTB on several other accounts. Over 1000 Warzone wins (90% win rate; non-firefight) & over an 80% win rate in Arena with 360+ Perfection medals. HaloTracker: Top 100 for Score and top 800 for K+A/D Ratio.\n\nOther Noteworthy Points:\nI've set up & successfully run over four different local 6+ Xbox 360 Halo LANs.\nI personally attended & spectated MLG's 2011 Columbus Ohio tournament (Halo Reach) and the 2017 Halo World Championship (Halo 5).\nI don't curse/cuss at all. Even so, I choose to judge others by their actions, not purely by their words.\nI'm an avid gamer, streamer, music listener, movie viewer, and overall media connoisseur.\n\nCONTROLLER:\n\\-Type: Microsoft Elite Series 2 (wired; 4 paddles; hair triggers on; left analog stick on \"aggressive\")\n\\-Button Layout: Bumper Jumper\n\\-Horizontal Sensitivity: 2\n\\-Vertical Sensitivity: 3\n\\-Aim Acceleration: 5 (=10 in MCC)\n\\-Inner & Outer Deadzones: 0 (7 Radial & 0 Axial in MCC)\n\\-Toggle Crouch, Clench Protection, Assassinations, Maintain Sprint, Auto-Stabilize & Vibration: ALL OFF\n\\-Hold to Clamber: On\nSETUP:\n\\-Headset: Astro A50+TR Modkit+\"ZaliaS Arcturus\" EQ preset\n\\-Console: Xbox Series X\n\\-Capture Card: Elgato HD60 S+\n\\-Monitor: LG 27UL500\n\\-Microphone: Blue Yeti+pop filter\n\\-Chair: Secret Lab Titan (Napa Leather)\n\\-Editing Software: Final Cut Pro X\n\\-Webcam: Logitech C920\n\\-Computer: 2020 custom-built NZXT (NVIDIA 2080 TI; Intel i9 9900K 8-core 3.6GHz; 32GB 4000GHz RAM; 2TB M.2 NVMe SSD)", "timestamp": 1634071221, "digest": "09I2hS4ewmMYQ8meGpQOXfQw-jiMjCIuLVnXWgo4reA", "contributor": "0x40313f66f7eb3eb5FF210cD95807d8201fc28406"}

Prior to this controversial piracy explosion, music discovery was a cumbersome, expensive endeavour, inaccessible to most.\n\nAs we started to realize just how much amazing music was sitting quietly on the internet, these early years ignited our passion to share unheard gems with as many people as possible.\n\nIn 2007, after nearly a decade of purely recreational music discovery, we started a blog called **Hillydilly**, originally intended as nothing more than an efficient means of sharing music with close friends.\n\nAs **Hillydilly** gained momentum, its ethos and purpose became clear: to share music on a song-by-song basis, solely based on each individual track’s quality—and nothing else. Regardless of whether a song came from an undiscovered talent or a superstar, we assessed everything equally, with as little bias as possible. We were determined to be the most reliable source for music discovery and curation, untouched by nepotism, politics, or monetary gain.\n\nDuring **Hillydilly**’s 14 year run, we were lucky enough to discover and help break some enormously influential artists ([Billie Eilish](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/magazine/billie-eilish-profile.html), [LANY](https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2016/03/27/new-noise-lany/), Lorde, [healy](https://www.memphisflyer.com/listen-up-ethan-healy-on-returning-to-his-memphis-roots-new-single-and-video-released-july-23rd) + many more), earning us our reputation as a trusted source of music discovery and curation—something that we are immensely proud of.\n\n## The Future\n\nWhen **Hillydilly** shut down in May of 2020, we started **Before The Data**, which allowed us to shift our focus towards shining a light on the need for human-led curation in a music business climate that heavily prioritizes data and algorithms.\n\nWhile data and algorithms have their extremely useful place in music, we believe that human curation is still essential for a healthy climate.

{"id": "ZW6-A7mb7flh-Oj1uSeObuZfh1GoPuvo-WQCaJdZzNY", "title": "Proof of First: Web3 Taste, Earliness, and Curation", "body": "## Who, What, When, and Where\n\nOne of the advantages of blockchain technology is timestamped proof of users’ actions and associations with various applications, individuals, and organizations. These actions are immutable in the sense that they’re unchangeable and set in stone. It immutably records what happened, who was involved, and when it occurred.\n\n> *“What the blockchain does is assert facts about the metadata… It starts to give you unambiguous proof-of-who, proof-of-when, proof-of-what.” - [Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&t=4723s)*\n\nIn a social context, users can leverage this history to prove that they or others were not curating things at a particular time. Spotify’s Year in Review is a compelling example of this. Moreover, people trust it because the information comes directly from Spotify, and authority is critical for strong proof-of-first mechanisms.\n\n## The Hunter Economy\n\nImagine a local band that you discover and strongly feel is going to be big. In web2, you have very few mechanisms for supporting the organization in such a way that benefits you for being early. Web3 forms a fundamentally new economy around this activity. Among hipsters and cultural people, non-conformists and conformists, there is a high emphasis on earliness. Being in something before it was fantastic - being ahead of the curve, if you will. Being in something before it’s played out.\n\n![Spotify Year in Review](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z6A6Wu7VLYAC3mf8PJLsP.png?height=536&width=1080)\n\nThe first wave of supporters leads to the next wave, but they are rarely rewarded for the asymmetric value they provided that artist. Creators with quality content and many followers tend to perform well on social media platforms. But who are the individuals who are curating their content? Who is drawing multiple other users to the creator? What is their incentive?\n\n> *Enter “The Hunter Economy” — a whole class of startups that'll be built to incentivize & reward early adopters both economically & socially. They'll exist for discovering new products, new people, and new ideas. I was going to call this the \"Hipster Economy\" since it more acutely identifies the phenomenon of taking joy in discovering things early, but it also has a negative connotation I don't imply. But it's essentially that same phenomenon — a joy in early discovery — “I liked it before it was cool” — which will exist everywhere: bands, newsletters, people, you name it!*\n>\n> *For example, everything you subscribe to could list your place in line so you could demonstrate how early you were. With crypto involved, you could also be financially incentivized to be a curator. A great example of this is [Yup.io](http://Yup.io), which rewards curators across the internet for liking & commenting on things they care about — things they already do natively in web2.  - [Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-hunter-economy)*\n\nRecently web3 tools are being built to allow individuals to support creators by owning assets associated with that creator and then having an incentive to help that individual. But in addition to the monetary gain that individuals receive directly from the creator’s creation or creator’s value add, there’s valuable social signaling in this context: the first supporters could benefit socially from the proof-of-first that they have on the blockchain. So now there’s an action that was a positive social signal associated with this artist at a specific time on-chain.\n\nIt is straightforward for them to prove their early support, good taste, alignment with certain communities, demographics, and genres. In addition to that, it can be an excellent mechanism for others to find, recognize, reward, and target individuals with specific interests. For example, suppose you are a creator with similar taste and similar ambitions as an existing larger community. In that case, it can be enormously advantageous to target their first movers, their first believers, evangelists of the vision, both to you as the creator and to them as curators and supporters. They benefit from an opportunity to be early on something new solely for their track record. The creator gets to target an audience that’s very aligned or likely to listen to and support their content or consume and curate their content.\n\n## Receipts\n\n‘Receipts’ are often used on the internet to describe proof of something that happened that someone may be hiding or unaware of.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Amor_Tiffany/status/1447620304201601030?s=20](https://twitter.com/Amor_Tiffany/status/1447620304201601030?s=20)\n\nBut what are receipts, and how can we trust them? How do we know that a tweet will not get removed or that Twitter hasn’t modified it at the interface level or by any individual at a photoshop level? How can we understand another individual’s relationship to that? The likes that are given and then taken away surrounding a specific tweet, for example. Or someone that claims to have been a believer of something. How can we trust that? Spotify gives us no way to know who the early users are or who the early supporters are. Not for the creators themselves but not for the community, so there’s no incentive to be early on things and therefore follow people.\n\nWeb3 takes ‘receipts’ to the next level, providing indisputable proof. \n\nYup provides the opportunity to be rewarded solely on that social signaling and recognized for *when* you supported something. This proof-of-first mechanism will incentivize people to engage more profound and more specifically on things in the context of their actions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPeople who care very much about being early on have commonly leveraged the internet to prove their earliness or some history of what’s happened. Yup builds mechanisms for individuals to earn and monetize the act of being early on something (without corrupting the creativity or creation itself) with some feed mechanism, some sale or speculative component around the content itself, or even a subscription model. Thus, Yup presents a new way to monetize solely tied to culture and the social value of something.\n\nWeb3 enables them to do that immutable and trustless manner with no platform intermediary between them and that proof. Other creatives, corporations, and organizations can target specific communities based on that information. Different protocols and communities can reward individuals based on their earliness, and products can be built to recognize and celebrate individuals early in various forms.", "timestamp": 1634077725, "digest": "WDO-tO_r2P7OpMToAPjpl00TjHPEoJdpkXbgtKLJBUk", "contributor": "0x4303Ddc9943D862f2B205aF468a4A786c5137E76"}

It includes traveling through space to escape a dying Earth, a consciousness being absorbed into a machine to create super AI, and a scientist accidentally implanting genes into huge spiders to create a new race of eight-legged intelligent beings.\n\nIt’s a wild ride.  I highly recommend it.\n\nAt one point in this story, a “mad scientist” character was studying octopuses, and had an interesting thought that stuck with me:\n\n> \"Senkovi’s personal theory was that the pressure of being in the middle of the food chain was an essential prerequisite for complex intelligence. Like humans (and like Portiid spiders, had he only known), octopuses had developed in a world where they were both hunter and hunted. Top predators, in Senkovi’s assessment, were an intellectual dead end.\"\n\nThis made a lot of sense to me.  Why would we have needed to develop better brains if we were already kings of the jungle?  We were small, had no claws or teeth or tusks, and needed to coordinate in order to get any large task completed, like taking down a larger prehistoric animal.  Living in fear of [giant birds snatching away our children](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajpa.20415), [crocodiles and leopards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_hl804lSfc&t=176s), [saber-tooth tigers and bears and hyenas](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-top-ten-deadliest-animals-of-our-evolutionary-past-18257965/), etc. forced us to evolve smarter rather than stronger, or else go extinct.  We needed to be able to hunt, scavenge, and forage in more intelligent ways, or else starve.\n\n![teratornis | Big animals, Animals, Cryptozoology](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8ef99e6-3cb1-453d-a962-6d02ff1e1464_640x416.jpeg)\n\n*The Size of a Teratonis.

Likely the situation portrayed in the story above: being both the hunter and the hunted.  Being stuck in the middle of the food chain may have made us evolve into a more intelligent species\\*.\n\n*\\*Note: This last point is often disputed.*\n\nSo maybe taking the middle road is the best choice for us.  Maybe it's what we've always done, and how we evolved as a species.\n\nGood investment advice is based around your personal preferences using this “hunter vs hunted” framework.  In the industry it’s more commonly called “risk-averse” and “risk-seeking” behavior, but it’s the same idea (even though being called “a hunter” is way cooler than being called “risk-seeking”).  And whether we’re one or the other usually depends on our personal situation.\n\nGoing full “risk-on,” we could could launching ourselves at woolly mammoth with a wooden stick or making OTM call options [on GameStop](https://furballfinancial.substack.com/p/the-four-horsemen-of-the-retail-apocalypse) because that’s how we could make millions.\n\nGoing full “risk-off,” we could be running for our lives from a sabertooth tiger or going to cash and gold because the FED is printing money, the market is down, and you’re afraid of losing your job.\n\nTo our monkey brains, it’s the same thing.  And where would we feel the safest?  Where are we most comfortable?\n\nStuck in the middle, being both the hunter and the hunted.\n\nThis is complete speculation, but maybe this is yet another reason [why something like the 60/40 portfolio works so well](https://blog.pimco.com/en/2020/12/the-60-40-portfolio-is-alive-and-well), and people are able to stick with it.

{"id": "Dyj5hBDgDIdtILLGEWPate1aJKWjnXL5KBZiB7R3exM", "title": "Every Reason to Stop Eating Meat Right Now", "body": "What we eat matters. It matters in so many aspects that creating an outline for this article was a challenge. People always say, “you are what you eat,” but even this is an understatement. This paper is an argument on why it’s our ethical duty to stop consuming meat and dairy products. I present objective and factual arguments and anything I say in this paper can be found online with proper research. I argue that we should have a broad point of view of the history of time and not be prejudiced against other opinions. Our high-tech urban-city lifestyle existed for less than 0.001% of human history. Meat as a commodity existed for even a shorter period. It has been only 50 or so years since we started eating so much meat. We consume twice the amount we did in the 1960s, and for chicken, we’re eating 400% more. This could be possible when we took the animals from their natural environment, and put them indoors, and industrialized and mechanized the animal industry. Our current diet is a modern invention; it’s not how our grandparents got their nutrition. So, the argument that eating this much meat is ‘part of our basic human nature,’ ‘always has been like this’ fails. \n\nNow we must ask, **why is meat so cheap?** *How did it become such a commodity that we can get a burger for $3? What is in our food, and is it good for us? What is happening to the animals we eat? Who determines what is commonly known about food? Why are there so many diseases, and it’s getting worse? What impact does my diet has on animals and the environment? Could all this be related to how the world is right now?* I am covering as many subjects I deemed relevant and important as possible about the meat and dairy industry in this paper, gathering from many sources. Topics are all interrelated, so understanding all gives a more *wholesome* view. I want to say that my intent is not to be judgmental; I believe it’s my ethical duty to convey this information I have learned, that you might not know. I didn’t know any of this until recently, and I would want someone to *tell me* if they knew what is in this paper. My only goal is to increase awareness, that people know the truth, so each can make up their minds. \n\n**Contents:**\n\n*Argument 1: Animal suffering* \n\n*Argument 2: Industry can’t be trusted* \n\n*Argument 3: Earth is suffering* \n\n*Argument 4: Meat is ruining our health* \n\n*Milk, Cheese, Eggs* \n\n*Are we omnivores?* \n\n*Sustainability* \n\n*New tech opens the door for endless possibilities* \n\n*Ethical Responsibility* \n\n*Spirituality* \n\n*Becoming Vegan, Making the Switch to Plant-Based Diet* \n\n> To utilize the benefits of web3, I am embedding 3 NFTs of animal photographs in this article. The proceeds from these NFTs will be sent to a foundation that fights for animal rights.\n\n**Argument 1: What we eat matters, because animals are suffering** \n\n***Do animals have moral status?*** \n\nAs Darwin showed, humans are part of the animal group as well. We don’t have much difference from the rest of the animal world; we share %98.8 of our DNA with chimpanzees and bonobos. We have developed bigger brains, which enabled us to do more complex cognitive functions, which lie in the frontal lobes in the brain. The emotional, sentient part of the brain is in what is called the lizard/reptilian brain, which developed much earlier in the history of time. We share this part with most animals. Does sapient and intellectual part is what makes us suffer? No, it’s the sentient part, which makes us feel. When we are determining what being has moral status, the question is whether that being has a consciousness. The suffering of animals is a matter of questioning the animal’s consciousness. In determining consciousness, we usually first look at behaviors. Animals are living organisms that appropriately respond to external stimuli. It can showcase hunger, anger, pleasure, and pain.\\[1\\] Animals can recognize people, and some have incredible memories, spatial navigation. Chickens are especially good at withholding a current reward for a better reward in the future (delayed gratification), which requisites an awareness of time and selfhood. Animals also show behaviors of suffering when they are inflicted pain, so there is no reason to question whether they are conscious, sentient beings who can suffer, therefore, have moral status. Lisbon Treaty (2009) recognized animals as sentient beings. \n\n***What is actually happening to the animals we eat? Where do they come from?*** \n\nAlmost all animals we eat comes from feedlots, a factory-like intensive animal farming system. They have an unbelievable intensity of animals existing in a confined place. The whole point is to create the most efficient and cheap system, regardless of how it’s done. Taking animals indoors enabled us to have a massive number of animals in a controlled space. Animals grow much faster so that more meat can be produced, and for this, they are confined in a box-like space with food in front of them 24/7. A cow grows typically in 2 years, but in factories, this span is shortened to 4 months. *How?* Hormones are put into the food animals eat. Hormones in the food are stored in the animal’s tissues, and then is in our bodies when we eat it. What do they eat? Typically in nature, cows eat grass, but in factories, they are given highly genetically modified soy and corn.\\[2\\] Cows never ate corn naturally before we fed them. When they eat this highly GMO food, they start to have metabolic syndromes, just like in humans. Hormones, their food, and their proximity to other alive or dead animals cause diseases. To prevent them from dying before the owners need them to die, animals are given incredible amounts of antibiotics. In the US, 80% of all antibiotics manufactured are used for livestock. We also consume these antibiotics when we eat meat, but more on antibiotic resistance in the argument for health. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYxKgvtojdg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYxKgvtojdg)\n\n(Footage from inside a chicken farm. **Can be disturbing** to some.)\n\n***Treatment of animals in feedlots***\n\nMost animals in this system never see the sun or the sky. They are kept in small cages where they can’t move, turn around, or even lie down. They are kept so to save space, and so they will keep eating all the time. Cows are not allowed to move at all to keep their meat tender. They don’t form muscles, and most are unable to stand or walk anymore. To move them, we use electric shock, as the pain inflicted causes nerves to respond, and it stimulates movement. Chicken are kept in even closer proximity where they can’t form their natural social structure, which makes them aggressive. They end up attacking each other, so we cut their beaks and claws. Turkeys have a similar fate, under such circumstances, and because of all the stress from the horrible treatment and torture, they show abnormal behaviors, even cannibalism. Pigs and other animals are left to live in their waste full of bacteria. They suffer from stress and show cannibalism and tail-biting behavior as they are in a cycle of torture. Pigs are one of the smartest animals on earth, smarter than dogs, and three-year-old humans. Several hundred million male baby chickens are killed immediately after birth as they are not suitable for neither consumption nor laying eggs. Chickens live in a space smaller than a piece of A4 (letter) paper. A factory chicken lives an average of 42 days. They suffer from abnormal bodies because they gain more than 50g every day, and their immune system, organs, and legs can’t keep up. Most animals have disproportionate bodies because of how fast and badly we feed them to increase productivity. In 1972, one cow averaged **9,863** pounds of milk per year; today, it’s **21,697** pounds. It’s quite smart on our end to forcefully increase their milk production and then claim that we need to take their milk, *for them*. We are playing with their genetics, disrupting their natural selection, and evolution.\\[3\\] After their life in the hell-on-earth we created, they are then taken to the slaughterhouse. More than 1 million pigs die in route to slaughterhouse each year, and those who are alive are in close proximation to the dead, which is both traumatizing and terrible for the health of the animals. (which becomes an issue of our health, but more on that later) No laws regulate the duration of the transport, frequency of rest, or provision of food and water. A typical slaughterhouse kills around 1,000 pigs per hour. They are slaughtered while they are fully conscious, crippling with fear. This huge number makes it impossible for their death to be painless or humane. They’re conscious when we put them in hot water of defeathering tanks, or while they’re skinned or hacked apart. This constant fear and torment are widespread. Why no one does anything about it? For such a long time, we didn’t even have this information. Because of the increasing number of diseases, people started asking questions about nutrition, and only then we started looking. Now, the industry pushed **ag-gag laws** to **prevent** activists from entering their property and film what is actually going on inside. This law is clearly intended to censor animal rights abuses. Activist whistleblowers, who are just showing where the food we eat comes from, are regarded the same way as terrorists under this law. (“Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act”) We should ask why they would need this law. We’ll talk about why we’re not attending to these issues in the next section when we discuss the meat industry. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtrvOiuK6w8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtrvOiuK6w8)\n\n(Footage showing dairy cow abuse. **Can be disturbing** to some.)\n\n[https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/56726441181679876690402897331371077105052994973272125722574401088069757304833](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/56726441181679876690402897331371077105052994973272125722574401088069757304833)\n\n**Argument 2: What we eat matters, because we can’t trust the Meat and Dairy Industry**\n\n***How big is the BigMeat? \n ***The value of the global meat industry was $945.7 billion in 2018, and it’s expected to increase to $1142.9 billion by 2023. It’s so powerful that the industry’s decisions have huge impact on our health, the environment, and the fates of so many living beings. Robert Martin summarized the meat industry in a documentary as having all the money of BigTobacco and BigPharma and the personality of the National Rifle Association. Because of its size and value, the meat industry has a significant place in countries’ economies. US government spends **$38 billion** each year to subsidize the meat and dairy industries, but only **$17 million (0.04%)** to subsidize fruit and vegetables. In return, NAMI estimates that the meat industry contributes $894 billion to the US economy. Therefore, the industry is tied up in politics, and there comes its political power.\n\n***How powerful is the BigMeat?***\n\n*Politics*\n\nThe meat industry contributed over $1.7M during the 2014 campaign cycle to deferral candidates. (83% Republicans) The industry spent another $6.9M directly on lobbying the federal government. Power in lobbying enables the industry to create laws and push legislation that doesn’t benefit the people, but laws that will bring in more money. For example, in addition to the ag-gag law mentioned above, the Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act, or better known as **‘cheeseburger bill,’** states that ‘food-producing or retailing corporations cannot be legally held responsible for obesity, heart disease, or other health-related issues caused by consumption of their food.’ It was introduced by Republican Congressman Rick Keller, who received the maximum amount of donations possible from companies including McDonald’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s. Bill passed in the House and is sought solely to protect the producer.\n\nThe influence of food lobbyists also has power over **federal nutritional guidelines**, which advise more meat consumption than what scientists advise. Every 5 years, the Department of Agriculture gives an updated dietary guideline. People who make up this committee receive money from companies such as McDonald’s, Dannon, Coca Cola, Mars, American Meat Institute, American Egg Board, National Livestock and Meat Board, National Dairy Council, The Sugar Association, Campbell’s, Hershey, Snack Food Association. We get dietary recommendations from the companies who have the **most gain** in determining what we eat, and also who produce the food that makes us sick in the first place, which will be discussed under the health argument.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/irP-2AacSIhcimZYz0x2-.png?height=734&width=1236)\n\n*Money*\n\nHow could we trust such an entity when vast amounts of money are involved? People in government face a dilemma, either protect the producer or protect the consumer, as their interests clash. When looking from their position, the individual lives don’t seem to matter that much. The pressure and expectation to support BigMeat are probably widespread within the government as well. If someone were to dissent, that person most likely wouldn’t have a bright future in politics.\n\nHere, it’s important to note **check-off programs,** the government-created commodity research and promotion enterprises. They are meant to increase demand, but this is done without any consideration of health or environmental effects. For example, $12M is given to Domino’s to promote the consumption of cheese. For every $1 the checkoff program spends on increasing demand for cheese, farmers get $4.43 in increased revenue. Domino’s adds more cheese on the menu, cheese producers win, government wins, and fast-food producers win. Consumers lose as pizza is definitely neither healthy nor nutritious.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XM95fAyoC66H2DZ5uUIjK.png?height=998&width=1346)\n\nWe might think why nobody would know or do anything about this issue if it’s really bad. We didn’t touch upon the health and environmental issues yet, but when we do, it will be evident that this is a subject that needs to be attended. When we’re inclined to believe somebody would do something, we are that somebody. We should remember that this is a giant industry, who has all the money and power in the government. It’s beyond the point to expect large organizations to save us.\n\n***Health and Environmental Organizations***\n\nFor BigMeat, who has so much power in government, it shouldn’t be hard to have ties in the health and environmental organizations. These organizations have a large audience who are trusting, so their word matters. BigMeat isn’t oblivious and is well aware of the effects of its products. If it can control these organizations, it can first avoid a possible catastrophe, and also then can use it as a marketing tool. And unfortunately, in today’s world, you can own a lot by using fear and money. BigMeat companies pay millions of dollars to health and environmental organizations, which therefore can’t tell the sick people what is actually making them sick, and to environmentalists how they can actually save the planet. It is probably written in bold in the contracts. BigMeat is putting a huge blockage in between the truth and the people, and that block is piles of money. This doesn’t mean that everybody who works there is a bad person, and people all the way on the top might even want to shout the truth from the roofs, but might not be able to because of the complex politics involved. It is quite sad and disturbing actually to think millions of people who are suffering from chronic diseases have to take a bunch of pills every day. They can be saved, but aren’t because the information they rely on is false.\n\n*Sponsors for Health Organizations*\n\n* American Diabetes Association takes money from Dannon, Kraft (Velveeta, Oscar Mayer, Lunchables), Bumblebee Foods, LLC (processed can meats)\n* American Cancer Society takes money from Tyson, Yum! (Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell) \n* Susan G. Komen (Breast Cancer) corporate partners with KFC, Dietz & Watson, Yoplait\n* American Heart Association takes money from Texas Beef Council, Tyson, Kentucky Beef Council, Idaho Beef Council, Nebraska Beef Council, Mars, Unilever, Domino’s Pizza, Farmland, WhiteWave Foods, Dairy Max, ConAgra Foods, Subway, Perdue, Nestle, Kellogg’s, Kraft. \n\nAll of these organizations take money from meat and dairy companies that are associated with the cause of that disease. This is unfortunately the same with environmental organizations. Almost none of them talk about how we can fight climate change by stopping eating meat. Look at the websites of large leading environmental organizations. Chances are that they are not talking about animal agriculture. We won’t be able to save the planet only by turning off the water when brushing our teeth. The scale of the water animal agriculture is just too vast to be compared to our daily use. One positive is that now, when I am looking for information on this subject and the company doesn’t mention animal agriculture, I can infer that I can’t trust them. \n\nAnother point I’d like to draw your attention to is how much money is spent on **advertising**. Aside from check-off programs, all these powerful big companies, of course, engage in vicious advertising. Going into college, I was very interested in marketing, but now I know for all the bad reasons. My current view on it is that marketing became this attention manipulation machine that is a big cause of consumerist culture, envy, and feelings of self-doubt. It creates a need for us to constantly compare ourselves to others. We are all the time seeing ads that tick our basic senses. Our money is used back towards us so that we spend even more money.\n\n***Relation to BigPharma***\n\nThe cycle BigMeat and BigPharma are in together is fascinating. Millions of people eat food from BigMeat, which in turn makes them sick slowly over time. They then develop chronic diseases, which is where the money lies. Healthy and dead people don’t bring in money. People who ‘have to’ take pills all their lives bring in money. Pills relieve symptoms while creating other symptoms without resolving the root cause. BigPharma and BigMeat get their monetary benefits from people being sick. They recommend eating meat then taking pills to relieve the symptoms of the problems caused by the meat. This cycle continues while people give their hard-earned money to both of these industries. People suffer incredibly, live unpleasant unhealthy lives, spend money on medicine, take care and mourn their loved ones, and life quality drops. They win, we lose. I don’t know what to call this, other than a well-elaborated fraud.\n\nThe problems about the BigPharma are huge in its own right, and too complex to get in here. They control what doctors are told, and focus on medication and relieving symptoms, not treating nor prevention. I just want to stress its relation to BigMeat and point out how huge of a power that is as well. In the US, treating chronic diseases is a **$1.5 trillion** industry. Would BigPharma or BigMeat want to eliminate this? Neither wins from healthy beings. Pharmaceutical industry spends more money on lobbying than any other industry: **$238M.**\n\nHealth organizations mentioned above take money from the people who make money out of us being sick for the rest of our lives. It’s a clear conflict of interest, and as I said before, when given a choice between individual lives and huge amounts of money, money wins. \n\n* American Cancer Society takes money from Pfizer, Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Abbvie, Merck, Abbott.\n* American Diabetes Association takes money from Pfizer, Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novo Nordisk, Janssen, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim.\n* American Heart Association takes money from Merck, Pfizer, Lilly, Sanofi, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Chiesi, Daiichi-Sankyo, Bayer, Amgen, Takeda, Novartis, Genentech, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. \n\nWe have lost our ability to choose what to eat. We are given surreal cheap prices, and we’re constantly bombarded with by misleading messages to create the perception of how much meat and dairy we should be consuming. There are so much externalized costs that are not owned by the meat and dairy industry. Externalized costs are costs that the consumer and society pays for the industry. We don’t ask them to do it, neither does the government, so we all pay their debt together. David Simon calculated this cost: it’s **$414 billion each year**. When we account health care, environmental damage, subsidies, and cruelty. If producers were required to internalize this cost, a $4 big mac would be $11, a $5 carton of eggs would be $13. No matter what you as an individual eat, we’re all paying their debt while they make huge profits. Less the price, more the demand, which is what they want.\n\n**Argument 3: What we eat matters, because Earth is suffering**\n\nWe might not be able to save Mother Earth only by stopping consuming meat and dairy (although I believe we might) but we can’t save Mother Earth if we don’t stop consuming meat and dairy. It’s not a secret that climate change is real, happening right now. If we want human species to continue existing in the beautiful world we live in, we must take action now. The industry is not sustainable, from whatever aspect you look. In this section, I’ll lay down the facts and numbers and talk about different aspects BigMeat is contributing to the destruction of our planet. I believe by knowing what is actually happening, we can each decide what we want to do autonomously.\n\nThe human population grew exponentially. In 1812, there were 1B people on the planet. In 1912, it was 1.5B; in 2012, the number is 7B. Overpopulation is a problem for its own sake, but it can’t be the scapegoat for climate change.\n\n**Every day:** \n\nHuman population drinks **5.2B** gallon water and eats **21B** pound food\n\n1\\.5B cows alone drink **45B** gallon water and eat **135B** pound food\n\n10,000 years ago, which is a pretty short time considering the life on earth existed for much longer, humans were %1 of the biomass in the world, while the rest %99 were free-living animals. Today, humans and the animals we own as our property account for %98 of the biomass, while free-living animals are only **%2.**\n\nAnimal agriculture is responsible for **51% of human-caused climate change** when we account the loss of carbon sinks, respiration, and methane. \n\n**15%** of all greenhouse gas emissions are caused by animal agriculture. \n\n**45%** of the earth’s total land area is used for animal agriculture. \n\n**30%** of global freshwater consumption is used for animal agriculture.\n\n**91%** of Amazon Rainforest destruction is due to animal agriculture\n\nUN reported that livestock is the leading cause of resource consumption and environmental degradation.\n\n***Greenhouse Effect***\n\nNormally, greenhouse gases are good and necessary for us. Without it, the temperature on earth would be -18 degrees C. It keeps the heat from the sun inside the atmosphere so that we can enjoy warmth during the night as well. But we produce a lot of **CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide** that disrupt the balance. This increases the amount of radiation that is sent back to earth, and heat is unable to escape. Typically, Earth’s temperature fluctuates — ice ages to warmer times. The problem is that it increased unusually fast in the last years, and this is *unprecedented*. This results in global temperatures increasing, sea levels rising, and ice caps melting.\n\nClimate scientists say the maximum safe level of emissions for CO2 is **350 parts per million** of CO2, and, right now, we’re at **400ppm**. Methane is **86** times more destructive than CO2. Cows produce 150B gallons of methane per day because of their digestive processes. Animal agriculture produces **65%** of the world’s nitrous oxide, which is a gas with global warming potential 296 times greater than CO2. Worldwatch Institute estimates animal agriculture is responsible for 51% of global greenhouse emissions. This is **more than all transportation** (cars, planes, ships, trucks…) **combined**.\n\n***Land Usage***\n\nAnimal agriculture uses **30% of land on earth** (size of Asia!), **%50 of habitable land**, and **80% of agricultural land in the US**. *(I can hear you say, whaaat?)* Most of which is to grow food to feed the billions of animals we’re manufacturing. We could nourish an additional of 3.5B people if we just ate what we feed to animals. We are currently producing enough crops to feed 9.8 billion people. It’s unbelievable how much land we use to give food to the animals we are going to kill in just couple months. It is so inefficient, unsustainable, and unnecessary when we could eat the crops we are producing. If we were to eliminate animal agriculture altogether, we would have a much healthier land, produce better crops that is good for human consumption, and have so much extra land that could be reversed back to being a forest. This could help reverse climate change, clean the air, and give back their homes to many endangered animals. We grow genetically modified soy and corn on %23 of the land we use for animal agriculture, 93% of which are genetically modified in some way. While we do that, we cause such damage to the land. The production on all this land is non-stop, which gives no time for the soil to recover. We are using pesticides and herbicides on these crops which then contaminates the soil as well. All the minerals in the soil are lost, all bacteria and life under the soil die. There is another world under the soil, which is so necessary for the health of the plant. This is an issue that permaculture addresses and tries to resolve. I have seen first-hand that respecting the life under and around the plant is beneficial to the plant, and the environment. The resulting plant is much better, good looking, and healthier to consume. People care even less about the food that their food eats, so how corn and soy are not good at all, we wouldn’t eat it for sure. Soil is being depleted irreversibly, which means that in any kind of natural disaster, drought, or flood, humans will face a worse situation. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7NEqjJZzwY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7NEqjJZzwY)\n\n(Drone video showing massive feedlots)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cY39MaFulpP-p5F5CkHJo.png?height=4377&width=6251)\n\n***Water Usage***\n\nThe water that goes into animal agriculture is beyond comprehension. It is ***so much***. For example, 1 pound of beef uses 2,500 gallons of water. Think how much time you need to drink that much water. Eating 1 pound less beef saves as much as not showering for 6 months. One burger is equal in water usage to around 2 months of showering. About 70% of the world’s water usage is used for animal agriculture. 55% of fresh water in the US is used for animal agriculture (to compare, private homes account for 5%) This is shocking considering there is so much talk about when our clean water will end and thinking about so many people around the world have no access to clean water. How can we use this much water when people are actually dying from dehydration.\n\n***Habitat Destruction and Species Extinction***\n\nThis is mostly a result of land usage. I was shocked to learn **91% of the Amazon rainforest we destroyed** is because of animal agriculture, which accounts for a large portion of Brazil’s economy. Rainforests are essential to our **survival**; they are our world’s lungs. They breathe in CO2 and exhale O2. **Every second, an acre** (size of a football field) **of the rainforest is cleared**. Animals living on that land lose their homes, and their possibility of existing. Many animals who have been in that environment for millions of years are evolutionarily adapt solely to that environment, which then makes them extremely vulnerable even if they can find somewhere else to live. The is the largest mass extinction in 65 million years, and it’s human caused. Another cause of species extinction is overgrazing, which happens when plants are exposed to grazing for an extended period of time without having the chance to recover.\n\nThis is not only on land either. We took **28 billion animals from oceans last year**, so we are definitely overfishing. The main problem is due to the enormous demand, we’re using massive fishnets, and **for every targeted 1 pound of fish, up to 5 pounds of untargeted species**, like dolphins, whales, turtles, and sharks are caught as **bycatch**. Sea Shepard Conservation Society says there is no such thing as sustainable fishing. Their motto is, “If oceans die, we die.” We will see fishless oceans by 2048 if we don’t do something about it.\n\n![Amazon Rainforest](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IWYnEbuaUYJvHAy2iX4gv.png?height=653&width=1200)\n\n***Ocean Dead-Zones***\n\nWhen water approaches two parts per million or less of oxygen — considered low-oxygen conditions. Eutrophication happens when excess nutrients enter a water body. Extra nitrogen and phosphorous encourage algae growth, which first results in algal blooms. As the algae die, bacteria start to decompose the algae. Much of the **dissolved oxygen in the water gets used up** in this process, causing drops in oxygen. Few or little life in our oceans can survive such circumstances as marine life need oxygen to survive. *How it’s caused by animal agriculture?* We cause excessive nutrient pollution. We have billions of animals, and they produce incredible amounts of **waste**. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that roughly **335 million tons of manure** are produced by livestock in the United States each year. We don’t have good waste management systems, so for producers, it’s easy just to flush that waste into water. That accounts for 335 million tons of extra nutrients. The second part of the story is about half of the fertilizers in the corn and soybean animals eat end up in the oceans as well. There are at least 500 identified dead zones in the world, completely devoid of line. Dead zones have been **doubling** each decade since the 1960s when our current agricultural practices began. As Lucia von Reusner said, “These dead zones will continue to expand unless the major meat companies that dominate our global agricultural system start cleaning up their supply chains to keep pollution out of our waters.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sJ6SZR18P6dUoJAIJYNjV.png?height=756&width=1284)\n\n![Image of an ocean-dead zone](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/irNXO1QUzOrBGNlajLPVv.png?height=1348&width=1982)\n\n***Waste***\n\nWe just mentioned one effect of the huge amounts of waste. All the waste produces incredible **air and water pollution**. Their urine and manure emit around 400 different harmful gases into the atmosphere, and because of the huge numbers and close proximity of animals, the concentration of gasses increase and is awfully dangerous. In the giant lagoons of waste, waste breaks down and produces ammonia gas, which breeds bacteria and forms **nitric acid**. It builds up in the atmosphere and returns as **acid rain**, which harms soil, forests, and waters. One example of water contamination is from the hog farms in North Carolina. There are as many pigs as there are people, but pigs produce ten times more waste than humans. There is almost no waste treatment; pigs are forced to live in their waste in the farms, then it’s pumped into giant waste pits which goes into the rivers. Like this is not enough, factories then use this water without filtering onto fields, further polluting the environment and health of everyone around. The pollution from waste in the rivers kills marine life, as it is in Burnt River. Hog farms are around neighborhoods of low-income families, where mostly African American families live. When we look at the area where the farms in North Carolina are, everybody has a disease, either cancer or asthma. They don’t have the chance to move to somewhere with cleaner air. Animal agriculture creates this pollution that increases diseases, which then helps the BigPharma, as they can now sell more drugs to ‘treat’ these diseases. Animal agriculture’s relation to racism and social class is a huge topic that I won’t be covering in this article, but is extremely important.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7qlnzUHcVE4YhWAe4RDKq.png?height=554&width=1058)\n\nRight now, **our world is suffering**, and we are the ones making it suffer. There are dangerous levels of air pollution, CO2 levels, storms, melting ice caps, wildfires in Amazon, California, Australia as we keep cutting trees. The acidification of oceans is on its way to be 150% higher than normal, resulting in a pH level oceans haven’t seen in *20 million years*. Countries will go underwater, millions of people will have to relocate, we will lose some of our history and culture. Nature is the ultimate giver; it gives us food, water, everything we could ever need, and asks nothing in return but compassion. We will die if we don’t take care of nature. We must realize the effects of our actions; it’s our responsibility to learn. Ignorance shouldn’t be bliss. We are currently living in **Holocene extinction**, sixth mass extinction in the history of Earth, which is now caused by human activity. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates. We are global superpredators, killing anything we deem unimportant for our aims. We first caused the extinction of megafauna and now have even more power to cause loss of biodiversity through our industrialized activities, overfishing, climate change, and of course, meat consumption. We are all in this together. This, of course, affects some people more than others, but eventually, it will affect us all. We can’t live without our environment; we can’t survive without mother nature. We must ask ourselves what kind of world we want to live in? A world of rainforests, animal diversity, clean air, co-existing with animals, with normal climate events, or a world where we have to fight for clean water, food, while causing mass extinction of animals and live in drought.\n\nMost environmental organizations aren’t doing anything that will reverse what is done as they are also taking money from meat and dairy companies. They need funding, so they take the money, and as they already have many oppositions, they don’t want to be branded as anti-meat even though that is what the world needs. That would piss off a whole new group of powerful individuals, so we must take it in our own hands. We can’t expect somebody else to save us. I believe we must take action rather than just do the talking. \n\n**Argument 4: What we eat matters, because it’s ruining our health** \n\n> *“Let food be thy medicine” — Hippocrates*\n\nWe have a huge misunderstanding of what we really need to eat because the producers control nutrition guidelines. We are not receiving diet advice from scientists who do the correct research. In this part, I will talk about the effects of consuming meat and dairy on our health. \n\n***Antibiotic Resistance*** \n\nBecause of the excessive antibiotic use in animal agriculture, bacteria are evolving to become antibiotic resistant. Before antibiotics, millions of people died of infections that we can now easily resolve. We now treat antibiotics as a commodity, but it was a revolution in medicine. Millions of lives were saved with the invention of antibiotics, but now when people are infected with an antibiotic resistant bacterium, this **life-saving drug won’t have any effect**. When a bacterium gains resistance to its corresponding antibiotic, we fight it with a more potent antibiotic. For example, one last resort strong antibiotic called Colistin was rarely used to avoid creating even stronger bacteria that can fight it. In 2015 in China, resistance against Colistin was discovered. Resistance to Colistin could mean the deaths of a lot of people. How did this happen? Millions of animals in Chinese pig farms were given Colistin for a long time, and their bacteria gained resistance, which then was spread to us. Through extensive use of antibiotics in animals, we now created more bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. In the US, 80% of all antibiotics are fed to livestock to keep them from dying early because of all the diseases they develop. The antibiotic they consume create irreversible changes in their body, and it causes the adaptation of bacteria that affect both them and humans to become antibiotic resistant. This is a major problem and a health risk, as we also don’t know how fast bacteria develop resistance towards common antibiotics. Many people die from this problem each year already. \n\n***Pandemics*** \n\nThere is a natural order of things. Viruses existed far longer than humans, animals, or even single cell organisms. When the natural order of things is disrupted, problems start to happen. We, humans, disrupted this way of things by manipulating environment so much, that we find ourselves in surreal situations. We’re not changing humans, but it’s naïve to think while changing how animals live, we’re not disrupting anything. We have destroyed natural habitat of many animals, as discussed under habitat destruction. Viruses are host specific, they have existed in the animal they chose for thousands of years. Viruses don’t randomly affect any living being. They act to live as well, they need the host to survive so that the virus can survive. Their aim is not to kill their host. Herpes is a virus that we live with, and it manifests when we’re under stress. All other animals have different type of viruses that they carry. When we change the environment animal lives in, the virus on it is subject to evolve. When a virus evolves, it can change its host preferences. When we put a snake near a dog next to a bat, alive, or recently dead, the viruses these animals carry can evolve, because these animals are not meant to be in this close proximity in nature. Disrupting this ecosystem comes with a cost, one that we’re all seeing right now. When the virus evolves, it has the possibility to choose human as a host, and because human isn’t the organism that virus evolved to live with, then it causes disease, and death. Perhaps, this will be our undoing. When we disrupt the ecosystem, treat animals like stuff, be disrespectful to their way of life, the result is unnatural situations, such as the coronavirus pandemic right now. At some point in the future, most probably, the virus will evolve to live with humans without killing, but until that point, so many lives will be lost. I can’t stop to think that this massive change in lifestyle, disruption of the economy, lives that are lost are because we put an animal next to other animals that weren’t supposed to be together and ate that animal that we weren’t supposed to eat. Mad cow, Avian flu, Coronavirus, and so many more. I ask, is it worth it?\n\n***Inflammation*** \n\nAlmost all chronic diseases start with inflammation in the body. Everything that causes inflammation in the body has the potential to trigger a disease. As a lifestyle, it’s something that must be averted. Air pollution, cigarette smoke, alcohol, and stress are some examples that can result in inflammation. The one we’re focusing on here is the inflammation caused by meat products. The toxins in the fat in the animals are inflammatory. All animals, us included, by nature, create toxins when they engage in metabolic activity and produce energy. This is the cycle of life; we create toxins as waste when we produce energy. It is how mitochondria work, and this is why we die. If we didn’t create toxins, we would reverse aging. Plants are the purest form of nutrients we can take, and their rate of toxin production is much lower. Animals produce toxins, and when we eat them, we take in the toxins they create as well. Whatever grass-fed beef we buy, this is the case. Now, it gets worse as the meat we buy isn’t up to the standards. First, the herbicides and pesticides used in the corn fed to the cow are toxins. Second, because of the horrible treatment of animals, the stress animal goes through creates even more toxins. (just like we do) All these toxins we consume cause inflammation in our bowels, and by eating constantly, bowels can’t handle it, and it spreads to the whole body. First, it’s low levels of inflammation, but when the cause is left unattended, as we usually do, inflammation finds a weak spot and then becomes a chronic disease. Chronic diseases are not like traumas (breaking a leg); they develop over time, and they can’t be resolved immediately. For example, a type of chronic disease, type 2 diabetes, can take years to develop, and it can take years to treat. It results from the damage of inflammation on the cell walls, which become resistant to insulin. Once the cell walls are resistant to insulin, they cannot uptake the glucose in the blood, and this creates a foundation for a set of metabolic problems. Decreasing inflammation in the body is one of the most promising changes diabetic patients can do. \n\n***Cancer*** \n\nCancer, one of the diseases that cause the **most deaths** every year, has been associated with meat consumption in literature. Studies are showing two reasons why meat consumption may be related to cancer. First, the **growth hormone** used in cattle production is causing human cells to proliferate without control. Second, the **toxins** that accumulate inside the animal tissue have the potential to mess up with the DNA of human cells, which can give rise to tumors. One of the worst things we can eat is processed meat. Any meat that is cured, salted, smoked, fermented, dried, or canned is processed. Bacon, ham, sausages, burgers, salami, nugget, ground beef are all examples of processed meat. Rule of thumb should be not to eat any processed meat. World Health Organization classifies processed meat as group 1 carcinogen. Some group 1 carcinogens include arsenic, benzene, radiation, and smoking. Red meat is classified as group 2, so it’s not good either, but processed is much worse. \n\nChronic diseases must be taken seriously. Top 5–10 deathly diseases include mostly chronic diseases, which include auto-immune diseases, allergies, Alzheimer’s, stroke, diabetes, etc. 1/3 of Americans have diabetes. We must care about this, also because chronic diseases are one of the biggest expenses as the patients are bound to take multiple drugs for the rest of their lives, and it’s where BigPharma makes its most money. As it’s said, if you don’t invest in your food first, you will pay that later to drugs.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SZ5JKs9FD56Efj_n9OZuE.png?height=474&width=750)\n\nIn medical journals and newspapers, the benefits of these drugs are always talked about, because most studies are conducted and sponsored by either BigMeat or BigPharma, who get the most benefit from these problems. Pharmaceutical companies sponsor many different scientists to conduct research to establish the credibility of their drug. On the other hand, the studies that aim to show you can resolve these issues through nutrition don’t receive any funding; thus, people don’t know much about it and don’t understand its importance. People commonly believe that drugs can solve the problem, and that diet has no place in the cause of the disease nor in treatment. This is a huge problem in the medical world. The lack of thorough studies causes the situation now, where we don’t know what is correct and what is wrong. One effect of this issue is that the more drugs we put into our bodies, the more we disrupt the natural system the body has. Each drug adds something artificial to our body. All drugs are only aimed to get rid of the symptom, and as we get rid of the symptom, the root cause remains, but we are only left oblivious to the problems our body is trying to tell us. No drug is designed to either treat the cause or to prevent the disease from happening. For example, cholesterol drug aims to lower the cholesterol, not to understand why it’s elevated in the first place. Think of this; when we’re healthy, we are not aware of our inner organs. We can’t feel our stomach or our kidneys because it’s evolutionarily not necessary. We’re always aware of our mental states (introspection), but it’s only when there is a problem that we can sense the inner state of our body. (interoception) When our body is telling us something, we must listen and try to find the cause, not shut it down by relieving symptoms. Each drug creates other problems and symptoms as it relieves one, and therefore people are left with so many drugs that they have to take for the rest of their lives. What is not commonly known, but I completely believe in, is that given the right nutrition and time, the body has the capacity to heal itself in most conditions.\n\n> *“The doctor of the future will give no medicine but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame, in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease.”  \n -Thomas Edison* \n\nThe reason why alternative medicines such as Ayurveda, Homeopathy, and functional medicine became so popular in recent times is not because it’s proven scientifically. It’s because people realized that we are continually taking drugs, but things are not getting any better, so we try to find some other way to heal and turn to alternative options. It was through experience that people realize drugs are not doing anything good to do body, and if anything, doing something bad. Chronic disease numbers are increasing worldwide. Alternative ways are gaining popularity because the options we have are not helping. We don’t know how good or bad the alternative options are as there are not enough studies to prove their effectiveness. There is a lack of information because, unfortunately, the main point isn’t health, but it is money, so we are left to try and find what works through trial and error. Health is so important, but yet we are so bad at it. We must leave our preconceptions, personal gains, and actually work to find the truths by treating each option equally. We must listen to our bodies and get to the root cause of the problems. Our aim shouldn’t be to get rid of the symptoms but to understand and resolve so that body can function normally again. \n\n…\n\nI have made my main four arguments about why we should stop consuming meat and dairy. I talked about animals having a moral status, what happens to the animals we eat, animal cruelty; the meat and dairy industry’s power in politics and organizations, its relations to BigPharma; in what aspects BigMeat contributes to climate change, how the world is right now; the health problems consuming meat causes, talking about antibiotic resistance, inflammation, and cancer. \n\nNow, I turn to specific subjects and talk briefly about each to have an even more wholesome view on the subject. The more we know, the better we can make decisions, right? \n\n…\n\n***Milk, Cheese, and Eggs*** \n\n*Milk* \n\nMilk is one of the biggest hoaxes of all time. Many studies have proven that it is risky to drink milk, and contrary to common belief, it doesn’t protect bones. But actually, people who drink milk have higher hip fractions, eczema, constipation, acid reflux, iron deficiency, anemia, and live shorter lives. It causes many types of cancers, especially those linked to hormones: breast, prostate, ovarian cancers. Milk increases a man’s chance of getting prostate cancer by 34%, and for women who had breast cancer, one glass of milk per day increases their chance of dying from the disease by 49% and dying from anything by 64%. Aside from that, most people in the world are lactose-intolerant (73% of African Americans, 95% of Asians, 53% of Hispanic Americans), because why would our body create this enzyme to digest lactose if we don’t need it. This fact alone shows that we are not supposed to drink it. \n\nThink about it, the purpose of cow’s milk is to turn a 65-pound calf into a 400-pound cow as fast as possible. Cow’s milk is, as Dr. Michael Klaper calls it, baby calf growth fluid, and it is the lactation secretions of a large mammal who just had a baby. Everything in it, hormones, lipids, proteins, sodium, insulin-like growth factors are for that calf to grow; it doesn’t exist for humans to consume. Whether it’s in the form of yogurt, cheese, or ice cream, it’s still milk. Maybe you could be thinking, milk is the first thing we drink, so shouldn’t it be fine? But it’s the milk from one’s mother, created for that child. Human milk, which is the perfect food for the infant, designed and perfected for millions of years through evolution, is very different than milk from other animals. \n\nLooking from the environmental perspective, it is not sustainable at all. One gallon of milk requires 1000 gallons of water to produce. The industry is so focused on making money that Ryan Shapiro and Jeffrey Light exposed e-mails from people high in the hierarchy in the American Egg Board that AEB considers the alternative egg company Just as “a crisis and a major threat” and wrote suggesting murdering the CEO of Just, Josh Tetrick, writing “Can we pool our money and put a hit on him?” How and why would AEB be this scared from a start-up providing an alternative option? \n\nI also believe it is the easiest thing to make the change, as there are so many possible options that it’s impossible not to like one of them. I am in love with oat milk, it goes amazing with coffee, and also prefer soy milk if oat isn’t available. Some other options are cashew, coconut, soy, almond, rice, hazelnut, and macadamia milk. \n\n*Cheese* \n\nCheese contains everything bad about milk, is also highly processed, naturally has a lot of saturated fat, and we add a lot of salt into it. There is a strong link between dairy products and autoimmune diseases such as asthma, multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes, and rheumatologic problems. Dr. Neal Barnard explains a disturbing finding about why we seem to love cheese a lot. Scientists found that the casein protein that is the main protein in the dairy products (especially cheese) breaks apart to create casomorphins. They are casein-derived, morphine-like compounds that go to the brain and attach to the receptors that heroin attaches to. This explains our love and addiction to cheese, and casomorphins may play a role in sudden infant death syndrome and autism, which is why giving an infant cow’s milk is a terrible thing to do. Human breast milk has 2.7 grams of casein per liter, while cow’s milk has 26 grams. \n\n*Eggs* \n\nEggs contain saturated fat and cholesterol (about 200mg in one egg), which are linked to cancer and diabetes. About 60% of the calories in eggs are from fat, most of which is saturated. One study found that people who regularly eat eggs have a 19% higher risk for cardiovascular problems; another found that people who eat eggs regularly have high coronary artery calcium scores, which is a measure of heart disease risk. The high fat in the egg can contribute to insulin resistance. People who consume most eggs have a %68 higher chance for diabetes. Dr. Michael Greger uncovered documents where USDA admitted that eggs could not legally be called ‘nutritious,’ ‘low fat,’ ‘part of a balanced diet,’ ‘low calorie,’ ‘healthful,’ ‘healthy,’ ‘good for you,’ or even ‘safe.’ I liked eggs and thought they were essential. My mom would push me to eat eggs as I didn’t like it when I was little. Now, I was putting two, three eggs in my omelets so that I could get protein and everything else good in it, right? Well, it turns out I was wrong, and I’m usually pleased to be wrong in life so that I can make the right choice. It’s sad that eggs are bad for us, but it is what it is, and at the end of the day, living a healthy and quality life is more important than having eggs benedict.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FNpGaHukNfj0VPbzAg1wi.png?height=708&width=1160)\n\n***Are we omnivores?***\n\nLet’s compare the anatomy of true omnivores (who eat both plants and animals, like bears and raccoons) to frugivores. (who eat almost exclusively plants, like chimps and other primates) Frugivores’ teeth are flat molars for chewing plants, while omnivores have long and sharp teeth for stabbing tearing flesh. Frugivore jaws can move forward and back and side to side. Omnivores’ can only up and down. Frugivores have much less acidic stomach acid than omnivores. Frugivores have intestines 9 times the body length, while omnivores’ are only three times their body length. We fit every requirement to be a frugivore. Human’s closest relatives are chimps, who take 97% of their calorie intake from plants and rest from eating insects. The idea of having to eat meat to be strong is not true in nature. The largest, strongest animals are herbivores: elephants, bison, rhinos, giraffes. Biology can’t lie, and this seems like a pretty good argument to me that we are frugivores.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YTGOViStOAm6qfuenygp1.jpg?height=571&width=750)\n\n***Sustainability***\n\nWe have talked about many problems the meat and dairy industry causes to the environment, and how much resources it uses. There are people supporting sustainable animal agriculture, but thinking about the demand and the growing population, I don’t believe it’s possible, nor necessary. To reiterate, 1 kg of beef requires 150 square meters of land, and 15,000 liters of water, and generates 27 kg of CO2, which equals to driving your car more than 100 miles. **In the same land, we can grow either 37,000 pounds of veggies or 375 pounds of meat.** We can produce **15 times more protein from plant-based sources than** **meat** on any given area of land. All the proteins that we eat are already coming from plants as well because only plants have the ability to take nitrogen from the air, break those molecules apart, and incorporate that into amino acids and make protein. When we eat animals, it’s just recycled protein. This means we can get all the protein we need from plants. When these are the numbers we have, while also considering all the other reasons I wrote about, it doesn’t make sense. Around 216,000 more people are born every single day, and in a typical American diet, that would mean we need 34,000 acres of new farmland to feed those people every single day. It doesn’t make any sense to use most of our farmland to produce food for the animals so that we can eat those animals when we could produce food that we can directly eat, especially when you consider so many children are starving around the world. Right now, there are 843 million undernourished people in the world. (and more than 1.7 billion overweight people) We don’t have a lack of food; we’re just feeding it to the animals. Of course, there is a lot more that can be said about sustainability, but I believe this whole essay has the undertone of sustainability and, therefore, doesn’t need any more explanation here. Sustainability is very important to me, because I used to be so focused on efficiency, and thought that was the most important thing, until I met the concept of sustainability and understood what it is, not only in environmental issues, but in many aspects of life, and especially technology.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G-kQ9m-pGXyTDAnO6uBLX.jpg?height=494&width=800)\n\n***New tech opens the door for endless possibilities***\n\nAll said and done, it’s normal to still have in mind that we might still want a burger or enjoy an eggs benedict. I certainly do. We have traditions and cultures around food, as it is something very important that brings us together. Animal products are very much in our lives, and it’s also not easy to live without some types of food. Luckily, we are developing new technologies every day, and there are smart and caring people working on this. Let’s talk about plant protein. We have developed ways to turn plant so that it brings the same taste, texture, and protein of meat. \n\n**Beyond Meat:** This company makes products similar to chicken, beef, and pork sausage. They say it’s a ‘perfect substitute for meat.’ It has a very similar nutritional profile of beef from animals, has similar texture and taste. You can find their products in restaurants all around the US. I had many Beyond Burgers before, and it tasted almost identical to beef. If you ask me, it tastes way better. They said, “Why do you need an animal to create meat? Why can’t you build meat directly from plants? It turns out you can. So we did.” They are in Target, TGIFridays, Whole Foods, Bareburger, and many more places. \n\n**Impossible Food:** Honestly, eating Impossible Burger, I couldn’t tell any difference from a burger made from an animal. The typical veggie burger doesn’t fully look like beef, but Impossible’s cooks and tastes like a beef patty. They used neuroscience to understand what makes beef so good, and worked to get the same sensory experience, so neither brain nor the person can tell the difference. Their burger is even red and bloody as they found out what makes animal beef red and aromatic is heme, and that you can extract the same thing from soy plants. Impossible is both in groceries and in restaurants. \n\n**Just:** They decided to go after eggs, as 1.1 trillion eggs are laid worldwide each year. 99% of our eggs come from battery cage facilities. They realized the problematic system going on of thousands of chickens in little cages left for a life of hell and wanted to revolutionize the system completely. They are now producing a plant-based scramble, that scrambles and tastes like eggs. What is also good about these startups is their mission is not the make the most money regardless of what is in the food, but actually create something that has value, and won’t harm people, animals, or the environment. Companies like these show that we don’t have to give up the pleasure we take from eating meat and eggs, but we can choose to do it differently. We have the technology; we just need to put the effort in it. I really hope that more and more companies start to focus on plant-based substitutes, and this would motivate people who are unsure to make the change in their diets. I love eggs, and I am very happy that I get to chance to have scrambled eggs or cook waffles or crepes as I wish.\n\n![Impossible Burger!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l0HNZqWXot8hun_G0lRjk.jpg?height=410&width=756)\n\n**Cultured Meat:** It’s important to note that there is a whole different option that we might have in the stores soon. It is meat produced by in vitro cell culture of animal cells, instead of from slaughtered animals. It’s a form of cellular agriculture and uses the same tissue engineering techniques we use for regenerative medicine. It’s not available yet, as it’s expensive and still in progress to make it better, but people are working on it, and it has been done and tested before. Mosa Meat, Memphis Meats, SuperMeat are several companies working on it. What I’m concerned here is that we most likely will have a negative public opinion on it, probably deemed as ‘unnatural,’ as the industry will place the seeds of doubt. I, personally, would eat it. Still, supporters are numerous, as the funding of €250,000 for one research came from the co-founder of Google, Sergey Brin.\n\n> *“We shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium.”  \n -Winston Churchill*\n\n***Ethical Responsibility***\n\n“… compare the respective feelings of two animals, one of which is engaged in eating the other,” said Schopenhauer. Which one has more intense feelings about it? He says the intensity of pain always outweighs the pleasure, so we must **avoid inflicting great pain to gain a lesser pleasure.** Think of the joy you get from eating meat in your dinner, how long does it last? Is it even something special anymore, as it was 50 years ago? Is it anywhere near the pain inflicted upon that animal? We are responsible for the mess we created. Not one of us individually is responsible, but that doesn’t mean we’re off the hook. If there are billions of living, feeling, sensing animals who are in pain, all the time, at any given time, we have the responsibility to do something about it. \n\nThis whole essay started with me wanting to give ethical arguments to stop eating meat. While researching to be thorough, I was shocked to find the grandiosity of these issues. What is going on behind the curtains is true, and gives rise to pressing issues. We can’t turn away from it. Ignorance isn’t bliss, because in this case, ignorance is killing us, animals, and the environment. \n\n*317 animals are killed every second in the US.* \n\nI honestly believe that from the point of view of the universe, we are not more important than any other living being. Perhaps even less so, as we are consuming, killing, and polluting, while trees are supporting life, and other animals live in accordance with each other. All animals derive from a common ancestor. We must acknowledge that all living beings have the desire to live, and they feel pain, joy, grief, and pleasure. They all can feel pain; they all can suffer. Try to put yourself in the shoes of a pig on the factory farm. Just close your eyes and think of the life story of that pig. We must stop deliberately inflicting suffering on all other living beings for our selfish gains and desires. Are my taste buds more important than their lives? \n\n*“Do to others as you would have them do to you”* \n\nIf you can’t kill an animal with your hands and take it apart, why should anybody do that for you? When you have beef in front of you to eat, if you don’t like thinking that it was a living being on your plate, you shouldn’t eat it. We must acknowledge meat for what it is, that it was a living being that lived a horrible life and is killed so that you can eat. It’s a cow, not steak; it’s chicken, not wings; it’s a pig, not bacon. The meat industry decontextualizes meat from the animal itself and the process, so you don’t overthink it and can buy with ease. But we must bring back to our minds that under all this mechanization, industrialization, branding, marketing, and the illusion, there are animals suffering incredibly. \n\nWhy do we eat cows, pigs, chickens, and turkeys when dogs and cats are our friends? The animals we eat are not so different from dogs, as they also love to play, learn, have self-awareness, and can communicate. They are fully aware of the horrible conditions, and they know what will happen when they enter a slaughterhouse. There is no nice or humane way to kill a being that doesn’t want to die. As Philip Wollen said, “I discovered that when we suffer, we suffer as equals. In their capacity to suffer, a dog is a pig, is a bear, is a boy.” \n\nBecause of the suffering, the environmental impact, the games played by the industry, and also other lives impacted, the diseases and the money spent on it, I argue that it’s our ethical duty to STOP EATING MEAT. Eat less, at least. \n\n> *“I think we come to view eating meat in the way we now look back on the Roman games. Having crowds of enthusiastic people cheering on the lions as they slaughtered the Christians or gladiators fighting each other to the death.”  \n -Peter Singer* \n\n***Spirituality*** \n\nEvery year, 56 billion land and 90 billion marine animals are killed for food. We didn’t consciously choose to eat meat; it was mostly given from culture, habits, and family; it was normal. But we are smart beings, and we can learn to make better choices in our lives. I have come to realize that **selflessness, kindness, compassion, love, considerations of other living beings** are what make us human. It’s not money that is at the core of being human. We all have the capacity to foster compassion and kindness. When I was in Thailand at the Mindfulness Project, I experienced first-hand that we can enlarge our love and compassion to people we don’t know, people across the globe, but also to all animals. I could feel instant warmness to and from these people I didn’t know; when we **listen, care, understand**, and actively engage in being **non-judgmental**, the world becomes a different place. Even though I wanted to stop eating meat for a while, I went vegetarian for the first time there, and I was more mindful of my eating. Also, our food was so good that it made me realize it’s completely possible! I believed that we are all living beings existing in the same planet, and nothing makes us better than other animals, but now it was time to practice it. Practice what you preach, they say, and that is right.\n\nOur minds guide us, and its goal is to make us survive. So, our brains create this boundary between what is my in-group and out-group. We have the tendency to want the best for ourselves and those around us, but we fail to enlarge that compassion to people different from us. We attribute good meanings to the actions of people we like, and negative to those of the people we don’t like. But realizing that we are all just living beings who are capable of suffering, there is no reason to draw a line. You could just look, listen, and love because that living being has a completely different subjective experience, but nothing makes theirs less valuable than yours. \n\nI don’t want to deviate too much, but I believe it’s so important to see ourselves more than just the body and the everyday experiences. We have a soul, we have consciousness, which I believe is beyond the everyday life, and perhaps something non-physical. We all have subjective experiences that start with our sensory information, which then gives the tools to our brain to create a model of the world in the mind. Understanding difference in **subjective experience** is critical to being non-judgmental and being open-minded towards other opinions and possible truths. No one point of view is correct, or better than any other. From the point of view of the universe, a human is no different than a cow. *Why would my point of view, my wants and needs be more important, or valuable than that of the cow?* \n\nWe’re interconnected with other living beings, in many layered levels. I argue in another paper that we’re connected in an atomic, cultural, and biological level.\\[4\\] We can’t exist in total isolation and be who we are. There is no language with one person. There is no O2 without trees. There is no life without bees. We can see all other human beings, and all other animals as part of us, because we exist together, exchange atoms with each step, with each meal, with each breath. The idea of an independent self is simply not accurate. \n\n> *“The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.”  \n ― Nikola Tesla*\n\nIt also inherently makes sense not to cause damage to other living beings, as we are all interconnected. We are part of something bigger than ourselves; we share this planet, this energy. What happens to the environment affects us all; what happens to other people affects us all. Diseases affect us all, as we have seen with the pandemic. \n\nWe usually don’t think about what we can’t see. We avoid the emotional pain of empathizing with the animal, even though we know they are being killed. We are sort of lying to ourselves, denying the truth. When I asked my family to watch a documentary talking about animal agriculture, my mom’s response was, “I’m not eating a lot anyway, I don’t want to learn and make the experience of eating meat worse.” This denial causes a struggle inside that we are not consciously aware of. \n\nWhen we’re doing things that hurt other living beings, we are wrong. \n\nAdopting a vegan diet will make you compassionate towards animals, but also towards other human beings. It makes you more conscious of your eating habits, which can carry on for the day and makes you more mindful throughout your day. There is a lightness coming from knowing you are not causing more suffering into the world, not causing more harm to the environment. \n\nWe don’t see the face in the food. \n\nI’d like to share two things we said in the Mindfulness Project. Perhaps it will resonate with you. \n\nFirst is a practice of loving-kindness meditation. It’s meant to enlarge our love to everybody, and saying it repetitively makes you feel so good, that I understood and embraced in me that what makes people happy is giving, not taking. \n\n*“May all living beings be full of love and kindness. May all living beings be healthy and free of physical pain. May all living beings be calm, relaxed, and without fear. May all living beings be happy, content, and really free.”* \n\nSecond is sort of like a prayer or dedication before meals. It serves as a reminder that nature provides everything we need, and we have responsibility to give back. \n\n*“Thank you mother nature for providing this food. I eat this beautiful meal not for joy or pleasure, not for beautification or purification, but only to maintain my physical body to serve animals, environment, and people who need our help so badly right now.”*\n\n![What kind of world do we want to live in?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hbqnmS83ns_YQsTsrrQHu.jpg?height=380&width=520)\n\n***Becoming Vegan, Making the Switch to Plant-Based Diet***\n\nThis paper became very important to me. It wasn’t so long ago that I stopped eating meat in Thailand and decided to continue as a pescatarian that when I got back. I was feeling so sure when I was saying, “Well, fish have less capacity to suffer, and I just love shrimp a lot” When someone asked me why I stopped eating meat, which was considered unusual, as no one I know is neither veggie nor vegan, I gave the three arguments: animals, industry, environment. I didn’t want to add more suffering. While I was giving the same arguments to one of my mom’s friends, I thought to myself, why not write about this? I was feeling very passionate about the subject as equality, environment, sustainability, and ethical lifestyle are important to me. I spent some time doing research, then some time writing. While I was researching, I learned so much more about the cruelty and the health problems that I just knew I had to stop altogether and become a vegan. It just wasn’t worth it. If every time I want a shrimp, I am killing 5 other marine animals as bycatch, it’s not worth it. I also learned alarming health problems, therefore decided to add an argument talking about it. I am not saying by any means that anybody is a bad person for eating animals. I was thinking of myself as caring for animal rights and the environment, and now I see **it’s impossible to call myself either if I’m eating animal products**. I wasn’t a hypocrite; I just didn’t know better. I wish I knew about these before, and that’s why I decided to compile everything I read, watched, and learned under these titles. I am no expert in any of these subjects by any means; I’m just someone who wanted to learn what seems right and share this knowledge. Don’t take my words as any well-established or medical advice, as I didn’t came up with anything I talked about, and I’m not formally educated on any of these topics. I just love to learn about what is important, and feel the need to share what I learned. We covered a lot of subjects, and I thank you if you got all the way here. This was my first serious writing venture that I am doing just for its own sake. I know it was a pretty long essay, but I really think everything I wrote are incredibly important to get the almost-thorough story. \n\nHere is some data on going vegetarian or vegan: \n\n**Per year:** \n\n***Land usage:*** You can use 18 times less land. \n\nAll vegan: 1/6 acre of land \n\nAll vegetarian: ½ acre of land \n\nAverage American: 3 acres of land \n\n***CO2 savings:*** (to compare, solar-powered house saves 1.4 tons, using an electric car saves 2.5) \n\nBy removing beef only: 1.4 tons \n\nAll vegetarian: 1.6 tons \n\nAll vegan: 1.8 tons \n\nEvery single day, by choosing to go vegan, **you can save** \n\n1100 gallons (4164 liters) of water \n\n45 pounds (20 kg) of grain \n\n30 square feet (2.8 square meters) of forest \n\n10 pounds (4.5 kg) of CO2 \n\n1 animal’s life \n\nYou can eat fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains. Making the switch will make you healthier, have more compassionate towards the environment and animal life. Overall, vegetarians have a longer life expectancy, lower rates of heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s. The average male’s risk of death from heart disease is 50% if omnivore, 15% if vegetarian, 4% if vegan. It is the single most important action you can take as an individual to save the planet. You’re not becoming a different person or giving up something that makes you a human. If anything, you’re connecting with yourself, with the planet, and the animals. \n\nLet’s foster **empathy, kindness, and compassion.** \n\nWhen we’re altruistic, when we do things for the greater good and we’re not selfish, it comes around and benefits me too. It feels good, it is coherent with our nature. We’re connected. Hurting an animal, hurts us too. Even if we don’t feel it right away, it hurts us, it hurts the environment little by little. \n\nMake your own mind about what you believe is right for you, but remember that we are all in this together. Your choice matters a lot, and you get the chance to vote red or vote green. You are the customer; you are the demand. With less demand, they will have no choice to lower the supply, which could save lives. \n\nIt’s up to you to make that choice and *make a difference.* \n\n…\n\n\\[1\\] There are some theories of consciousness that to be conscious, and therefore have a moral status, a being must have thinking ability, or self-consciousness. For example, higher-order theory of consciousness claims a thought about the state one is in is necessary for that state to be conscious. I disagree with such theories. \n\n\\[2\\] Why “grass-fed” beef is more expensive \n\n\\[3\\] It’s true that we always genetically modified our environment through selective breeding. How animals and plants are today is very different than how it was several thousand years ago. Problem is, now we have larger number of animals, less regard for their well-being, and high industrialization. \n\n\\[4\\] <https://medium.com/@aleynadogan/identity-is-an-illusion-death-is-trivial-18a5cef50a6c>\n\nNote: Feel free to write to me if you have something you think is important to add, if you have an updated or different data in hand, or if there is a conflict somewhere in my essay.

{"id": "Mqhi5FgnJmJ0iZaVot9_0LhvjAnT9QHH_UteMZoYxQI", "title": "Every Reason to Stop Eating Meat Right Now", "body": "What we eat matters. It matters in so many aspects that creating an outline for this article was a challenge. People always say, “you are what you eat,” but even this is an understatement. This paper is an argument on why it’s our ethical duty to stop consuming meat and dairy products. I present objective and factual arguments and anything I say in this paper can be found online with proper research. I argue that we should have a broad point of view of the history of time and not be prejudiced against other opinions. Our high-tech urban-city lifestyle existed for less than 0.001% of human history. Meat as a commodity existed for even a shorter period. It has been only 50 or so years since we started eating so much meat. We consume twice the amount we did in the 1960s, and for chicken, we’re eating 400% more. This could be possible when we took the animals from their natural environment, and put them indoors, and industrialized and mechanized the animal industry. Our current diet is a modern invention; it’s not how our grandparents got their nutrition. So, the argument that eating this much meat is ‘part of our basic human nature,’ ‘always has been like this’ fails.\n\nNow we must ask, **why is meat so cheap?** *How did it become such a commodity that we can get a burger for $3? What is in our food, and is it good for us? What is happening to the animals we eat? Who determines what is commonly known about food? Why are there so many diseases, and it’s getting worse? What impact does my diet has on animals and the environment? Could all this be related to how the world is right now?* I am covering as many subjects I deemed relevant and important as possible about the meat and dairy industry in this paper, gathering from many sources. Topics are all interrelated, so understanding all gives a more *wholesome* view. I want to say that my intent is not to be judgmental; I believe it’s my ethical duty to convey this information I have learned, that you might not know. I didn’t know any of this until recently, and I would want someone to *tell me* if they knew what is in this paper. My only goal is to increase awareness, that people know the truth, so each can make up their minds.\n\n**Contents:**\n\n*Argument 1: Animal suffering*\n\n*Argument 2: Industry can’t be trusted*\n\n*Argument 3: Earth is suffering*\n\n*Argument 4: Meat is ruining our health*\n\n*Milk, Cheese, Eggs*\n\n*Are we omnivores?*\n\n*Sustainability*\n\n*New tech opens the door for endless possibilities*\n\n*Ethical Responsibility*\n\n*Spirituality*\n\n*Becoming Vegan, Making the Switch to Plant-Based Diet*\n\n> To utilize the benefits of web3, I am embedding 3 NFTs of animal photographs in this article. The proceeds from these NFTs will be sent to a foundation that fights for animal rights.\n\n**Argument 1: What we eat matters, because animals are suffering**\n\n***Do animals have moral status?***\n\nAs Darwin showed, humans are part of the animal group as well. We don’t have much difference from the rest of the animal world; we share %98.8 of our DNA with chimpanzees and bonobos. We have developed bigger brains, which enabled us to do more complex cognitive functions, which lie in the frontal lobes in the brain. The emotional, sentient part of the brain is in what is called the lizard/reptilian brain, which developed much earlier in the history of time. We share this part with most animals. Does sapient and intellectual part is what makes us suffer? No, it’s the sentient part, which makes us feel. When we are determining what being has moral status, the question is whether that being has a consciousness. The suffering of animals is a matter of questioning the animal’s consciousness. In determining consciousness, we usually first look at behaviors. Animals are living organisms that appropriately respond to external stimuli. It can showcase hunger, anger, pleasure, and pain.\\[1\\] Animals can recognize people, and some have incredible memories, spatial navigation. Chickens are especially good at withholding a current reward for a better reward in the future (delayed gratification), which requisites an awareness of time and selfhood. Animals also show behaviors of suffering when they are inflicted pain, so there is no reason to question whether they are conscious, sentient beings who can suffer, therefore, have moral status. Lisbon Treaty (2009) recognized animals as sentient beings.\n\n***What is actually happening to the animals we eat? Where do they come from?***\n\nAlmost all animals we eat comes from feedlots, a factory-like intensive animal farming system. They have an unbelievable intensity of animals existing in a confined place. The whole point is to create the most efficient and cheap system, regardless of how it’s done. Taking animals indoors enabled us to have a massive number of animals in a controlled space. Animals grow much faster so that more meat can be produced, and for this, they are confined in a box-like space with food in front of them 24/7. A cow grows typically in 2 years, but in factories, this span is shortened to 4 months. *How?* Hormones are put into the food animals eat. Hormones in the food are stored in the animal’s tissues, and then is in our bodies when we eat it. What do they eat? Typically in nature, cows eat grass, but in factories, they are given highly genetically modified soy and corn.\\[2\\] Cows never ate corn naturally before we fed them. When they eat this highly GMO food, they start to have metabolic syndromes, just like in humans. Hormones, their food, and their proximity to other alive or dead animals cause diseases. To prevent them from dying before the owners need them to die, animals are given incredible amounts of antibiotics. In the US, 80% of all antibiotics manufactured are used for livestock. We also consume these antibiotics when we eat meat, but more on antibiotic resistance in the argument for health.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYxKgvtojdg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYxKgvtojdg)\n\n(Footage from inside a chicken farm. **Can be disturbing** to some.)\n\n***Treatment of animals in feedlots***\n\nMost animals in this system never see the sun or the sky. They are kept in small cages where they can’t move, turn around, or even lie down. They are kept so to save space, and so they will keep eating all the time. Cows are not allowed to move at all to keep their meat tender. They don’t form muscles, and most are unable to stand or walk anymore. To move them, we use electric shock, as the pain inflicted causes nerves to respond, and it stimulates movement. Chicken are kept in even closer proximity where they can’t form their natural social structure, which makes them aggressive. They end up attacking each other, so we cut their beaks and claws. Turkeys have a similar fate, under such circumstances, and because of all the stress from the horrible treatment and torture, they show abnormal behaviors, even cannibalism. Pigs and other animals are left to live in their waste full of bacteria. They suffer from stress and show cannibalism and tail-biting behavior as they are in a cycle of torture. Pigs are one of the smartest animals on earth, smarter than dogs, and three-year-old humans. Several hundred million male baby chickens are killed immediately after birth as they are not suitable for neither consumption nor laying eggs. Chickens live in a space smaller than a piece of A4 (letter) paper. A factory chicken lives an average of 42 days. They suffer from abnormal bodies because they gain more than 50g every day, and their immune system, organs, and legs can’t keep up. Most animals have disproportionate bodies because of how fast and badly we feed them to increase productivity. In 1972, one cow averaged **9,863** pounds of milk per year; today, it’s **21,697** pounds. It’s quite smart on our end to forcefully increase their milk production and then claim that we need to take their milk, *for them*. We are playing with their genetics, disrupting their natural selection, and evolution.\\[3\\] After their life in the hell-on-earth we created, they are then taken to the slaughterhouse. More than 1 million pigs die in route to slaughterhouse each year, and those who are alive are in close proximation to the dead, which is both traumatizing and terrible for the health of the animals. (which becomes an issue of our health, but more on that later) No laws regulate the duration of the transport, frequency of rest, or provision of food and water. A typical slaughterhouse kills around 1,000 pigs per hour. They are slaughtered while they are fully conscious, crippling with fear. This huge number makes it impossible for their death to be painless or humane. They’re conscious when we put them in hot water of defeathering tanks, or while they’re skinned or hacked apart. This constant fear and torment are widespread. Why no one does anything about it? For such a long time, we didn’t even have this information. Because of the increasing number of diseases, people started asking questions about nutrition, and only then we started looking. Now, the industry pushed **ag-gag laws** to **prevent** activists from entering their property and film what is actually going on inside. This law is clearly intended to censor animal rights abuses. Activist whistleblowers, who are just showing where the food we eat comes from, are regarded the same way as terrorists under this law. (“Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act”) We should ask why they would need this law. We’ll talk about why we’re not attending to these issues in the next section when we discuss the meat industry.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtrvOiuK6w8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtrvOiuK6w8)\n\n(Footage showing dairy cow abuse. **Can be disturbing** to some.)\n\n[https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/56726441181679876690402897331371077105052994973272125722574401088069757304833](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/56726441181679876690402897331371077105052994973272125722574401088069757304833)\n\n**Argument 2: What we eat matters, because we can’t trust the Meat and Dairy Industry**\n\n\\*\\*\\*How big is the BigMeat?\n\\*\\*\\*The value of the global meat industry was $945.7 billion in 2018, and it’s expected to increase to $1142.9 billion by 2023. It’s so powerful that the industry’s decisions have huge impact on our health, the environment, and the fates of so many living beings. Robert Martin summarized the meat industry in a documentary as having all the money of BigTobacco and BigPharma and the personality of the National Rifle Association. Because of its size and value, the meat industry has a significant place in countries’ economies. US government spends **$38 billion** each year to subsidize the meat and dairy industries, but only **$17 million (0.04%)** to subsidize fruit and vegetables. In return, NAMI estimates that the meat industry contributes $894 billion to the US economy. Therefore, the industry is tied up in politics, and there comes its political power.\n\n***How powerful is the BigMeat?***\n\n*Politics*\n\nThe meat industry contributed over $1.7M during the 2014 campaign cycle to deferral candidates. (83% Republicans) The industry spent another $6.9M directly on lobbying the federal government. Power in lobbying enables the industry to create laws and push legislation that doesn’t benefit the people, but laws that will bring in more money. For example, in addition to the ag-gag law mentioned above, the Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act, or better known as **‘cheeseburger bill,’** states that ‘food-producing or retailing corporations cannot be legally held responsible for obesity, heart disease, or other health-related issues caused by consumption of their food.’ It was introduced by Republican Congressman Rick Keller, who received the maximum amount of donations possible from companies including McDonald’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s. Bill passed in the House and is sought solely to protect the producer.\n\nThe influence of food lobbyists also has power over **federal nutritional guidelines**, which advise more meat consumption than what scientists advise. Every 5 years, the Department of Agriculture gives an updated dietary guideline. People who make up this committee receive money from companies such as McDonald’s, Dannon, Coca Cola, Mars, American Meat Institute, American Egg Board, National Livestock and Meat Board, National Dairy Council, The Sugar Association, Campbell’s, Hershey, Snack Food Association. We get dietary recommendations from the companies who have the **most gain** in determining what we eat, and also who produce the food that makes us sick in the first place, which will be discussed under the health argument.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/irP-2AacSIhcimZYz0x2-.png?height=734&width=1236)\n\n*Money*\n\nHow could we trust such an entity when vast amounts of money are involved? People in government face a dilemma, either protect the producer or protect the consumer, as their interests clash. When looking from their position, the individual lives don’t seem to matter that much. The pressure and expectation to support BigMeat are probably widespread within the government as well. If someone were to dissent, that person most likely wouldn’t have a bright future in politics.\n\nHere, it’s important to note **check-off programs,** the government-created commodity research and promotion enterprises. They are meant to increase demand, but this is done without any consideration of health or environmental effects. For example, $12M is given to Domino’s to promote the consumption of cheese. For every $1 the checkoff program spends on increasing demand for cheese, farmers get $4.43 in increased revenue. Domino’s adds more cheese on the menu, cheese producers win, government wins, and fast-food producers win. Consumers lose as pizza is definitely neither healthy nor nutritious.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XM95fAyoC66H2DZ5uUIjK.png?height=998&width=1346)\n\nWe might think why nobody would know or do anything about this issue if it’s really bad. We didn’t touch upon the health and environmental issues yet, but when we do, it will be evident that this is a subject that needs to be attended. When we’re inclined to believe somebody would do something, we are that somebody. We should remember that this is a giant industry, who has all the money and power in the government. It’s beyond the point to expect large organizations to save us.\n\n***Health and Environmental Organizations***\n\nFor BigMeat, who has so much power in government, it shouldn’t be hard to have ties in the health and environmental organizations. These organizations have a large audience who are trusting, so their word matters. BigMeat isn’t oblivious and is well aware of the effects of its products. If it can control these organizations, it can first avoid a possible catastrophe, and also then can use it as a marketing tool. And unfortunately, in today’s world, you can own a lot by using fear and money. BigMeat companies pay millions of dollars to health and environmental organizations, which therefore can’t tell the sick people what is actually making them sick, and to environmentalists how they can actually save the planet. It is probably written in bold in the contracts. BigMeat is putting a huge blockage in between the truth and the people, and that block is piles of money. This doesn’t mean that everybody who works there is a bad person, and people all the way on the top might even want to shout the truth from the roofs, but might not be able to because of the complex politics involved. It is quite sad and disturbing actually to think millions of people who are suffering from chronic diseases have to take a bunch of pills every day. They can be saved, but aren’t because the information they rely on is false.\n\n*Sponsors for Health Organizations*\n\n* American Diabetes Association takes money from Dannon, Kraft (Velveeta, Oscar Mayer, Lunchables), Bumblebee Foods, LLC (processed can meats)\n* American Cancer Society takes money from Tyson, Yum! (Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell)\n* Susan G. Komen (Breast Cancer) corporate partners with KFC, Dietz & Watson, Yoplait\n* American Heart Association takes money from Texas Beef Council, Tyson, Kentucky Beef Council, Idaho Beef Council, Nebraska Beef Council, Mars, Unilever, Domino’s Pizza, Farmland, WhiteWave Foods, Dairy Max, ConAgra Foods, Subway, Perdue, Nestle, Kellogg’s, Kraft.\n\nAll of these organizations take money from meat and dairy companies that are associated with the cause of that disease. This is unfortunately the same with environmental organizations. Almost none of them talk about how we can fight climate change by stopping eating meat. Look at the websites of large leading environmental organizations. Chances are that they are not talking about animal agriculture. We won’t be able to save the planet only by turning off the water when brushing our teeth. The scale of the water animal agriculture is just too vast to be compared to our daily use. One positive is that now, when I am looking for information on this subject and the company doesn’t mention animal agriculture, I can infer that I can’t trust them.\n\nAnother point I’d like to draw your attention to is how much money is spent on **advertising**. Aside from check-off programs, all these powerful big companies, of course, engage in vicious advertising. Going into college, I was very interested in marketing, but now I know for all the bad reasons. My current view on it is that marketing became this attention manipulation machine that is a big cause of consumerist culture, envy, and feelings of self-doubt. It creates a need for us to constantly compare ourselves to others. We are all the time seeing ads that tick our basic senses. Our money is used back towards us so that we spend even more money.\n\n***Relation to BigPharma***\n\nThe cycle BigMeat and BigPharma are in together is fascinating. Millions of people eat food from BigMeat, which in turn makes them sick slowly over time. They then develop chronic diseases, which is where the money lies. Healthy and dead people don’t bring in money. People who ‘have to’ take pills all their lives bring in money. Pills relieve symptoms while creating other symptoms without resolving the root cause. BigPharma and BigMeat get their monetary benefits from people being sick. They recommend eating meat then taking pills to relieve the symptoms of the problems caused by the meat. This cycle continues while people give their hard-earned money to both of these industries. People suffer incredibly, live unpleasant unhealthy lives, spend money on medicine, take care and mourn their loved ones, and life quality drops. They win, we lose. I don’t know what to call this, other than a well-elaborated fraud.\n\nThe problems about the BigPharma are huge in its own right, and too complex to get in here. They control what doctors are told, and focus on medication and relieving symptoms, not treating nor prevention. I just want to stress its relation to BigMeat and point out how huge of a power that is as well. In the US, treating chronic diseases is a **$1.5 trillion** industry. Would BigPharma or BigMeat want to eliminate this? Neither wins from healthy beings. Pharmaceutical industry spends more money on lobbying than any other industry: **$238M.**\n\nHealth organizations mentioned above take money from the people who make money out of us being sick for the rest of our lives. It’s a clear conflict of interest, and as I said before, when given a choice between individual lives and huge amounts of money, money wins.\n\n* American Cancer Society takes money from Pfizer, Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Abbvie, Merck, Abbott.\n* American Diabetes Association takes money from Pfizer, Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novo Nordisk, Janssen, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim.\n* American Heart Association takes money from Merck, Pfizer, Lilly, Sanofi, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Chiesi, Daiichi-Sankyo, Bayer, Amgen, Takeda, Novartis, Genentech, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis Pharmaceuticals.\n\nWe have lost our ability to choose what to eat. We are given surreal cheap prices, and we’re constantly bombarded with by misleading messages to create the perception of how much meat and dairy we should be consuming. There are so much externalized costs that are not owned by the meat and dairy industry. Externalized costs are costs that the consumer and society pays for the industry. We don’t ask them to do it, neither does the government, so we all pay their debt together. David Simon calculated this cost: it’s **$414 billion each year**. When we account health care, environmental damage, subsidies, and cruelty. If producers were required to internalize this cost, a $4 big mac would be $11, a $5 carton of eggs would be $13. No matter what you as an individual eat, we’re all paying their debt while they make huge profits. Less the price, more the demand, which is what they want.\n\n**Argument 3: What we eat matters, because Earth is suffering**\n\nWe might not be able to save Mother Earth only by stopping consuming meat and dairy (although I believe we might) but we can’t save Mother Earth if we don’t stop consuming meat and dairy. It’s not a secret that climate change is real, happening right now. If we want human species to continue existing in the beautiful world we live in, we must take action now. The industry is not sustainable, from whatever aspect you look. In this section, I’ll lay down the facts and numbers and talk about different aspects BigMeat is contributing to the destruction of our planet. I believe by knowing what is actually happening, we can each decide what we want to do autonomously.\n\nThe human population grew exponentially. In 1812, there were 1B people on the planet. In 1912, it was 1.5B; in 2012, the number is 7B. Overpopulation is a problem for its own sake, but it can’t be the scapegoat for climate change.\n\n**Every day:**\n\nHuman population drinks **5.2B** gallon water and eats **21B** pound food\n\n1\\.5B cows alone drink **45B** gallon water and eat **135B** pound food\n\n10,000 years ago, which is a pretty short time considering the life on earth existed for much longer, humans were %1 of the biomass in the world, while the rest %99 were free-living animals. Today, humans and the animals we own as our property account for %98 of the biomass, while free-living animals are only **%2.**\n\nAnimal agriculture is responsible for **51% of human-caused climate change** when we account the loss of carbon sinks, respiration, and methane.\n\n**15%** of all greenhouse gas emissions are caused by animal agriculture.\n\n**45%** of the earth’s total land area is used for animal agriculture.\n\n**30%** of global freshwater consumption is used for animal agriculture.\n\n**91%** of Amazon Rainforest destruction is due to animal agriculture\n\nUN reported that livestock is the leading cause of resource consumption and environmental degradation.\n\n***Greenhouse Effect***\n\nNormally, greenhouse gases are good and necessary for us. Without it, the temperature on earth would be -18 degrees C. It keeps the heat from the sun inside the atmosphere so that we can enjoy warmth during the night as well. But we produce a lot of **CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide** that disrupt the balance. This increases the amount of radiation that is sent back to earth, and heat is unable to escape. Typically, Earth’s temperature fluctuates — ice ages to warmer times. The problem is that it increased unusually fast in the last years, and this is *unprecedented*. This results in global temperatures increasing, sea levels rising, and ice caps melting.\n\nClimate scientists say the maximum safe level of emissions for CO2 is **350 parts per million** of CO2, and, right now, we’re at **400ppm**. Methane is **86** times more destructive than CO2. Cows produce 150B gallons of methane per day because of their digestive processes. Animal agriculture produces **65%** of the world’s nitrous oxide, which is a gas with global warming potential 296 times greater than CO2. Worldwatch Institute estimates animal agriculture is responsible for 51% of global greenhouse emissions. This is **more than all transportation** (cars, planes, ships, trucks…) **combined**.\n\n***Land Usage***\n\nAnimal agriculture uses **30% of land on earth** (size of Asia!), **%50 of habitable land**, and **80% of agricultural land in the US**. *(I can hear you say, whaaat?)* Most of which is to grow food to feed the billions of animals we’re manufacturing. We could nourish an additional of 3.5B people if we just ate what we feed to animals. We are currently producing enough crops to feed 9.8 billion people. It’s unbelievable how much land we use to give food to the animals we are going to kill in just couple months. It is so inefficient, unsustainable, and unnecessary when we could eat the crops we are producing. If we were to eliminate animal agriculture altogether, we would have a much healthier land, produce better crops that is good for human consumption, and have so much extra land that could be reversed back to being a forest. This could help reverse climate change, clean the air, and give back their homes to many endangered animals. We grow genetically modified soy and corn on %23 of the land we use for animal agriculture, 93% of which are genetically modified in some way. While we do that, we cause such damage to the land. The production on all this land is non-stop, which gives no time for the soil to recover. We are using pesticides and herbicides on these crops which then contaminates the soil as well. All the minerals in the soil are lost, all bacteria and life under the soil die. There is another world under the soil, which is so necessary for the health of the plant. This is an issue that permaculture addresses and tries to resolve. I have seen first-hand that respecting the life under and around the plant is beneficial to the plant, and the environment. The resulting plant is much better, good looking, and healthier to consume. People care even less about the food that their food eats, so how corn and soy are not good at all, we wouldn’t eat it for sure. Soil is being depleted irreversibly, which means that in any kind of natural disaster, drought, or flood, humans will face a worse situation.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7NEqjJZzwY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7NEqjJZzwY)\n\n(Drone video showing massive feedlots)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cY39MaFulpP-p5F5CkHJo.png?height=4377&width=6251)\n\n***Water Usage***\n\nThe water that goes into animal agriculture is beyond comprehension. It is ***so much***. For example, 1 pound of beef uses 2,500 gallons of water. Think how much time you need to drink that much water. Eating 1 pound less beef saves as much as not showering for 6 months. One burger is equal in water usage to around 2 months of showering. About 70% of the world’s water usage is used for animal agriculture. 55% of fresh water in the US is used for animal agriculture (to compare, private homes account for 5%) This is shocking considering there is so much talk about when our clean water will end and thinking about so many people around the world have no access to clean water. How can we use this much water when people are actually dying from dehydration.\n\n***Habitat Destruction and Species Extinction***\n\nThis is mostly a result of land usage. I was shocked to learn **91% of the Amazon rainforest we destroyed** is because of animal agriculture, which accounts for a large portion of Brazil’s economy. Rainforests are essential to our **survival**; they are our world’s lungs. They breathe in CO2 and exhale O2. **Every second, an acre** (size of a football field) **of the rainforest is cleared**. Animals living on that land lose their homes, and their possibility of existing. Many animals who have been in that environment for millions of years are evolutionarily adapt solely to that environment, which then makes them extremely vulnerable even if they can find somewhere else to live. The is the largest mass extinction in 65 million years, and it’s human caused. Another cause of species extinction is overgrazing, which happens when plants are exposed to grazing for an extended period of time without having the chance to recover.\n\nThis is not only on land either. We took **28 billion animals from oceans last year**, so we are definitely overfishing. The main problem is due to the enormous demand, we’re using massive fishnets, and **for every targeted 1 pound of fish, up to 5 pounds of untargeted species**, like dolphins, whales, turtles, and sharks are caught as **bycatch**. Sea Shepard Conservation Society says there is no such thing as sustainable fishing. Their motto is, “If oceans die, we die.” We will see fishless oceans by 2048 if we don’t do something about it.\n\n![Amazon Rainforest](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IWYnEbuaUYJvHAy2iX4gv.png?height=653&width=1200)\n\n***Ocean Dead-Zones***\n\nWhen water approaches two parts per million or less of oxygen — considered low-oxygen conditions. Eutrophication happens when excess nutrients enter a water body. Extra nitrogen and phosphorous encourage algae growth, which first results in algal blooms. As the algae die, bacteria start to decompose the algae. Much of the **dissolved oxygen in the water gets used up** in this process, causing drops in oxygen. Few or little life in our oceans can survive such circumstances as marine life need oxygen to survive. *How it’s caused by animal agriculture?* We cause excessive nutrient pollution. We have billions of animals, and they produce incredible amounts of **waste**. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that roughly **335 million tons of manure** are produced by livestock in the United States each year. We don’t have good waste management systems, so for producers, it’s easy just to flush that waste into water. That accounts for 335 million tons of extra nutrients. The second part of the story is about half of the fertilizers in the corn and soybean animals eat end up in the oceans as well. There are at least 500 identified dead zones in the world, completely devoid of line. Dead zones have been **doubling** each decade since the 1960s when our current agricultural practices began. As Lucia von Reusner said, “These dead zones will continue to expand unless the major meat companies that dominate our global agricultural system start cleaning up their supply chains to keep pollution out of our waters.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sJ6SZR18P6dUoJAIJYNjV.png?height=756&width=1284)\n\n![Image of an ocean-dead zone](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/irNXO1QUzOrBGNlajLPVv.png?height=1348&width=1982)\n\n***Waste***\n\nWe just mentioned one effect of the huge amounts of waste. All the waste produces incredible **air and water pollution**. Their urine and manure emit around 400 different harmful gases into the atmosphere, and because of the huge numbers and close proximity of animals, the concentration of gasses increase and is awfully dangerous. In the giant lagoons of waste, waste breaks down and produces ammonia gas, which breeds bacteria and forms **nitric acid**. It builds up in the atmosphere and returns as **acid rain**, which harms soil, forests, and waters. One example of water contamination is from the hog farms in North Carolina. There are as many pigs as there are people, but pigs produce ten times more waste than humans. There is almost no waste treatment; pigs are forced to live in their waste in the farms, then it’s pumped into giant waste pits which goes into the rivers. Like this is not enough, factories then use this water without filtering onto fields, further polluting the environment and health of everyone around. The pollution from waste in the rivers kills marine life, as it is in Burnt River. Hog farms are around neighborhoods of low-income families, where mostly African American families live. When we look at the area where the farms in North Carolina are, everybody has a disease, either cancer or asthma. They don’t have the chance to move to somewhere with cleaner air. Animal agriculture creates this pollution that increases diseases, which then helps the BigPharma, as they can now sell more drugs to ‘treat’ these diseases. Animal agriculture’s relation to racism and social class is a huge topic that I won’t be covering in this article, but is extremely important.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7qlnzUHcVE4YhWAe4RDKq.png?height=554&width=1058)\n\nRight now, **our world is suffering**, and we are the ones making it suffer. There are dangerous levels of air pollution, CO2 levels, storms, melting ice caps, wildfires in Amazon, California, Australia as we keep cutting trees. The acidification of oceans is on its way to be 150% higher than normal, resulting in a pH level oceans haven’t seen in *20 million years*. Countries will go underwater, millions of people will have to relocate, we will lose some of our history and culture. Nature is the ultimate giver; it gives us food, water, everything we could ever need, and asks nothing in return but compassion. We will die if we don’t take care of nature. We must realize the effects of our actions; it’s our responsibility to learn. Ignorance shouldn’t be bliss. We are currently living in **Holocene extinction**, sixth mass extinction in the history of Earth, which is now caused by human activity. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates. We are global superpredators, killing anything we deem unimportant for our aims. We first caused the extinction of megafauna and now have even more power to cause loss of biodiversity through our industrialized activities, overfishing, climate change, and of course, meat consumption. We are all in this together. This, of course, affects some people more than others, but eventually, it will affect us all. We can’t live without our environment; we can’t survive without mother nature. We must ask ourselves what kind of world we want to live in? A world of rainforests, animal diversity, clean air, co-existing with animals, with normal climate events, or a world where we have to fight for clean water, food, while causing mass extinction of animals and live in drought.\n\nMost environmental organizations aren’t doing anything that will reverse what is done as they are also taking money from meat and dairy companies. They need funding, so they take the money, and as they already have many oppositions, they don’t want to be branded as anti-meat even though that is what the world needs. That would piss off a whole new group of powerful individuals, so we must take it in our own hands. We can’t expect somebody else to save us. I believe we must take action rather than just do the talking.\n\n**Argument 4: What we eat matters, because it’s ruining our health**\n\n> *“Let food be thy medicine” — Hippocrates*\n\nWe have a huge misunderstanding of what we really need to eat because the producers control nutrition guidelines. We are not receiving diet advice from scientists who do the correct research. In this part, I will talk about the effects of consuming meat and dairy on our health.\n\n***Antibiotic Resistance***\n\nBecause of the excessive antibiotic use in animal agriculture, bacteria are evolving to become antibiotic resistant. Before antibiotics, millions of people died of infections that we can now easily resolve. We now treat antibiotics as a commodity, but it was a revolution in medicine. Millions of lives were saved with the invention of antibiotics, but now when people are infected with an antibiotic resistant bacterium, this **life-saving drug won’t have any effect**. When a bacterium gains resistance to its corresponding antibiotic, we fight it with a more potent antibiotic. For example, one last resort strong antibiotic called Colistin was rarely used to avoid creating even stronger bacteria that can fight it. In 2015 in China, resistance against Colistin was discovered. Resistance to Colistin could mean the deaths of a lot of people. How did this happen? Millions of animals in Chinese pig farms were given Colistin for a long time, and their bacteria gained resistance, which then was spread to us. Through extensive use of antibiotics in animals, we now created more bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. In the US, 80% of all antibiotics are fed to livestock to keep them from dying early because of all the diseases they develop. The antibiotic they consume create irreversible changes in their body, and it causes the adaptation of bacteria that affect both them and humans to become antibiotic resistant. This is a major problem and a health risk, as we also don’t know how fast bacteria develop resistance towards common antibiotics. Many people die from this problem each year already.\n\n***Pandemics***\n\nThere is a natural order of things. Viruses existed far longer than humans, animals, or even single cell organisms. When the natural order of things is disrupted, problems start to happen. We, humans, disrupted this way of things by manipulating environment so much, that we find ourselves in surreal situations. We’re not changing humans, but it’s naïve to think while changing how animals live, we’re not disrupting anything. We have destroyed natural habitat of many animals, as discussed under habitat destruction. Viruses are host specific, they have existed in the animal they chose for thousands of years. Viruses don’t randomly affect any living being. They act to live as well, they need the host to survive so that the virus can survive. Their aim is not to kill their host. Herpes is a virus that we live with, and it manifests when we’re under stress. All other animals have different type of viruses that they carry. When we change the environment animal lives in, the virus on it is subject to evolve. When a virus evolves, it can change its host preferences. When we put a snake near a dog next to a bat, alive, or recently dead, the viruses these animals carry can evolve, because these animals are not meant to be in this close proximity in nature. Disrupting this ecosystem comes with a cost, one that we’re all seeing right now. When the virus evolves, it has the possibility to choose human as a host, and because human isn’t the organism that virus evolved to live with, then it causes disease, and death. Perhaps, this will be our undoing. When we disrupt the ecosystem, treat animals like stuff, be disrespectful to their way of life, the result is unnatural situations, such as the coronavirus pandemic right now. At some point in the future, most probably, the virus will evolve to live with humans without killing, but until that point, so many lives will be lost. I can’t stop to think that this massive change in lifestyle, disruption of the economy, lives that are lost are because we put an animal next to other animals that weren’t supposed to be together and ate that animal that we weren’t supposed to eat. Mad cow, Avian flu, Coronavirus, and so many more. I ask, is it worth it?\n\n***Inflammation***\n\nAlmost all chronic diseases start with inflammation in the body. Everything that causes inflammation in the body has the potential to trigger a disease. As a lifestyle, it’s something that must be averted. Air pollution, cigarette smoke, alcohol, and stress are some examples that can result in inflammation. The one we’re focusing on here is the inflammation caused by meat products. The toxins in the fat in the animals are inflammatory. All animals, us included, by nature, create toxins when they engage in metabolic activity and produce energy. This is the cycle of life; we create toxins as waste when we produce energy. It is how mitochondria work, and this is why we die. If we didn’t create toxins, we would reverse aging. Plants are the purest form of nutrients we can take, and their rate of toxin production is much lower. Animals produce toxins, and when we eat them, we take in the toxins they create as well. Whatever grass-fed beef we buy, this is the case. Now, it gets worse as the meat we buy isn’t up to the standards. First, the herbicides and pesticides used in the corn fed to the cow are toxins. Second, because of the horrible treatment of animals, the stress animal goes through creates even more toxins. (just like we do) All these toxins we consume cause inflammation in our bowels, and by eating constantly, bowels can’t handle it, and it spreads to the whole body. First, it’s low levels of inflammation, but when the cause is left unattended, as we usually do, inflammation finds a weak spot and then becomes a chronic disease. Chronic diseases are not like traumas (breaking a leg); they develop over time, and they can’t be resolved immediately. For example, a type of chronic disease, type 2 diabetes, can take years to develop, and it can take years to treat. It results from the damage of inflammation on the cell walls, which become resistant to insulin. Once the cell walls are resistant to insulin, they cannot uptake the glucose in the blood, and this creates a foundation for a set of metabolic problems. Decreasing inflammation in the body is one of the most promising changes diabetic patients can do.\n\n***Cancer***\n\nCancer, one of the diseases that cause the **most deaths** every year, has been associated with meat consumption in literature. Studies are showing two reasons why meat consumption may be related to cancer. First, the **growth hormone** used in cattle production is causing human cells to proliferate without control. Second, the **toxins** that accumulate inside the animal tissue have the potential to mess up with the DNA of human cells, which can give rise to tumors. One of the worst things we can eat is processed meat. Any meat that is cured, salted, smoked, fermented, dried, or canned is processed. Bacon, ham, sausages, burgers, salami, nugget, ground beef are all examples of processed meat. Rule of thumb should be not to eat any processed meat. World Health Organization classifies processed meat as group 1 carcinogen. Some group 1 carcinogens include arsenic, benzene, radiation, and smoking. Red meat is classified as group 2, so it’s not good either, but processed is much worse.\n\nChronic diseases must be taken seriously. Top 5–10 deathly diseases include mostly chronic diseases, which include auto-immune diseases, allergies, Alzheimer’s, stroke, diabetes, etc. 1/3 of Americans have diabetes. We must care about this, also because chronic diseases are one of the biggest expenses as the patients are bound to take multiple drugs for the rest of their lives, and it’s where BigPharma makes its most money. As it’s said, if you don’t invest in your food first, you will pay that later to drugs.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SZ5JKs9FD56Efj_n9OZuE.png?height=474&width=750)\n\nIn medical journals and newspapers, the benefits of these drugs are always talked about, because most studies are conducted and sponsored by either BigMeat or BigPharma, who get the most benefit from these problems. Pharmaceutical companies sponsor many different scientists to conduct research to establish the credibility of their drug. On the other hand, the studies that aim to show you can resolve these issues through nutrition don’t receive any funding; thus, people don’t know much about it and don’t understand its importance. People commonly believe that drugs can solve the problem, and that diet has no place in the cause of the disease nor in treatment. This is a huge problem in the medical world. The lack of thorough studies causes the situation now, where we don’t know what is correct and what is wrong. One effect of this issue is that the more drugs we put into our bodies, the more we disrupt the natural system the body has. Each drug adds something artificial to our body. All drugs are only aimed to get rid of the symptom, and as we get rid of the symptom, the root cause remains, but we are only left oblivious to the problems our body is trying to tell us. No drug is designed to either treat the cause or to prevent the disease from happening. For example, cholesterol drug aims to lower the cholesterol, not to understand why it’s elevated in the first place. Think of this; when we’re healthy, we are not aware of our inner organs. We can’t feel our stomach or our kidneys because it’s evolutionarily not necessary. We’re always aware of our mental states (introspection), but it’s only when there is a problem that we can sense the inner state of our body. (interoception) When our body is telling us something, we must listen and try to find the cause, not shut it down by relieving symptoms. Each drug creates other problems and symptoms as it relieves one, and therefore people are left with so many drugs that they have to take for the rest of their lives. What is not commonly known, but I completely believe in, is that given the right nutrition and time, the body has the capacity to heal itself in most conditions.\n\n> *“The doctor of the future will give no medicine but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame, in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease.”-Thomas Edison*\n\nThe reason why alternative medicines such as Ayurveda, Homeopathy, and functional medicine became so popular in recent times is not because it’s proven scientifically. It’s because people realized that we are continually taking drugs, but things are not getting any better, so we try to find some other way to heal and turn to alternative options. It was through experience that people realize drugs are not doing anything good to do body, and if anything, doing something bad. Chronic disease numbers are increasing worldwide. Alternative ways are gaining popularity because the options we have are not helping. We don’t know how good or bad the alternative options are as there are not enough studies to prove their effectiveness. There is a lack of information because, unfortunately, the main point isn’t health, but it is money, so we are left to try and find what works through trial and error. Health is so important, but yet we are so bad at it. We must leave our preconceptions, personal gains, and actually work to find the truths by treating each option equally. We must listen to our bodies and get to the root cause of the problems. Our aim shouldn’t be to get rid of the symptoms but to understand and resolve so that body can function normally again.\n\n…\n\nI have made my main four arguments about why we should stop consuming meat and dairy. I talked about animals having a moral status, what happens to the animals we eat, animal cruelty; the meat and dairy industry’s power in politics and organizations, its relations to BigPharma; in what aspects BigMeat contributes to climate change, how the world is right now; the health problems consuming meat causes, talking about antibiotic resistance, inflammation, and cancer.\n\nNow, I turn to specific subjects and talk briefly about each to have an even more wholesome view on the subject. The more we know, the better we can make decisions, right?\n\n…\n\n***Milk, Cheese, and Eggs***\n\n*Milk*\n\nMilk is one of the biggest hoaxes of all time. Many studies have proven that it is risky to drink milk, and contrary to common belief, it doesn’t protect bones. But actually, people who drink milk have higher hip fractions, eczema, constipation, acid reflux, iron deficiency, anemia, and live shorter lives. It causes many types of cancers, especially those linked to hormones: breast, prostate, ovarian cancers. Milk increases a man’s chance of getting prostate cancer by 34%, and for women who had breast cancer, one glass of milk per day increases their chance of dying from the disease by 49% and dying from anything by 64%. Aside from that, most people in the world are lactose-intolerant (73% of African Americans, 95% of Asians, 53% of Hispanic Americans), because why would our body create this enzyme to digest lactose if we don’t need it. This fact alone shows that we are not supposed to drink it.\n\nThink about it, the purpose of cow’s milk is to turn a 65-pound calf into a 400-pound cow as fast as possible. Cow’s milk is, as Dr. Michael Klaper calls it, baby calf growth fluid, and it is the lactation secretions of a large mammal who just had a baby. Everything in it, hormones, lipids, proteins, sodium, insulin-like growth factors are for that calf to grow; it doesn’t exist for humans to consume. Whether it’s in the form of yogurt, cheese, or ice cream, it’s still milk. Maybe you could be thinking, milk is the first thing we drink, so shouldn’t it be fine? But it’s the milk from one’s mother, created for that child. Human milk, which is the perfect food for the infant, designed and perfected for millions of years through evolution, is very different than milk from other animals.\n\nLooking from the environmental perspective, it is not sustainable at all. One gallon of milk requires 1000 gallons of water to produce. The industry is so focused on making money that Ryan Shapiro and Jeffrey Light exposed e-mails from people high in the hierarchy in the American Egg Board that AEB considers the alternative egg company Just as “a crisis and a major threat” and wrote suggesting murdering the CEO of Just, Josh Tetrick, writing “Can we pool our money and put a hit on him?” How and why would AEB be this scared from a start-up providing an alternative option?\n\nI also believe it is the easiest thing to make the change, as there are so many possible options that it’s impossible not to like one of them. I am in love with oat milk, it goes amazing with coffee, and also prefer soy milk if oat isn’t available. Some other options are cashew, coconut, soy, almond, rice, hazelnut, and macadamia milk.\n\n*Cheese*\n\nCheese contains everything bad about milk, is also highly processed, naturally has a lot of saturated fat, and we add a lot of salt into it. There is a strong link between dairy products and autoimmune diseases such as asthma, multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes, and rheumatologic problems. Dr. Neal Barnard explains a disturbing finding about why we seem to love cheese a lot. Scientists found that the casein protein that is the main protein in the dairy products (especially cheese) breaks apart to create casomorphins. They are casein-derived, morphine-like compounds that go to the brain and attach to the receptors that heroin attaches to. This explains our love and addiction to cheese, and casomorphins may play a role in sudden infant death syndrome and autism, which is why giving an infant cow’s milk is a terrible thing to do. Human breast milk has 2.7 grams of casein per liter, while cow’s milk has 26 grams.\n\n*Eggs*\n\nEggs contain saturated fat and cholesterol (about 200mg in one egg), which are linked to cancer and diabetes. About 60% of the calories in eggs are from fat, most of which is saturated. One study found that people who regularly eat eggs have a 19% higher risk for cardiovascular problems; another found that people who eat eggs regularly have high coronary artery calcium scores, which is a measure of heart disease risk. The high fat in the egg can contribute to insulin resistance. People who consume most eggs have a %68 higher chance for diabetes. Dr. Michael Greger uncovered documents where USDA admitted that eggs could not legally be called ‘nutritious,’ ‘low fat,’ ‘part of a balanced diet,’ ‘low calorie,’ ‘healthful,’ ‘healthy,’ ‘good for you,’ or even ‘safe.’ I liked eggs and thought they were essential. My mom would push me to eat eggs as I didn’t like it when I was little. Now, I was putting two, three eggs in my omelets so that I could get protein and everything else good in it, right? Well, it turns out I was wrong, and I’m usually pleased to be wrong in life so that I can make the right choice. It’s sad that eggs are bad for us, but it is what it is, and at the end of the day, living a healthy and quality life is more important than having eggs benedict.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FNpGaHukNfj0VPbzAg1wi.png?height=708&width=1160)\n\n***Are we omnivores?***\n\nLet’s compare the anatomy of true omnivores (who eat both plants and animals, like bears and raccoons) to frugivores. (who eat almost exclusively plants, like chimps and other primates) Frugivores’ teeth are flat molars for chewing plants, while omnivores have long and sharp teeth for stabbing tearing flesh. Frugivore jaws can move forward and back and side to side. Omnivores’ can only up and down. Frugivores have much less acidic stomach acid than omnivores. Frugivores have intestines 9 times the body length, while omnivores’ are only three times their body length. We fit every requirement to be a frugivore. Human’s closest relatives are chimps, who take 97% of their calorie intake from plants and rest from eating insects. The idea of having to eat meat to be strong is not true in nature. The largest, strongest animals are herbivores: elephants, bison, rhinos, giraffes. Biology can’t lie, and this seems like a pretty good argument to me that we are frugivores.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YTGOViStOAm6qfuenygp1.jpg?height=571&width=750)\n\n***Sustainability***\n\nWe have talked about many problems the meat and dairy industry causes to the environment, and how much resources it uses. There are people supporting sustainable animal agriculture, but thinking about the demand and the growing population, I don’t believe it’s possible, nor necessary. To reiterate, 1 kg of beef requires 150 square meters of land, and 15,000 liters of water, and generates 27 kg of CO2, which equals to driving your car more than 100 miles. **In the same land, we can grow either 37,000 pounds of veggies or 375 pounds of meat.** We can produce **15 times more protein from plant-based sources than** **meat** on any given area of land. All the proteins that we eat are already coming from plants as well because only plants have the ability to take nitrogen from the air, break those molecules apart, and incorporate that into amino acids and make protein. When we eat animals, it’s just recycled protein. This means we can get all the protein we need from plants. When these are the numbers we have, while also considering all the other reasons I wrote about, it doesn’t make sense. Around 216,000 more people are born every single day, and in a typical American diet, that would mean we need 34,000 acres of new farmland to feed those people every single day. It doesn’t make any sense to use most of our farmland to produce food for the animals so that we can eat those animals when we could produce food that we can directly eat, especially when you consider so many children are starving around the world. Right now, there are 843 million undernourished people in the world. (and more than 1.7 billion overweight people) We don’t have a lack of food; we’re just feeding it to the animals. Of course, there is a lot more that can be said about sustainability, but I believe this whole essay has the undertone of sustainability and, therefore, doesn’t need any more explanation here. Sustainability is very important to me, because I used to be so focused on efficiency, and thought that was the most important thing, until I met the concept of sustainability and understood what it is, not only in environmental issues, but in many aspects of life, and especially technology.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G-kQ9m-pGXyTDAnO6uBLX.jpg?height=494&width=800)\n\n***New tech opens the door for endless possibilities***\n\nAll said and done, it’s normal to still have in mind that we might still want a burger or enjoy an eggs benedict. I certainly do. We have traditions and cultures around food, as it is something very important that brings us together. Animal products are very much in our lives, and it’s also not easy to live without some types of food. Luckily, we are developing new technologies every day, and there are smart and caring people working on this. Let’s talk about plant protein. We have developed ways to turn plant so that it brings the same taste, texture, and protein of meat.\n\n**Beyond Meat:** This company makes products similar to chicken, beef, and pork sausage. They say it’s a ‘perfect substitute for meat.’ It has a very similar nutritional profile of beef from animals, has similar texture and taste. You can find their products in restaurants all around the US. I had many Beyond Burgers before, and it tasted almost identical to beef. If you ask me, it tastes way better. They said, “Why do you need an animal to create meat? Why can’t you build meat directly from plants? It turns out you can. So we did.” They are in Target, TGIFridays, Whole Foods, Bareburger, and many more places.\n\n**Impossible Food:** Honestly, eating Impossible Burger, I couldn’t tell any difference from a burger made from an animal. The typical veggie burger doesn’t fully look like beef, but Impossible’s cooks and tastes like a beef patty. They used neuroscience to understand what makes beef so good, and worked to get the same sensory experience, so neither brain nor the person can tell the difference. Their burger is even red and bloody as they found out what makes animal beef red and aromatic is heme, and that you can extract the same thing from soy plants. Impossible is both in groceries and in restaurants.\n\n**Just:** They decided to go after eggs, as 1.1 trillion eggs are laid worldwide each year. 99% of our eggs come from battery cage facilities. They realized the problematic system going on of thousands of chickens in little cages left for a life of hell and wanted to revolutionize the system completely. They are now producing a plant-based scramble, that scrambles and tastes like eggs. What is also good about these startups is their mission is not the make the most money regardless of what is in the food, but actually create something that has value, and won’t harm people, animals, or the environment. Companies like these show that we don’t have to give up the pleasure we take from eating meat and eggs, but we can choose to do it differently. We have the technology; we just need to put the effort in it. I really hope that more and more companies start to focus on plant-based substitutes, and this would motivate people who are unsure to make the change in their diets. I love eggs, and I am very happy that I get to chance to have scrambled eggs or cook waffles or crepes as I wish.\n\n![Impossible Burger!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l0HNZqWXot8hun_G0lRjk.jpg?height=410&width=756)\n\n**Cultured Meat:** It’s important to note that there is a whole different option that we might have in the stores soon. It is meat produced by in vitro cell culture of animal cells, instead of from slaughtered animals. It’s a form of cellular agriculture and uses the same tissue engineering techniques we use for regenerative medicine. It’s not available yet, as it’s expensive and still in progress to make it better, but people are working on it, and it has been done and tested before. Mosa Meat, Memphis Meats, SuperMeat are several companies working on it. What I’m concerned here is that we most likely will have a negative public opinion on it, probably deemed as ‘unnatural,’ as the industry will place the seeds of doubt. I, personally, would eat it. Still, supporters are numerous, as the funding of €250,000 for one research came from the co-founder of Google, Sergey Brin.\n\n> *“We shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium.”-Winston Churchill*\n\n***Ethical Responsibility***\n\n“… compare the respective feelings of two animals, one of which is engaged in eating the other,” said Schopenhauer. Which one has more intense feelings about it? He says the intensity of pain always outweighs the pleasure, so we must **avoid inflicting great pain to gain a lesser pleasure.** Think of the joy you get from eating meat in your dinner, how long does it last? Is it even something special anymore, as it was 50 years ago? Is it anywhere near the pain inflicted upon that animal? We are responsible for the mess we created. Not one of us individually is responsible, but that doesn’t mean we’re off the hook. If there are billions of living, feeling, sensing animals who are in pain, all the time, at any given time, we have the responsibility to do something about it.\n\nThis whole essay started with me wanting to give ethical arguments to stop eating meat. While researching to be thorough, I was shocked to find the grandiosity of these issues. What is going on behind the curtains is true, and gives rise to pressing issues. We can’t turn away from it. Ignorance isn’t bliss, because in this case, ignorance is killing us, animals, and the environment.\n\n*317 animals are killed every second in the US.*\n\nI honestly believe that from the point of view of the universe, we are not more important than any other living being. Perhaps even less so, as we are consuming, killing, and polluting, while trees are supporting life, and other animals live in accordance with each other. All animals derive from a common ancestor. We must acknowledge that all living beings have the desire to live, and they feel pain, joy, grief, and pleasure. They all can feel pain; they all can suffer. Try to put yourself in the shoes of a pig on the factory farm. Just close your eyes and think of the life story of that pig. We must stop deliberately inflicting suffering on all other living beings for our selfish gains and desires. Are my taste buds more important than their lives?\n\n*“Do to others as you would have them do to you”*\n\nIf you can’t kill an animal with your hands and take it apart, why should anybody do that for you? When you have beef in front of you to eat, if you don’t like thinking that it was a living being on your plate, you shouldn’t eat it. We must acknowledge meat for what it is, that it was a living being that lived a horrible life and is killed so that you can eat. It’s a cow, not steak; it’s chicken, not wings; it’s a pig, not bacon. The meat industry decontextualizes meat from the animal itself and the process, so you don’t overthink it and can buy with ease. But we must bring back to our minds that under all this mechanization, industrialization, branding, marketing, and the illusion, there are animals suffering incredibly.\n\nWhy do we eat cows, pigs, chickens, and turkeys when dogs and cats are our friends? The animals we eat are not so different from dogs, as they also love to play, learn, have self-awareness, and can communicate. They are fully aware of the horrible conditions, and they know what will happen when they enter a slaughterhouse. There is no nice or humane way to kill a being that doesn’t want to die. As Philip Wollen said, “I discovered that when we suffer, we suffer as equals. In their capacity to suffer, a dog is a pig, is a bear, is a boy.”\n\nBecause of the suffering, the environmental impact, the games played by the industry, and also other lives impacted, the diseases and the money spent on it, I argue that it’s our ethical duty to STOP EATING MEAT. Eat less, at least.\n\n> *“I think we come to view eating meat in the way we now look back on the Roman games. Having crowds of enthusiastic people cheering on the lions as they slaughtered the Christians or gladiators fighting each other to the death.”-Peter Singer*\n\n***Spirituality***\n\nEvery year, 56 billion land and 90 billion marine animals are killed for food. We didn’t consciously choose to eat meat; it was mostly given from culture, habits, and family; it was normal. But we are smart beings, and we can learn to make better choices in our lives. I have come to realize that **selflessness, kindness, compassion, love, considerations of other living beings** are what make us human. It’s not money that is at the core of being human. We all have the capacity to foster compassion and kindness. When I was in Thailand at the Mindfulness Project, I experienced first-hand that we can enlarge our love and compassion to people we don’t know, people across the globe, but also to all animals. I could feel instant warmness to and from these people I didn’t know; when we **listen, care, understand**, and actively engage in being **non-judgmental**, the world becomes a different place. Even though I wanted to stop eating meat for a while, I went vegetarian for the first time there, and I was more mindful of my eating. Also, our food was so good that it made me realize it’s completely possible! I believed that we are all living beings existing in the same planet, and nothing makes us better than other animals, but now it was time to practice it. Practice what you preach, they say, and that is right.\n\nOur minds guide us, and its goal is to make us survive. So, our brains create this boundary between what is my in-group and out-group. We have the tendency to want the best for ourselves and those around us, but we fail to enlarge that compassion to people different from us. We attribute good meanings to the actions of people we like, and negative to those of the people we don’t like. But realizing that we are all just living beings who are capable of suffering, there is no reason to draw a line. You could just look, listen, and love because that living being has a completely different subjective experience, but nothing makes theirs less valuable than yours.\n\nI don’t want to deviate too much, but I believe it’s so important to see ourselves more than just the body and the everyday experiences. We have a soul, we have consciousness, which I believe is beyond the everyday life, and perhaps something non-physical. We all have subjective experiences that start with our sensory information, which then gives the tools to our brain to create a model of the world in the mind. Understanding difference in **subjective experience** is critical to being non-judgmental and being open-minded towards other opinions and possible truths. No one point of view is correct, or better than any other. From the point of view of the universe, a human is no different than a cow. *Why would my point of view, my wants and needs be more important, or valuable than that of the cow?*\n\nWe’re interconnected with other living beings, in many layered levels. I argue in another paper that we’re connected in an atomic, cultural, and biological level.\\[4\\] We can’t exist in total isolation and be who we are. There is no language with one person. There is no O2 without trees. There is no life without bees. We can see all other human beings, and all other animals as part of us, because we exist together, exchange atoms with each step, with each meal, with each breath. The idea of an independent self is simply not accurate.\n\n> *“The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.”― Nikola Tesla*\n\nIt also inherently makes sense not to cause damage to other living beings, as we are all interconnected. We are part of something bigger than ourselves; we share this planet, this energy. What happens to the environment affects us all; what happens to other people affects us all. Diseases affect us all, as we have seen with the pandemic.\n\nWe usually don’t think about what we can’t see. We avoid the emotional pain of empathizing with the animal, even though we know they are being killed. We are sort of lying to ourselves, denying the truth. When I asked my family to watch a documentary talking about animal agriculture, my mom’s response was, “I’m not eating a lot anyway, I don’t want to learn and make the experience of eating meat worse.” This denial causes a struggle inside that we are not consciously aware of.\n\nWhen we’re doing things that hurt other living beings, we are wrong.\n\nAdopting a vegan diet will make you compassionate towards animals, but also towards other human beings. It makes you more conscious of your eating habits, which can carry on for the day and makes you more mindful throughout your day. There is a lightness coming from knowing you are not causing more suffering into the world, not causing more harm to the environment.\n\nWe don’t see the face in the food.\n\nI’d like to share two things we said in the Mindfulness Project. Perhaps it will resonate with you.\n\nFirst is a practice of loving-kindness meditation. It’s meant to enlarge our love to everybody, and saying it repetitively makes you feel so good, that I understood and embraced in me that what makes people happy is giving, not taking.\n\n*“May all living beings be full of love and kindness. May all living beings be healthy and free of physical pain. May all living beings be calm, relaxed, and without fear. May all living beings be happy, content, and really free.”*\n\nSecond is sort of like a prayer or dedication before meals. It serves as a reminder that nature provides everything we need, and we have responsibility to give back.\n\n*“Thank you mother nature for providing this food. I eat this beautiful meal not for joy or pleasure, not for beautification or purification, but only to maintain my physical body to serve animals, environment, and people who need our help so badly right now.”*\n\n![What kind of world do we want to live in?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hbqnmS83ns_YQsTsrrQHu.jpg?height=380&width=520)\n\n***Becoming Vegan, Making the Switch to Plant-Based Diet***\n\nThis paper became very important to me. It wasn’t so long ago that I stopped eating meat in Thailand and decided to continue as a pescatarian that when I got back. I was feeling so sure when I was saying, “Well, fish have less capacity to suffer, and I just love shrimp a lot” When someone asked me why I stopped eating meat, which was considered unusual, as no one I know is neither veggie nor vegan, I gave the three arguments: animals, industry, environment. I didn’t want to add more suffering. While I was giving the same arguments to one of my mom’s friends, I thought to myself, why not write about this? I was feeling very passionate about the subject as equality, environment, sustainability, and ethical lifestyle are important to me. I spent some time doing research, then some time writing. While I was researching, I learned so much more about the cruelty and the health problems that I just knew I had to stop altogether and become a vegan. It just wasn’t worth it. If every time I want a shrimp, I am killing 5 other marine animals as bycatch, it’s not worth it. I also learned alarming health problems, therefore decided to add an argument talking about it. I am not saying by any means that anybody is a bad person for eating animals. I was thinking of myself as caring for animal rights and the environment, and now I see **it’s impossible to call myself either if I’m eating animal products**. I wasn’t a hypocrite; I just didn’t know better. I wish I knew about these before, and that’s why I decided to compile everything I read, watched, and learned under these titles. I am no expert in any of these subjects by any means; I’m just someone who wanted to learn what seems right and share this knowledge. Don’t take my words as any well-established or medical advice, as I didn’t came up with anything I talked about, and I’m not formally educated on any of these topics. I just love to learn about what is important, and feel the need to share what I learned. We covered a lot of subjects, and I thank you if you got all the way here. This was my first serious writing venture that I am doing just for its own sake. I know it was a pretty long essay, but I really think everything I wrote are incredibly important to get the almost-thorough story.\n\nHere is some data on going vegetarian or vegan:\n\n**Per year:**\n\n***Land usage:*** You can use 18 times less land.\n\nAll vegan: 1/6 acre of land\n\nAll vegetarian: ½ acre of land\n\nAverage American: 3 acres of land\n\n***CO2 savings:*** (to compare, solar-powered house saves 1.4 tons, using an electric car saves 2.5)\n\nBy removing beef only: 1.4 tons\n\nAll vegetarian: 1.6 tons\n\nAll vegan: 1.8 tons\n\nEvery single day, by choosing to go vegan, **you can save**\n\n1100 gallons (4164 liters) of water\n\n45 pounds (20 kg) of grain\n\n30 square feet (2.8 square meters) of forest\n\n10 pounds (4.5 kg) of CO2\n\n1 animal’s life\n\nYou can eat fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains. Making the switch will make you healthier, have more compassionate towards the environment and animal life. Overall, vegetarians have a longer life expectancy, lower rates of heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s. The average male’s risk of death from heart disease is 50% if omnivore, 15% if vegetarian, 4% if vegan. It is the single most important action you can take as an individual to save the planet. You’re not becoming a different person or giving up something that makes you a human. If anything, you’re connecting with yourself, with the planet, and the animals.\n\nLet’s foster **empathy, kindness, and compassion.**\n\nWhen we’re altruistic, when we do things for the greater good and we’re not selfish, it comes around and benefits me too. It feels good, it is coherent with our nature. We’re connected. Hurting an animal, hurts us too. Even if we don’t feel it right away, it hurts us, it hurts the environment little by little.\n\nMake your own mind about what you believe is right for you, but remember that we are all in this together. Your choice matters a lot, and you get the chance to vote red or vote green. You are the customer; you are the demand. With less demand, they will have no choice to lower the supply, which could save lives.\n\nIt’s up to you to make that choice and *make a difference.*\n\n…\n\n\\[1\\] There are some theories of consciousness that to be conscious, and therefore have a moral status, a being must have thinking ability, or self-consciousness. For example, higher-order theory of consciousness claims a thought about the state one is in is necessary for that state to be conscious. I disagree with such theories.\n\n\\[2\\] Why “grass-fed” beef is more expensive\n\n\\[3\\] It’s true that we always genetically modified our environment through selective breeding. How animals and plants are today is very different than how it was several thousand years ago. Problem is, now we have larger number of animals, less regard for their well-being, and high industrialization.\n\n\\[4\\] <https://medium.com/@aleynadogan/identity-is-an-illusion-death-is-trivial-18a5cef50a6c>\n\nNote: Feel free to write to me if you have something you think is important to add, if you have an updated or different data in hand, or if there is a conflict somewhere in my essay.

{"id": "M6ekAIKYBE5hpC1IRRoVZxb0tEPSCNKwU-dRfYfg7TQ", "title": "Legendary Investor Stan Druckenmiller - Inflation & The Fed", "body": "***“An investment in knowledge pays the best interest” - Benjamin Franklin***\n\nThe following is an article based on Stan Druckenmiller’s presentation which you can find [here](https://vimeo.com/548917378). \n\nStan is a legend among investors, having been in the industry for over 45 years, and running Duquesne Capital for 29 years, closing the fund with 12billion dollars. \n\nI have learned an enormous amount from Stan’s presentation, and I have done my best to summarise the most important parts for you. \n\n**The Unprecedented Decline**\n\nIt should not come as a surprise to any of you, that the last 18months have been completely unprecedented. There is no prior recession or economic event that comes close to what we saw last year. The US saw 5x the decline of the average recession - in only 25% of the time. The decline in economic activity was both violent and abrupt, which called for an equivalently aggressive monetary and fiscal policy response from the Fed.\n\nThey didn't hold back.\n\nIn just 3 months, the Government deficit increased more than the last 5 recessions combined. Think the GFC, the dot-com bubble, the '90s recession, and the two recessions prior. Add them all up and they still do not equal what was done in just ***3 months.*** In fact, the Fed's incredible response to the economic shutdown meant that they did more QE in 6 weeks, than was done in the ***entire*** period from '09 - '18 following the GFC.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X3_77ixVHLe8smshvbK6O.png?height=406&width=736)\n\nNow due to the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and the effect on economies around the world, the response actually makes a lot of sense. However, what is surprising is that the Fed is doubling down on these policies, even after what seemed like a sharp and strong recovery.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/px9bEx5d9vC6wq5xYlBJK.png?height=431&width=699)\n\nThe unemployment rate has recovered 70% from the initial hit in only 6months. It has typically taken 25months for this to happen. So the question is; why is the Fed still continuing to purchase 120billion dollars in securities per month, after such an incredible recovery in the workforce?\n\nDruckenmiller points out that it is \"unnecessary and frankly reckless, that 575bil. of the 850bil in direct transfer of 2.5T of expected QE, has come *after* retail sales were above pre-Covid trends and after vaccine confirmation\"\n\nThe question is, why continue with such a heavy-handed response when unemployment has recovered so dramatically, and retail sales are 15% above trend?\n\nThis is of course making asset managers and investors very well off. The incredible amount of stimulus bolsters asset prices in virtually every sector and makes people like Druckenmiller a lot of money. His criticism carries a lot of weight, as those who will get hurt by inflation will not be the investors, but those without any assets.\n\n> \"put simply - the fastest and strongest recovery from any post-war recession, is being met with the feds easiest response on record - by a mile.\"\n\n# **Financial Stability**\n\nThe worst economic periods in the last century, have followed the bursting of asset bubbles. Think of the '30s after the '29 bubble, or the GFC after the housing bubble burst.\n\nWith a meme-coin (the doge) worth 60b and NFT's selling for millions of dollars, is there any doubt that we are in a bubble? Not to mention stock market to GDP is sitting well above any level we've seen in the last century.\n\nThen there is the concern of the potential loss of reserve currency status.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/otCICQ0CG9BLMKqfgl06D.png?height=380&width=676)\n\nUS treasuries have typically been the go-to assets for global portfolio managers for the better part of 20 years. They've been sought as a safe haven in so-called - 'risk off' periods. Look at the above diagram, after the GFC in '09.\n\nThe steep sell-off in 2020 should come as a surprise then. Foreigners have sold 1T worth of bonds following the initial stimulus of the CARES Act. Portfolio managers have been looking at Chinese assets, as they have done no QE, and had very little drop in their GDP.\n\nChina currently represents 20% of world GDP, but only 1.6% of global portfolios. The US represents 25% of world GDP, but 28% of portfolios.\n\n> For the first time in my career, I think that we will lose this reserve currency status and all the benefits that come with it - in the next 15 years. I've never said this before, I've never even thought it before, at present there is no alternative because of the lack of trust in the communist dictatorship in China, and the mess that Europe currently is. I don't know who going to replace us, but if I have to guess is the biggest threat is going to be a crypto-derived ledger system, invented by a group from an army of engineers leaving university.\n\nFollowing all this reasoning, Druckenmiller is short the dollar and long all sorts of commodities - copper, grain, oil. He says, \"If it moves, we're long it\".\n\n# **Investing Advice**\n\nNever ever think in the present - try to envisage what the world will look like 12-18 months ahead.\n\nWhat creates price movement? Change. Big change. With all the disruption happening in the world economy, if you look at the macro picture, this presents the most fruitful set of opportunities I've ever seen, in terms of the magnitude of change.\n\n# **Bitcoin**\n\nI think it will be a ledger system that requires a cryptocurrency to execute it, as the lion's share of great engineers from universities are moving into cryptocurrency. Millennials and more importantly, tech billionaires prefer Bitcoin to gold. BTC has been around 13-14 years now, it's a brand, and it's not going away. I wouldn't doubt that Bitcoin continues to move higher.\n\n# **On Inequality**\n\n\"I don't think there has been any greater engine of inequality than the federal reserve bank, of the last 11 years... I've just had the best year I've had in 15 years last year - everyone wealthy I know is making a fortune. And why are we making it - because this guy is printing money like there's no tomorrow. For the life of me, I can't figure out why the left is so excited about money printing.\n\nThe people that benefit from money printing are the rich people who know how to navigate that.\n\nThis thing, looking out 12-18 months, is going to take one of two paths. As you can tell by my portfolio I'm betting on inflation. When you grow the money supply by 25% for a year. It's just historically correct, and we have a whole generation who haven't seen it for 10-12 years - so they can't even deal with the concept. Chairman Powell, says we're not going to have inflation because it hasn't been persistent and it hasn't been around. But what the hell, we didn't have inflation between 55-70 for 15 years! If you went by that we couldn't have had inflation but then we had the 70s and guns and butter - and what I just showed you is about 5x guns and butter!\n\nI think the odds-on bet is we are going to have inflation - and inflation will hurt poor people much more than rich people.\"\n\nDruckenmiller makes solid arguments for his case that we will see inflation. Historically it fits, we're seeing enormous increases in asset prices that signal a bubble, and the money supply has been increased dramatically. It's a wonder why Chairman Powell is continuing with such an irresponsible response until you remember where most of the money is going - into assets. Inequality is increasing dramatically as those with assets get richer, and the poor get screwed by inflation.\n\nOf course, only time will tell. However, you can be sure that we will look back on this time as completely unprecedented in both the economic shock and the accompanying response.\n\n> I hope its not ever repeated. I don't know how it's going to end, but it's going to end badly. I just don't know when.", "timestamp": 1634092460, "digest": "wxu_k27h7qqmOjdd_AopNLjrb9ho0goq-VRIl3Y01A8", "contributor": "0x3c6f739fC6153446eC6Ca71bc483cAF1F59dC70a"}

News & Updates\n3. Shoutouts & Showcases\n4. Overheard in CityDAO\n5. DAO industry news\n6. Memes to go\n\n\n---\n\n### What is CityDAO?\n\nThe CityDAO community is made up of ambitious and HIGHLY curious people exploring and building at the frontier of technology, governance and physical land.\n\nThe vision of CityDAO is to build the city of the future on the Ethereum blockchain by tokenizing land, rights, and governance.\n\n## 🔈CityDAO so far\n\nFirst, let’s do a quick recap of the CityDAO adventure so far:\n\n**Month 1: July - laying the groundwork**\n\n* **July 1** - DAOs can legally be recognized as an LLC in Wyoming\n* **July 2** - CityDAO starts (Scott’s infamous tweet)\n* **July 7** - First community call\n* **July 15** - CityDAO Discord membership crosses 1000 people\n* **July 23** - CityDAO officially registered as an LLC in Wyoming\n* **July 28** - CityDAO gets voted in on Mirror’s $WRITE RACE\n\n**Month 2: August - bolstering the treasury**\n\n* **August 8** - The First Citizen NFT sells for 6.52 ETH\n* **August 11** - Release Founding Citizen NFTs\n* **August 12** - CityDAO treasury passes $30k\n* **August 20** - CityDAO treasury passes $100k\n* **August 25** - Founding Citizen NFT sells for 10 ETH live in a community call\n* **August 25** - CityDAO treasury passes $250k\n* **August 26** - Connect w/ real estate agent in Wyoming to help with land purchase\n\n**Month 3: September - voting on land acquisition**\n\n* **September 08** - CityDAO forum is added to aid governance discussions\n* **September 15** - Dev & Design team demo the parcel viewer\n* **September 21** - CityDAO citizens vote on first parcel purchase\n* **September 27** - Citizens vote to make offer on “Parcel 6” (40 acres)\n* **September 28** - CityDAO makes an offer on real land\n* **September 28** - Offer accepted, land purchase process begins\n\n### Live footage of CityDAO going from tweet to citizens voting on putting an offer on 40 acres of real Wyoming land…in 3 months 😂 :\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vKOY51NA2DwmZbQoll1rV.gif?height=400&width=480)\n\n\n---\n\n# 🔈News & Updates\n\n# 🗞 Annnnd our DAO has officially purchased land! 🎊\n\n![WAGMI vibes right here](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FmbW8L0eDN3hh_cUBjUlE.png?height=702&width=1043)\n\n![CityDAO flag going up on the land](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H-C4tGhmdYUCcJalTF-H5.png?height=1398&width=1054)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k2kW3fYZebFAqQJTUNbuz.png?height=197&width=375)\n\n### 🗞 OpenSea de-listed CityDAO\n\n[https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/1444365420388044806?s=20](https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/1444365420388044806?s=20)\n\n**What happened?**\n\nWe found out the NFTs were de-listed from new members asking why they couldn’t buy a Citizen NFT. We received no notification, e-mail or information at all from OpenSea as to what happened. We sent multiple support tickets, reached out in their Discord server, and finally got some answers after utilizing our collective networks to get a hold of someone there.\n\n**Why did they de-list the NFTs?**\n\nSince land tokenization is central to our DAO and these NFTs would give access to land drops they believe the NFTs went against their terms. They explained its because OpenSea doesn't allow listing real estate. Our NFTs are not real estate but they don’t want to support anything that could be related.\n\n[OpenSea experienced controversy](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58585342) in September with an insider trading situation. They are likely highly risk-averse right now.\n\n### 🗞 What’s next? Solution: create independent smart contract (in development)\n\n1. The new one will be ERC721 and 100% independent of any exchange. Minting will be done through our site.\n2. Once ready, previous NFTs can be exchanged 1:1 with the new ones at any time, and they have the same rights/value.\n\n### 🗞 When will Citizen NFTs be available again?\n\nTimeline TBD but we anticipate it being in the near-future. Please reach out if you have any questions or have experience in this space. We’ll post in #announcements once we have updates.\n\n### 🗞 Parcel Viewer - here’s a glimpse of the CityDAO parcel explorer! @Greg, @Bpetes, @odyslam and @scott have been on fire with this one 🔥\n\n> A web app to view & trade CityDAO land parcels\n\n[Here’s a link to a 45 second Loom for a better view](https://www.loom.com/share/a9adac738b2d4003a12ad3359e26f846).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/snbdoc4j5qWBAm4A4Kf5O.gif?height=270&width=480)\n\n### 🗞 So… Balaji’s call-to-action sounds fun.

Before moving out here I worked in city government as an urban planner and spent lots of time writing zoning ordinances and working with developers to help them navigate our development process.\n\nI've a background in architecture, urban design and GIS. Now I've been developing computer programming skills for automating the urban design process.\n\nyou put in an airport or helipad for Yellowstone and you're golden\n\nLand update: we put in an offer of 95k on Parcel 6! More updates will come for Citizens shortly as negotiations proceed\n\ntheir top execs are aware of it and should get back to us soon. Regardless, we are in parallel working on our own, independent way to buy and trade the citizen nfts.\n\nfeels like a historic moment, reading it now!\n\nHow do i get citizenship?\n\nQuit my AI day job to play full time in the Metaverse\n\nI’m based in NYC and spend most of my time thinking about the intersection of web3 x real assets. I’m also a governance geek interested in incentive networks that align community stakeholders and more equitably distribute value.\n\nThis is awesome. You guys have obviously been kicking ass. I've not been checking in and here you got your land already!\n\nI am experienced in Computer Vision and have recently been using Drones for mapping and training CV models to detect objects from the air.\n\nI cannot wait for property and realspace assets are on the blockchain.\n\nhave heard quite a lot of people discussing citydao lately and wanted to hop in and say hello\n\njust to discuss, casually, perhaps over dinner and not during official hours, about possibly changes in the land registration process\n\nHey all, I haven't been around for a couple months, but I wanted to say I'm blown away with all the progress that's been made!\n\nI've been doing some research into water rights in Wyoming. Here's a summary of the laws in a government memo, but it's from 2001 (and it looks like the source document could be even older)\n\nThis is one of the most interesting projects I've ever seen in crypto, not just in NFT. I'm waiting for the bar results right now, but if all goes well i'll be a cryptolawyer soon!\n\nbuying one parcel as a DAO is our first step, and allowing members to own a piece of that parcel. the city aspect comes as more people start building on the land and we deal with questions like what is allowed to be built and funding public goods.\n\nThe land is in Wyoming. It's very rural - 40 minutes north west of Cody, Wyoming\n\nout of curiosity, are they referring to this CityDAO or maybe they're just referring to CityDAOs in a general sense?\n\nCommunity Call happening now - we will go over the land parcels and DAO citizens will share the reasons they like or dislike each parcel. Will be a fun time, see ya soon!\n\nFormer commercial real estate finance underwriting pro (mostly CMBS type stuff, some CDOs) based in Brooklyn.\n\nuseless observation -- \"Kirschbaum\" (current owner?) means \"Cherry Tree\"\n\nI'd also say there's another layer of deeper questions being asked here beyond just streamlining ownership and revenue generation\n\nHey all, love what you’re doing. Awesome to see the beginnings of on chain land ownership.\n\nI am a commercial property developer from South Africa.\n\nInteresting documents on Well water quality and Disclosures from the broker today on Parcel 6\n\nExcited to give what I can to this community and hopefully build the future of cities with you all!\n\nI'm a software engineer, working on building 5G networks. Outside of that, I host The Urban Loop podcast where I talk to technologists and city leaders about building the Smart Cities of the future\n\nLast chance to vote on the land parcel!\n\nthey gave us no explanation, but it was shortly after i requested verification for the collection. i think its because our project is tokenizing real assets\n\nWhat's good citiziens of citydao, my friend just turned me on to this. Just came back from Wyoming on a massive 4,500 mile roadtrip\n\n## 🐦 Some recent tweets we love\n\n[https://twitter.com/CroissantEth/status/1443971953187069955?s=20](https://twitter.com/CroissantEth/status/1443971953187069955?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/nichanank/status/1438205060777865218?s=20](https://twitter.com/nichanank/status/1438205060777865218?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/anotherjohnbeck/status/1439325370742833152?s=20](https://twitter.com/anotherjohnbeck/status/1439325370742833152?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/gid3xn/status/1442249426668376066?s=20](https://twitter.com/gid3xn/status/1442249426668376066?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/spaghettiNFT/status/1443493722474221574?s=20](https://twitter.com/spaghettiNFT/status/1443493722474221574?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/BoredElonMusk/status/1446316443247595520?s=20](https://twitter.com/BoredElonMusk/status/1446316443247595520?s=20)\n\n\n---\n\n# ☕️ Resources shared in CityDAO\n\n[https://twitter.com/theindiedao/status/1445410822134501386?s=20](https://twitter.com/theindiedao/status/1445410822134501386?s=20)\n\n## 🎨 Meme to go\n\n**H/T to @Greg for this spicy meme 🌶**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g-6lBZ_pPFp_J5akUZtiw.png?height=992&width=898)\n\n**H/T to @Justin Kalland**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1mBD6wn2XjIHzlLImsu2X.png?height=500&width=750)\n\n### Past CityDAO Roundups\n\n[https://chance.ghost.io/citydao-community-roundup-vol-1-so-it-begins/](https://chance.ghost.io/citydao-community-roundup-vol-1-so-it-begins/)\n\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/jTi0-xQOMadDgvP_KgMOoHZaYvWJY6D7YK4bcdFz-f4](https://city.mirror.xyz/jTi0-xQOMadDgvP_KgMOoHZaYvWJY6D7YK4bcdFz-f4)\n\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/4t6MRC8re_vTuJiVqkKmJTPXBpurzwb1N3v8S6bSJJs](https://city.mirror.xyz/4t6MRC8re_vTuJiVqkKmJTPXBpurzwb1N3v8S6bSJJs)\n\n", "timestamp": 1634096410, "digest": "1HoGdPHJ4NBmLW_sEun299_QiZTl5WHQAZfa9G8J8NY", "contributor": "0x77aA943A365161e499eaFF59E936a799e6051e15"}

{"id": "_FIgGpYe31_sd6PjFGbMacL7fPvMeHzRBiUH9FRp-CY", "title": "Motherland", "body": "So many of us grow up as “others”. Questioning where we fit in, who our tribe is and how our identity meets the world. For me, this was the story of much of my life as a Japanese-New Zealander who was never Japanese enough to be Japanese, or white enough to be white. My teenage love of jazz, hip hop and drum’n’bass all stemmed from the same needs - these were music forms where I could find comfort and community through diving into albums created from artists’ own searches for belonging and identity: sonic offerings that decried the status quo and mainstream seeking something more. This premise has been my foundation as an artist - creating music that looks to answer my own inner questions and reflect the world I see, while knowing that emulating the status quo does little to help me understand my own past, present and future.\n\n**Motherland** is a 43-minute film, a meditative audio-visual exploration of my Japanese ancestry and culture. Presented as both a **super-NFT film** and **audio NFTs**, Motherland features my Japanese roots-inspired music through a solo performance, set to footage shot during an artist residency in Kaga, Japan, during Summer 2019. It’s a series of instrumental tone-poems and immersive audio-visual moments to let your imagination play.\n\nThe collector of the super-NFT Motherland film will also receive **additional content** and an **equity share in the entire collection’s revenue** (more about that below). As well as sharing the project to share my art, I’m excited to experiment with different ways to present, share and incentivize music in the web3 space.\n\n***\\* Due to file size, please allow up to two minutes for the film to buffer before it plays***\n\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=3750](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=3750)\n\n## The Film\n\nWe begin **Motherland** on the train ride to Kaga, and then on to an immersive journey of soundtracked sights following outdoor pathways to temples, rivers and lakes, accompanied by the sounds of nature and the eight compositions.\n\nThe footage of Japan featured in the film was shot in two locations - **Kakusenkei Gorge**, a beautiful forested valley with a river running between, and **Natadera Temple** - a Buddhist temple established in 714 AD with sprawling grounds, temple buildings and a distinct feeling of spiritual homeland. Along with the visuals, I’ve incorporated all the field-sound - the summer breeze rustling the trees, cicada song in the air, and the river’s running water. These create an integral connecting of the music with the visuals, and underpin the film with the sonic signature of nature.\n\nEach composition included in the film is introduced with *shodo* (traditional Japanese calligraphy) by visual artist **Kuniharu Yoshida**. The visual of the shodo and sight of Kuniharu’s hand in motion captures so much of the spirit of ancestry and roots which this project focuses on, and I’m grateful to have his contributions here.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AoIkXLj3xAHG5cTHi10qm.jpg?height=1348&width=2396)\n\n## The Music\n\n**Motherland** features eight instrumental compositions.

Where some of my work dives heavily into beat-culture and the dancefloor, Motherland is an introspective offering, leaning primarily on the sound of the piano and subtle use of electronics to tell the story.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vYH2K0udctxqI46gcBVIG.jpg?height=1324&width=2552)\n\n## The NFT Collection\n\nMotherland is a deeply personal project for me and it’s important to present it in a way that preserves this meaning.

But this was too apropos.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ATc74SF6DKZdOqZTbeUSO.png?height=111&width=1039)\n\nOne of the greatest gifts of the past year or so has been the amazing people I’ve met as a result of tumbling down the crypto and web3 rabbit hole.\n\nI ventured into the [Krause House](https://krausehouse.club/) [Discord](https://discord.gg/egMhTZZn) in June to experience a bit of the off-the-charts creative juju that I was hearing about via the crypto grapevine.\n\nWell, I found that incredible energy…but best of all, I also found [Flex Chapman](https://twitter.com/flexxchapman), co-founder of Krause House.\n\nI was so happy that Flex joined me last Friday on the vlog. He was super gracious with his time and our nearly one-hour jam session meandered through:\n\n▹ The importance of working a ritual of “pause and reflect” into one’s life. (Flex brought up a surprising analogy found in the world of software development!)\n\n▹ The best DAO onboarding experience I’ve had to date.\n\n▹ Flex’s re-discovery of the power of cohort-based activities.\n\n▹ Flex’s journey through the Seed Club accelerator (and how there may be no such thing as a blueprint or subject matter expert in crypto).\n\n▹ Why a broader conception of onboarding may be needed, embracing the entire DAO community and helping folks onramp to web3, DeFi, etc. (Krause House University, here we come!)\n\n▹ FWB pets, plants & home decor channels…folks have a million other places on the Web to talk about these things, but they **choose** to do so in the FWB Discord. What’s the secret sauce?\n\n▹ *Understand the user persona,* says Flex. There’s a wide array of people coming through a Discord with unique goals and interests. But…*We can’t solve for everyone, either.*\n\n▹ What does Flex think are the top psychological motivations that drive not just membership but deep commitment to a DAO? (h/t [Scott Mandel](https://scottmandel.medium.com/dedication-is-the-holy-grail-for-daos-13c7b8b98f22).)\n\n▹ How do you protect the vitality and creative energy of an org while setting up forms/ structures to support its growth?\n\n▹ The most powerful paradox:  passionately believing everything is broken while simultaneously, deeply surrendering and trusting in the process.  *Ask,* Flex says, *what could go right?*\n\n▹  Take those 1:1 calls with your fellows in the DAO!

In essence, the company allegedly knew for years that its algorithms were pointing users to content that was harmful in a variety of ways, but did nothing, because change would mean losing money.\\\n> （ここ数週間、フェイスブックは、報道機関や米国議会から、悪としか思えないような行為で非難されています。要するに、フェイスブックは何年も前から、自社のアルゴリズムがさまざまな意味で有害なコンテンツをユーザーに提供していることを知っていたにもかかわらず、変更すると損失が生じるため、何もしなかったとされています。）\n\n> If you’ve ever used your Facebook account to log into another service online, you’ve been helping the social network make your online experience more toxic, even if you’re not a user of Facebook.com itself. Or maybe you do much the same using Google or Apple identity services. All involve major trade-offs – like **possibly having your data shared with U.S. intelligence**.\\\n> （Facebookのアカウントを使って他のサービスにログインしたことがあれば、たとえFacebook.comのユーザーでなくても、ソーシャルネットワークがあなたのオンライン体験をより有害なものにする手助けをしていることになります。また、GoogleやAppleのIDサービスを使っても同様のことをしているかもしれない。**これらのサービスは、米国の情報機関とデータを共有する可能性がある**など、大きなトレードオフを伴います。）\n\n> It’s one of the core quandaries of today’s internet. While the ‘net’s inherent anonymity is definitely a good thing, **it leaves users of ID-reliant tools in thrall to major centralized identity providers and their seemingly inevitable abuses**. Blockchain developers have long talked about **developing “decentralized” identity standards** to save us from the dangers of Big Login, and at least one significant step towards that future appears imminent: **Sign-in With Ethereum** is coming.\\\n> （これは、今日のインターネットの核心的な問題の1つです。ネット特有の匿名性は確かに良いことだが、**IDに依存するツールのユーザーは、中央集権的な大手IDプロバイダーと、その避けられない悪用に翻弄される**ことになる。ブロックチェーンの開発者たちは、ビッグログインの危険性から私たちを救うために **「分散型」のID標準を開発**することを長い間話し合ってきましたが、その未来に向けた少なくとも1つの重要なステップが間近に迫っています。「**Sign-in With Ethereum**」の登場です。）\n\n> It’s just what it sounds like ++**a standard way to use an Ethereum wallet that you own as an identifier across multiple services**++. If your first thought is, “my name isn’t even attached to my ETH wallet,” that’s exactly the point: Using a cryptographic marker as an identity means the user, not the identity provider, has total control over what information is associated with it. Eventually, ++**you’ll be able to decide, for instance, whether a particular service needs your name, proof of your age, or a glimpse of your ETH balance. You won’t have to send all that information to every service you use**++.\\\n> （その名の通り、++**自分が所有するEthereumウォレットを複数のサービスの識別子として利用するための標準的な方法**++ です。「自分のETHウォレットには名前が付いていない」と思われるかもしれませんが、それこそが問題なのです。暗号化されたマーカーをIDとして使用するということは、どのような情報を関連付けるかをIDプロバイダーではなく、ユーザーが完全にコントロールすることを意味します。**++最終的には、特定のサービスが必要とする情報が、名前、年齢証明、ETHの残高のどれかであるかどうかを決めることができるようになる++** でしょう。そうなれば、利用するサービスごとに、すべての情報を送信する必要はなくなります。）\n\n<div class=\"h-parent\"><div class=\"h-left\">\n<img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hideaki-97c59.appspot.com/o/images%2FOBVPHREgE2OYIozIkScfYv6wAwd2%2FfsJvtEK2q.png?alt=media\">\n<div class=\"iconname\">ANE</div></div><div class=\"bparent-left\">\n<div class=\"body-left\" style=\"background: #88bfbf; color: #ffffff;\">\nミニマムの個人情報だけ提供すればいいと\n<div class=\"tri-left\" style=\"border-right: 12px solid #88bfbf;\"></div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n> The standard is being developed by ++**Spruce Systems**++, cofounded by former ConsenSys staffers, which won a recent development RFP from the Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum Name Service. The initial goals are modest (always a good sign, in my book).\\\n> （この規格は、Ethereum FoundationとEthereum Name Serviceから最近の開発RFPを獲得した、ConsenSysの元スタッフが共同で設立した ++**Spruce Systems**++ によって開発されています。当初の目標は控えめなものです（私に言わせれば、常に良い兆候です）。）\n\n> “We’re starting with not as serious, not as strong identity,” says Spruce co-founder and CEO Wayne Chang. “Because we want to be battle tested. In the short to medium term it’s more like social media credentials that tie their Twitter handles to a blockchain … We don’t want to provide [know your customer] credentials for buying millions of dollars of financial securities right yet,” though that’s a possibility down the road.\\\n> （Spruceの共同設立者兼CEOであるウェイン・チャンは、「私たちは、それほど真剣ではなく、それほど強いアイデンティティでもないところから始めています」と言います。「私たちは実戦的でありたいからです。短期的、中期的には、ツイッターのハンドルネームをブロックチェーンに結びつけるソーシャルメディアの認証のようなものです...今はまだ、何百万ドルもの金融証券を購入するための（顧客を知るための）認証を提供したいとは思っていません」と、将来的にはその可能性もあります。）\n\n> Applications for this initial iteration, according to Spruce, are more likely to include lower-security uses like gating content for non-fungible token (NFT) holders. But, eventually, by integrating secure off-chain storage, ++**Sign-in With Ethereum (let’s just call it SIWE) could also offer “strong” options such as government ID**++. Users will be able to control access to that data on a case-by-case basis and remove or disassociate it at will.\\\n> （Spruceによると、この初期段階のアプリケーションは、NFT（Non-Fungible Token）保有者にコンテンツを提供するなど、よりセキュリティの低い用途が考えられます。しかし ++**最終的には、安全なオフチェーン・ストレージを統合することで、Sign-in With Ethereum（SIWEと呼ぶことにします）は、政府のIDのような「強力な」オプションも提供**++ できるようになります。ユーザーは、そのデータへのアクセスをケースバイケースでコントロールし、自由に削除したり関連付けを解除したりすることができるようになります。）\n\n> One significant hurdle for SIWE is the inherent risk of reusing any identifier, particularly an address that can likely be pretty easily linked to wallets used for financial activity. While the idea of ++using multiple or disposable wallets as a security measure is familiar to crypto users, it’s probably a bridge too far for normies++, at least for now – one more reason SIWE is starting with baby steps.\\\n> （SIWEにとって大きなハードルとなるのは、あらゆる識別子を再利用することの固有のリスクです。特にアドレスは、金融活動に使用されるウォレットと容易に結びつく可能性があります。++セキュリティ対策として複数のウォレットを使用したり、使い捨てのウォレットを使用したりすることは、暗号ユーザーにとっては馴染みのあることですが、一般のユーザーにとっては、少なくとも今のところは橋を渡りすぎていると言えます++。）\n\n<div style=\"border-top: 1px dashed #8c8b8b;\"><span style=\"display:inline-block;position: relative;top: -14px;left: 40px;padding: 0 3px;color: #8c8b8b;font-size: 18px;\">&#x2702;</span></div>\n\n一般公開された社説はここで終わっています。\\\n続きはニュースレターの購読で読めるようです。\n\n# 大手が情報を持たない世界線\n\nもし、FacebookやGoogle、Appleといった巨大企業が、顧客の情報を持たない未来が来るとしたら、生活はどのように変わるでしょうか？\n\n<div class=\"h-parent\"><div class=\"h-left\">\n<img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hideaki-97c59.appspot.com/o/images%2FOBVPHREgE2OYIozIkScfYv6wAwd2%2FfsJvtEK2q.png?alt=media\">\n<div class=\"iconname\">ANE</div></div><div class=\"bparent-left\">\n<div class=\"body-left\" style=\"background: #88bfbf;

In essence, the company allegedly knew for years that its algorithms were pointing users to content that was harmful in a variety of ways, but did nothing, because change would mean losing money.（ここ数週間、フェイスブックは、報道機関や米国議会から、悪としか思えないような行為で非難されています。要するに、フェイスブックは何年も前から、自社のアルゴリズムがさまざまな意味で有害なコンテンツをユーザーに提供していることを知っていたにもかかわらず、変更すると損失が生じるため、何もしなかったとされています。）\n\n> If you’ve ever used your Facebook account to log into another service online, you’ve been helping the social network make your online experience more toxic, even if you’re not a user of Facebook.com itself. Or maybe you do much the same using Google or Apple identity services. All involve major trade-offs – like **possibly having your data shared with U.S. intelligence**.（Facebookのアカウントを使って他のサービスにログインしたことがあれば、たとえFacebook.comのユーザーでなくても、ソーシャルネットワークがあなたのオンライン体験をより有害なものにする手助けをしていることになります。また、GoogleやAppleのIDサービスを使っても同様のことをしているかもしれない。**これらのサービスは、米国の情報機関とデータを共有する可能性がある**など、大きなトレードオフを伴います。）\n\n> It’s one of the core quandaries of today’s internet. While the ‘net’s inherent anonymity is definitely a good thing, **it leaves users of ID-reliant tools in thrall to major centralized identity providers and their seemingly inevitable abuses**. Blockchain developers have long talked about **developing “decentralized” identity standards** to save us from the dangers of Big Login, and at least one significant step towards that future appears imminent: **Sign-in With Ethereum** is coming.（これは、今日のインターネットの核心的な問題の1つです。ネット特有の匿名性は確かに良いことだが、**IDに依存するツールのユーザーは、中央集権的な大手IDプロバイダーと、その避けられない悪用に翻弄される**ことになる。ブロックチェーンの開発者たちは、ビッグログインの危険性から私たちを救うために **「分散型」のID標準を開発**することを長い間話し合ってきましたが、その未来に向けた少なくとも1つの重要なステップが間近に迫っています。「**Sign-in With Ethereum**」の登場です。）\n\n> It’s just what it sounds like ++**a standard way to use an Ethereum wallet that you own as an identifier across multiple services**++. If your first thought is, “my name isn’t even attached to my ETH wallet,” that’s exactly the point: Using a cryptographic marker as an identity means the user, not the identity provider, has total control over what information is associated with it. Eventually, ++**you’ll be able to decide, for instance, whether a particular service needs your name, proof of your age, or a glimpse of your ETH balance. You won’t have to send all that information to every service you use**++.（その名の通り、++**自分が所有するEthereumウォレットを複数のサービスの識別子として利用するための標準的な方法**++ です。「自分のETHウォレットには名前が付いていない」と思われるかもしれませんが、それこそが問題なのです。暗号化されたマーカーをIDとして使用するということは、どのような情報を関連付けるかをIDプロバイダーではなく、ユーザーが完全にコントロールすることを意味します。**++最終的には、特定のサービスが必要とする情報が、名前、年齢証明、ETHの残高のどれかであるかどうかを決めることができるようになる++** でしょう。そうなれば、利用するサービスごとに、すべての情報を送信する必要はなくなります。）\n\n<div class=\"h-parent\"><div class=\"h-left\">\n<img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hideaki-97c59.appspot.com/o/images%2FOBVPHREgE2OYIozIkScfYv6wAwd2%2FfsJvtEK2q.png?alt=media\">\n<div class=\"iconname\">ANE</div></div><div class=\"bparent-left\">\n<div class=\"body-left\" style=\"background: #88bfbf; color: #ffffff;\">\nミニマムの個人情報だけ提供すればいいと\n<div class=\"tri-left\" style=\"border-right: 12px solid #88bfbf;\"></div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n> The standard is being developed by ++**Spruce Systems**++, cofounded by former ConsenSys staffers, which won a recent development RFP from the Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum Name Service. The initial goals are modest (always a good sign, in my book).（この規格は、Ethereum FoundationとEthereum Name Serviceから最近の開発RFPを獲得した、ConsenSysの元スタッフが共同で設立した ++**Spruce Systems**++ によって開発されています。当初の目標は控えめなものです（私に言わせれば、常に良い兆候です）。）\n\n> “We’re starting with not as serious, not as strong identity,” says Spruce co-founder and CEO Wayne Chang. “Because we want to be battle tested. In the short to medium term it’s more like social media credentials that tie their Twitter handles to a blockchain … We don’t want to provide \\[know your customer\\] credentials for buying millions of dollars of financial securities right yet,” though that’s a possibility down the road.（Spruceの共同設立者兼CEOであるウェイン・チャンは、「私たちは、それほど真剣ではなく、それほど強いアイデンティティでもないところから始めています」と言います。「私たちは実戦的でありたいからです。短期的、中期的には、ツイッターのハンドルネームをブロックチェーンに結びつけるソーシャルメディアの認証のようなものです...今はまだ、何百万ドルもの金融証券を購入するための（顧客を知るための）認証を提供したいとは思っていません」と、将来的にはその可能性もあります。）\n\n> Applications for this initial iteration, according to Spruce, are more likely to include lower-security uses like gating content for non-fungible token (NFT) holders. But, eventually, by integrating secure off-chain storage, ++**Sign-in With Ethereum (let’s just call it SIWE) could also offer “strong” options such as government ID**++. Users will be able to control access to that data on a case-by-case basis and remove or disassociate it at will.（Spruceによると、この初期段階のアプリケーションは、NFT（Non-Fungible Token）保有者にコンテンツを提供するなど、よりセキュリティの低い用途が考えられます。しかし ++**最終的には、安全なオフチェーン・ストレージを統合することで、Sign-in With Ethereum（SIWEと呼ぶことにします）は、政府のIDのような「強力な」オプションも提供**++ できるようになります。ユーザーは、そのデータへのアクセスをケースバイケースでコントロールし、自由に削除したり関連付けを解除したりすることができるようになります。）\n\n> One significant hurdle for SIWE is the inherent risk of reusing any identifier, particularly an address that can likely be pretty easily linked to wallets used for financial activity. While the idea of ++using multiple or disposable wallets as a security measure is familiar to crypto users, it’s probably a bridge too far for normies++, at least for now – one more reason SIWE is starting with baby steps.（SIWEにとって大きなハードルとなるのは、あらゆる識別子を再利用することの固有のリスクです。特にアドレスは、金融活動に使用されるウォレットと容易に結びつく可能性があります。++セキュリティ対策として複数のウォレットを使用したり、使い捨てのウォレットを使用したりすることは、暗号ユーザーにとっては馴染みのあることですが、一般のユーザーにとっては、少なくとも今のところは橋を渡りすぎていると言えます++。）\n\n<div style=\"border-top: 1px dashed #8c8b8b;\"><span style=\"display:inline-block;position: relative;top: -14px;left: 40px;padding: 0 3px;color: #8c8b8b;font-size: 18px;\">✂</span></div>\n\n一般公開された社説はここで終わっています。続きはニュースレターの購読で読めるようです。\n\n# 大手が情報を持たない世界線\n\nもし、FacebookやGoogle、Appleといった巨大企業が、顧客の情報を持たない未来が来るとしたら、生活はどのように変わるでしょうか？\n\n<div class=\"h-parent\"><div class=\"h-left\">\n<img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hideaki-97c59.appspot.com/o/images%2FOBVPHREgE2OYIozIkScfYv6wAwd2%2FfsJvtEK2q.png?alt=media\">\n<div class=\"iconname\">ANE</div></div><div class=\"bparent-left\">\n<div class=\"body-left\" style=\"background: #88bfbf;

As ‘The Godfather’ soundtrack played, the Toadz came a sweeping!\n\nBelow is the work of @diamondhandz707 based on the collective musings and ramblings of the #grailed channel in the 10ktf discord, if this is new to you go to 10ktf.com and follow the link to the discord.\n\n![BOSS_TOADZ a sweepin'](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EnMorOSeoVnaNydqegM47.jpg?height=600&width=600)\n\nDaily Update 10/12 - Here is the recap we have worked out in the ✨︱grailed︱検証済み channel from today’s 10/12 posts. If your holding 10ktf and haven't verified yet, please do that and join us in the chat. This is derived from our community chat in ✨︱grailed︱検証済み and has not been confirmed by 10ktf at this time. To join the grailed chat, if you’re holding 10ktf (bag or shoes), please go to verify and join us over there for more in depth conversations and theory work. I went through the daily chat and summarized the following information. Feel free to add or suggest edits. Thanks Frens!\n\nFloor Update - 10ktfshop as of 11:59PM EST- .186 10ktfstockroom as of 11:59PM EST- .03\n\nBOSS_TOADZ is Sweeping!!! Delist everything and refresh metadata for bags & shoes on OpenSea.\n\nRoadmap is unique on this project. It’s a game that we will eventually enter the metaverse to continue playing (headed to level 2 of 6 now frens) - ShopSweeper “I always liked to take the roadmap less traveled” expect unique things along the journey that we have not seen in other projects. If this is just the rollout out of the project, imagine what this looks like moving forth and the team involved at Wenew. Diamond Hands Y'all!\n\nWagmi Dance Party Thursday (Airdrops!?) - I think the party started at 7PM PST and airdrop coming at 10PM PST last week. No promises that will be the same but it's the Beeple NFTaversery - (1 year since beeple found out about NFT's)\n\nMetaverse - We are learning there are different districts of New Tokyo. We think think we will meet and craft things there. Possible tokens/physicals = there could be a potential new nft marketplace connected to the metaverse.\n\n   BOSS_TOADZ has started sweeping this means the 10ktf team is sweeping the floor, this is bullish for this project - we have speculated they will burn these materials. What you let go of you will likely never get back. If you believe in this honorable project, your frens here in the discord and the amazing 10ktfteam behind Wagmi (Wenew moments), delist and strap in, rockets about to take off if ya get what I mean. His wallet is here - <https://opensea.io/BOSS_TOADZ>\n\nBOSS_TOADZ said they would take the materials and they did just that. We do not think they are done yet. They only got bags and limited materials today we think they will come back for more.\n\nWe have many items still listed OpenSea. Frens of wagmi’s delist their materials so the toadz don’t hurt Wagmi. We need to protect our fren y’all!\n\nThe rocket ship is taking off. Grab what you can if you can and we’ll see you back at the discord! Be well and stay vigilant frens!\n\nGenesis materials (Bags & Shoes) here - <https://opensea.io/collection/10ktf?collectionSlug=10ktf&search\\[sortAscending\\]=true&search\\[sortBy\\]=PRICE>)   Crafting materials (to be used in future levels of the game) are here. Some of these are reusable but not unlimited tools (Tape, Scissors & Thimbles) and the rest are minimal use materials. Crafting Tools & Materials here - <https://opensea.io/collection/10ktf-stockroom>   We think Genesis is the best to have & to hold long-term but tools and materials will be important to crafting and building when the time comes to do so in future levels. Materials are way undervalued right now and will most likely help when shit hits the fan (future levels).  \n\nAlso 10ktf Stockroom got the check, LFG!!! Only a matter of time before the shop gets verified and more folks find out about the gold we’re sitting on frens…. WAGMI!   As always feel free to add in or comment below.

In essence, the company allegedly knew for years that its algorithms were pointing users to content that was harmful in a variety of ways, but did nothing, because change would mean losing money.（ここ数週間、フェイスブックは、報道機関や米国議会から、悪としか思えないような行為で非難されています。要するに、フェイスブックは何年も前から、自社のアルゴリズムがさまざまな意味で有害なコンテンツをユーザーに提供していることを知っていたにもかかわらず、変更すると損失が生じるため、何もしなかったとされています。）\n\n> If you’ve ever used your Facebook account to log into another service online, you’ve been helping the social network make your online experience more toxic, even if you’re not a user of Facebook.com itself. Or maybe you do much the same using Google or Apple identity services. All involve major trade-offs – like **possibly having your data shared with U.S. intelligence**.（Facebookのアカウントを使って他のサービスにログインしたことがあれば、たとえFacebook.comのユーザーでなくても、ソーシャルネットワークがあなたのオンライン体験をより有害なものにする手助けをしていることになります。また、GoogleやAppleのIDサービスを使っても同様のことをしているかもしれない。**これらのサービスは、米国の情報機関とデータを共有する可能性がある**など、大きなトレードオフを伴います。）\n\n> It’s one of the core quandaries of today’s internet. While the ‘net’s inherent anonymity is definitely a good thing, **it leaves users of ID-reliant tools in thrall to major centralized identity providers and their seemingly inevitable abuses**. Blockchain developers have long talked about **developing “decentralized” identity standards** to save us from the dangers of Big Login, and at least one significant step towards that future appears imminent: **Sign-in With Ethereum** is coming.（これは、今日のインターネットの核心的な問題の1つです。ネット特有の匿名性は確かに良いことだが、**IDに依存するツールのユーザーは、中央集権的な大手IDプロバイダーと、その避けられない悪用に翻弄される**ことになる。ブロックチェーンの開発者たちは、ビッグログインの危険性から私たちを救うために **「分散型」のID標準を開発**することを長い間話し合ってきましたが、その未来に向けた少なくとも1つの重要なステップが間近に迫っています。「**Sign-in With Ethereum**」の登場です。）\n\n> It’s just what it sounds like ++**a standard way to use an Ethereum wallet that you own as an identifier across multiple services**++. If your first thought is, “my name isn’t even attached to my ETH wallet,” that’s exactly the point: Using a cryptographic marker as an identity means the user, not the identity provider, has total control over what information is associated with it. Eventually, ++**you’ll be able to decide, for instance, whether a particular service needs your name, proof of your age, or a glimpse of your ETH balance. You won’t have to send all that information to every service you use**++.（その名の通り、++**自分が所有するEthereumウォレットを複数のサービスの識別子として利用するための標準的な方法**++ です。「自分のETHウォレットには名前が付いていない」と思われるかもしれませんが、それこそが問題なのです。暗号化されたマーカーをIDとして使用するということは、どのような情報を関連付けるかをIDプロバイダーではなく、ユーザーが完全にコントロールすることを意味します。**++最終的には、特定のサービスが必要とする情報が、名前、年齢証明、ETHの残高のどれかであるかどうかを決めることができるようになる++** でしょう。そうなれば、利用するサービスごとに、すべての情報を送信する必要はなくなります。）\n\n<div class=\"h-parent\"><div class=\"h-left\">\n<img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hideaki-97c59.appspot.com/o/images%2FOBVPHREgE2OYIozIkScfYv6wAwd2%2FfsJvtEK2q.png?alt=media\">\n<div class=\"iconname\">ANE</div></div><div class=\"bparent-left\">\n<div class=\"body-left\" style=\"background: #88bfbf; color: #ffffff;\">\nミニマムの個人情報だけ提供すればいいと\n<div class=\"tri-left\" style=\"border-right: 12px solid #88bfbf;\"></div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n> The standard is being developed by ++**Spruce Systems**++, cofounded by former ConsenSys staffers, which won a recent development RFP from the Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum Name Service. The initial goals are modest (always a good sign, in my book).（この規格は、Ethereum FoundationとEthereum Name Serviceから最近の開発RFPを獲得した、ConsenSysの元スタッフが共同で設立した ++**Spruce Systems**++ によって開発されています。当初の目標は控えめなものです（私に言わせれば、常に良い兆候です）。）\n\n> “We’re starting with not as serious, not as strong identity,” says Spruce co-founder and CEO Wayne Chang. “Because we want to be battle tested. In the short to medium term it’s more like social media credentials that tie their Twitter handles to a blockchain … We don’t want to provide \\[know your customer\\] credentials for buying millions of dollars of financial securities right yet,” though that’s a possibility down the road.（Spruceの共同設立者兼CEOであるウェイン・チャンは、「私たちは、それほど真剣ではなく、それほど強いアイデンティティでもないところから始めています」と言います。「私たちは実戦的でありたいからです。短期的、中期的には、ツイッターのハンドルネームをブロックチェーンに結びつけるソーシャルメディアの認証のようなものです...今はまだ、何百万ドルもの金融証券を購入するための（顧客を知るための）認証を提供したいとは思っていません」と、将来的にはその可能性もあります。）\n\n> Applications for this initial iteration, according to Spruce, are more likely to include lower-security uses like gating content for non-fungible token (NFT) holders. But, eventually, by integrating secure off-chain storage, ++**Sign-in With Ethereum (let’s just call it SIWE) could also offer “strong” options such as government ID**++. Users will be able to control access to that data on a case-by-case basis and remove or disassociate it at will.（Spruceによると、この初期段階のアプリケーションは、NFT（Non-Fungible Token）保有者にコンテンツを提供するなど、よりセキュリティの低い用途が考えられます。しかし ++**最終的には、安全なオフチェーン・ストレージを統合することで、Sign-in With Ethereum（SIWEと呼ぶことにします）は、政府のIDのような「強力な」オプションも提供**++ できるようになります。ユーザーは、そのデータへのアクセスをケースバイケースでコントロールし、自由に削除したり関連付けを解除したりすることができるようになります。）\n\n> One significant hurdle for SIWE is the inherent risk of reusing any identifier, particularly an address that can likely be pretty easily linked to wallets used for financial activity. While the idea of ++using multiple or disposable wallets as a security measure is familiar to crypto users, it’s probably a bridge too far for normies++, at least for now – one more reason SIWE is starting with baby steps.（SIWEにとって大きなハードルとなるのは、あらゆる識別子を再利用することの固有のリスクです。特にアドレスは、金融活動に使用されるウォレットと容易に結びつく可能性があります。++セキュリティ対策として複数のウォレットを使用したり、使い捨てのウォレットを使用したりすることは、暗号ユーザーにとっては馴染みのあることですが、一般のユーザーにとっては、少なくとも今のところは橋を渡りすぎていると言えます++。）\n\n<div style=\"border-top: 1px dashed #8c8b8b;\"><span style=\"display:inline-block;position: relative;top: -14px;left: 40px;padding: 0 3px;color: #8c8b8b;font-size: 18px;\">✂</span></div>\n\n一般公開された社説はここで終わっています。続きはニュースレターの購読で読めるようです。\n\n# 大手が情報を持たない世界線\n\nもし、FacebookやGoogle、Appleといった巨大企業が、顧客の情報を持たない未来が来るとしたら、生活はどのように変わるでしょうか？\n\n<div class=\"h-parent\"><div class=\"h-left\">\n<img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hideaki-97c59.appspot.com/o/images%2FOBVPHREgE2OYIozIkScfYv6wAwd2%2FfsJvtEK2q.png?alt=media\">\n<div class=\"iconname\">ANE</div></div><div class=\"bparent-left\">\n<div class=\"body-left\" style=\"background: #88bfbf;
