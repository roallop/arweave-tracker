Once you‚Äôre ready to dip your toes in and don‚Äôt know where to begin, let this guide help you get started.\n\nThe world of crypto is very much a work in progress. It‚Äôs exciting because people are building in realtime, right in the open, with new projects launching weekly. There are a ton of different ways to get involved, and I believe that the [Ethereum](https://preethikasireddy.medium.com/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway-22d1df506369) network is presently one of the most engaging spaces to immerse yourself in. Most of the hype projects you see trending on Twitter are being built within the Ethereum ecosystem. Though there are endless entry points, the path this guide outlines is a good place to start.\n\nThis guide will walk you through how to:\n\n1. Buy your very first cryptocurrency\n2. Set up a [wallet](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/ethereum-wallets-a-beginners-guide-to-storing-eth)\n3. Send cryptocurrency (ETH) to your wallet\n4. Prosper\n\nSome notes:\n\n1. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE! Following the steps in this guide requires you to use your own money. It is absolutely possible that you may lose that money. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose.\n2. The [fiat currency](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/fiat-currency/) I will be focusing on is USD, but you could easily translate it to the fiat currency of your respective country.\n\n### A Very Quick Primer Because There is a Lot\n\nüí´ If your only exposure to crypto up until this point has been Bitcoin, it‚Äôs important to know that there is a [difference](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/ethereum-vs-bitcoin-blockchain-differences#section-differences-between-bitcoin-and-ethereum) between it and Ethereum. Bitcoin is currently¬† \\*just\\* a currency whereas Ethereum is a system that includes its own currency, the ability to create applications using the system, and a vibrant developer ecosystem.\n\nüí´ You may have heard that crypto is decentralized, but what does that mean? [Decentralization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralizedmarket.asp) is interesting because it‚Äôs a way for money to exist online, detached from a single, central institution like a government or a traditional financial institution. It means that you could be in control of your money, with no middlemen, and the value would be determined by the people who own the same currency. Right now, all of our USD is government-backed, so its value is determined by the US economy. Not that we have much control over how any types of markets move, but a lot of people feel bad about the value of their money being tied to (and so, controlled) by the government of the country they happen to live in. Borders are stupid! Also, your money in the bank is not actually there for you whenever you want it because banks use your money to make themselves money. If something happens to the bank, it is not guaranteed that you will get your money back. The list goes on and on!\n\nüí´ You may have seen the words [DeFi](https://future.a16z.com/cryptos-fourth-wave-defi-poised-for-breakthrough/) and [web3](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-web-3) floating around. Both concepts point to the idea of building new, decentralized systems for both financial structures and [the internet](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-for-the-decentralized-web/). The backbone of these decentralized systems will be blockchain networks, like Ethereum. In order to participate in most of the popular projects within the DeFi space right now, you will need to leverage Ethereum‚Äôs currency, Ether (ETH). ETH is, under the hood, used for computing transactions and transaction fees. On its surface, ETH is money that you can send, receive, use to pay for things, lose!, etc.\n\nüí´ Coinbase, Gemini, and Robinhood are [exchanges](http://www.differencebetween.net/business/investment-business/difference-between-cryptocurrency-wallet-vs-exchange/), not wallets. \\\\n (Coinbase does have a separate wallet app called Coinbase Wallet, which is confusing. It‚Äôs not super fleshed out yet and there are better wallets out there so don‚Äôt worry about it for now.)\n\nüí´ All crypto is very volatile and will probably continue to be for a long time. Values of [coins](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-the-difference-between-coins-and-tokens)/[tokens](https://future.a16z.com/a-taxonomy-of-tokens-distinctions-with-a-difference/)/currencies can fluctuate in the hundreds and thousands on a daily basis. Like with any monetary investment, there will inevitably be ups and downs, so if you‚Äôre risk averse then this may not be for you.\n\nüí´ In order to participate in most of crypto, especially in the FOMO-inducing projects and communities that you see everyone tweeting about (like investing in expensive NFTs, for example), you have to shell out some money. Crypto today is pay-to-play. This unfortunate, high (monetary) barrier to entry is definitely problematic.\n\nüí´ Community building is an important aspect of crypto. Twitter, Discord, and Telegram seem to be the main social apps of choice for people involved.\n\n### Getting Set Up\n\n#### Step 1: Trade US Dollars for ETH\n\nBecause the cool crypto projects at the moment are pay-to-play, you need some cryptocurrency to get started. There are several different ways to purchase crypto, but the easiest would be to use a crypto exchange like Coinbase or Gemini. Oftentimes when you travel to a foreign country, you need to exchange USD for that country‚Äôs currency so that you can pay for things in that country‚Äôs economic ecosystem. The concept is the same when you trade USD for crypto through Coinbase or Gemini (or any [fiat onramp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fiat-on-ramp)).\n\nYou‚Äôll have to link your bank account or debit card to trade funds. The user flows are pretty straight forward: you select the currency you‚Äôre interested in purchasing > press Trade > press Buy > continue on with your swap. I recommend buying ETH since it will unlock the doors to most DeFi projects and will give you access to ETH wallets. FYI, there will be an annoying exchange/transaction fee if you use Coinbase or Gemini.\n\n**CONGRATULATIONS! You now own your very first crypto!!!**\n\nImportant things to know at this step:\n\n1. Despite transaction fees, I‚Äôd suggest starting small while you‚Äôre learning. Do not throw in more than you can afford to lose while you are in your learning phase.\n2. The crypto you buy is living on the exchange itself. Think about how when someone pays you on Venmo, it sits in your Venmo balance (so within the Venmo platform) until you withdraw your funds. The same notion applies here. At step 3, you will be withdrawing the crypto to your own wallet.\n3. You can actually have/buy no ETH and still create a wallet. You won‚Äôt be able to do much without ETH since you need to pay for gas fees (I will cover what that is later) per transaction, but people/projects can send things to your wallet and you can participate in *some* free projects.\n\n#### Step 2: Set up a wallet\n\nIRL, your wallet generally consists of some cash, some credit cards, a debit card, some random rewards cards you picked up at the movie theater and boba shop, and your drivers license (ID). An Ethereum wallet is similar in concept. Your wallet address stores your identification, and instead of having to create unique accounts on all Ethereum apps, you use your one wallet address to identify yourself everywhere. You also use your wallet address to pay for things, or collect rewards. Using most wallets, you can send and receive Ethereum objects (ETH, tokens, coins, NFTs, etc), perform transactions (like buy, sell, and trade things), log into platforms, and interact with different projects.\n\nIf I‚Äôm being honest, at the moment, most wallets leave a lot to be desired, and the user experience of using, connecting, and transacting with most wallets is rough. For the purposes of this guide I will help you get set up with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) as that‚Äôs my current wallet of choice. MetaMask is very popular in the industry and supported by almost every DeFi app. The UX can be tricky, and I would encourage you to move slowly and read everything before confirming anything while using it.\n\nVisit the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) website and download the MetaMask Chrome extension. There is also a MetaMask mobile app, but I prefer and recommend starting with the Chrome extension for ease of use. Once installed, go through the flow of creating your wallet address.\n\n**\\*\\*IMPORTANT\\*\\*** You will be given a secret recovery phrase. This is completely different from a regular password, it is the master key to your vault, and there is no way to recover it if you lose it. MAKE SURE YOU SAVE IT. Store it somewhere SAFE that could not be easily hackable - ideally not on a computer at all. Don‚Äôt email it to yourself. Don‚Äôt text it to yourself on your ‚Äúend-to-end encrypted‚Äù messaging app. Don‚Äôt send it to your friend. If you somehow forget your wallet password or download a new instance of MetaMask on a new device, you will be prompted to input your secret recovery phrase to access your wallet. If you no longer have your secret recovery phrase, you will not be able to access your wallet. This phrase is all anyone needs to fully control your wallet, with no ability to stop them. I cannot stress enough how important it is to SAVE this and to never share it with anyone. This can be scary at first (and I have learned the hard way), but it‚Äôs what allows you to have full control of your money.¬† **\\*\\*IMPORTANT\\*\\***\n\nAfter you save your secret recovery phrase in a super secret and safe place (AGAIN, DO NOT SKIP THIS), you‚Äôll create a wallet password, and then voila! You have your first wallet set up! Your wallet address will look like some wacky, long jumble of letters and numbers, most likely starting with ‚Äú0x‚Äù. That‚Äôs your address, your identity! Welcome to \\~the metaverse\\~\n\nAt this point it‚Äôs important to understand that you alone are fully accountable for your wallet. What separates crypto from traditional finance and banking is that there is no bank or entity that is responsible for your wallet, only you. That means if you lose your secret recovery phrase, or you get scammed/hacked, there is no support person to call to help you retrieve your information, there is no insurance company to call to claim your lost money. I know I sound like a broken record, but again: only put in as much money as you‚Äôre ok with possibly losing.\n\n#### Step 3: Withdrawing your ETH from your crypto exchange to your wallet\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the ETH you own is hanging out in the place that you exchanged it, and you need to move it to your personal wallet.\n\n*Note: you can only send ETH to your ETH wallet (in this case, MetaMask). If in step 1 you chose to buy another currency like Bitcoin or Litecoin, you will have to convert it to ETH first.*\n\nHead back to the crypto exchange you bought ETH with at step 1. You‚Äôll want to select the option to ‚ÄúWithdraw‚Äù and then input the amount of ETH you want to withdraw to your wallet. The exchange will then prompt you for the address you want to send that crypto to. Remember the long wallet address you created on MetaMask that started with ‚Äú0x‚Äù? That‚Äôs what you input. That is YOUR wallet address, where you will send your crypto. You will then have to confirm your transaction, and within moments, your crypto wallet will be ready to go!\n\n*Additional note: sometimes there are very long wait times when transferring ETH from exchange to wallet. Like longer than 1-5 minutes. This is scary and confusing as we are used to instantaneous feedback from software, especially when dealing with money. Sometimes folks accidentally end up buying more ETH because they think their transactions didn‚Äôt go through. I‚Äôd say that with all transactions, you should err on the side of waiting for a while instead of trying to move fast.*\n\n### Another Very Quick Primer Because You Will Encounter New Confusing Things\n\nüí´ GAS FEES, BABY! The bane of transacting on Ethereum today! NGL, when I was first getting started, I thought people were referring to actual, IRL gasoline whenever they talked about gas fees. [Gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) *actually* refer to Ethereum network transaction fees. They are payments to compensate for the computational energy used to process and validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. You will inevitably encounter ‚Äúgas fees‚Äù as you use your MetaMask wallet, and the fees will often be ridiculously high (in the several hundreds), fluctuating rapidly when there is high usage or activity on Ethereum‚Äôs network. You will be paying gas fees every time you perform a transaction, including when you buy ETH. Even projects that are free to participate in (like [Loot](https://decrypt.co/80108/what-is-loot-ethereum-nft-role-playing-phenonemon) being free to mint) will still require gas fees to mint. This is changing and being fixed soon, and that‚Äôs a whole different thing to get into, but just know that high gas fees are another painful barrier to entry for everyone right now.\n\nüí´ There are scams galore!!!! The team at [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) (another cool mobile wallet to try out when you feel comfortable) wrote these great guides for [How to Avoid Crypto Scams](https://rainbow.me/learn/rainbows-guide-to-avoiding-crypto-scams) and [How to Protect Your Ethereum Wallet](https://rainbow.me/learn/rainbows-guide-to-protecting-your-ethereum-wallet) and I highly recommend reading both before you start doing anything with your wallet.\n\n### Getting the Party Started\n\nThere are so many things you can do now that you have some ETH in your wallet! A route that many people first take is getting involved with lending, trading, and other (confusing) financial transactions. In an effort to keep this as beginner as possible, here are some less financially motivated things you can try:\n\n#### You can create a .eth wallet address!\n\nThese are [ENS domains](https://ens.domains/). They translate your wallet address (that long, jumbled string that begins with ‚Äú0x‚Äù) to something human-memorable. A common practice is to get yourname.eth, or randomword.eth. With an ENS domain, you can easily link your ENS in places that require you to input your wallet address without having to go back to your wallet to copy the long address string.\n\n#### You can buy your first NFT!\n\n[NFTs](https://future.a16z.com/podcasts/nfts-explainer-innovation-crypto-creator-economy/) are huge drivers of hype (and cashflow) in the system at the moment. If you‚Äôve finally moved past the ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs just a jpeg‚Äù phase of your crypto journey, why not invest in some digital art? Popular NFT platforms include [Foundation](https://foundation.app/), [Zora](https://zora.co/), and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Support your favorite artists!\n\n#### You can participate in the $WRITE race on Mirror!\n\n[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) is one project that you don‚Äôt have to spend any money to get involved with, and it‚Äôs what this blog is built on! Think Substack but on the blockchain. You‚Äôll have to win an upvoting contest ($WRITE race) to receive the ability to create your Mirror publication (which could take some time and some heavy PR), but the community, the writing, and the features on Mirror are very inspiring and worth the effort!\n\n### ---\n\nMy hope in writing this guide was to make crypto feel more accessible and approachable! Hopefully this helped you get set up and started with your crypto journey.

Most DAOs use a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet to manage their treasury, and Zodiac transforms that wallet into a *platform for powering DAOs* of all shapes, sizes, and goals. DeFi DAOs, investment DAOs, social DAOs, etc all have very different needs so a configurable toolbox makes sense vs. a single product.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n[https://blog.nftx.io/introducing-our-decentralized-nft-marketplace/](https://blog.nftx.io/introducing-our-decentralized-nft-marketplace/)\n\n**ü§î   Why it Matters**\n\n> NFTs have gone mainstream and many startups are battling for a share of the transaction activity with Open Sea being the largest ([potentially vulnerable](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/15/opensea-insider-trading-rumors-are-true.html)) player.

Take, for instance, the stories we tell ourselves about the stars. The characters that accompany the constellations, like the Great Bear, the Bull, or the Seven Sisters, appear to pass singularly from one generation to the next. However, upon closer inspection, these myths are not monolithic; they culturally transform in their telling. Even more, these myths are not merely stories, they are also design systems supported by artefacts like glyphs, charts, and cards that carry their resemblance through time.\n\n![They are relational, rather than grand, narratives. Image: Final Fantasy Tactics by jekoln, 2009, https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197339-final-fantasy-tactics/map/6667-zodiac-compatibility-chart/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/806e7ed0-0a8e-4184-bdcb-cac808f3a7e5.png?height=780&width=1075)\n\nIn a sense, the artefacts that accompany constellations can be viewed as collections of tools to pass on their memory, which are consistently reincorporated into new settings, like in the Final Fantasy Tactics example above. The key to their success perhaps lies in their composable ‚Äúopen source‚Äù plurality. In this light, if DAOs aim to be networks in which ‚Äúcollective memory freely circulates‚Äù, their tooling can learn from stories like the constellations that survive millennia ([1](https://blog.curvelabs.eu/ownership-in-cryptonetworks-96f13f4a113e)).\n\n## Unveiling Zodiac\n\nAfter 2016, *The DAO* gave rise to many decentralized governance platforms, each offering its own protocol for making decisions. In 2021, the ecosystem flourishes with hundreds of DAOs combining platforms, protocols, and tools. However, threads connecting this plug-and-play approach lacked an open standard until now. In our last post, we offered [a prehistory of DAOs](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q), but now we‚Äôll share one of their futures.\n\nA composable design philosophy for DAOs, Zodiac is a collection of tools built according to an open standard. The Zodiac open standard enables DAOs to act more like constellations, connecting platforms, protocols, and chains, no longer confined to monolithic designs.\n\nIn other words: **Zodiac is the expansion pack for DAOs**.\n\n![Compose your myth.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7975a8e9-3e66-4eb9-bee9-d7822c05e064.png?height=1500&width=3000&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nZodiac launches today with four tools available through the **Zodiac App** on [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/). These are ***Exit, Bridge, and*** ***Delay***, which join ***Reality*** (formerly SafeSnap) in the Zodiac collection of tools.\n\nEach adheres to the Zodiac open standard consisting of Avatars, Modules, Modifiers, and Guards. The current Zodiac compliant collection of tools, soon to all be available through the Zodiac App, fully encompass:\n\n### Avatars\n\n* **[Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/)**: The most trusted platform for managing digital assets on Ethereum. Zodiac embraces Gnosis Safe as a powerful, extensible and programmable account standard. However, all Zodiac tools are framework agnostic, and they can be plugged into any programmable account that implements the [IAvatar](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac/blob/master/contracts/interfaces/IAvatar.sol) interface.\n\n### Modules\n\n* ***[Reality](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-reality/get-started)*** (formerly SafeSnap): This module allows on-chain execution based on the outcome of events reported by the [Reality.eth](https://reality.eth.link/) oracle. While built initially to execute Gnosis Safe transactions according to Snapshot proposals, this module is framework agnostic. It can enable proposal execution from just about anywhere. For example, it can bring Discord polls on-chain.\n* ***[Bridge](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-bridge/get-started)***: This module allows an address on one chain to control an avatar on another chain using an Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB). This enables a DAO on one chain to control assets and interact with systems like a Gnosis Safe on a different chain.\n* ***[Exit](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-exit/get-started)***: This module allows participants to redeem a designated token for a proportional share of an avatar's digital assets, similar to Moloch DAO's [rageQuit()](https://twitter.com/molochdao/status/1115451404242436098) function.\n* ***[Safe Minion](https://daohaus.substack.com/p/6991f40b-3931-47ff-bea3-fa6f9c365135)*** (developed by [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/)): This module allows Moloch DAOs to manage a Gnosis Safe‚Äôs digital assets based on the outcome of v2 Moloch DAO proposals. Safe Minion enables Moloch DAOs to control collections of NFTs, manage LP positions with AMMs, and initiate any other arbitrary interactions. Even more, it supports DAOs that begin as a Gnosis Safe to later delegate governance to a Moloch DAO.\n* ***[Seele](https://github.com/TokenWalk/Seele)*** (developed by [TokenWalk](https://www.tokenwalk.org/)): This module allows avatars to operate with trustless tokenized DeGov, similar to Compound or Gitcoin, with a time-boxed proposal core that can register swappable voting contracts. This enables DAOs to choose from various on-chain voting methods that best suit their needs.\n\n### Modifiers\n\n* ***[Delay](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-modifier-delay/get-started)***: This modifier allows avatars to enforce a time delay between when a module initiates a transaction and when it can be executed by an avatar.\n\n### Guards\n\n* ***[Scope](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-guard-scope)*:** This guard allows an avatar or module to limit the scope of the functions with which it can interact. This enables a DAO to define granular permissions for different control mechanisms.\n\nThe Zodiac collection of tools can be equipped by visiting the `APPS` page on a Gnosis Safe and navigating to the Zodiac App. The [Zodiac documentation](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac) offers tutorials on how to set up each using the Zodiac App, and the [Zodiac Github repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) offers technical tutorials on how to configure each using the CLI. Detailed developer resources on how to build your own Zodiac module, modifier, or guard will be available soon.\n\n![Zodiac App on Gnosis Safe](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac99b614-f6ce-428d-9dbc-eeea1b51dfd3.jpg?height=1069&width=1699&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nAnyone can contribute to the Zodiac compliant collection of tools by submitting a pull request on the [repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac). We look forward to sharing collaborations with partner organizations [dOrg](https://www.dorg.tech/#/), [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/), [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/), [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/), [yearn.finance,](https://yearn.finance/) [Friends with Benefits (FWB)](https://www.fwb.help/), [TokenWalk](https://www.tokenwalk.org), [PrimeDAO](https://www.prime.xyz/), [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/mission), [Raid Guild](https://www.raidguild.org/), [ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.com/), [SZNS](https://szns.io/), [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/), [Stakewise](https://stakewise.io/), [Colony](https://colony.io/), [DeepDAO](https://deepdao.io/#), [Moving Castles](https://trust.support/feed/moving-castles), [Other Internet](https://twitter.com/otherinternet__), and [Black Swan](https://trust.support/events/black-swan-panel). Even more, Zodiac works with the ecosystem to develop a **DAO Improvement Proposal (DIP)** process to establish standard practices, which can be discussed in the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq) #dao-improvement-proposals channel with the plans to move to a more public forum.\n\n## Songlines for Progressive Decentralization\n\nBecause of its composable design philosophy, Zodiac supports DAOs on the road to progressive decentralization. This philosophy decouples avatars from decision making, meaning that practices surrounding governance, membership, and treasury management can be customized independently of the affordances of any of the tools a DAO uses.\n\nFor example, let‚Äôs imagine a DAO on a common trajectory today. A DAO begins as a squad with an idea. They deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-signature account as their avatar to manage shared resources, and this Gnosis Safe has 4/6 signatures required to execute a transaction. While informal proposals through a group chat suffice initially, eventually their decisions as a squad become more substantial: they decide to launch a token to expand their project. In order to keep a formal record of their decisions, they create a Snapshot space for token voting, and their first vote includes who should be elected as signers on their Gnosis Safe. Using the Zodiac App, they also equip ***Exit***, so that anyone who holds their token can leave the organization with their proportional share of digital assets if they disagree with a decision.\n\nAs time goes on, their community grows rapidly, developing many centers of activity through their token-enabled Discord, and one central team managing their Gnosis Safe becomes less than ideal. They decide to use ***Reality***, allowing both off-chain Snapshot proposals and Discord polls to trigger on-chain Gnosis Safe transactions that anyone in the community can execute. To add extra security to this new practice, they enable ***Scope***, which restricts addresses their Gnosis Safe can call. After acclimating to using Snapshot and Gnosis Safe with the Zodiac mods ***Reality*** and ***Scope***, they choose to disable the Gnosis Safe signers, achieving decentralization of its core technical system managing resources.\n\n![Zodiac Songline for Progressive Decentralization](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/009969ed-4861-4b11-aa97-c0fd00c30cea.png?height=1724&width=3066&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nContinuing the example with a future scenario, eventually this DAO community would like more refined governance processes than token voting. They take an interest in [conviction voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475), in which members can continuously signal their preferences, and they decide to use an upcoming conviction voting app on the xDai network to save gas fees. Operating as a multichain DAO does not sacrifice composability, however, because they also enable ***Bridge***, which connects the conviction voting app deployed on the xDai network to their Gnosis Safe treasury deployed on Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nZodiac not only changes access to platforms, protocols, and tools, but bridges chains, organizations, and networks through DAO-to-DAO (D2D) collaboration mechanisms. We expect DAOs to grow across ecosystems, seeing the Zodiac open standard as their foundation.  Even more options for nuanced governance processes can be achieved with ***Seele***, which enables interchangeable voting strategies, meaning DAOs can coordinate multiple agile governance processes across teams, squads, and other DAOs participating in their network.\n\n[https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1392454358810472448](https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1392454358810472448)\n\nThe approach of DAOs embracing modular tools as their organization develops proves their most effective cultural pattern yet. DAOs can continue with their favorite platforms, which become newly composable through equipping Zodiac modules, modifiers, and guards. Like expansion packs for games that introduce new maps, loot, and storylines to existing worlds, Zodiac encourages a plug-and-play culture of modding. Participants can shape their *access to DAO tools*, foregrounding a way the web could still be.\n\n![The WHOLE EARTH CATALOG (1969) embraced access to tools. Perhaps in the decades since, tools have also gotten access to us.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5452304-de9d-4540-a31f-0f1bf38f7e47.png?height=800&width=1590)\n\n## The team behind Zodiac\n\nGnosis Guild is a society for interdependent software with the values of conviviality, co-ownership, and experimentation at its heart. Incubated by [Gnosis](https://gnosis.io/), we operate as a small team using the tools we build. The two co-founders of Gnosis Guild, [Auryn Macmillan](https://twitter.com/auryn_macmillan) and [Kei Kreutler](https://twitter.com/keikreutler), bring over ten years combined experience developing products for decentralized governance in the blockchain ecosystem. From closely observing the rise of Gnosis Safe, our awareness that the DAO technology stack lacked composability ignited the initiative for Zodiac.\n\nGnosis Guild is a core contributor to Zodiac and a keeper of the open standard. True to its philosophy, however, Zodiac is open for participation. Anyone can contribute to the Zodiac compliant collection of tools by submitting a pull request on the [repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac). As an initial core contributor, Gnosis Guild approves which submissions comply with the standard. We embrace practices that will over time meaningfully distribute contribution, governance, and ownership of the value Zodiac produces, encouraging individuals, teams, and DAOs to participate. This includes the Zodiac design language, which consists of glyphs that can be recombined to create Zodiac icons.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/45a0e2a8-6c93-4a1c-967f-4e807480e7c2.png?height=1856&width=1920)\n\nDeveloped by [PROPS.SUPPLY](https://props.supply/), the design language represents the collection of tools according to the qualities, such as strength, magic, and dexterity, each tool affords an organization. Even more, DAOs can overlay these glyphs to represent the constitution of their organization as a badge. While still evolving, the release of the first version of the design language will coincide with a Gnosis Guild NFT drop.\n\n![Zodiac Delay Module composition](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2933d2c3-e87b-489a-94f1-802536dab760.png?height=1500&width=3000&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nThrough this design language, Zodiac seeks to decentralize not only its development but its vibe.\n\n## Bright Night Sky Ahead\n\nThe future of Zodiac is bright.\n\nThe tools launched today enhance existing practices in the DAO ecosystem, but the Zodiac roadmap aims to establish new practices in DAO-to-DAO collaboration mechanisms with a special focus on multichain governance. Upcoming Zodiac releases ‚Äã‚Äãinclude secret voting with zero knowledge proofs magic, message bridges between compatible networks, and web3 backends for your favorite virtual worlds. Like the glyphs that when co-present on star charts change their aspect, the Zodiac collection of tools are mods that support, expand, and transform how organizations operate.\n\nTo participate, join the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq) today.\n\n![Moonlit night by the sea, Lev Lagorio, 1886](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ff3c5bfc-e101-499b-a201-69e83e3d6094.jpeg?height=589&width=1000)\n\n*Use the Zodiac collection of tools today through the Zodiac App available on [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/).

The [fiat currency](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/fiat-currency/) I will be focusing on is USD, but you could easily translate it to the fiat currency of your respective country.\n\n### A Very Quick Primer Because There is a Lot\n\nüí´ If your only exposure to crypto up until this point has been Bitcoin, it‚Äôs important to know that there is a [difference](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/ethereum-vs-bitcoin-blockchain-differences#section-differences-between-bitcoin-and-ethereum) between it and Ethereum. Bitcoin is currently¬† \\*just\\* a currency whereas Ethereum is a system that includes its own currency, the ability to create applications using the system, and a vibrant developer ecosystem.\n\nüí´ You may have heard that crypto is decentralized, but what does that mean? [Decentralization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralizedmarket.asp) is interesting because it‚Äôs a way for money to exist online, detached from a single, central institution like a government or a traditional financial institution. It means that you could be in control of your money, with no middlemen, and the value would be determined by the people who own the same currency. Right now, all of our USD is government-backed, so its value is determined by the US economy. Not that we have much control over how any types of markets move, but a lot of people feel bad about the value of their money being tied to (and so, controlled) by the government of the country they happen to live in. Borders are stupid! Also, your money in the bank is not actually there for you whenever you want it because banks use your money to make themselves money. If something happens to the bank, it is not guaranteed that you will get your money back. The list goes on and on!\n\nüí´ You may have seen the words [DeFi](https://future.a16z.com/cryptos-fourth-wave-defi-poised-for-breakthrough/) and [web3](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-web-3) floating around. Both concepts point to the idea of building new, decentralized systems for both financial structures and [the internet](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-for-the-decentralized-web/). The backbone of these decentralized systems will be blockchain networks, like Ethereum. In order to participate in most of the popular projects within the DeFi space right now, you will need to leverage Ethereum‚Äôs currency, Ether (ETH). ETH is, under the hood, used for computing transactions and transaction fees. On its surface, ETH is money that you can send, receive, use to pay for things, lose!, etc.\n\nüí´ Coinbase, Gemini, and Robinhood are [exchanges](http://www.differencebetween.net/business/investment-business/difference-between-cryptocurrency-wallet-vs-exchange/), not wallets. \\\\n (Coinbase does have a separate wallet app called Coinbase Wallet, which is confusing. It‚Äôs not super fleshed out yet and there are better wallets out there so don‚Äôt worry about it for now.)\n\nüí´ All crypto is very volatile and will probably continue to be for a long time. Values of [coins](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-the-difference-between-coins-and-tokens)/[tokens](https://future.a16z.com/a-taxonomy-of-tokens-distinctions-with-a-difference/)/currencies can fluctuate in the hundreds and thousands on a daily basis. Like with any monetary investment, there will inevitably be ups and downs, so if you‚Äôre risk averse then this may not be for you.\n\nüí´ In order to participate in most of crypto, especially in the FOMO-inducing projects and communities that you see everyone tweeting about (like investing in expensive NFTs, for example), you have to shell out some money. Crypto today is pay-to-play. This unfortunate, high (monetary) barrier to entry is definitely problematic.\n\nüí´ Community building is an important aspect of crypto. Twitter, Discord, and Telegram seem to be the main social apps of choice for people involved.\n\n### Getting Set Up\n\n#### Step 1: Trade US Dollars for ETH\n\nBecause the cool crypto projects at the moment are pay-to-play, you need some cryptocurrency to get started. There are several different ways to purchase crypto, but the easiest would be to use a crypto exchange like Coinbase or Gemini. Oftentimes when you travel to a foreign country, you need to exchange USD for that country‚Äôs currency so that you can pay for things in that country‚Äôs economic ecosystem. The concept is the same when you trade USD for crypto through Coinbase or Gemini (or any [fiat onramp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fiat-on-ramp)).\n\nYou‚Äôll have to link your bank account or debit card to trade funds. The user flows are pretty straight forward: you select the currency you‚Äôre interested in purchasing > press Trade > press Buy > continue on with your swap. I recommend buying ETH since it will unlock the doors to most DeFi projects and will give you access to ETH wallets. FYI, there will be an annoying exchange/transaction fee if you use Coinbase or Gemini.\n\n**CONGRATULATIONS! You now own your very first crypto!!!**\n\nImportant things to know at this step:\n\n1. Despite transaction fees, I‚Äôd suggest starting small while you‚Äôre learning. Do not throw in more than you can afford to lose while you are in your learning phase.\n2. The crypto you buy is living on the exchange itself. Think about how when someone pays you on Venmo, it sits in your Venmo balance (so within the Venmo platform) until you withdraw your funds. The same notion applies here. At step 3, you will be withdrawing the crypto to your own wallet.\n3. You can actually have/buy no ETH and still create a wallet. You won‚Äôt be able to do much without ETH since you need to pay for gas fees (I will cover what that is later) per transaction, but people/projects can send things to your wallet and you can participate in *some* free projects.\n\n#### Step 2: Set up a wallet\n\nIRL, your wallet generally consists of some cash, some credit cards, a debit card, some random rewards cards you picked up at the movie theater and boba shop, and your drivers license (ID). An Ethereum wallet is similar in concept. Your wallet address stores your identification, and instead of having to create unique accounts on all Ethereum apps, you use your one wallet address to identify yourself everywhere. You also use your wallet address to pay for things, or collect rewards. Using most wallets, you can send and receive Ethereum objects (ETH, tokens, coins, NFTs, etc), perform transactions (like buy, sell, and trade things), log into platforms, and interact with different projects.\n\nIf I‚Äôm being honest, at the moment, most wallets leave a lot to be desired, and the user experience of using, connecting, and transacting with most wallets is rough. For the purposes of this guide I will help you get set up with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) as that‚Äôs my current wallet of choice. MetaMask is very popular in the industry and supported by almost every DeFi app. The UX can be tricky, and I would encourage you to move slowly and read everything before confirming anything while using it.\n\nVisit the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) website and download the MetaMask Chrome extension. There is also a MetaMask mobile app, but I prefer and recommend starting with the Chrome extension for ease of use. Once installed, go through the flow of creating your wallet address.\n\n**\\*\\*IMPORTANT\\*\\*** You will be given a secret recovery phrase. This is completely different from a regular password, it is the master key to your vault, and there is no way to recover it if you lose it. MAKE SURE YOU SAVE IT. Store it somewhere SAFE that could not be easily hackable - ideally not on a computer at all. Don‚Äôt email it to yourself. Don‚Äôt text it to yourself on your ‚Äúend-to-end encrypted‚Äù messaging app. Don‚Äôt send it to your friend. If you somehow forget your wallet password or download a new instance of MetaMask on a new device, you will be prompted to input your secret recovery phrase to access your wallet. If you no longer have your secret recovery phrase, you will not be able to access your wallet. This phrase is all anyone needs to fully control your wallet, with no ability to stop them. I cannot stress enough how important it is to SAVE this and to never share it with anyone. This can be scary at first (and I have learned the hard way), but it‚Äôs what allows you to have full control of your money.¬† **\\*\\*IMPORTANT\\*\\***\n\nAfter you save your secret recovery phrase in a super secret and safe place (AGAIN, DO NOT SKIP THIS), you‚Äôll create a wallet password, and then voila! You have your first wallet set up! Your wallet address will look like some wacky, long jumble of letters and numbers, most likely starting with ‚Äú0x‚Äù. That‚Äôs your address, your identity! Welcome to \\~the metaverse\\~\n\nAt this point it‚Äôs important to understand that you alone are fully accountable for your wallet. What separates crypto from traditional finance and banking is that there is no bank or entity that is responsible for your wallet, only you. That means if you lose your secret recovery phrase, or you get scammed/hacked, there is no support person to call to help you retrieve your information, there is no insurance company to call to claim your lost money. I know I sound like a broken record, but again: only put in as much money as you‚Äôre ok with possibly losing.\n\n#### Step 3: Withdrawing your ETH from your crypto exchange to your wallet\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the ETH you own is hanging out in the place that you exchanged it, and you need to move it to your personal wallet.\n\n*Note: you can only send ETH to your ETH wallet (in this case, MetaMask). If in step 1 you chose to buy another currency like Bitcoin or Litecoin, you will have to convert it to ETH first.*\n\nHead back to the crypto exchange you bought ETH with at step 1. You‚Äôll want to select the option to ‚ÄúWithdraw‚Äù and then input the amount of ETH you want to withdraw to your wallet. The exchange will then prompt you for the address you want to send that crypto to. Remember the long wallet address you created on MetaMask that started with ‚Äú0x‚Äù? That‚Äôs what you input. That is YOUR wallet address, where you will send your crypto. You will then have to confirm your transaction, and within moments, your crypto wallet will be ready to go!\n\n*Additional note: sometimes there are very long wait times when transferring ETH from exchange to wallet. Like longer than 1-5 minutes. This is scary and confusing as we are used to instantaneous feedback from software, especially when dealing with money. Sometimes folks accidentally end up buying more ETH because they think their transactions didn‚Äôt go through. I‚Äôd say that with all transactions, you should err on the side of waiting for a while instead of trying to move fast.*\n\n### Another Very Quick Primer Because You Will Encounter New Confusing Things\n\nüí´ GAS FEES, BABY! The bane of transacting on Ethereum today! NGL, when I was first getting started, I thought people were referring to actual, IRL gasoline whenever they talked about gas fees. [Gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) *actually* refer to Ethereum network transaction fees. They are payments to compensate for the computational energy used to process and validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. You will inevitably encounter ‚Äúgas fees‚Äù as you use your MetaMask wallet, and the fees will often be ridiculously high (in the several hundreds), fluctuating rapidly when there is high usage or activity on Ethereum‚Äôs network. You will be paying gas fees every time you perform a transaction, including when you buy ETH. Even projects that are free to participate in (like [Loot](https://decrypt.co/80108/what-is-loot-ethereum-nft-role-playing-phenonemon) being free to mint) will still require gas fees to mint. This is changing and being fixed soon, and that‚Äôs a whole different thing to get into, but just know that high gas fees are another painful barrier to entry for everyone right now.\n\nüí´ There are scams galore!!!! The team at [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) (another cool mobile wallet to try out when you feel comfortable) wrote these great guides for [How to Avoid Crypto Scams](https://rainbow.me/learn/rainbows-guide-to-avoiding-crypto-scams) and [How to Protect Your Ethereum Wallet](https://rainbow.me/learn/rainbows-guide-to-protecting-your-ethereum-wallet) and I highly recommend reading both before you start doing anything with your wallet.\n\n### Getting the Party Started\n\nThere are so many things you can do now that you have some ETH in your wallet! A route that many people first take is getting involved with lending, trading, and other (confusing) financial transactions. In an effort to keep this as beginner as possible, here are some less financially motivated things you can try:\n\n#### You can create a .eth wallet address!\n\nThese are [ENS domains](https://ens.domains/). They translate your wallet address (that long, jumbled string that begins with ‚Äú0x‚Äù) to something human-memorable. A common practice is to get yourname.eth, or randomword.eth. With an ENS domain, you can easily link your ENS in places that require you to input your wallet address without having to go back to your wallet to copy the long address string.\n\n#### You can buy your first NFT!\n\n[NFTs](https://future.a16z.com/podcasts/nfts-explainer-innovation-crypto-creator-economy/) are huge drivers of hype (and cashflow) in the system at the moment. If you‚Äôve finally moved past the ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs just a jpeg‚Äù phase of your crypto journey, why not invest in some digital art? Popular NFT platforms include [Foundation](https://foundation.app/), [Zora](https://zora.co/), and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Support your favorite artists!\n\n#### You can participate in the $WRITE race on Mirror!\n\n[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) is one project that you don‚Äôt have to spend any money to get involved with, and it‚Äôs what this blog is built on! Think Substack but on the blockchain. You‚Äôll have to win an upvoting contest ($WRITE race) to receive the ability to create your Mirror publication (which could take some time and some heavy PR), but the community, the writing, and the features on Mirror are very inspiring and worth the effort!\n\n### ---\n\nMy hope in writing this guide was to make crypto feel more accessible and approachable!

Once you‚Äôre ready to dip your toes in and don‚Äôt know where to begin, let this guide help you get started.\n\nThe world of crypto is very much a work in progress. It‚Äôs exciting because people are building in realtime, right in the open, with new projects launching weekly. There are a ton of different ways to get involved, and I believe that the [Ethereum](https://preethikasireddy.medium.com/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway-22d1df506369) network is presently one of the most engaging spaces to immerse yourself in.

Contracts", "body": "*üëã Note: Originally published in April 2016 on [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/04/11/how-close-are-smart-contracts-to-impacting-real-world-law/) and [Medium](https://jjmstark.medium.com/introduction-to-smart-contracts-part-1-8f191a324d0a).*\n\n\n---\n\nOver the last year, the concept of a ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù has received renewed attention in both the technology industry and in legal and business circles. Recent advancements in a field known as ‚Äúblockchain technology‚Äù have led some to believe that smart contracts could soon offer alternatives to traditional commercial and financial agreements, with dire results for the legal and financial sectors. While this enthusiasm may be premature, lawyers nonetheless remain mostly unaware of this important emerging technology and the long-term implications for their profession.\n\nIn this context, ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù refers specifically to the use of computer code to articulate, verify, and execute an agreement between parties. Whereas a typical contract is drafted using natural language, the terms of smart contracts are expressed in code, similar to a programming language like javascript or HTML. The contract is then ‚Äúexecuted‚Äù by a computer ‚Äî given the conditions of the agreement, and a set of defined inputs, the smart contract enforces its own terms.\n\nReaders familiar with blockchain technology will know that the term ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù is often used in a more general sense to refer to any script or program that operates on a blockchain. However for the purposes of this article, I focus on the narrower meaning described above: using code in place of traditional contractual agreements between parties.\n\n\n---\n\nThe term ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù was first popularized by computer scientist Nick Szabo in his 1997 paper *The Idea of Smart Contracts*. The vending machine, he described, is the simplest form of a ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù ‚Äî a mechanical device designed to transfer ownership of a good (a candy bar) when provided with a certain defined input ($1.50). Because the machine itself ‚Äúcontrols‚Äù the property ‚Äî by being physically sealed ‚Äî it is able to enforce the terms of the ‚Äúcontract‚Äù.\n\nExtending the concept, Szabo suggested that computer code could be used in place of mechanical devices to facilitate far more complex transactions of *digital* property. Rather than transfer ownership of a candy bar, a smart contract could transfer ownership of real-estate, or shares, or intellectual property. The program would define what ‚Äúinputs‚Äù were necessary for the contract to execute ‚Äî things like payment, or votes of board members, or any other condition that can be expressed by code.\n\nConsider a basic options contract. A call options contract entitles the holder to buy a given security at a defined price. In our example, Alice buys our ‚Äúsmart options contract‚Äù from Bob. The contract entitles Alice to purchase 100 shares of Acme Inc. from Bob at a defined price of $50 per share. The contract has an expiry date, after which Alice is no longer entitled to buy the share at the defined ‚Äústrike price‚Äù.\n\nExpressed in pseudo-code, a simple ‚Äúsmart options contract‚Äù might look like this:\n\n```\ncontract Option {   strikePrice = $50\n   holder = Alice\n   seller = Bob\n   asset = 100 shares of Acme Inc.\n   expiryDate = June 1st, 2016   function exercise ( ) {\n\n             If Message Sender = holder, and\n      If Current Date < expiryDate, then\n         holder send($5,000) to seller, and\n         seller send(asset) to holder\n   }\n\n}\n```\n\nIn the first section, the smart options contract defines the relevant terms ‚Äî the underlying asset, the strike price, the identities of each party, and the expiry date. Then, a function we‚Äôve named ‚Äúexercise‚Äù enables the holder to trigger the purchase of shares at the strike price at any moment before the expiry date. The function first checks to see if the entity triggering it (the ‚ÄúMessage Sender‚Äù) is the holder, and then checks to see that the contract is still within the expiry date. If both are true, then the contract immediately executes by transferring cash from the holder to the seller, and the assets from the seller to the holder, according to the contract‚Äôs terms.\n\n\n---\n\nUntil recently, smart contracts were little more than theory. In general, there were two fundamental challenges that needed to be addressed before smart contracts could be used in any real-world setting.\n\n**(1)** How would a smart contract actually *control* real assets so that it could enforce an agreement? A vending machine, to return to Szabo‚Äôs example, controls property by physically securing it inside of itself. But how could code do the same? In our options contract above, the ‚Äúexercise‚Äù function transfers money and assets between the two parties. But how can a computer program control real-world assets like cash and shares?\n\n**(2)** What computer would be trusted to ‚Äúexecute‚Äù those terms in a way that both parties could rely upon? Parties must not only agree on the code of their contract, but also the computer which interprets and executes that code. A shared standard, at the minimum, would have to exist, and be used in a way that was verifiable by each party ‚Äî ideally, without requiring the parties to physically inspect the computer in question.\n\nIn the last few years, solutions to both of these problems have come into sight. Emerging research and development surrounding what is called ‚Äúblockchain technology‚Äù may provide a basis to make smart contracts a reality in the near future.\n\nThe first use of blockchain technology was the digital currency bitcoin, made famous by its mysterious creator and sudden price increase in late 2013. In the last few years, the underlying ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù technology has been intensely studied and adapted to expand its use beyond simple digital currencies. Startups, open-source communities, and large financial institutions alike are improving and expanding the technology with the aim of one day using it to facilitate exchange of fully digital assets.\n\nA blockchain is an **authoritative database**. It is a database that, by virtue of the way it is maintained and updated, has very high trust properties. Blockchains are not controlled by a single party. There is no single company, organization, or person that has ultimate control over a blockchain. Rather, a blockchain is maintained, updated, and secured by a network of participating computers.\n\nEach computer keeps a full copy of the blockchain database, and each copy is kept in synchronization with the others by a system of cryptographically-enforced rules called a *consensus algorithm*. Crucially, blockchains are *append-only* databases, meaning that once information is validly added, it can never be removed. Each update to the blockchain is secured by a cryptographic process known as a *hash function*, which allows the network to immediately detect and reject any attempt to distribute an edited copy of the database.\n\nIn this way, blockchains form the foundation for the recording and transfer of fully digital assets. Because the blockchain is always kept in synchronization, there is only ever one true record of ownership ‚Äî essential to prevent anyone trying to double-spend their assets by sending it to multiple parties at the same time, a problem that plagued previous attempts to create digital assets. Because it is impossible to edit a blockchain once it has been properly updated, parties have mathematically-enforced confidence that the record of their ownership will persist into the future.\n\n\n---\n\nWhile the technology is still in early stages, many now believe that if blockchains can create a secure platform for the trade of digital assets, they may also solve the two fundamental challenges facing smart contracts.\n\n**First**, recall that smart contracts require a way for computer code to control real assets. By enabling fully digitized assets, blockchains make it possible for code to exercise control over property. On a blockchain, control over an asset means controlling a cryptographic key that corresponds to the asset in question, rather than any physical object. Thus in our example above, the options contract could *itself* have control of the underlying assets, rather than an escrow agent. When the ‚Äúexercise‚Äù function is called, the operation of the code would transfer the assets without requiring any human assistance.\n\n**Second**, smart contracts need a ‚Äútrusted computer‚Äù that would execute the terms of the contract. This is the blockchain itself. The blockchains that are being developed today are not only databases, but distributed *computers* that can execute code as well as record ownership of assets. Our ‚Äúsmart option‚Äù example would itself be uploaded and stored on a blockchain, and would be executed by the blockchain when instructed to do so. The same properties that make blockchains ideal to record ownership of assets also make them ideal for executing smart contracts. Once the code of the contract is uploaded and recorded onto the blockchain, the parties can have confidence that the contract cannot be altered, and that it will always perform as expected.\n\nBlockchain smart contracts may not be as far away as we expect. Banks, exchanges, and other financial institutions are actively developing blockchain technologies that will enable them to store and trade real assets over blockchain systems. Nasdaq, in partnership with blockchain startup Chain, has developed and begun testing a private-market equity trading platform. A next-generation open-source blockchain called Ethereum, launched in July 2015, aims to be the foundation for a new industry of non-traditional decentralized commerce. A consortium of 42 banks, working with blockchain firm R3, have begun work on a shared industry platform based on blockchain technology specifically designed to facilitate financial agreements. Within a few years, financial markets may be trading fully-digital assets across blockchain networks, with the terms of those trades enforced by code.\n\nThe impact will not be limited to financial contracts, although these are the most obvious use cases. As techniques are developed that enable other types of property to be recorded and transacted on a blockchain the possible applications for smart contracts will multiply.\n\n\n---\n\nIf they ever become widely used, smart contracts could alter the nature of corporate & commercial transactions. The advantages of software that have revolutionized so many industries ‚Äî automation, predictability, and speed ‚Äî could finally be brought to bear on segments of the legal industry.\n\nRepresenting contractual terms in code, rather than natural language, could bring clarity and predictability to agreements. A smart contract could be tested against any set of inputs ‚Äî in other words, against any set of material facts which it takes as inputs ‚Äî allowing lawyers on either side of a deal to know precisely how the contract would execute in every computationally-possible outcome.\n\nIn our simple Smart Options example above, each of Alice and Bob could ‚Äúdry run‚Äù the contract in a simulated environment, where every possible input is tested. While this is unnecessary in such a simple example, imagine a contract with thousands of inputs, and hundreds of nested if-then statements ‚Äî as is common in many complex financial agreements. These, too, could be tested against every possible input defined in the code. Analogous to how software developers ‚Äúdebug‚Äù their own code by testing it in every possible circumstance, lawyers could test contracts, giving each side of a deal a clearer understanding of their risk ‚Äî and perhaps requiring fewer billable hours.\n\nOf course, smart contracts will never fully replace natural-language law. Many types of agreements can never be fully expressed in code or executed by a computer ‚Äî for instance, those that involve human performance rather than just the exchange of dematerialized assets. Even fully self-executing contracts will ultimately need to make reference to legal terms and concepts that will define each party‚Äôs rights if their relationship leads to litigation. Rather, the emergence of smart contracts will lead to a re-evaluation of common practice, as lawyers and clients alike discover which types of agreements and terms are best suited to code, which should be left to natural language, and how to combine each to achieve the best of both worlds.\n\nFor now, smart contracts are still speculative fiction. But for the first time we have a technology that could be used to bring them into commercial use. While that day may still be years away, law firms would be wise to consider how these innovations could impact their business. By the time smart contracts become viable, the legal industry should hope that they have lawyers to match.", "timestamp": 1631897447, "digest": "IUqivJ5jeQiCRnwlwkAhGSJtT5pSAPpqbBJvyUN0nCg", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}

The idea has long been hyped to the public as a central component of next-generation blockchain platforms, and as a key capability for any practical enterprise application.\n\nThey are defined variously as [‚Äúautonomous machines‚Äù](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/smart-contracts-sound-boring-but-theyre-more-disruptive-than-bitcoin), [‚Äúcontracts between parties stored on a blockchain‚Äù](http://en.finance.sia-partners.com/impact-blockchains-smart-contracts-insurance) or [‚Äúany computation that takes place on a blockchain‚Äù](http://www.multichain.com/blog/2015/11/smart-contracts-good-bad-lazy/). Many [debates about the nature of smart contracts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/300yez/if_it_doesnt_escrow_value_its_not_a_smart_contract/) are really just contests between competing terminology.\n\nThe different definitions usually fall into one of two categories. Sometimes the term is used to identify a specific technology ‚Äî code that is stored, verified and executed on a blockchain. Let‚Äôs call this type of definition ‚Äúsmart contract code‚Äù.\n\nOther times, the term is used to refer to a specific *application* of that technology: as a complement, or substitute, for legal contracts. Let‚Äôs name these ‚Äúsmart legal contracts‚Äù.\n\nUsing the same term to refer to distinct concepts makes answering even simple questions impossible. For instance, one question I‚Äôm often asked is simply: what are the capabilities of a smart contract?\n\nIf we are talking about *smart contract code*, then the answer depends on the capabilities of the language used to express the contract and the technical features of the blockchain on which it operates.\n\nBut if we are asking about using that technology to create a binding legal agreement, or an effective substitute *for* a binding legal agreement, the answer depends on far more than the technology. This answer depends on existing legal doctrine and how our legal, political and commercial institutions decide to treat the technology. If businesspeople don‚Äôt trust it, the legislature doesn‚Äôt recognize it and the courts can‚Äôt interpret it, then it won‚Äôt be a very practically useful ‚Äúcontract‚Äù.\n\nIt would be futile to try and change the way people use the term already. Practically speaking, we are probably stuck using ‚Äî or at least reading ‚Äî the term ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù for now. This makes it essential for anyone interested in this space to understand the different ways the term is used and be able to distinguish clearly between them.\n\n## Smart contracts as smart contract code\n\nBlockchains can run code. While the first blockchains were designed to perform a small set of simple operations ‚Äî mainly, transactions of a currency-like token ‚Äî techniques have been developed to allow blockchains to perform more complex operations, defined in full-fledged programming languages.\n\nBecause these programs are run on a blockchain, they have unique characteristics compared to other types of software. First, the program itself is recorded *on* the blockchain, which gives it a blockchain‚Äôs characteristic permanence and censorship resistance. Second, the program can *itself* control blockchain assets ‚Äî i.e., it can store and transfer amounts of cryptocurrency. Third, the program is executed *by* the blockchain, meaning it will always execute as written and no one can interfere with its operation.\n\nTo developers and others working directly with blockchain technology, the term ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù is most often used to refer to this blockchain code. You‚Äôll see this use of the term in the [Ethereum documentation](https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), on[ stackexchange](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/607/how-to-unit-test-smart-contracts) and in [technically minded articles](http://www.coindesk.com/three-smart-contract-misconceptions/). The term has been particularly associated with the Ethereum project, whose primary purpose is to be a platform for smart contract code. But today, the term is used generically [across](http://www.coindesk.com/smart-contract-1-million-bitcoin-rootstock/) [the](https://docs.erisindustries.com/explainers/smart_contracts/)[ community](https://medium.com/@tjayrush/smart-contracts-are-immutable-thats-amazing-and-it-sucks-e0fbc7b0ec16#.sl3xvhf0w) to refer to any complex program that is stored and executed on a blockchain.\n\nCalling these programs *contracts* is helpful in that this code is governing something important or valuable. We only go to the trouble of creating a binding contract when it‚Äôs important that we be able to enforce the terms. Similarly, we only use smart contract code when the code controls something important, like money or identity.\n\nThat said, smart contract code need not resemble anything we would ordinarily think of as a ‚Äúcontract‚Äù. While the code could articulate a conditional financial transaction (‚Äúsend 1 BTC from Alice to Bob on July 1, 2016‚Äù), it could also be a governance application that controls account permissions (‚Äúif Alice has voted yes, remove Bob‚Äôs voting rights over Application X and notify the following accounts‚Ä¶‚Äù).\n\nIn many cases, smart contract code is not used in isolation but as a small piece in a larger application. Every DApp, DAO, or other blockchain-based application is built using smart contract code to perform operations on their chosen blockchain. Any Ethereum application that you‚Äôve read about ‚Äî like [Augur](http://augur.net/), [Slock.it](http://slock.it/), or [Boardroom](http://boardroom.to/) ‚Äî is made out of smart contract code.\n\n## Imperfect, misleading, and someday outdated\n\nThe term receives a lot of valid criticism. Relying on the metaphor of a ‚Äúcontract‚Äù is misleading because it emphasizes a single narrow use case. The term fails to capture one of the key capabilities of blockchain programs: that they have a kind of independent agency.\n\nSmart contract programs can *themselves* hold balances of cryptocurrency, or even control other smart contract programs. Once they are created, they can act autonomously when called to perform an action. For this reason, many prefer the term ‚Äúsmart agent‚Äù, analogous to the more general concept of a [software agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent).\n\nEventually, this use of the term may simply fade from use as blockchain technology matures.\n\nDevelopers will be more likely to refer to a specific language (‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look at your [Solidity code](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)‚Äù) or platform (‚ÄúOur application runs on [Eris.db](https://erisindustries.com/components/erisdb/)‚Äù) that they are working with, as opposed to a generic term that could describe any complex operation on a blockchain.\n\nThe capabilities and purpose of smart contract code as distinct from *other* code may simply become clear from context, without requiring the use of a clumsy analogy like ‚Äúcontract‚Äù. It might end up being more similar to how we speak of HTML and JavaScript today, without having to think about how the former is a ‚Äúmarkup‚Äù language, playing a distinct role from JavaScript in the overall web application.\n\n## Smart contracts as smart legal contracts\n\nAmong those who work in finance or law, the term ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù is often read quite differently than the definition above.\n\n‚ÄúSmart contract‚Äù here refers to a specific *use case of smart-contract code* ‚Äî a way of using blockchain technology to complement, or replace, existing legal contracts. This is the definition of the term I considered in [my last piece](https://stark.mirror.xyz/IUqivJ5jeQiCRnwlwkAhGSJtT5pSAPpqbBJvyUN0nCg): the use of code to articulate, verify, and enforce an agreement between parties. A smart *legal* contract.\n\nThese smart legal contracts would most likely be a combination of smart contract code and more traditional legal language. For instance, imagine a supplier of goods enters into a smart legal contract with a retailer. The payment terms could be defined in code and executed[ automatically when delivery is made](https://www.loaddelivered.com/blog/why-blockchain-is-a-game-changer-for-supply-chain-management/). But the retailer would likely insist the contract include an [indemnity clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indemnity), whereby the supplier agrees to indemnify the retailer against claims flowing from a defective product. There would be no point representing this clause in code, since it is not something that can self-execute ‚Äî it exists to be interpreted and enforced by a court in the case of litigation.\n\nCommercial agreements are full of boilerplate clauses that protect parties from various edge-case liabilities, and these are not always suitable for representation and execution through code, meaning that smart legal contracts will require (at least for the foreseeable future) a blend between code and natural language.\n\nThis is the basic idea behind Eris Industries‚Äô [dual integration](https://erisindustries.com/components/erislegal/) system, Primavera de Fillipi‚Äôs proposed [Legal Framework for Crypto-Ledger Transactions](http://p2pfoundation.net/Legal_Framework_For_Crypto-Ledger_Transactions), and R3‚Äôs Corda [smart contracts system](http://www.coindesk.com/barclays-smart-contracts-templates-demo-r3-corda/).\n\nCould smart legal contracts ever be considered legally enforceable? Probably. Despite what many think, the conditions under which an agreement becomes a legally enforceable contract are flexible and attuned to the underlying relationship between the parties, rather than dependent on the form the contract takes. Anything from a verbal agreement to an email conversation can become a contract at law, if the [basic elements of a contract can be found](https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/unpacking-the-term-smart-contract-e63238f7db65#.nak50tdkj).\n\n## Many contracts, many use cases\n\nThe category of smart legal contracts is complicated by the fact that there are many different types of contracts in the world, only some of which are obvious candidates for use as ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù. A legal contract could be anything from a verbal agreement for someone to paint your house to a derivative traded electronically in financial markets.\n\nSince early 2015, the use cases attracting the most attention are [smart legal contracts as smart](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2016/04/the-blockchain-revolution/)*[financial instruments](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2016/04/the-blockchain-revolution/)* like shares, bonds, or derivatives contracts. Articulating these contracts in code could allow financial markets to become more automated and simplify many process-intensive systems related to trading and servicing of financial instruments.\n\nThese ‚Äúsmart financial instruments‚Äù do not exist at scale today, although many people are working to build them. R3‚Äôs recently announced [Corda platform](http://www.coindesk.com/9-takeaways-r3s-new-distributed-ledger-tech/) is designed to facilitate this type of smart-contract. Digital Asset Holdings [recently acqui-hired Elevance](http://www.coindesk.com/digital-asset-acquires-elevence/), a Swiss firm that has developed a way to model financial agreements in code. In April, Barclays‚Äô [revealed details of a scheme](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/19/barclays-used-blockchain-tech-to-trade-derivatives.html), in cooperation with R3, to represent ISDA agreements in smart contract code.\n\nFinancial instruments are just one type of contract that could benefit from blockchain code. As the technology matures, other assets ‚Äî e.g. real estate, or intellectual property ‚Äî may be stored and traded over blockchain systems. As new asset types go ‚Äúon-chain‚Äù, the agreements used to govern those assets in the world today (like a mortgage or licensing agreement) may benefit from blockchain-based analogs.\n\n## Alternatives to traditional legal agreements\n\nMany advocates for blockchain technology see larger possibilities. Rather than merely imitate or complement the legal contracts we use today, perhaps smart contract code could be used to facilitate new types of commercial arrangements.\n\nWe might even call this a third definition of the term: using smart contract code to create novel, alternative forms of agreements that are nonetheless commercially useful. Let‚Äôs call these ‚Äúsmart*alternative* contracts‚Äù.\n\nThis approach takes a broader view of the real-world problem solved by contracts. Commerce depends on individuals being able to form stable, predictable agreements with one another. Contracts, along with a strong legal system, are the primary mechanisms we use to shape each party‚Äôs incentives to the point where they have sufficient confidence in their relationship to engage in the risky business of trade.\n\nBut perhaps legal agreements are not the only solution to this general problem. Smart contract code offers a new set of tools to articulate and enforce terms, and they can be used to create systems of incentives that may be sufficient to make commercial relationships possible.\n\nThe most widely discussed opportunity of this type is machine-to-machine commerce. The growing ecosystem of smart devices ‚Äî particularly those that are in some fashion autonomous ‚Äî will eventually need a way to engage in basic commercial interactions with one another. For instance, a washer that [buys its own detergent](http://www.coindesk.com/ibm-reveals-proof-concept-blockchain-powered-internet-things) or a [car that can pay to recharge itself](http://www.coindesk.com/german-utility-company-turns-to-blockchain-amid-shifting-energy-landscape/).\n\nThese transactions still require a minimum level of trust to be commercially viable, but are ill-suited for legal contracts, which are comparatively expensive and require the involvement of legal persons like a corporation or human. Smart alternative contracts might enable an entirely new type of commerce carried out between our computers, cars, phones, and appliances.\n\nThere probably are ‚Äî or will be ‚Äî other types of commercial interaction that aren‚Äôt well suited to traditional legal contracts. New markets, suddenly made possible by technology, but which are underserved by legal tools that are slow to innovate and adapt.\n\nSmart alternative contracts might let us stretch the web of trust out a little further, a little faster, beyond the reach of the legal system, where they can enable new forms of commerce not possible today.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe lack of clear terminology in this field is an unfortunate reality. Those of us who work in the blockchain space should be mindful of how the term is being used in different communities, and be prepared to ask a series of annoying, though necessary, clarifying questions when asked about the nature and potential of ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù.\n\nThe different uses of the term illustrate a broader challenge in our industry. The interdisciplinary nature of blockchain technology, and ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù in particular, lead people to see the technology as primarily belonging to their own discipline, at the expense of the others.Lawyers often look at smart contracts and see marginally improved legal agreements, without appreciating the fuller potential of blockchain-code to extend beyond law‚Äôs reach.\n\nDevelopers, on the other hand, consider smart contracts and see the limitless possibilities of software, without appreciating the subtleties and commercial realities reflected in traditional legal agreements.\n\nAs with any interdisciplinary field, both must learn from the other.", "timestamp": 1631897836, "digest": "7g0Bmjw8uJKCBvUKBPcfAN50eXDrvvgHdOqdQ1Eko3Y", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}

Ready to get this revolution kick-started?\n\nNow that we've shared some of our [hopes and dreams for SR2.0](https://superrare.mirror.xyz/fkGKcN1xVNRvfZk5OiY52-T_WNSndC4ve1DPDmvZQ6E) and you've heard the [rallying cry for self-governance](https://superrare.mirror.xyz/M9A9TbTMBkDD_No3Q0-LPjnq4OZxfDgxXKqBVLYRVDA), we hope you're as excited about the future of SuperRare as we are. It's a BIG vision, we know, but one that's worth fighting for. And we're thrilled to have you along for the ride üöÄ\n\nBefore embarking on the important business of changing the world, we thought it'd be helpful to bring things back to brass tacks and talk through what to expect as we embark on our noble journey. Like all teams coming together for the first time - we need to learn our collective strengths and weaknesses, build communication skills, and develop methods of collaboration that can leverage our different backgrounds/cultures and feelings about the world. Sounds easy, right?! üòâ\n\n### From the top\n\nOne metaphor we've found useful to help contextualize the task ahead is to think about the SuperRare DAO as a band getting together for the first time. Even professional musicians can't sit down and play a concert straight through without a few hours of practice. There are just too many opinions, styles and moving pieces that need to get worked out for a group of strangers - no matter how well trained - to pick it up cold and rock it from the first take. If you want a concert or a sports match to be enjoyable, the players need to have chemistry - and good chemistry comes from having tuned the ingredients beforehand to get the right reaction.\n\nSo, in order for our band (aka \"the DAO\") to come together and play what we expect to be a pretty amazing tour - we first need to learn how to play our scales and some simple tunes together. In this analogy you can think of the Space Race as learning to play our scales, and Spaces that get elected as the songs we're playing together. Spaces are an easily understandable use case for the DAO to begin building strong governance/curation muscles together. We don't expect everyone to become self-governance junkies overnight, but with gradual education and a regular heartbeat of Space elections twice a month, we hope everyone can learn *How to DAO* and *Why Governance Matters.*\n\n### Play it again\n\nStretching this metaphor *just a little* further, it's also helpful if you think of SuperRare Labs as the conductor of this new band. The conductor has a particularly important role in a large ensemble because they help to lead, coordinate & balance all the competing voices that must come together as one in order to make the music sing.\n\nWhile each player in the band has a unique voice and an important role to play, they're also just a single piece of a larger orchestration that must be balanced across many voices. What's important is that each player understand their contribution relative to the larger orchestra and how this contribution shapes the viewing experience. Not everyone can be a soloist in every performance, but a single voice can always be heard when it's not in sync with the rest of the ensemble.\n\n### Time and Spaces\n\nHopefully by now you are dusting off the music case, tuning the strings and getting ready to jam!\n\nNow that we're all ready to rock and roll, we'd like to announce that the SuperRare Governance forum is officially open for business over at [forum.superrare.com](https://forum.superrare.com/).\n\nWe encourage all $RARE holders to familiarize themselves with the forum as this will be the home base for all of our coordination and collaboration to come - beginning with Spaces.\n\nAnd with that, we're also excited to announce the kick off of Space Race 1...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wwET45VgJ0Y2FH5qd2FNl.png?height=1667&width=2501)\n\nThose interested in submitting a Space proposal can do so by visiting [forum.superrare.com](http://forum.superrare.com) and completing a Space Proposal by midnight on Oct 15th. Once submitted, proposals will be reviewed by community editors to ensure creative standards are met prior to council submission. The council will then audit + publish selected applications for public review prior to the community vote.\n\nEach race will have a single winner decided by the $RARE community in an official snapshot vote. Once elected, Space operators will be scheduled for onboarding and given an official launch date.\n\nLet the race for the RARE-est Spaces begin! üöÄ", "timestamp": 1631898260, "digest": "F9rkh2IxAo7YVB7W8MUNu3ocaGwpVsL1w28Kycwfkbw", "contributor": "0x60E912290431D877489CDb74FA3C75A51575f57a"}
{"id": "fh67PePNBWoo6AY9BBptVU8oTmJVPBhF7D8cUN_cVZE", "title": "Making Sense of Smart Contracts", "body": "*üëã Note: Originally published in June 2016 on [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/06/04/making-sense-of-blockchain-smart-contracts/) and [Medium](https://jjmstark.medium.com/part-2-making-sense-of-smart-contracts-dfef850f049c).*\n\n\n---\n\nThe term [‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù](http://www.coindesk.com/research/smart-contracts-report/) has no clear and settled definition. The idea has long been hyped to the public as a central component of next-generation blockchain platforms, and as a key capability for any practical enterprise application.\n\nThey are defined variously as [‚Äúautonomous machines‚Äù](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/smart-contracts-sound-boring-but-theyre-more-disruptive-than-bitcoin), [‚Äúcontracts between parties stored on a blockchain‚Äù](http://en.finance.sia-partners.com/impact-blockchains-smart-contracts-insurance) or [‚Äúany computation that takes place on a blockchain‚Äù](http://www.multichain.com/blog/2015/11/smart-contracts-good-bad-lazy/). Many [debates about the nature of smart contracts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/300yez/if_it_doesnt_escrow_value_its_not_a_smart_contract/) are really just contests between competing terminology.\n\nThe different definitions usually fall into one of two categories. Sometimes the term is used to identify a specific technology ‚Äî code that is stored, verified and executed on a blockchain. Let‚Äôs call this type of definition ‚Äúsmart contract code‚Äù.\n\nOther times, the term is used to refer to a specific *application* of that technology: as a complement, or substitute, for legal contracts. Let‚Äôs name these ‚Äúsmart legal contracts‚Äù.\n\nUsing the same term to refer to distinct concepts makes answering even simple questions impossible. For instance, one question I‚Äôm often asked is simply: what are the capabilities of a smart contract?\n\nIf we are talking about *smart contract code*, then the answer depends on the capabilities of the language used to express the contract and the technical features of the blockchain on which it operates.\n\nBut if we are asking about using that technology to create a binding legal agreement, or an effective substitute *for* a binding legal agreement, the answer depends on far more than the technology. This answer depends on existing legal doctrine and how our legal, political and commercial institutions decide to treat the technology. If businesspeople don‚Äôt trust it, the legislature doesn‚Äôt recognize it and the courts can‚Äôt interpret it, then it won‚Äôt be a very practically useful ‚Äúcontract‚Äù.\n\nIt would be futile to try and change the way people use the term already. Practically speaking, we are probably stuck using ‚Äî or at least reading ‚Äî the term ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù for now. This makes it essential for anyone interested in this space to understand the different ways the term is used and be able to distinguish clearly between them.\n\n## Smart contracts as smart contract code\n\nBlockchains can run code. While the first blockchains were designed to perform a small set of simple operations ‚Äî mainly, transactions of a currency-like token ‚Äî techniques have been developed to allow blockchains to perform more complex operations, defined in full-fledged programming languages.\n\nBecause these programs are run on a blockchain, they have unique characteristics compared to other types of software. First, the program itself is recorded *on* the blockchain, which gives it a blockchain‚Äôs characteristic permanence and censorship resistance. Second, the program can *itself* control blockchain assets ‚Äî i.e., it can store and transfer amounts of cryptocurrency. Third, the program is executed *by* the blockchain, meaning it will always execute as written and no one can interfere with its operation.\n\nTo developers and others working directly with blockchain technology, the term ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù is most often used to refer to this blockchain code. You‚Äôll see this use of the term in the [Ethereum documentation](https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), on[ stackexchange](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/607/how-to-unit-test-smart-contracts) and in [technically minded articles](http://www.coindesk.com/three-smart-contract-misconceptions/). The term has been particularly associated with the Ethereum project, whose primary purpose is to be a platform for smart contract code. But today, the term is used generically [across](http://www.coindesk.com/smart-contract-1-million-bitcoin-rootstock/) [the](https://docs.erisindustries.com/explainers/smart_contracts/)[ community](https://medium.com/@tjayrush/smart-contracts-are-immutable-thats-amazing-and-it-sucks-e0fbc7b0ec16#.sl3xvhf0w) to refer to any complex program that is stored and executed on a blockchain.\n\nCalling these programs *contracts* is helpful in that this code is governing something important or valuable. We only go to the trouble of creating a binding contract when it‚Äôs important that we be able to enforce the terms. Similarly, we only use smart contract code when the code controls something important, like money or identity.\n\nThat said, smart contract code need not resemble anything we would ordinarily think of as a ‚Äúcontract‚Äù. While the code could articulate a conditional financial transaction (‚Äúsend 1 BTC from Alice to Bob on July 1, 2016‚Äù), it could also be a governance application that controls account permissions (‚Äúif Alice has voted yes, remove Bob‚Äôs voting rights over Application X and notify the following accounts‚Ä¶‚Äù).\n\nIn many cases, smart contract code is not used in isolation but as a small piece in a larger application. Every DApp, DAO, or other blockchain-based application is built using smart contract code to perform operations on their chosen blockchain. Any Ethereum application that you‚Äôve read about ‚Äî like [Augur](http://augur.net/), [Slock.it](http://slock.it/), or [Boardroom](http://boardroom.to/) ‚Äî is made out of smart contract code.\n\n## Imperfect, misleading, and someday outdated\n\nThe term receives a lot of valid criticism. Relying on the metaphor of a ‚Äúcontract‚Äù is misleading because it emphasizes a single narrow use case. The term fails to capture one of the key capabilities of blockchain programs: that they have a kind of independent agency.\n\nSmart contract programs can *themselves* hold balances of cryptocurrency, or even control other smart contract programs. Once they are created, they can act autonomously when called to perform an action. For this reason, many prefer the term ‚Äúsmart agent‚Äù, analogous to the more general concept of a [software agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent).\n\nEventually, this use of the term may simply fade from use as blockchain technology matures.\n\nDevelopers will be more likely to refer to a specific language (‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look at your [Solidity code](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)‚Äù) or platform (‚ÄúOur application runs on [Eris.db](https://erisindustries.com/components/erisdb/)‚Äù) that they are working with, as opposed to a generic term that could describe any complex operation on a blockchain.\n\nThe capabilities and purpose of smart contract code as distinct from *other* code may simply become clear from context, without requiring the use of a clumsy analogy like ‚Äúcontract‚Äù. It might end up being more similar to how we speak of HTML and JavaScript today, without having to think about how the former is a ‚Äúmarkup‚Äù language, playing a distinct role from JavaScript in the overall web application.\n\n## Smart contracts as smart legal contracts\n\nAmong those who work in finance or law, the term ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù is often read quite differently than the definition above.\n\n‚ÄúSmart contract‚Äù here refers to a specific *use case of smart-contract code* ‚Äî a way of using blockchain technology to complement, or replace, existing legal contracts. This is the definition of the term I considered in [my last piece](https://stark.mirror.xyz/IUqivJ5jeQiCRnwlwkAhGSJtT5pSAPpqbBJvyUN0nCg): the use of code to articulate, verify, and enforce an agreement between parties. A smart *legal* contract.\n\nThese smart legal contracts would most likely be a combination of smart contract code and more traditional legal language. For instance, imagine a supplier of goods enters into a smart legal contract with a retailer. The payment terms could be defined in code and executed[ automatically when delivery is made](https://www.loaddelivered.com/blog/why-blockchain-is-a-game-changer-for-supply-chain-management/). But the retailer would likely insist the contract include an [indemnity clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indemnity), whereby the supplier agrees to indemnify the retailer against claims flowing from a defective product. There would be no point representing this clause in code, since it is not something that can self-execute ‚Äî it exists to be interpreted and enforced by a court in the case of litigation.\n\nCommercial agreements are full of boilerplate clauses that protect parties from various edge-case liabilities, and these are not always suitable for representation and execution through code, meaning that smart legal contracts will require (at least for the foreseeable future) a blend between code and natural language.\n\nThis is the basic idea behind Eris Industries‚Äô [dual integration](https://erisindustries.com/components/erislegal/) system, Primavera de Fillipi‚Äôs proposed [Legal Framework for Crypto-Ledger Transactions](http://p2pfoundation.net/Legal_Framework_For_Crypto-Ledger_Transactions), and R3‚Äôs Corda [smart contracts system](http://www.coindesk.com/barclays-smart-contracts-templates-demo-r3-corda/).\n\nCould smart legal contracts ever be considered legally enforceable? Probably. Despite what many think, the conditions under which an agreement becomes a legally enforceable contract are flexible and attuned to the underlying relationship between the parties, rather than dependent on the form the contract takes. Anything from a verbal agreement to an email conversation can become a contract at law, if the [basic elements of a contract can be found](https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/unpacking-the-term-smart-contract-e63238f7db65#.nak50tdkj).\n\n## Many contracts, many use cases\n\nThe category of smart legal contracts is complicated by the fact that there are many different types of contracts in the world, only some of which are obvious candidates for use as ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù. A legal contract could be anything from a verbal agreement for someone to paint your house to a derivative traded electronically in financial markets.\n\nSince early 2015, the use cases attracting the most attention are [smart legal contracts as smart ](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2016/04/the-blockchain-revolution/)*[financial instruments](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2016/04/the-blockchain-revolution/)* like shares, bonds, or derivatives contracts. Articulating these contracts in code could allow financial markets to become more automated and simplify many process-intensive systems related to trading and servicing of financial instruments.\n\nThese ‚Äúsmart financial instruments‚Äù do not exist at scale today, although many people are working to build them. R3‚Äôs recently announced [Corda platform](http://www.coindesk.com/9-takeaways-r3s-new-distributed-ledger-tech/) is designed to facilitate this type of smart-contract. Digital Asset Holdings [recently acqui-hired Elevance](http://www.coindesk.com/digital-asset-acquires-elevence/), a Swiss firm that has developed a way to model financial agreements in code. In April, Barclays‚Äô [revealed details of a scheme](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/19/barclays-used-blockchain-tech-to-trade-derivatives.html), in cooperation with R3, to represent ISDA agreements in smart contract code.\n\nFinancial instruments are just one type of contract that could benefit from blockchain code. As the technology matures, other assets ‚Äî e.g. real estate, or intellectual property ‚Äî may be stored and traded over blockchain systems. As new asset types go ‚Äúon-chain‚Äù, the agreements used to govern those assets in the world today (like a mortgage or licensing agreement) may benefit from blockchain-based analogs.\n\n## Alternatives to traditional legal agreements\n\nMany advocates for blockchain technology see larger possibilities. Rather than merely imitate or complement the legal contracts we use today, perhaps smart contract code could be used to facilitate new types of commercial arrangements.\n\nWe might even call this a third definition of the term: using smart contract code to create novel, alternative forms of agreements that are nonetheless commercially useful. Let‚Äôs call these ‚Äúsmart *alternative* contracts‚Äù.\n\nThis approach takes a broader view of the real-world problem solved by contracts. Commerce depends on individuals being able to form stable, predictable agreements with one another. Contracts, along with a strong legal system, are the primary mechanisms we use to shape each party‚Äôs incentives to the point where they have sufficient confidence in their relationship to engage in the risky business of trade.\n\nBut perhaps legal agreements are not the only solution to this general problem. Smart contract code offers a new set of tools to articulate and enforce terms, and they can be used to create systems of incentives that may be sufficient to make commercial relationships possible.\n\nThe most widely discussed opportunity of this type is machine-to-machine commerce. The growing ecosystem of smart devices ‚Äî particularly those that are in some fashion autonomous ‚Äî will eventually need a way to engage in basic commercial interactions with one another. For instance, a washer that [buys its own detergent](http://www.coindesk.com/ibm-reveals-proof-concept-blockchain-powered-internet-things) or a [car that can pay to recharge itself](http://www.coindesk.com/german-utility-company-turns-to-blockchain-amid-shifting-energy-landscape/).\n\nThese transactions still require a minimum level of trust to be commercially viable, but are ill-suited for legal contracts, which are comparatively expensive and require the involvement of legal persons like a corporation or human. Smart alternative contracts might enable an entirely new type of commerce carried out between our computers, cars, phones, and appliances.\n\nThere probably are ‚Äî or will be ‚Äî other types of commercial interaction that aren‚Äôt well suited to traditional legal contracts. New markets, suddenly made possible by technology, but which are underserved by legal tools that are slow to innovate and adapt.\n\nSmart alternative contracts might let us stretch the web of trust out a little further, a little faster, beyond the reach of the legal system, where they can enable new forms of commerce not possible today.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe lack of clear terminology in this field is an unfortunate reality. Those of us who work in the blockchain space should be mindful of how the term is being used in different communities, and be prepared to ask a series of annoying, though necessary, clarifying questions when asked about the nature and potential of ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù.\n\nThe different uses of the term illustrate a broader challenge in our industry. The interdisciplinary nature of blockchain technology, and ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù in particular, lead people to see the technology as primarily belonging to their own discipline, at the expense of the others.Lawyers often look at smart contracts and see marginally improved legal agreements, without appreciating the fuller potential of blockchain-code to extend beyond law‚Äôs reach.\n\nDevelopers, on the other hand, consider smart contracts and see the limitless possibilities of software, without appreciating the subtleties and commercial realities reflected in traditional legal agreements.\n\nAs with any interdisciplinary field, both must learn from the other.", "timestamp": 1631898299, "digest": "7g0Bmjw8uJKCBvUKBPcfAN50eXDrvvgHdOqdQ1Eko3Y", "contributor": "0x4aa9C5546BE68486c4eF264a230D25674a1A728e"}
