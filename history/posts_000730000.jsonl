Where buying art, voting, fundraising, and even social media were not controlled by a central company or intermediary, but rather an open-source, community-run network where code runs without interference. In 2013 Vitalik Buterin, an 18-year-old Bitcoin enthusiast and writer proposed the tools to make that future possible. Less than a decade later, thousands of developers have contributed to building the Ethereum ecosystem: a technology that enables decentralized applications, including but not limited to money. For many, [Ethereum is building the internet of value](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-building-internet-of-value). \n\nBut as Ethereum grows in size and popularity, it faces mounting pressure from cutting-edge competitors, hype markets, and criticisms for its scalability and energy consumption. Spearheaded by a global team of researchers and developers, a push to upgrade the platform could address the criticisms and unlock the technology's full potential... or it could derail the still-budding $300 billion network. \n\nFollowing the high-stakes journey to upgrade the platform, ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN is a feature-length documentary film that explores the innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain, the die-hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik Buterin, whose vision for the internet has the potential to change the world.\n\n[](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/videos/vitalik-interview.mp4?controls=true)\n\n### The Infinite Garden\n\nIn this film, we approach Ethereum as an “infinite garden.” Instead of thinking of Ethereum as a machine controlled by a central brain, we see it as a decentralized ecosystem with soil, plants, and insects that need to be cared for in order to grow. \n\nThe idea of the infinite garden was conceptualized by Aya Miyaguchi, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. She was inspired by James P. Carse’s book *Finite and Infinite Games*. The following basic principles are at its core: \n\n- A finite game is played for the purpose of winning; An infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the play\n- The rules of finite games may not change; the rules of infinite games must change\n- Finite players play within boundaries; Infinite players play without boundaries\n- Finite players are serious; Infinite players are playful\n- Finite players play to win titles; Infinite players have nothing but their names\n- A finite player plays to be powerful; an infinite player plays with strength\n- Finite players are theatrical; infinite players are dramatic\n- A finite player consumes time; an infinite player generates time\n- The finite players aims to win eternal life; the infinite player aims for eternal birth\n\nThose who tend to the seeds they plant in the Ethereum garden can nurture and empower the ecosystem, but can also harm it. For a crypto culture to remain equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, it must be tended to carefully. ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN will introduce us to these early “gardeners” of the platform as they face the mounting pressures and challenges of the growing ecosystem.\n\n### Director's Statement\n\nAs a kid, I grew up in a strictly open-source household. My dad’s radical adoration of Linux introduced me to the potential of community-led technology (and mind blowing internet [weirdness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5x5OXfe9KY)) before I was even in grade school. Today, I feel that same excitement my dad once felt, but for Ethereum and the unique community that powers it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4406f2a-503f-46ec-ba6b-89db89fdd8df.jpeg?height=2336&width=8742&size=large)\n\nMy hope is to make Ethereum accessible and understandable to the world. By highlighting diverse stories from the global network of developers, founders, and end-users, we can create an emotional and human record of Ethereum’s journey. From the inspiring Axie Infinity gamers in the Philippines supporting their families during COVID to the tireless developers making Proof of Stake possible, there already is a bountiful garden to explore. \n\nThirty years from now, when our children look back from a world powered by programmable blockchain technology, they will wonder who was behind it, what challenges they faced, and what sacrifices they made. Instead of boring them with scattered memories and poor explanations of the “[Just Keep Chugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvr0xYeV94M)” meme, let's give them ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN.\n\n*-Zach Ingrasci, Director*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ed408928-e082-4606-ad6c-f393ec2fb501.jpeg?height=4500&width=8000&size=medium)\n\n### Projected Timeline \n\n- Spring - Summer 2021: Development & Casting\n- Summer 2021- Winter 2022: Principle Photography \n- Spring 2022: Begin Edit\n- Summer 2022: Rough Cut\n- Fall 2022: Lock Picture\n- Winter 2023: Festival Premiere/ Release\n\n### A note from the NFT artist\n\n> This piece excites me because it's probably one of the first NFTs that also doubles as a movie poster and represents so much of what the community believes in. It reflects my interpretation of an \"infinite garden\" and uses a color palette that cross references the main illustration from the Ethereum website as well as my previous work. I find myself in a unique position standing at the intersection of NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi, and I definitely don't want to take this attention for granted. I feel a degree of responsibility to help spread awareness to these topics in a positive and eloquent way, and this documentary certainly is a step in that direction.\n\n*—pplpleasr, NFT Artist*\n\n**pplpleasr**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d694da66-57b2-4903-b109-6d654d6f9a76.jpeg?height=320&width=320)\n\n[pplpleasr](https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1) is a multidisciplinary artist based in NYC.

In our efforts to be on the cutting edge of this technological revolution, Leaving Records is honored to be challenging the notion of what a record label could be in the 21st Century. \n\nCollectively-governed entities known as DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) allow like-minded people across the Internet to come together to achieve shared goals in a radically new way. Without relying on a single authority figure, the DAO’s operations are decided upon by its members. \n\nWe owe our sustainability to artists, friends, and supporters — **the community**. Experimenting in Web 3.0 territory, we will now engage in ways to further the coordination & operation of Leaving Records from within our community.       \n\n\n**Introducing GENRE DAO**\nGENRE is our community token that symbolizes membership in the Leaving Records All-Genre DAO community. GENRE is also a governance token for the GENRE DAO community members, including (but not limited to) Artists from the Leaving Records catalog, Day1 NFT holders, and the greater community adding value to the GENRE DAO Treasury (more details on this to come).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/08690161-da17-4f37-8be3-fbdc8c53f576.jpeg?height=3953&width=3953)\n\n*Artwork by [Dazer](https://www.ddazerr.com/) (aka Jordan Rundle)*\n\n\n**Leaving Records All-Genre DAO Values**\n- Providing a safe space for the uplifting of underground, experimental, and marginalized music & community via our resources platform.\n- All Genre-embracing curation & facilitation via record label platform + publicly accessible events platform online and IRL.\n- Advocation of alternative, experimental lifestyle & creative practice.\n\n\n**We are here now** \nJoin our Discord to claim 10 GENRE here: https://discord.gg/zwPsCpzfjX.

{"id": "w15nPqtKgQ2rCX6YXR1sWd2iS5csJkgv65ySYY0VYfY", "title": "The Bad Marriage Problem", "body": "Over the last 18 months, the early-stage financing market has seen dramatic changes characterized by these three things:\n\n*   A shift from in-person fundraising to virtual fundraising\n*   A reduction in financing process timelines from months to weeks\n*   A continued increase in the amount of capital available for early stage companies\n\nI believe that for the most part, these changes will be permanent.\n\nAnd I believe that for the most part, these changes are good for early-stage company formation and innovation.\n\nHowever, there will be some negative side effects from these changes and one that I worry about is the “bad marriage problem.” Unlike public markets, private market investments are held for many years, often a decade or more. If an investor and an entrepreneur find each other difficult to work with, there is no easy solution. There is no divorce court for startups. And so the result is likely to be entrepreneurs and investors getting stuck in bad marriages.\n\nThere are a few opportunities to address this issue. There is a vibrant secondary market for private investments and while it is mostly limited today to well-known later-stage companies, it could develop into a broader market as the capital seeking to get invested in early-stage innovation continues to grow unabated. It is unlikely that founders will be able to force investors out of their cap tables via the secondary markets, but a voluntary separation via the secondary market seems more likely to me.\n\nI also think startup boards need to evolve. There should be many more independent directors and many fewer investor directors on startup boards. Investors should be more open to observer seats and founders should have more say in which investors sit on their boards. I am not arguing that founders should control their boards, but I am arguing that investors should not control the boards. I think independent control is the most sustainable solution.\n\nWe know that bad marriages are hurtful to everyone, not just the spouses. Companies that have dysfunctional founder/investor relationships suffer from them. And the shotgun marriage environment we are operating in right now (and for the foreseeable future) will likely create more of them. So we should be thinking about solutions to end these bad marriages and let everyone move on to better ones.\n", "timestamp": 1626698910, "digest": "Q6BDFZ9jRmn18Wj_Q19TnTKCLU8Ewk3G1IbKXTpzJ8A", "contributor": "0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136"}

Our community is full of thousands of smart, talented individuals looking to get hands-on experience working for a DAO.\n\nA common frustration we hear from many is how hard it is to “break into” existing DAOs. There are hundreds of people who want to participate, but have yet to find their way into an operational role.\n\nSo we asked ourselves…\n\nWhat if we used Mirror’s full set of creator empowering tools to launch a DAO that supports creative projects on Mirror, and gives individuals hands-on experience in building and operating a DAO?\n\nWell, today we’re excited to announce mClub: a Grant Giving DAO focused on the Mirror Ecosystem. \n\n### The mClub Mission\n\nFirst and foremost, mCLUB is about hands on learning. Web 3 needs to be experienced and this project is about creating an opportunity for you to go from 0 to 1 in setting up and operating a DAO. \n\nThat said, a DAOs needs a mission to catalyze interest and focus efforts. So here's what we're thinking: \n\nmCLUB's Mission: To be the leading community DAO focused on the Mirror ecosystem.\n\nSpecifically, mCLUB DAO aims to be:\n\n1.

Our community is full of thousands of smart, talented individuals looking to get hands-on experience working for a DAO.\n\nA common frustration we hear from many is how hard it is to “break into” existing DAOs. There are hundreds of people who want to participate, but have yet to find their way into an operational role.\n\nSo we asked ourselves…\n\nWhat if we used Mirror’s full set of creator empowering tools to launch a DAO that supports creative projects on Mirror, and gives individuals hands-on experience in building and operating a DAO?\n\nWell, today we’re excited to announce mClub: a Grant Giving DAO focused on the Mirror Ecosystem. \n\n### The mClub Mission\n\nFirst and foremost, mCLUB is about hands on learning. Web 3 needs to be experienced and this project is about creating an opportunity for you to go from 0 to 1 in setting up and operating a DAO. \n\nThat said, a DAOs needs a mission to catalyze interest and focus efforts. So here's what we're thinking: \n\nmCLUB's Mission: To be the leading community DAO focused on the Mirror ecosystem.\n\nSpecifically, mCLUB DAO aims to be:\n\n1. The foremost backer of projects, and collector of tokens, on Mirror.\n2. The premier media publication focused on the Mirror ecosystem.\n\n### Why Mirror?\n\nMirror somehow manages to both reveal the capabilities of crypto while also making it easy and “indistinguishable from magic”.\n\nThis makes it a prime tool to help onboard new creators into crypto.\n\nFor months they’ve consistently delivered new functionality that gives creators on chain super powers.

Matthewdavid), nearing 200 releases from artists worldwide.\n\n**Where we are going** \nThe new technologies and [mindsets powering Web 3.0](https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b) can profoundly change how music is created, appreciated, and shared between artists and their communities. In our efforts to be on the cutting edge of this technological revolution, Leaving Records is honored to be challenging the notion of what a record label could be in the 21st Century. \n\nCollectively-governed entities known as DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) allow like-minded people across the Internet to come together to achieve shared goals in a radically new way. Without relying on a single authority figure, the DAO’s operations are decided upon by its members. \n\nWe owe our sustainability to artists, friends, and supporters — **the community**. Experimenting in Web 3.0 territory, we will now engage in ways to further the coordination & operation of Leaving Records from within our community.       \n\n\n**Introducing GENRE DAO**\nGENRE is our community token that symbolizes membership in the Leaving Records All-Genre DAO community. GENRE is also a governance token for the GENRE DAO community members, including (but not limited to) Artists from the Leaving Records catalog, Day1 NFT holders, and the greater community adding value to the GENRE DAO Treasury (more details on this to come).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/08690161-da17-4f37-8be3-fbdc8c53f576.jpeg?height=3953&width=3953)\n\n*Artwork by [Dazer](https://www.ddazerr.com/) (aka Jordan Rundle)*\n\n\n**Leaving Records All-Genre DAO Values**\n- Providing a safe space for the uplifting of underground, experimental, and marginalized music & community via our resources platform.\n- All Genre-embracing curation & facilitation via record label platform + publicly accessible events platform online and IRL.\n- Advocation of alternative, experimental lifestyle & creative practice.\n\n\n**We are here now** \nJoin our Discord to claim 10 GENRE here: https://discord.gg/zwPsCpzfjX.
