Asset Heavy in the Digital World.", "body": "*This essay was published on [Forefront](https://forefront.news/blog/feat-shreyas-physical-digital-world). It is summarized below.*\n\nCrypto is partly a resistance to the decline in ownership. Home and car ownership have declined. Digital goods are rented on platforms. Software is licensed via subscriptions. But you actually own the private keys to your crypto. That opens up a universe of internet-native assets that you can own and control. These include digital art, media, online communities, video game collectibles, and many other things we haven't created yet.\n\nThese are some of the interesting experiments on digital ownership: \n- [Cryptomedia](https://cryptomedia.wtf/)\n- Unique digital experiences like the [Metapalooza event](https://andrewsteinwold.substack.com/p/-metapalooza-making-history-with)\n- Communities built around NFTs like [WHALE](https://forefront.news/creators/whale)\n- [Crowdfunding](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ) writing via NFTs\n- Incorporating status games into cryptonetworks via NFTs\n\nThere are two problems today. First, token IDs are scarce but the [metadata isn't](https://outpost-protocol.com/jamm/post/lbH2RrWaSHjBAVRg40vJJ5T00sZtwIWsmKA3Jg2flis). Second, metaverse experiences are low-fidelity today. We should be able to integrate more of our body, senses, and physical world with computing.\n\nIn the future, it is possible that the metaverse becomes so engaging and entertaining that it distracts us from important things in the physical world.\n\n> \"Instead of violent wars, there could be violent video games; instead of heroic feats, there could be thrilling amusement park rides; instead of serious thought, there could be 'intrigues of all sorts', as in a soap opera. It is a world where people spend their lives amusing themselves to death.\" - Peter Thiel.\n\nOver the next few years, people will be able to truly own more digital assets. Creators and communities will be able to capture more of the value that they create. We will build out various components of the metaverse and hopefully ensure that the digital goods and experiences we create are interoperable between platforms.\n\n", "timestamp": 1611850915, "digest": "cq_BZbiZzgFyCXqyeSR3U-i3GeODJh6qoDNm2HxYjq4", "contributor": "0x10D6d2e343281D388291A3e02f3293AaEdA67178"}

This will allow me to devote my full time to writing the piece, while allowing it to exist as a public good for anyone to read.\n\nUnlike other patronage models, this form of crowdfunding is not pure altruism. Instead, patrons receive a stake in the success of the work. Here's how it works:\n\n1. The essay exists as permanent, public data published via Mirror.\n2. That essay is minted as an NFT on the new [Zora protocol](https://cryptomedia.wtf/).\n3. Backers can send ETH to the crowdfund in exchange for $ESSAY tokens.\n4. When the NFT is sold, the ETH in the contract increases\n5. $ESSAY tokens can be bought and sold like any other ERC-20 token, or redeemed for underlying ETH.\n6. Participants in the initial crowdfund will be embedded in the essay forever, as the supporters who made it possible.\n\n### Inspiration\nOver the past couple years, paid writing has made great strides, with Substack popularizing newsletter subscriptions as the dominant business model for writing online. However, the paid newsletter model only works for a certain kind of writing - something regular, consistent, and often a bit shorter.\n\nWhile newsletters are great for many reasons, we also need other business models for writing. Some of the greatest thinkers around are primarily dedicated to something besides publishing their ideas on a regular cadence, and therefore won't be found starting a weekly newsletter. Even those who *are* dedicated to writing often produce their best work after weeks or months of research, not by writing a new piece every few days. Unfortunately, these kinds of writers face a tough choice today: adapt their work to a newsletter format, or write without being paid.\n\nEven for writers running successful newsletters, there's an inherent tradeoff in the subscription format: in order to monetize their content, writers must hide some, if not all of their work, behind a paywall, reserved for those who pay to subscribe. With each new piece is a choice between rewarding those who pay and sharing ideas widely.\n\nThe tools we have at our disposal influence the kind of work we create, and when the only tool around for getting paid to write is a newsletter publisher, it's no wonder we see more and more newsletters, and less of everything else.\n\nOther formats and styles of writing are obviously valuable and worth paying for, and for this reason alone it's worth experimenting with new funding models. I believe that these issues can be solved if we can introduce effective new business models for writing.\n\nThis week, in an attempt to move towards that goal, I'm pursuing my own writing under the new crowdfunding model described above. This model has been on my mind for awhile, and I'm really curious to see if it's possible.\n\nIf my funding goal is hit, the piece will be published publicly, free for everyone to read and share, while those who funded it hold ownership. If the funding goal isn't hit, everyone will receive their money back.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7d42a4b3-363c-4b13-b7f3-592d3b9cb6c1.jpeg?height=1340&width=2400)\n\nThough not proven, I believe this model can can solve both of the problems mentioned above:\n\n1. It offers a path to being paid for a one-off work that's not part of a subscription or newsletter.\n2. It offers a way to monetize work that remains a public good, without a paywall.\n\nIf this experiment is a success, it will mark an early promising sign for a new way to fund not just writing, but all kinds of creative work.\n\nThat all being said, I hope you'll stick around to fund, share, or at least observe as we try something new. The abstract is below, along with some information about me.\n\n### About Me\nI’m a product designer and software engineer, mostly involved in helping early stage startups design and grow products in interesting markets. I started my career as a software engineer at Snapchat, then founded a startup, which went through Y Combinator in 2018. Since then, I've worked as a designer and consultant for several startups and investors, including WorkOS, Muze, a16z Crypto, and Y Combinator, where I help out part-time with admissions. You can find me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer).\n\nI typically write 1-2 longer essays each year, most often concerning new insights around startup strategy and product design. Among them, my [Spatial Software](https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware/) post from last year was probably the most popular, describing a wave of new products being built around game-like interfaces and what makes them unique.\n", "timestamp": 1611857589, "digest": "RUeJfZEZxr-hkuzUCakQyUuf2kOJVMPPiAWBaQFhhqc", "contributor": "0xB0623C91c65621df716aB8aFE5f66656B21A9108"}

What kind of new bonds will they form with their readers? How will it shape the streams of discovery via social networks?\n\nThese are a radical idea that will foster more collaboration in across new, nested networks, to fund creativity.

Whereas a dollar bill has the same value as any other dollar bill (meaning they are fungible), one car has a drastically different value from another (meaning they are non-fungible).\n\nNFTs frequently represent scarce digital content, and allow for provable ownership (otherwise known as provenance) of media files which have historically been free to reproduce.\n\nNFTs allow creators to assign scarcity and value to a digital file, including anything from text to images, videos and sound. \n\n`https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1347395072933838851?s=20`\n\nThink of a digital version of the Mona Lisa, where anyone can take a screenshot - but there is only one true owner. This is an NFT.\n\n## NFT Issuance\n\nThe process of creating an NFT is not as scary.\n\nCreators upload files like mp4s, gifs or jpgs to a distributed database like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and issue a token that includes that file in its metadata.\n\nI found this description from the [NFT Skeptics Guide](https://justincone.com/posts/nft-skeptics-guide/) particularly accurate as it demystifies the seemingly dodgy world of web3.\n\n‘Token + Media = Cryptoart’\n\nThe token itself is not cryptoart. The NFT points to something else and says ‘Hey, this thing and I are joined at the hip. We’re inseparable. Think of us as one’ \n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f503408e-8428-418a-91db-8ce898492374.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\nEveryone knows how to create a mp4, gif, and jpg, but very few people know how to issue a token on a blockchain.\n\nThis is where issuers - or platforms that help users create (or issue) tokens come into play.\n\n## Issuance Landscape\n\nDepicted below is a list of all the projects mentioned in my exploration of the NFT landscape today.\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f08dde91-b46c-49cb-8eae-b227c09dac55.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n*Designed by [Carlos Gomes](https://twitter.com/carlosecgomes) of Forefront.*\n\nLet’s dive into a couple key players and identify what makes them unique in NFT conversations happening today.\n\n### SuperRare\n\n[SuperRare](https://superrare.co/) allows whitelisted creators to issue 1/1 NFTs, exemplifying the name ‘Super Rare’ by leaning on the fact that each and every token is highly exclusive and of the finest quality.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/18159)\n\nCuration on SuperRare is key, as only about 1% of all applicants make their way onto the platform.\n\nSuperRare places a strong emphasis on the social nature of NFT collecting, allowing users to like posts and share their collection through a username linked to their Ethereum wallet.\n\nAll purchases on SuperRare are made exclusively in ETH.\n\n`https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1349811824082911232?s=20`\n\n### Nifty Gateway\n\n[Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/) is currently leading in sales volume, largely thanks to its fiat onramps that allow collectors to purchase NFTs with a credit card.\n\nWhile Nifty also offers 1/1 pieces, it’s seen the most success from the issuance of editions - or multiple copies of a specific type of NFTs. \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xa20f75be9427995e596788c29a10c7d734671251/5600020036)\n\nNifty leverages ‘[open editions](https://niftygateway.com/collections/everything)’ or FOMO-induced drops in which an unlimited number of editions can be for a finite period of time (commonly 5 minutes or less). \n\nEach open edition is sold at a base price, and after the window closes, no more of that NFT are ever issued. This has led to a vibrant secondary market and the emergence of novel releases including ‘packs’ or NFT drops with different rarities received at the time of purchase.\n\nNifty also leans heavily on curation, as only whitelisted creators are able to release NFTs, almost all of which are marketed as ‘drops’ that sell out in a matter of minutes.\n\n`https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1352774900163829760?s=20`\n\n### Rarible\n\nNot all NFT marketplaces require permission to access.\n\n[Rarible](https://rarible.com/) allows anyone to quickly and easily issue an NFT, and is underpinned by a governance token - [RARI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rarible) - that gives users the ability to vote on changes to the protocol.\n\nWhile Rarible has had to deal with its fair share of growing pains including wash trading and fraud, the principle of allowing anyone to mint an NFT in a matter of seconds provides a fantastic testing ground for those new to the space.\n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430/18600)\n\nJust ask Marc Cuban, who minted his first NFT on Rarible earlier this week.\n\n`https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1354498247700709388?s=20`\n\n### Zora\n\n[Zora](https://zora.co/) offers a universal market protocol for media ownership through the standardization of cryptomedia - or NFTs that include both a media and market components.\n\nzNFTs add an order book directly to the NFT, allowing creators to buy and sell the token directly without having to interface through any of the platforms mentioned above.\n\nAll zNFTs are issued as 1/1’s and indexed as a part of a global registry, meaning no two NFTs can be replicated.\n\nWhile still in its infancy, Zora’s push to make NFTs platform agnostic has garnered interest from projects like [Catalog](https://catalog.works/) and [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) - both of which are utilizing Zora for the NFTs being issued on their respective products.\n\n### OpenSea\n\n[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) is an NFT issuance platform that doubles as the first NFT marketplace - offering a novel home for creators and collectors to access an aggregate view of all their NFTs collected from the various platforms listed above.\n\nOpenSea allows anyone to create NFTs, either as 1/1s or as editions.\n\nThe marketplace encompasses everything from crypto art to gaming assets and much more, and is long seen as the home for a global secondary market on any and all NFTs that exist today.\n\nOpenSea accepts a variety of different currencies, giving creators the ability to accept payment in ETH, DAI, USDC or custom social tokens like WHALE, COIN or HUE.\n\n## The Resources\n\nThe most important aspect of NFTs are the creators themselves - specifically with many of them releasing content across multiple marketplaces in various shapes and forms.\n\nI’ve found the best place to keep up with the top artists to be [cryptoart.io](https://cryptoart.io/) by [Richard Chen](https://twitter.com/richardchen39), offering a fantastic breakdown of the top sellers across SuperRare, Nifty Gateway, MakersPlace, Async Art, and KnownOrigin.\n\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6544aa15-594e-40e4-b540-b7bed4f1f762.jpeg?height=1040&width=2308)\n\nOther valuable resources to keep up with the ever changing NFT landscape include but are not limited to:\n\n### Starter Guides\n\n- [Collecting NFTs and Digital Art](https://www.loop-news.com/p/beginners-guide-collecting-nfts-and)\n- [Beginners Guide to NFTs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d)\n- [Non Fungible Tokens](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) -
