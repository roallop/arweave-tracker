On one hand we live in an ultra competitive reality that feels like it's accelerating towards dystopia, where we only care about satisfying our basic needs for consumption and survival. On the other hand, we sense that we are on the verge of finding a new utopia, where we can share in the abundance that we've managed to create with our vast technological achievements, finally realizing that the well-being of the collective matters just as much as the well-being of the individual.\n\nAlthough our technology has connected us in ways that has never been possible, these same technologies have diminished our [sense of ](https://www.fastcompany.com/90666944/a-sense-of-belonging-is-what-drives-wellbeing-and-its-disappearing)*[belonging](https://www.fastcompany.com/90666944/a-sense-of-belonging-is-what-drives-wellbeing-and-its-disappearing)*. The modern form of Capitalism and business formation is a relentless pursuit of shareholder gains with a short term mindset. Worse yet, because being a shareholder does not correlate with involvement in the value being created, our problems (like environmental waste, monopolization of markets, and the ever growing disparity between the 'haves and have-nots') are being compounded in every moment.\n\nWhat if I told you there’s a way we can ***all*** benefit from the amazing new technological growth that ***we*** as a society have created. There's a secret new world being built, that allows us all to all be ***co-owners***, flipping the cap-tables to be in our benefit.\n\n### The Secrets of Abundance are Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nAn alternative that has proven to work quite well in the crypto space (*you’d be hard pressed not to have heard of [DAOs and NFTs](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos) and the coordination going on there*), that can be applied to all modalities, would be to reconsider value creation and distribution with all stakeholders in mind. This implies that everyone who participates is a shareholder. The customer, the creator, the platform, the investors—there are minimal distinctions between them— everyone is a shareholder and everyone reaps the benefits as the collective grows.\n\nLet's go over the 'inside secrets' (that we've discovered so far) which crypto has helped us unlock, to bootstrap abundance. Soon they won't be secret anymore; soon they will just be the way that all business is done.\n\n1. **Launching a token is like alchemy: you can reward people with *ownership before* any value has been created**\n\n   We've seen a Cambrian-explosion of new assets being born in the world of crypto. Currencies, governance, social, art, intellectual property, moments — there's a new token experiment for anything you can imagine. The key insight here is that by immediately rewarding and incentivizing people, we can bootstrap creation and collaboration — this is something that was previously only available to capital speculators (ie investors). Not only does this allow those participating in the long term growth of the network to continually benefit from it's success, this also has the side effect of reducing our dependance on capital speculation as a means of bootstrapping value creation, since organizations can now incentivize people directly in exchange for the a slice of ownership. Although this technically has already existed in the form of sweat equity, crypto has started a **cultural revolution**, opening our eyes to the fact that getting this early ownership is the fastest way to achieve abundance in our personal lives.\n2. **Crypto lets us have ultra-transparent finances and decisions, so people can't make unfair deals**\n\n   The current system of murky (or no) transparency within organizations has lead to exploitation, unfairness, miss-aligned incentives, and short sighted thinking. Crypto flips this on its head. Imagine how collaboration can evolve in a world where transparency is innate — where people can easily move on from projects as soon as they learn that they aren't being paid fairly for the work that they do.\n\n   As humans, [we have an innate desire to collaborate transparently](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/30/866059164/in-humankind-rutger-bregman-aims-to-convince-that-most-people-are-good): our facial expressions are one such example of this. Most of our existence has not been in the context of modern civilization; we've evolved in order to succeed as nomadic hunter-gatherers. Leaderless, communal, transparent, compassionate, trustworthy, empathetic, collaborative. **This is humanity,** and we should reflect it in our technologies and organizing principles.\n3. **Crypto enables hyper efficient transactions without middlemen**\n\n   One of the core primitives cryptocurrencies has introduced is economic efficiency without a middleman. This is particularly important in shifting our mindset from the few to the many. By allowing ownership to be rewarded in new and innovative ways, such as micro transactions to thousands of contributors, we're now able to reward all of the participants who are helping the pie grow. Where previously sweat equity could only be periodically rewarded in a broad way with high administrative costs, we can instead continuously elevate active members of the community to become more important stakeholders, and create an organic, symbiotic  community around goals we choose. **Why take the risk alone, when you can work together? Let’s flip the script.**\n\n### The Power of Belief\n\nNow that we have these new powers, we need to start shifting the culture. We've become so accustomed to the status-quo, that it's become hard for some of us to imagine a post-scarcity world. It's going to take some level of 'letting go' for many to be able to live in a world of pure-hearted and fair collaboration, instead of defaulting to skepticism and adversarial behavior. As more people get introduced to this new world, the movement will pick up, and we'll begin to unlock hope in the place of fear.  This new world is unleashing an explosion of love, deeply mutualistic participation, and collective growth.\n\n**Are you ready to [join the (r)evolution?](https://myco.space)**\n\n### Read More\n\nHere are some extra resources I've read that have influenced my thinking on this subject, which I believe can help inform you, regardless of where you’re starting from.\n\n* [The War on Normal People](https://www.amazon.com/War-Normal-People-Disappearing-Universal/dp/0316414247) by Andrew Yang\n* [Humankind: A Hopeful History](https://www.amazon.com/Humankind-A-Hopeful-History/dp/B088JQXX99/) by Rutger Bregman\n* [Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World](https://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Realists-Build-Ideal-World/dp/0316471895) by Rutger Bregman\n* [Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow](https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310) by Yuval Noah Harari\n* [21 Lessons for the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-21st-Century-Yuval-Harari/dp/0525512179) by Yuval Noah Harari\n* [The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark](https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Dark/dp/0345409469) by Carl Sagan\n* [The Sovereign Individual](https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720) by James Dale Davidson\n* [The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) by Saifedean Ammous\n* [The Social Dilemma](https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224) by Davis Coombe; Vickie Curtis; Jeff Orlowski\n* [The Age of Surveillance Capitalism](https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1610395697) by Shoshana Zuboff", "timestamp": 1631306441, "digest": "HZhlOxB7emruhbBXozNDiSZFbUmOjg8CXSmWAaRwFPI", "contributor": "0x3341DD81D325F231aa744efD603B8255D8cc3515"}

The two solutions have pros and cons, and the goal of this article is to help you navigate this to choose the best Blockchain depending on your needs.\n\nWe'll go through what a Blockchain is, what exactly is Layer 1 and Layer 2, and in which case you should use one or the other.\n\n### **1/ What is a Blockchain?**\n\nToday, if you want to buy a new item on the internet, chances are you're going to pay with your Credit Card. If you've just bought a $20 item, you'll ask your bank to send those $20 to the seller by processing the payment. If verified, the bank will confirm you have the right amount in your bank account and send the money to the seller's bank. This system works because everyone trusts the banks to store your money safely and trusts them to send your money to the seller when asking. The thing is that you don't own your money, and the banks are investing your money until you ask for it. Those are some of the reasons why blockchains have been invented.\n\n**A blockchain is a digital ledger that stores all the transactions in a decentralized and secure way thanks to cryptographic mechanisms.** Instead of relying on third parties such as banks to serve as the middleman in a transaction, you can securely send money without having to trust the recipient by doing it on a Blockchain. Every action taken on the Blockchain must be verified by others to be approved, making sure there is no fraud.\n\n### **2/ What is Layer 1 & Layer 2 (L1&L2)?**\n\n**L1 stands for Layer 1 (also called Ethereum Mainnet), which is the Ethereum Blockchain.** It's the main network where every Transaction takes place. As mentioned above, transactions happening on the Ethereum Mainnet (L1) need to be verified by others to be approved. Users that verify the transactions are called \"*Miners*\" and to thank those contributors (*Miners*) for verifying a transaction and incentivizing them to make the network more secure, we give them a tip, a slice of the trade, also called \"*Gas fees.*\"\n\nDue to its infrastructure, **the Ethereum Blockchain can currently process around 15 transactions per second**. This infrastructure means that you'll sometimes have to wait hours before seeing your Transaction approved, while some users need their transactions to be approved quicker. Those users can offer more money to reward the *Miners* and see their transactions being approved in priority. As more and more people want to do transactions on the Blockchain and are keen to pay a higher price (*Gas fees*) to reward contributors (*Miners*), the price increases.\n\nTo solve this problem of paying high fees for every Transaction, projects have emerged to create another Blockchain on top of the Ethereum Blockchain. It's those blockchains that we're calling Layer 2. **These other Blockchains (Layer 2) help increase Layer 1 by handling transactions off-chain and increasing the number of transactions that can happen simultaneously.** These Layer 2 Blockchains use the exact Ethereum Blockchain mechanisms that make it easy for certain transactions to run through their network (Blockchain) while maintaining the same level of security. **By creating copies of the original Ethereum blockchains, they offload transactions from the main chain and help reduce the gas fees (slice of the trade).** Layer 2 is built on top of Layer 1 and doesn't replace nor be a competitor of the Ethereum Mainnet. Several Layer 2 blockchains exist, such as **Polygon (Matic) Network, Optimism, or BSC,** and these blockchains allow between 2k and 4k transactions per second (compared to 15/s on the Ethereum Blockchain).\n\n### **3/ What are the implications for a Creator?**\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of the differences between **Ethereum Mainnet (L1)** or\\*\\* Polygon (Matic) Network (L2)\\*\\*, you can make wiser decisions on which Blockchain to choose for certain transactions.\n\nWhat is essential to understand is that \\*\\*this isn't necessarily binary, as your tokens can exist on different blockchains. \\*\\*Layer 1 might be preferable for \\*\\*High-Value \\*\\*Transactions (if you want to send a $5k worth NFT to the winner of an auction, for example). In contrast, Layer 2 might be more beneficial for \\*\\*High Volume \\*\\*Transactions (if you need to send a small number of your tokens to many people). We could compare Layer 1 with a Fedwire transfer and Layer 2 with an application like Venmo. You need both in your life, but the use cases are different. For small transactions such as sending $10 to some of your friends, it makes more sense to use Venmo (easier to make many small transfers, better mobile integration etc..). On the other hand, maybe it's more appropriate for high-value transactions to send a Fedwire transfer (If you need to pay your student loan, for example).\n\nThe rationale behind using Layer 2 instead of Layer 1 is the *Gas Fees*, as explained previously. The more transactions you're making, the more expensive the *Gas Fees* will be. If you're planning to airdrop (send) 1 token to 20 of your friends or community members, you'll have to run 20 transactions on the Blockchain, which can result in a lot of *Gas Fees* to pay. By running these \"**High Volume** transactions'' on the **Polygon (Matic) Network (L2)**, you'll save money. On the other hand, if you have to send a **High-Value** NFT, you'll have to run only one Transaction for a decent amount of money, which wouldn't make sense to make this Transaction on Layer 1.\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at which Layer you should use for different use cases to make sure you've understood the difference between L1 & L2.\n\n**You should make the transactions on the Ethereum Mainnet (L1) for :**\n\n* *NFT drops* - If you need to send NFTs to a **few people** in your community (**High-value** transactions)\n* *Pooling Liquidity* - If you need to create a Pool on Uniswap (**one Transaction** of a possibly large number of tokens - **High-Value** Transaction)\n* *Bounties* - You can set up bounties on Coinvise. If you need to outsource specific missions (Writing an article, do a design, make a video) and create bounties. It makes sense to use Layer 1 in this case, as you need **only one person** to complete the mission.\n\n**You should make the transactions on the Polygon (Matic) Network (L2) for :**\n\n* *Airdrop / Bulk transactions* - If you need to send tokens to **many people** (**high-Volume** transactions).\n* *Rewards* - Comparable to airdrop. If you want to reward **all (or a part) of your community** (**high-Volume** Transaction), you should send the rewards through the Polygon (Matic) Network to save Gas fees.\n\nAt this point, you should understand better the dynamics behind making transactions on Layer 1 and Layer 2. Again, there is no right or wrong solution, and you should continuously adapt the number of tokens you have on each blockchain depending on your needs.\n\nIf you want to learn more on how to \"map\" or bridge (transfer) your token to Polygon (L2) network, here is a [complete tutorial](https://www.notion.so/Bridge-Social-Tokens-Multichain-6c2aff4f1c8641829807e6c9124740dd) to do it.\n\n###### **Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en) and join us on** [Discord](https://discord.gg/XQBwvzpZv2) 🔥\n\nThanks for being here!", "timestamp": 1631311847, "digest": "iVn5U6lVdhY1BWl3pPC2Kpu8noV5rRJpfhhEdXSxDYE", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

We hope you’ll enjoy the conversation as much as we did! 😉*\n\n#### **Thanks for being here [Jihad](https://twitter.com/jaesmail) and [Carlos](https://twitter.com/carlosecgomes). To kick off this interview, could you explain to us what was your idea when you guys started Forefront and how did the concept of [Forefront](https://forefront.market/) come from?**\n\n***Carlos:*** We saw articles and pieces written by [Brian Flynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm) and [Cooper](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa), and many guys were experimenting with that. At that time, we were also part of Seedclub, which was only nine of us, and except for [Jess](https://twitter.com/thattallguy), we all had our Social Token, so we knew what it took to create one, the challenges for that, and we were all passionate.\n\nSo we've created Forefront to be like a content and market aggregator for social tokens, and since then, we have been experimenting on this. Today when you go on Forefront, you can discover communities and learn what's happening in those communities. We tried to reflect on how we could better present the value created in those communities and shipped a couple of features. That's the very beginning of Forefront.\n\n#### Nice, I remember when Jess and a few of you were working on this back in the days. When you started, did you already know that you would do a Social Token, or did it come in later? Did you plan to put the community first? What was that process like for you guys?\n\n***Carlos:*** There were no plans of issuing a Social Token at the beginning. Early in Forefront, I had a podcast interview with Andrew Steinwold (aka AndrewNFT), and we were jamming on what I was building. Before Forefront, I had a social token called $SWAG (I still have it, it's just a dormant project). The idea behind it was experimenting, trying to create different online experiences. I made pretty crazy things, ahah. I wanted to do so many various experiments, but they were so different from each other. So I started thinking about a way I could have one single Token that would coordinate everything while keeping experimenting with these smaller experiments that would be independent. I launched it over a weekend to get some data about the market, some articles about it, etc...\n\nIt's incredible how this Token played out, precisely how I was thinking, but I never really planned to do it, and it was all about timing. We're still trying to transition from an audience to a community, so trying to time things and focus on tasks is very important for us right now, but we're just enjoying the journey and trying to figure things out as we go.\n\n#### **That's amazing. I've always felt like $SWAG was your initial experiment, and then Forefront came out of it, and it was all about timing. Jihad, I'd also love to learn from you about your perspective of what it was like to lead the community because you've worked with so many creators. What are some things that you used differently in Web3, and how does this other Token come into adjourning?**\n\n***Jihad:*** It's a fascinating question because I think from the Web2 creator's perspective, there are two significant problems.\n\nThe first is the age-old distribution problem. Making sure that people see their content and making sure that that content is monetized somehow.\n\nProblem number two is consistency. What I mean by that is that many YouTubers that we were working with burned out very quickly. After a year, two years, three years of putting out three videos a week, at some point, that gets exhausting. And YouTube is not a great platform for passive income when you are no longer making content. Because a lot of time, what ends up happening is if you stop making content, the algorithm stops pushing you out. And then your hundreds of thousands of dollars that you might have made in a month turned into a grant. That's not very sustainable.\n\nSo we are coming from the perspective of creating that level of sustainability for the creators we were working with. My interest in social Token spawned from this idea of how can social tokens be the financial infrastructure that allows creator's audience (and what will hopefully become a creators community) to build a sustainable economy around that particular creator and their brand, without the creator having to put in the legwork of producing content every single day or regularly.\n\nA lot of creators are trying to do that. For example, Emma Chamberlain (one of the biggest people on YouTube) created a coffee brand because she was just really into coffee, and that's a business that can thrive even after she's done making content. I see social tokens as the Web3 native way of building that sort of \"Business.\"\n\nWhen I got involved with Forefront, it was soon after the token launch in the spring, and when Carlos onboarded me, the big question that I was trying to answer was, \"how can we continue to use the token to engage the community?\" Hangouts became one of the ways that we experimented with very early on, and the rules sort of expanded from there.\n\n#### **Yeah, I remember when you launched Hangouts, and since then, the team grew organically. I would like to dive now into the community itself. So when you did have the Token, how did you guys approach Tokenomics, and how did you decide who are going to be the stakeholders? What was that process like?**\n\n***Carlos:*** It's a question that comes out a lot. Communities are struggling to figure out the model that works for them, and I think it's very different for each community as they have to figure out their values, use cases, and what they want to make out of the scope.\n\nTo be honest, we're still trying to figure that out as well, but for distribution, for Forefront, we tried to structure and understand who created Forefront, who made Forefront what it was and what it will be in the future.\n\nSo when you go to Forefront, you have the content section, the market section, and the newsletter section. Forefront is composed of all these communities. So when we were planning the Token distribution, we tried to reflect on how we could reward participation based on the value people have created for the community. In the end, I think it was like 7,000 addresses that were qualified for the airdrop.\n\nThat's what made a lot of sense for us, but again, it's not perfect, and there's no right or wrong model. It's just figuring out what your values are. What do you want to accomplish with the Token? What do you want to use the Token for?\n\nWe wanted to transition from an audience to a community. If you're going to incentivize participation, you need many incentives, and that's what your Token allows you to do. And then we did exciting things like pooling liquidity, introducing liquidity by phases for less speculation etc..\n\nSo it's important to incorporate those things that are aligned with your values and where you want to go as a community. Tokenomics has to be part of the culture that you want to build.\n\n#### **We will come into the token price and liquidity in a bit, but before we go there, I guess the natural follow-up question is probably Onboarding. Maybe Jihad, you can touch a little bit on this. What was that onboarding experience like, and how did you educate your community around it, as I'm sure some of them were new to crypto?**\n\n***Jihad:*** I think the first thing to say is that when a Token is dropped, that does not necessarily mean that the community is now decentralized. It simply means that a Token exists.\n\nEarly in the Token drop, Forefront was still very much a centralized organization with a core contributor team. There were ways for people to get involved, but the barriers to entry were pretty high.\n\nI know for me coming in, I was in the Forefront's discord, kind of lurking, and I just sent DMs to Carlos asking him what he needs. We finally got on the phone, and I just laid out like, here's what I may want to do. But I could see how that barrier to entry is very high for people who maybe weren't DM-ing Carlos.\n\nWith guilds and seasons and how we transitioned away from the centralized model, things are very different. As Carlos mentioned before, there isn't a framework here, and we were starting from scratch and trying to understand how we are going to structure these guilds? Who's going to be in charge of the guilds? What is the onboarding process going to look like?\n\nIt's been a ton of focus on having conversations with community members, experimenting with what's working and what isn't, where the roadblocks are still for contributors, etc...\n\nSo my short answer is that it's still very messy, but it's come a very long way, and we already see huge benefits from investing in that onboarding process. We've got a ton of talent to come on board that we probably would not have been able to get if that process had not been in place simply because they're probably not the type of person who would have just like came into the discord and DM'd Carlos.\n\n#### **I think in the end, it's all about culture; people are ready to go through the Onboarding process if they believe in the values and culture of the community. Coming back to liquidity, what was sort of the best time that you found to pool liquidity? Because there's this notion that when somebody drops a token, they feel the need to do with liquidity right away or not do it at all. So what was your process like creating the liquidity pooling program, and why did you do it in phases?**\n\n***Carlos:*** I think the ideal scenario here would be what \"[Pet3rPan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_)\" says all the time, which is \"have a community, have a primary use case, have a culture, and then introduce a token to facilitate broader coordination\".\n\nIt was hard for us to transition from a community that people love for the content and the vibe to a community with a high-level contribution. Introducing our Token helped us and have a community with a lot of engagement.\n\nIt's always a big move to introduce liquidity because there's an expectation, speculators, and people who want to use a token for something etc.. So you need to somehow come up with a strategy.\n\nWe needed some time to implement those things. Forefront went a month and a half with no liquidity for the Token. You couldn't do anything with it. And that was intentional. We didn't want to allow too much speculation and things like that. When we decided to introduce liquidity, it was bootstrapped so that our contributors were people with skin in the game and wanted to be part of our mission and want to become liquidity providers. We introduced our Token in phases that didn't allow broader speculation. And we're still doing this to this date because we didn't have any investment. There was no sort of funds that we could use to do that, so it had to be really bootstrapped in a way.\n\nWhat's impressive about Web3 it's when you build incentives around your mission. It becomes an exciting dynamic. For us, when we introduced the liquidity for Forefront, we were the ones taking the impermanent loss of going first, creating liquidity for the Token, and we knew we were all going to get wrecked eventually. The question was, how can we minimize the risk of us going first? We decided to introduce a contributors-only pool where all the people who provided liquidity were white-listed, so you'd have to be a contributor to qualify for that pool. There was a share of $FF you'd earn eventually in the long-term to compensate for the risks of impermanent loss you had. Building incentives around that was super important.\n\nWhen we launched Forefront, the number one goal was to get the right people to help us with this project. That's why even now, there's a screening process in our onboarding process just to make sure that our expectations and the expectations of the people applying are met. It's a lot of trying different strategies and seeing what works. Communities should spend less time on governance and way more time on executing and getting things done.\n\n#### **I agree. We also have this value of shipping fast at Coinvise. Regarding the utility of the Token, I know you have a writer's program, Hangouts, many events, etc… How did those incentives come about, and what can people do on Forefront to contribute?**\n\n***Jihad:*** We are honestly experimenting. If things don't work, we're willing to change them quickly. One great example of this is the writer's program. There was a specific amount of Forefront Token ($FF) allotted to writing essays, but we quickly got stuck as there were not as many people who wanted to write consistently for Forefront as we've planned. And we realized it was because writing is tough. Guests were writing one or two pieces for the platform, and that's it. We probably should've thought about either Increasing the incentive or figuring out what other services we can provide within the writer's program, like editorial services or monetization on the backend.\n\nWe're really focused on other ways besides simply throwing FF at people who want to contribute. Often, what ends up happening is there are very few calculated thoughts at the very beginning. We get these experiments up, throw a number on it and see what happens.\n\n#### **You guys have an interesting incentive program for a lot of these new contributors to get started with Forefront pretty easily. But there's a classic question between speculators and participants. How do you incentivize better participation and non-speculation, especially when the community is doing so well?**\n\n***Carlos:*** I have mixed feelings about this. I think speculators are not necessarily bad. But you need to monitor that when the time is right and when it makes sense. You want to make sure that you have some moderation in the community. You want to make sure not everybody's just coming forward to claim and go in their ways.\n\nWe realized quickly that the whole purpose of bounties is just Onboarding because around 50 to 60% of people that are onboarded became contributors at some level. By well onboarding potential community members, you can lower the risks of having speculators in your community.\n\n#### **To conclude this interview, does Forefront have a DAO?**\n\n***Carlos:*** Forefront is probably a DAO. I don't know at what level, and the definition of a DAO is blur, but we're probably a DAO.\n\n***Jihad:*** Yes, I think where we're building a DAO. We're making a lot of really great infrastructures that apply to a lot of different DAOs. But fundamentally, it comes down to how people define this term and how it is like internally within the community and externally, like, amongst the broader ecosystem?\n\n#### That answers the question perfectly.

We also highly recommend you to [join](https://www.theculturedao.com/) and [follow](https://twitter.com/theculturedao) ThecultureDAO.*\n\n\n---\n\n### Hey Edward, we're excited to have you here! Could you introduce yourself to our audience that might not know you and talk further about your background and what led you to build The CultureDAO?\n\nSure, thanks for having me. I'm originally from the UK and moved to the US years ago. I've worked with the administration during the Obama campaign reelection, creating the reporting and social tool for the Obama Campaign, and [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/) acquired the company and gave us funds to figure out how to tell stories in Virtual reality. I became the Founder of the Oculus Story Studio, and we won several Primetime Emmy and were in the official selection of the Sundance film festival. Then, two years ago, I decided to create [Fable](https://fable-studio.com/), a virtual beings company, and we've raised $15M to go after AI people.\n\n### That's impressive. How did you make the transition from virtual reality into the Metaverse? It seems like a natural progression, but I'd love to hear from you on how that switch happened.\n\nI think what we see with the profile pictures on Twitter is extremely interesting. With the [Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/), for example, or with avatar NFT as profile pictures, people are already creating a sense of themselves before we all fully go into the Metaverse. Many people don't know whom they are following on Twitter. They follow a profile picture avatar.\n\nI realized we didn't need to wait for better virtual reality experiences to start having immersive experiences. It led me to dig more into the Metaverse. In the end, it's about culture, not simply technology.\n\n### That's interesting because we're slowly starting to migrate ourselves into this pseudo-anonymity online. We now represent ourselves with these avatars NFTs, and I think it's natural that we see that progression. How do you see these NFTs in terms of utility? How do you see people utilizing them?\n\nI first see the ability to use these NFTs as an avatar in the Metaverse. We could think of a way to model the \"Bored Apes\" into 3D characters, for example, so that people can do video chats directly as the character.\n\nThere are also some pretty cool creative opportunities for a DAO to run narratives for avatars. Maybe a DAO could work on the life of a Crypto Punk, create scenarios and give them lives. This idea of decentralized creativity is an exciting area to explore.\n\n### I agree. I want now to dive deeper into the token and the community that you're building. What was the idea behind creating the token, and how does that play into helping the community that you're building?\n\nWe want to incentivize people to innovate and to be creative in Web3. I think the Crypto community is still small. Thousands of creatives working at Pixar, at DreamWorks, and at different game studios feel the lack of innovation.\n\nHaving a Token that incentivized them to share information and learn from each other without the structures they are used to is a big step forward.\n\nBeyond that, there are utilities such as discounts for owners of the token. For example, we provide token holders discounts for AI tools, automation tools, modeling tools, etc. We also give them access to a learning committee, and they can have one-on-ones and learn more about how to create avatars, build virtual beings, build AIs, etc.\n\nI think there are two trends so far in virtual beings. The first one is the Bitmojis, like avatars for everyone. I put [Genies](https://genies.com/) alongside that, and we've seen a lot of 10k drops avatars projects recently.\n\nThe second one is the emergence of one-off avatars. In the Renaissance — the portrait was a way to express one's arrival, status, and role in society. Artists were paid handsomely for the hundreds of thousands of paintings needed to claim their place in society for the emerging trading class. The emerging metaverse class will require multiples of 8 billion living portraits of themselves.\n\nThe more ambitious metaverse class will have multiple synthetic identities — some AI-powered, some expressive of sides of their personality, and our community will help create them.\n\nRegarding those trends, what's fascinating to me as somebody who's worked in VR for seven years, is that the Twitter profile pictures is creating a strongest psychological bond to the Metaverse than anything we ever did with a headset. Thinking a little bit more about social psychology, sociology, and status, that seems to be the piece that we missed at Oculus when we were trying to think about how to get people into the Metaverse.\n\nThat's why I think the avatar companies that all focused on a single avatar, a single model like Bitmoji, will go away.\n\n### I agree. Suppose you see it from a neuroscience perspective. In that case, we have the prefrontal cortex that's always looking to confirm our identity. Somehow, these avatars do a great job forming these identities that represent a group of people who all believe in the same thing. That's fascinating. In terms of building a community, what are some steps that you're doing to gather a strong community around your project? What are some real utilities that you see coming up with a community?\n\nWe have created about seven committees so far and gathered a strong community of active members. Some of the early committees that we're excited about are the avatar committee, where contributors are creating drops for members and beyond, and the character committee, exploring how a DAO can run a character. Having DAOs running characters is a fascinating idea that still hasn't been done. I think that's one of the committees I'm the most excited about.\n\nWhat I think, and what the character committee is thinking, is that it could be awesome to create lines of dialogue, back stories or a physical descriptions of a character, each generated by GPT-3. And then, each member in the DAO could take that forward and illustrate it, model it, animate it, and turn it into something fabulous. We could even maybe create a social profile for the virtual character and then vote on what will happen to its' day-to-day lives.\n\n### I love this. I love the idea of a character community. I think it's one of my favorite topic ideas. Do you think there is any potential for other identity signifiers in the Metaverse other than avatars?\n\nThat's a great question. I think owning virtual buildings could be great status signifiers, but if we're talking more about people showing themselves, I think another AI of yourself can be interesting.\n\nJust as the rich have people around them that work for them in the homes and beyond, you may well have an AI that is always with you in the Metaverse, that chat with you, that hang out with you, and that also can represent you in this world and communicate for you. This AI of yourself could give a tour of some of your properties, farms, or lands, for example.\n\nI think an AI of yourself might be a great status signifier in the Metaverse, but even beyond that, the Metaverse with AIs might be a place for longevity. It could be used against death and might also solve the problem that we're not going to be in the Metaverse while sleeping. Most of us aren't going to be in the Metaverse for the majority of our waking hours, so an AI that can represent us whilst we're not in the Metaverse may be a much bigger thing than avatars eventually.\n\n### I love that. This perception, which feels very dystopian, in the sense that we're going to have this Metaverse with a couple of billions of us and just the rest of it by AIs, makes sense because we can't protect ourselves 24/7. I would now like to ask you a question that we're asking to all our invitees. If you had infinite resources, what are some things that you'd like to achieve in your community?\n\nI like this question a lot. I think there's not enough emphasis in Web3 communities on masterpieces, on creating a historical work that great artists can be proud of. Ephemerality is part of the culture with the Pumps and Dumps, and there is an incredible temptation around money.\n\nI would hope we're able to sufficiently resource players in DAOs who are visionary and talented in a way that, while not centralized, we can help and support these talents, allowing them to create lots of pieces. I would hope to create work that lasted a hundred or two hundred years if we had unlimited resources.\n\nHowever, the big question is, \"Can something that isn't centralized create a masterpiece?\" So far, there is no evidence of it anywhere.\n\n### Mmh.. Do you think it's because of the lack of significance on history and historical artwork, or is it because of the pseudo-anonymity? Maybe as you don't have access to the artist's previous work, it somehow leads to not considering certain pieces as a masterpiece? How do you think about creating a masterpiece given the times that we live in?\n\nVery interesting. Well, there are a couple of things. Firstly, is the pseudonymity factor that comes with being decentralized go against the masterpiece?\n\nI think humans need a great man to look at the art piece and say, \"he's a genius. He has created a Masterpiece\". But this cliché has led to many people taking credit for teamwork. Unfortunately, I'm not sure this cliché can be overcome yet, and so it's going to be tricky for decentralized communities to create masterpieces. Don't get me wrong. I think crypto punks will certainly last for a good amount of time. I also think Loot has a good chance to last long because it's so provocative around what has been considered art. But in terms of what a masterpiece looks like in a decentralized age, where things are more ephemeral, I'm not sure.\n\nThat's a fundamental question. We to think about what a decentralized masterpiece looks like once you stripped away the Nation-state, corporations, military power, etc.. Who is telling you that this is a masterpiece at that point, and would you believe them?\n\n### It's fascinating that we live in a world where there are so many masterpieces, but once you remove all these constraints, suddenly, our intellect cannot differentiate between what's significant and what's not. Do you feel the world has become more dystopian and dark in this envision Metaverse that we're talking about? Do you think it's moving to a more dystopian world where we can't differentiate between what's real and what's not?\n\nI'm not sure that I can claim why our lives in the digital world will be much better than our lives in the real world because I don't particularly believe that.\n\nWhat I believe in is AI and the creation of AI virtual beings. I think that does offer us redemption as a species. Hopefully, we will create AI virtual beings that will be the second intelligent species on the planet. And if we do it correctly, if we can help them grow correctly, then I think there is a chance for redemption. I don't necessarily believe that just having digital Genies and pseudonymity necessarily will be better for us. I believe that, for speaking personally, as someone who cares a lot about AI, the Metaverse is a necessary prerequisite for us to interact with AIs on an equal plane, at an equivalent level, because in that case, we would both be avatars, both be virtual. We could start to see and communicate with AIs.\n\nToday, people creating AI and virtual beings are basically creating an avatar with GPT-3 and just walking away. I think what's needed is for virtual beings to live in a simulation of their lives. It shifts from building a virtual being to build that family, that work, that child's school. You have to build the society they live in and introduce emergent situations that will challenge them and allow them to grow over time.\n\nWhen you ask Alexa today, what are you doing right now? She's not doing anything. She doesn't exist in time, in any real way. I think they actually need to have lives. That would be our best shot. Suppose we want to live in the Metaverse. In that case, something completely unexpected will need to happen because it feels like the techniques are growing linearly. We are just not going to get to the point of billions of people living in the Metaverse like that. I think the infinity of the simulation could be the thing that gets us through.\n\n### Thanks so much, Edward, for being here.

While an audience is passive, a community is engaged, creating a complete paradigm shift in the way creators interact with fans.\n\nIndeed, while in Web2, it mainly was a creator and its fans, in Web3, it's much more a leader that achieves a broader goal by leveraging its community toward a joint project. With high-quality members keen to help a project grow, a singer could leverage its community to create an album, incentivizing its fan to create designs, helping them with marketing, etc.. The creator could them reward fans with Social Tokens, that, if the project succeeds, will gain in financial value. Aligning incentives is everything, and the power of a community can truly be outstanding.\n\nIt is, however, not a small task to attract high-quality talents as there are hundreds of exciting projects going on. So how to attract those top talents to help you achieve broader goals?\n\nThree mains parameters have shown their efficiency in previous DAO experiments: Having a strong culture, a well-designed onboarding flow, and creating good incentives.\n\nIn this essay, we will go through those three parameters and try to guide you on how to attract top talents to your DAO.\n\n### 1 - Having a strong culture\n\nCulture in a Creator DAO is the most important asset you can hope for. Culture is the reason why high-quality talents will provide support over a sustained period for your DAO. **There's only so much you can motivate someone with financial rewards, but with a strong culture, community members will actively contribute, intrinsically motivated by the values you have and the desire to be assimilated with the project you're creating.** High-quality talents are the ones who invest their time instead of capital, the ones who truly believe in the project and are keen to do whatever it takes to make it grow. Those are the most valuable and rarest contributors.\n\nPeople in the Web3/crypto space often display exclusive NFT avatars as their profile pictures and display such or such community in their Twitter bio. The reasons they are doing that are Culture and Social Status. With a strong culture, people are keen to assimilate their personal brand with your community. Culture is the glue of crypto. Without culture (meaning, story, community, memes…), NFTs wouldn't cost such an astronomical amount. What people are buying when purchasing a high-value NFT is not really the piece in itself. They buy the right to be part of a broader project in which they truly believe and want to be assimilated. NFTs don't cost their price for their utility but for the social signal and the culture they have shaped around it.\n\nWhen people are displaying in their Twitter bio that they are contributors to such a community, they signal that the DAO they are displaying has created a strong culture that has values and goals worth the time of the person. We're all [\"status-seeking monkeys,\"](https://twitter.com/packyM/status/1424715346976595972) and we're always on the hunt for things to enhance our identities. The goal of a Creator DAO is to create a culture so strong that people will promote it and work for it for free, for the social value it provides. Members of a community share a piece of their identity. **Thiscollective identity is one of your most vital selling points**.\n\n***Right, So how to create a strong culture?***\n\n* \\*\\*Share a common vision - \\*\\*Culture for every community is that one theme that people are aligned with, and that brings people together beyond your content. Any creator should seek this common thing, this right activity, which resonates with their audience and is better done as a group. This is how you create a strong culture. By creating a place where people with common interests can come and find their tribe, learn and grow together. Your goal as a community builder is to have community members engage with each other.\n* \\*\\*Know your community - \\*\\*You need to understand your typical \"community member persona deeply.\" As described by the [interaction design foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/personas), \"\\*Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand similarly. Creating personas helps the designer to understand users' needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals.\" \\*In our case, by understanding what kind of profile you have in your community, it will be easier to design incentives, develop values, create specific group chats and find that common thing that speaks to your audience.\n* \\*\\*Have a clear mission and strong values - \\*\\*The clearer you will be on what you want to achieve, and the values you have, the easier it will be to incentivize people to work with you. People will contribute in the long term only if they intrinsically believe in the project and gain social status by contributing.\n* **Provide Ownership** - You have to make the contributors feel accountable for the success of the project and the culture. By giving ownership and by showing strong leadership (by actions and decisions), you'll not only make sure to attract the best talents, but you will also assure good retention of your best contributors.\n* **Create trust -** Creating a strong culture is also creating trust. You need to build trust between members but also with people outside of the community. Having a public face behind the project has shown its efficiency to create trust. Hiring a scribe to facilitate the communication between team is also essential to create a healthy and sustainable trust culture.\n\nTo build a strong community, you have to find a “Why.” It’s all about having a common goal and a true belief. As a community leader, building a community with a strong culture is a long journey.\n\nBuilding a strong culture is only the first step to attract quality talents to your DAO. With a strong culture, potential contributors will probably notice you and try to understand better what you’re doing. Once in your community, the next step is to incentivize them to participate and help the DAO grow..\n\n### 2 - Design great incentives\n\nThe main interest of creating a Token for your community is to incentivize potential contributors to participate and give their time to make your project grow. There are [three primary types of incentives](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/how-to-design-great-incentives):\n\n* **Social incentives -** It's more of a social, collectible value that people are proud to own. Social Tokens create status within a community. Think of Airline miles that generate status within a specific sphere (Airline lounge, first to enter the plane, etc..) or special perks in Discord servers\n* **Vision Incentives -** members aren't participating \"for-profit\" (aka economic incentives) but are driven by a specific ideology. Community members will exchange your Token without a monetary value because they sincerely believed in the vision.\n* **Economic Incentives -** it doesn't require a particular strategy, and you can simply ask community members to achieve a mission in exchange for economic value. By creating a pay-for-performance incentive scheme, anyone can provide their skills and help grow the project.\n\nWell-designed incentives are essentials to attract quality talents for your DAO. Economic incentives are a great way to onboard new people to your project, but sustaining a community only based on financial incentives in the long term can be complicated. You should try to design bounties and rewards contributors that are here for the vision of the project and its social aspect, not for speculation. By giving ownership and rewarding high-quality talents with well-designed incentives, you'll make sure to create a sustainable and healthy community that can thrive in the long run.\n\nBounties and rewards can take many forms but should always fit into the broader goal of your community. A great example of an incentive that can be applied in almost all communities is a \"Referral bounty.\" Leveraging its community to attract qualified people by rewarding existing contributors when they refer people they know has shown to be an efficient way to attract top talents in the past.\n\nWith a strong culture and effective incentives, you should already be able to attract high-quality members for your Creator DAO. However, to make sure those talents contribute actively and provide value, you'll need a well-design onboarding process.\n\n### 3 - Having a well-design onboarding process\n\nBeing a member of a couple of DAOs myself, I've found it very time-consuming to browse the many channels of a Discord server and understand where I can provide value. There is a lot of confusion and plenty of non-relevant information to sift through, and it can be scary and demotivating for new potential contributors. To attract top talents, it's essential to make sure the onboarding process is straightforward. You should think about the user journey and create an onboarding process that makes it easy for anyone to participate.\n\nAn example of a great onboarding process could be [BanklessDAO](https://www.bankless.community/). Their [Wiki](https://www.notion.so/bankless/BanklessDAO-Wiki-82ba81e7da1c42adb7c4ab67a4f22e8f) is organized to participate even though you don't have much time to provide to the DAO. By doing that, they are making sure that no one feels intimidated and therefore are making sure to receive help from the maximum of people.\n\nThey also have clear documentation about the different guilds of the DAO and their respective missions, making it easy for anyone to see where they think they could provide the most value.\n\nFinally, once you've identified the guild you could bring the most value to, they are making the process of contacting someone from this guild easy. It's still rare to see a well-designed onboarding process in DAOs today, and potential contributors often still have to DM one (or several) community leaders (s) and ask how they can provide value, making the whole process longer and less effective. By creating a well-designed onboarding process (clearly explaining what you need help for, what your DAO is doing, and making it easy for potential contributors to reach out to a qualified member), you'll have a competitive advantage compared to other DAOs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAttracting quality talents for your DAO is not an easy task, but by making sure to have a strong culture, a well-designed onboarding process, and good incentives, you should be able to work with high-quality contributors and successfully grow your project. The most successful DAOs tend to lower entry barriers and combine a strong culture with a sense of ownership for every contributor.\n\n\n---\n\n**Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en)and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/XQBwvzpZv2) 🔥**\n\n\n---\n\n**Further resources:**\n\n* [Growing A Tokenized Community](https://club.mirror.xyz/hUCOZNvJ7uQI7DXOAmz3Rr-yt82o9gTiJx5T5srD5tc)\n* [Issue #26: How You DAO](https://30000feet.substack.com/p/issue-26-how-you-dao)", "timestamp": 1631312104, "digest": "_8nlEhI13gz8hbwF-fFwFFFw8tsm_c3uKNtpSzpmldU", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

What this technology allows you, in the end, is unlocking different experiences with your community. You have control over the means and the production of what you create throughout the process. It's no more the Creator and its fan, but more a whole community-driven by culture and values.\n\nA fundamental aspect to understand is that an audience is passive while a community is engaged. So how do you foster a strong community willing to collaborate and grow together?\n\nSocial tokens have shown their efficiency to incentivize individuals to share their skills with others. Well-designed incentives are more than crucial as they can make your project tremendously grow. Social Tokens are best used when they scale or incentivize coordination and engagement between community members. Incentives are ideal when it's mutually beneficial to you and your community. This will create positive-sum games, where everyone has an aligned economic interest. By designing great incentives, you'll reach a point where you'll have the power to gather a strong community keen to help you achieve broader goals and collaborate with others. This essay aims to give you a framework to help you foster a strong group of contributors toward a joint project. When incentives are aligned correctly, they will push the solution to grow indefinitely.\n\n## 1/ Understanding the different types of incentives\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23f52ac1-5261-49a0-bef1-17e599df8833_1932x965.png)\n\n**1.1 / Social incentives**\n\nFirst of all, you have to understand that a Social Token used purely for its utility can thrive in a niche community even though it has no monetary value. It's more of a social, collectible value that people are proud to own. Social Tokens create status within a community. Think of Airline miles that generate status within a specific sphere (Airline lounge, first to enter the plane, etc..) or special perks in Discord servers such as Discord roles, special reaction emoji, access to certain parts of the server etc. In the end, money is what people say is valuable. As [Hyman Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyman_Minsky) said: \"Everyone can create money. The problem is to get it accepted\". So suppose you can provide something worthwhile within the community but has no monetary value (in our case - Social Status) through your Social Tokens. In that case, community members will be keen to exchange their time against this other valuable resource.\n\nA great example is what the artist [RAC](https://twitter.com/RAC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) did with his [$RAC Token](https://blog.ourzora.com/home/introducing-rac). Uniquely, fans can't *buy* $RAC; they can only earn it (by buying merch, supporting him on Patreon, achieving small tasks etc..). By holding $RAC, fans can get access to a private Discord server, as well as early access to future merch drops. $RAC holders have a way to prove they are part of the 1% biggest fan. **Social Tokens can reinforce the hierarchy within the community, and it incentivizes anyone to participate within the community to increase their social status within this community**.\n\nAny niche will thrive because they have super fans who want to be part of a community and seek social status. [Status symbols within communities](https://davidphelps.substack.com/p/the-currency-of-community) are crucial for devoted fans. Think about the Star Wars fans willing to spend thousands of dollars for merchandise. Imagine now how big a project could become by letting those fans gain status through Social Tokens by helping grow this project. You can't underestimate the power of Social incentives.\n\n**1.2 / Vision Incentives**\n\nMany significant communities have succeeded even though the interests of their members weren't \"for-profit\" (aka economic incentives) and were more driven by a specific ideology. We can think of the [Bankless community](https://www.bankless.community/), for example, where \"members seek liberation from the tyranny of the traditional financial system\" and where they \"will achieve financial self-sovereignty, security, and prosperity.\" To achieve this great vision, collaboration is critical, and it firstly suited people who believed in the core ideology driving it. The movement has its currency, the $BANK, that has no financial value and simply represents participation in the bankless community. There is no sale. There are no investors. Community members will exchange this token without a monetary value because they sincerely believed in the vision.\n\nAligning interests is all about creating a token with embedded interest alignment for all parties who will use your token. Vision incentives can be powerful for broad and long-term projects, but it can, however, be complicated to motivate people in the short term.\n\n**1.3 / Economic Incentives**\n\nEconomic incentives are the most straightforward incentives to put in place. Indeed it doesn't require a particular strategy, and you can simply ask community members to achieve a mission in exchange for economic value. By creating a [pay-for-performance incentive scheme](https://medium.com/prysmeconomics/economics-of-tokenized-incentives-1-intro-to-pay-for-performance-84e3b9cfffa), anyone can provide their skills and help grow the project. It's clear what they will get in return. Creating Grant programs has also shown its efficiency to incentivize contributors participating in the project. With decentralized governance, anyone can submit a proposal (describing the missions, timeline, salary…) and get it accepted by the community.\n\nIt's also interesting to reflect on [how to shape those grant programs](https://medium.com/rallynetwork/what-social-tokens-can-learn-from-british-supermarkets-fd98bd1af5d0). Do you reward only people who opt-in to a program (which forces them to be active but results in fewer people ultimately enrolled), or is it better to enroll everyone by default(which means better coverage, but users might be more passive)? Do you prefer to create schemes that enforce rigid hierarchies (Token-gated communities or channels for example, where there's a hierarchy between those with enough tokens and the other) or create flat-rate systems where everyone on the scheme has the same chance of getting a discount (by curating article for a community for example)? As an example, we can think of Collab.Land, which built a Discord bot, connected to an Ethereum wallet to verify token balance before joining a chat group. This allowed the creation of token-permission groups, such as $JAMM and $KARMA, which helped ensure that those joining the group had a certain level of skin in the game.\n\nEconomic incentives are a great way to onboard new people to your project, but sustaining a community only based on financial incentives in the long term can be complicated.\n\nTo create incentives that impact and boost a community sustainably and positively, you have to make sure your incentives are part of at least one of the three categories: Social, Vision, or Financial. In creating incentives that don't fit in those categories, you have a higher risk of seeing users not be motivated enough to engage in activities that increase the value of the community.\n\n## 2/ The “Great incentives” Framework\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F704c5e19-0650-4f48-b118-f73d448d04cb_1932x965.png)\n\nNow that we've understood the different types of incentives, we'll try to develop a framework that can help any community leader design great incentives.\n\n**Step 1: Determine what would drive each party to use your token.**\n\nEveryone first chases personal interests. It's human. The aim of creating a Social Token is to align those interests with the ones of your community. **Suppose you can make incentive mechanisms that align both the community interests and the personal interests of each community member. In that case, you'll foster a strong community willing to build a joint project.** The first step to do so is to clearly define what members of your community are chasing by joining your community. What are their inner motivations? What would they earn by participating in the community? Why have they decided to join? You have to deeply understand their interest in collaborating with the community before creating incentives.\n\nThe second thing you should do, as a community leader, is to define the things you would need help with to achieve your mission. What are the activities that drive value for your community? Are you a curation community and looking for help to stay relevant? Are you a community aiming to share best practices and need everyone to be involved and share their skills?\n\n**Step 2: Determine how you can align each parties' interest.**\n\nNow that you know what you need and what other community members want, your goal is to align those interests and design targeted rewards schemes. University course grades, for example, provide powerful incentives for students to study hard or even to cheat, all without the university or the course instructor giving the student a dime. With grades, universities achieve their education goals while students are rewarded with good grades for their hard work. **Designing great incentives, it's all about considering the trade-offs, which balance costs and benefits.**\n\nTo align each parties' interest, you have to create incentives that provide sufficient value to your community to trade off their time. Students know that they can have good grades by spending hours learning their courses, and good grades can let them enter a good school and potentially have their dream job. They are trading their time against a potentially brighter future.\n\n**Step 3: Prevent bad token behaviors by disincentivizing those**\n\nWhen creating a Token for your community, you also have to think about the bad behaviors that could happen. Some bad behaviors could be speculative investments, for example, where community members would buy your token (try to raise its value) without having a positive impact on the project's value or development.\n\nOne way to beat this is to provide lock-up periods for token-holders. You reward token holders for holding your token, which disincentives them to sell and buy often and speculate.\n\nCreating trust and having clear values can be sufficient to prevent your community from those bad behaviors, but it's good to keep in mind that those bad behaviors can occur and determine in advance the actions you could take to disincentivize them.\n\n**Step 4: Incorporating effective performance metrics and optimizing the size of rewards**\n\nTo reward contributors efficiently, you also have to be clear about the quality of the work they are providing and, therefore, put in place clear performance metrics. The goal of defining clear performance metrics is to measure participants' contributions to reward them relative to their efforts.\n\nBlockchain and smart contracts now allow easy measuring of those metrics. Indeed, tools like [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) allow community leaders to measure and reward value creation thanks to a Discord Bot. For example, thanks to SourceCred, it's easy to see the number of messages someone has sent in a Discord or if he has recently submitted work.\n\nCreating good performance metrics is crucial to well-designed incentives. For example, token price is a poor performance metric for incentivizing the types of behaviors that blockchain platforms want their participants to engage in, and you should focus more on finding metrics that can measure the \"quality\" of the work done.\n\nBy following those four steps, you should be on the right track to well-designed incentives for your community. This framework aims not to give you a clear path to follow as there are no one-size-fits-all solutions. With this framework, you should ask yourself the right questions and decide for your specific use cases and your specific community. There are, however, some general pieces of advice that can be applied in pretty much every community.\n\n* **Create a token only if you have at least three \"realistic\" token use cases**. From previous experiences, creating a token for your community with less than three realistic use cases makes it more likely to fail.\n* \\*\\*Start with short-term incentives. \\*\\*Even though you have a long-term vision, it's essential to break it into smaller blocks and define specific missions that can be achieved in few hours.\n* **Don't underestimate the power of game design for your incentives.** People will trade-off their time if you're asking them in a fun and gamified way.\n* **Build trust & give ownership.** It's a long-term game to build trust, but it's essential to show your interest in every community member, always do the extra step, answer possible questions and give them ownership. By doing so, you'll create deep relationships with some members that will, in exchange, help you build a stronger community.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCrypto and Social Tokens finally allow easier collaboration. What was impossible only a few years ago is now a reality, and there are some super exciting niches out there that can be bound up with their own social money. In the end, everything will be tokenized as tokenization changes the equation. Any niche will thrive because they have super fans who want to be part of a community, part of a broader project. Those communities will need Social Tokens and great incentives to create better collaboration.\n\n###### **Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en) and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/XQBwvzpZv2) 🔥**", "timestamp": 1631312033, "digest": "Smjg3XUrEEO9ZQwLMvMnRNVV_gA6letmRmMz9q5KE7k", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

What this technology allows you, in the end, is unlocking different experiences with your community. You have control over the means and the production of what you create throughout the process. It's no more the Creator and its fan, but more a whole community-driven by culture and values.\n\nA fundamental aspect to understand is that an audience is passive while a community is engaged. So how do you foster a strong community willing to collaborate and grow together?\n\nSocial tokens have shown their efficiency to incentivize individuals to share their skills with others. Well-designed incentives are more than crucial as they can make your project tremendously grow. Social Tokens are best used when they scale or incentivize coordination and engagement between community members. Incentives are ideal when it's mutually beneficial to you and your community. This will create positive-sum games, where everyone has an aligned economic interest. By designing great incentives, you'll reach a point where you'll have the power to gather a strong community keen to help you achieve broader goals and collaborate with others. This essay aims to give you a framework to help you foster a strong group of contributors toward a joint project. When incentives are aligned correctly, they will push the solution to grow indefinitely.\n\n## 1/ Understanding the different types of incentives\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23f52ac1-5261-49a0-bef1-17e599df8833_1932x965.png)\n\n**1.1 / Social incentives**\n\nFirst of all, you have to understand that a Social Token used purely for its utility can thrive in a niche community even though it has no monetary value. It's more of a social, collectible value that people are proud to own. Social Tokens create status within a community. Think of Airline miles that generate status within a specific sphere (Airline lounge, first to enter the plane, etc..) or special perks in Discord servers such as Discord roles, special reaction emoji, access to certain parts of the server etc. In the end, money is what people say is valuable. As [Hyman Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyman_Minsky) said: \"Everyone can create money. The problem is to get it accepted\". So suppose you can provide something worthwhile within the community but has no monetary value (in our case - Social Status) through your Social Tokens. In that case, community members will be keen to exchange their time against this other valuable resource.\n\nA great example is what the artist [RAC](https://twitter.com/RAC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) did with his [$RAC Token](https://blog.ourzora.com/home/introducing-rac). Uniquely, fans can't *buy* $RAC; they can only earn it (by buying merch, supporting him on Patreon, achieving small tasks etc..). By holding $RAC, fans can get access to a private Discord server, as well as early access to future merch drops. $RAC holders have a way to prove they are part of the 1% biggest fan. **Social Tokens can reinforce the hierarchy within the community, and it incentivizes anyone to participate within the community to increase their social status within this community**.\n\nAny niche will thrive because they have super fans who want to be part of a community and seek social status. [Status symbols within communities](https://davidphelps.substack.com/p/the-currency-of-community) are crucial for devoted fans. Think about the Star Wars fans willing to spend thousands of dollars for merchandise. Imagine now how big a project could become by letting those fans gain status through Social Tokens by helping grow this project. You can't underestimate the power of Social incentives.\n\n**1.2 / Vision Incentives**\n\nMany significant communities have succeeded even though the interests of their members weren't \"for-profit\" (aka economic incentives) and were more driven by a specific ideology. We can think of the [Bankless community](https://www.bankless.community/), for example, where \"members seek liberation from the tyranny of the traditional financial system\" and where they \"will achieve financial self-sovereignty, security, and prosperity.\" To achieve this great vision, collaboration is critical, and it firstly suited people who believed in the core ideology driving it. The movement has its currency, the $BANK, that has no financial value and simply represents participation in the bankless community. There is no sale. There are no investors. Community members will exchange this token without a monetary value because they sincerely believed in the vision.\n\nAligning interests is all about creating a token with embedded interest alignment for all parties who will use your token. Vision incentives can be powerful for broad and long-term projects, but it can, however, be complicated to motivate people in the short term.\n\n**1.3 / Economic Incentives**\n\nEconomic incentives are the most straightforward incentives to put in place. Indeed it doesn't require a particular strategy, and you can simply ask community members to achieve a mission in exchange for economic value.

But recently, we've seen this correlation diminish. Indeed, as creators understand more the use cases and the utilities of Social Tokens, they bring in more fans from outside of Crypto. The use cases of Social Tokens are numerous. From allowing fans to invest early in creators, creating premium experiences, or collaborating efficiently with other creators, Social tokens have shown their efficiency to incentivize fans to engage and become Creator's distribution.\n\nIt's a complete paradigm shift in the way communities collaborate. It's no more the Creator and its fan, but more a whole community driven by a leader around a joint project. One of the use cases that stood out in the latest months is Crowdfunding through the community. Indeed, \\*\\*we've seen many exciting projects leverage the power of Social Tokens to achieve their goals. \\*\\*Many new possibilities have been made possible thanks to Social tokens and Web3, and Creators are at the forefront of this revolution, leveraging those new technologies to crowdfund their projects and achieve their goals.\n\nThis essay will try to understand the advantages of crowdfunding a project thanks to social tokens, understand the differences between crowdfunding a project on Web2 vs. Web3 for Creator and fans, and highlight use cases with concrete examples.\n\n## 1/ What does that exactly mean to crowdfund a project through social tokens?\n\nIn Web2 (centralized Web), creators asked their community to give USD to crowdfund a project. In Web3 (decentralized Web) the mechanisms are a bit different. Creators can mint (create) a Social Token (their personal digital currency) and use it the way they want. \\*\\*Creating a Social Token makes it easier for creators to raise funds as contributors will receive Social Tokens in exchange for their USD. Contributors are part of the project. They own a piece of it. \\*\\*\n\nLet's say a videographer needs to get better video equipment and hire an editor. There weren't many possibilities for the Creator before Social Tokens to crowdfund its project through its community. It was complicated to manage the legal part, deal with the logistic, and rely on a centralized platform. With this new money, the videographer's fans can redeem a slice of it in exchange for USD. They will have access to unique experiences while helping the Creator achieve its goals. \\*\\*While the videographer would have asked in Web2 to its community to \"support\" his project, he can now in Web3 ask them to be part of it, giving them personalized exchange experiences, a slice of its future income, etc.. \\*\\*The community now has the power to invest in creators to crowdfunding and shape the project's future rather than simply supporting the project from an external position.\n\nIn the end, Creators are leveraging new technologies to involve their community in their projects while raising funds to achieve broader goals. That's how powerful Web3 can be.\n\n## 2/ Why is it great to crowdfund through Social Tokens?\n\nWhat if you've invested in Taylor Swift early, helping her buy her first studio sessions in exchange for a slice of her future revenues? Chances are, this small investment would have turned in a multi-thousand dollar profit today. Social tokens allow to not simply support an artist but be part of its journey and serve as a way to align incentives. Indeed, by having a share of Taylor Swift's future revenues, its community is incentivized to help her grow and promote her art.\n\nThe possibilities are endless for creators. Singers are now able to crowdfund their first album, writers their first book, and filmmakers their first film. **By giving communities and fans ownership over the content and, therefore, by aligning incentives, we'll see more and more projects succeed, all thanks to the power of the community and Social Tokens.**\n\nAs mentioned previously, crowdfunding a project through Social Tokens (Web3) is very different from doing it through traditional Web2 platforms. There are fundamental advantages to using Social tokens to crowdfund your projects, mainly related to three aspects: Financial, Social aspect & Governance aspect.\n\nLet's dig more into the advantages of using Social Tokens to raise funds.\n\n### **✨ Financial aspect**\n\n***For Creators:***\n\n* It allows Creators to raise money for their projects while aligning their upside with key stakeholders.\n* Creators don't need to use the \"all-or-nothing model\", in which the money is only passed to project creators when the project reaches its established funding goal.\n* Overcome the challenges of fundraising through traditional financing methods, which is often complicated for non-well-known projects.\n\n***For Community members :***\n\n* They can buy and trade their tokens without any intermediary taking a cut on each transaction.\n* It gives supporters of the project ownership over it. They won't simply support the project. They'll possess a piece of it, which means having economic incentives to help the project succeed.\n\n### **✨ Social aspect**\n\n***For Creators:***\n\n* Incentivize fans to engage and promote the Creator's content. Community members have economic & Social incentives to help the project succeed.\n* Creators have access to the skills of a whole community keen to help grow the project.\n\n***For community members:***\n\n* Be a proud holder of $NAME tokens. Community members will have tokens in their Crypto wallet to prove they were there since the beginning and prove that they helped grow. They'll also have access to special perks and experiences.\n\n### **✨ Governance & Decisions**\n\n***For Creators:***\n\n* Creators have control over the means and the production of their content throughout the process. It enables them to **maintain their creative vision.**\n* Everything is decentralized, which means they don't need to ask permission from anyone to crowdfund, and platforms can't ban them. Web3 encourages collaboration and opens access to anyone wanting to build and share the upside without relying on centralized platforms anymore.\n\n***For Community members:***\n\n* Give stakeholders (Community members) the chance to have a voice and influence the project's future. It reinvents the process of creating entirely. Fans can now actively participate in the project, and the biggest fans can pay more to have premium experiences and decision power. It allows creators to granular their pricing while giving the biggest fans the possibility to be part of the creative journey.\n\nYou should now clearly see the advantages of creating a Social Token to raise funds for a project instead of crowdfunding it through Web2 platforms. Many exciting projects have already leveraged this new technology to achieve their goals. We're going to explore those examples to better understand why Social Tokens were the best solutions for their use-cases.\n\n## 3/ Examples of successful Social Token crowdfunding.\n\nLet's dig more into examples of projects that successfully leveraged Social Tokens to crowdfund their project through their community.\n\n* **[Ethereum: The Infinite Garden](https://twitter.com/EthereumFilm) - $INFINITE** - ETHEREUM: THE INFINITE GARDEN is a character-driven documentary film on the challenges and rewards of building a new world. The team exceeded their funding goal of 750ETH and raised [1035ETH](https://ethereumfilm.mirror.xyz/3SV8gLXHIW8Ot45h3RL7aOgDINxN2hjLfFVOvyatB2A)(\\~$2.7M when I'm writing this article). As the team behind the movie explain on their crowdfunding page: \"**as experienced, independent filmmakers, we understand the challenges of fundraising through traditional film financing methods.**\" Social tokens have allowed the team to ask their community directly, without asking permission from anyone. They will enable them to \\*\\*maintain their creative vision of the film while ramping up production quickly to capture this evolving story in real-time. \\*\\*Furthermore, it allows them to **involve the community in making the film** by giving them access to the film's private Discord chat and credit them in the film.\n\n  Project funded announcement\n* **[Burn Alpha Novel](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg) - $NOVEL** - As [Emily Sega](https://twitter.com/khole_emily)l, the author of the Burn Alpha Novel says: \"Usually, novelists go to great lengths to fund their own novel-writing process by working other gigs, selling commercial writing, or – in significantly fewer cases – getting an advance from a publishing company. All of these methods have drawbacks in the form of limited time or limited creative freedom for the author. On top of that, the process of creating these works of art goes on behind a veil of secrecy, away from the community that will ultimately enjoy the final product.\" She has decided to change that and crowdfunded her project through Social Tokens. By helping her achieve her goal to write a novel, contributors will have a mention in the book's acknowledgments, access to periodic supporter-only readings of the manuscript in process, and one-on-one calls with her to chat about writing or whatever is on their mind. Social Tokens helped Emily unlock new experiences with fans while giving her more freedom over her content.\n* **[Alex Masmej](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej) - $ALEX** - Alex Masmej has created the $ALEX token and has decided to sell 10% of the $ALEX token supply against $20,000, claiming to give some of his future income for the next three years. As a 23 years old from France, Alex wouldn't have been able to do it without Social Tokens as it would have been a legal and logistical mess. He achieved his goal to raise $20K and has been able to move to San Francisco with this money. Alex is now the Co-Founder of [Showtime](https://tryshowtime.com/), a platform that allows Creators and Collectors to showcase and Collect digital art, and an early investor in Coinvise.\n* **[Elektra by Songcamp](https://elektra.camp/#/) - $ELEKTRA** - Songcamp Elektra is made up of 42 musicians, visual artists, developers and strategists. Together, they are building \"Elektra\" — an interactive choose-your-own-adventure web3 game with music at its core. As this project evolves, the lines between Creator and audience will blur. Game builders will play the game they are building, and game players will build the game they are playing. The funds raised through this crowdfunding campaign go entirely towards bringing this project to life. The project [raised 80k](https://twitter.com/songcamp_/status/1415040169938460695) thanks to newly wealthy crypto-natives reinvesting in the next generation of creatives on the internet. This kind of project would have had a hard time being funded through the classic path and would have lost total control over the project.\n* **[Creator Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) - $CABIN** - The Creator Cabin DAO has built a new cabin designed as a collaborative co-living and working space for independent online creators. Their goal is to find ways to sustainably fund independent online creators and develop DAO-based governance models for physical spaces. Thanks to Social Tokens, they've crowdfunded their projects, and they collected $42k to experiment with their idea. It's an experiment in universal creator income, tech stacks for decentralized cities, and the physical manifestation of DAOs that has been made possible thanks to their community.\\\\\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCrypto and Social Tokens allowed revolutionizing the fundraising processes. **It will enable more projects to come to life, rewarding community leaders and community members to collaborate.** More and more projects will use Social Tokens to align incentives with their community and achieve bigger goals together. In the end, every project will be tokenized as tokenization changes the equation and greatly facilitate the crowdfunding process.\n\n###### **Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en) and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/XQBwvzpZv2) 🔥**", "timestamp": 1631311977, "digest": "aSqfg6vP1g7F_8_EM_vLT3dLiakhPUitPHC4sqHLPQ8", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

Creators discovered they can now BE the brand, BE the product, and they could do for them what they were doing for others. Creators can now build a direct relationship with their 'fans' and create their own economy thanks to Social Tokens.\n\nIf you're a creator not familiar with Crypto, but you would like to learn more about how it can help you, here's a good starting point.\n\nCoinvise is the most trusted & simple to use platform for creating social tokens and building incentives around them.\n\n### **First things first, what are Social Tokens, and why would I want to create mine?**\n\nSocial Tokens are virtual currencies that live on a blockchain. Put simply, your Social Token will allow you to create an open economy around your project. Anyone will be able to participate in your projects with your $NAME Token. Just as you need to convert your USD in EUR when going to Europe, fans will need to convert their USD in the Creator's social tokens to get involved in its economy/project.\n\n*But why, as a creator, would you want to create a virtual currency (aka Social Token)?*\n\nBy creating a Social Token, you'll gain ownership over your content and have an easier way to collaborate with your community. What Social Tokens allow you, in the end, is unlocking different experiences with your fans. You have control over the means and the production of your content throughout the process. You don't rely on platforms anymore. While, in Web2, creators needed to funnel people into their game (convincing people to follow them on YouTube, for example,) web3 allows new ways of collaboration to create a game and grow together. Instead of limiting the access (paywall in front of an article or a video), Web3 encourages collaboration and opens access to anyone wanting to build and share the upside. It's a complete paradigm shift. It's no more the Creator and its fan, but more a whole community driven by a leader around a common project.\n\nIn the end, it's all about community participation. For example, Forefront, the premier social token community creating and curating resources and spaces to help tokenized communities thrive, rewards its community by giving them bounties. As curating resources is not a small task, creating a Social Token to incentivize everyone to help makes sense. The Forefront's leaders have gathered a strong community and motivated their members to send daily great resources toward becoming\\*\\* \\*\\*the leading platform for insight across the social token community.\n\nEvery audience will turn into a community, and every fan will turn into a partner. With Social tokens, you'll have the power to incentivize anyone to help you achieve broader goals, meet new people and collaborate with others. You'll finally have a direct relationship with your fans and create new kinds of experiences instead of relying on centralized platforms that can potentially ban your content at any time.\n\n### **Concretely, what could I do with my Token if I decide to create one?**\n\nSocial tokens are best used when they scale or incentivize coordination and engagement between communities. Incentives are ideal when it's mutually beneficial to you and your community. You also have to understand that Crypto and social tokens are still early, and we're only scratching the surface of what's possible. There are new experimentations with Social Tokens every week, and everyone's trying to push this space forward as we go.\n\nHere are some use cases you could use your Social Token for :\n\n* **Allow your fans to invest in you early.** Having equity in an individual is much more than speculation. It's more about participation and how anyone can participate in helping grow and share the upside. It incentivizes people around a common goal. By believing in you early and helping you, community members will get a slice of your revenue once you've become more famous. In exchange for a portion of your future payments, you'll get their help and some money to start.\n* **Create bounties to incentivize the community to help you grow** (rating a podcast on Apple Podcast, writing a review on Amazon in exchange for X $NAME token, etc...).\n* **Crowdfund through an NFT** (NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token, which means you'll be the only owner of this specific piece). You can sell an NFT such as a unique autographed book, a YouTube video, or a piece of art and fund your future projects. Again, your community will get ownership over the project and will be incentivized to hype it up.\n* **Create premium experiences.** By holding enough $NAME tokens, certain community members could have access to special perks (the first chapters of a writer's next book in advance, access to a private Discord server, or redeem for one hour of your time, for example).\n* **Collaborate easily with other creators.** By creating a Creator DAO with its Social Token, you'll be able to collaborate with other creators and build more significant projects together. If you're interested in learning more about a Creator DAO, we recommend you [read this article](https://forefront.market/blog/how-creator-daos-redefine-the-way-we-work). (TLDR; It's highly complex today for creators to collaborate as they don't have the right tools to do it nor the experience, but Web3 and Social Tokens will re-invent the way people collaborate).\n\nThese are examples of things you could do today if you mint (create) your Token, but we're always looking for new ways to push the boundaries, and we would be happy to help you with every creative idea you may have to use your Social Token.\n\n### **Ok, that seems interesting. Now, what steps should I follow if I want to create my Social Token?**\n\nFirst, you have to understand that creating a Social Token is not complicated even for non-tech people. The difficulty is to get it accepted. How do you foster a strong community around your project? How do you share your vision? You don't need Technical skills but social ones.\n\nIf you already have a strong community and a clear idea of a project that would need strong collaboration between community members, an excellent first step would be to create a Crypto Wallet ([here's an easy tutorial](https://www.notion.so/coinvise/Create-a-Crypto-Wallet-and-Signup-on-Coinvise-co-e89358998648467c96922002fad2e2fc)) and read more about the specifies of creating a Social Token here. Once you understand better the implication of creating a Social Token, you can make yours in less than 5 mins, thanks to [this tutorial](https://www.notion.so/coinvise/How-to-Mint-a-Personal-Community-Token-7823a7c65c4c454bbdb924f80d9577dd). Again, it's crucial to understand that core use cases that drive successful interaction around them and incentives are ideal when mutually beneficial to you and your community.\n\nThe usual path communities are following are :\n\n* Create a small group and gather strong engagement around a common goal.\n* Create a Social token on Coinvise ([tutorial here](https://www.notion.so/coinvise/How-to-Mint-a-Personal-Community-Token-7823a7c65c4c454bbdb924f80d9577dd)).\n* Crowdfund the project and pool liquidity for their Token (If you're not familiar with Liquidity Pooling you can further read here).\n* Design great bounties to incentivize members to participate (As examples - here are [Forefront's bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dt5KxK5QmOyPAHBfj81nmY-btyTd0mbPlqJByOmkSR4/edit#gid=196077105)).\n* Collaborate with other projects to grow bigger.\n\n### **I'm interested now. You just said a good first step would be to create a Crypto Wallet. What's that?**\n\nA Crypto Wallet allows you to send/request cryptocurrencies, visualize how much Crypto you have, and serves as your unique decentralized identity.\n\nThe same way you have banking information that you share with anyone that wants to send you money, a Crypto wallet creates and stores your Private & Public Keys (a series of numbers similar to your banking information) that allows you to send and receive money on the Blockchain.\n\nYou'll use your Public Key as Banking information, while your Private Key will serve to verify and validate the transactions on the Blockchain.\n\nYour Crypto wallet also serves as your unique decentralized identity. With it, you can sign up to websites and prove your identity in one click.\n\nFor example, on Coinvise, by signing up with your Crypto Wallet (sharing with us your Public Key), we'll be able to verify \"on-chain\" that you're indeed the person trying to sign up on Coinvise and, therefore, let you airdrop (send) your Social Tokens, create an NFT or bounties. We'll also use your Crypto Wallet to send you your Social Tokens and NFTs if you're making any.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAt that point, you should be more familiar with what a Social Token is, how it can be beneficial for you as a creator and how to create one.

With Social tokens, you'll have the power to incentivize anyone to help you achieve broader goals, meet new people and collaborate with others. You'll finally have a direct relationship with your community and create new kinds of experiences instead of relying on centralized platforms that can potentially ban or censor your work at any time.\n\nWith Social Token used purely for its utility, your tokens can thrive in a niche community even though it has no monetary value. It's more of a social, collectible value that people are proud to own. But to create real incentives around a joint project, the financial value of a Token has its importance.\n\n**Indeed to create a whole new economy where every individual can thrive, we need creators to collaborate, and social tokens have shown their efficiency to incentivize individuals to share their skills with others.** Financial aspects of Social Tokens are more than crucial as well-designed incentives can make your project tremendously grow. Remember that the more value your Token will have, the easiest it will be to incentivize contributors to participate.\n\nThere are two main ways to create a Token. The first one is to make your Token on a \\*\\*Fixed Supply Model \\*\\*; you're creating a fixed supply of Token, the standard is 10M, and you can then distribute it to whoever you want in the way you want. The second one is to create it on a \\*\\*Bonding Curve Model \\*\\*; you're creating your Token on a Bonding Curve, which means the supply starts at 0, and every new Token created will cost more than the previous one.\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer, but there are fundamental differences between creating on a Bonding curve and a fixed supply, and it's essential to understand those differences well to make sure it fits your needs.\n\nToday, we'll explain the main differences between a bonding curve model and a Fixed Supply model and which one you should choose for your project. 🔥\n\n## 1 / The Fixed Supply Model\n\n**1.1 / What does that mean to create my Token on a Fixed Supply?**\n\nThe fixed supply model is a model where **you define the number of tokens you want to create beforehand.** Having a fixed supply allows you to get directly in your Crypto Wallet a known number of tokens that you can share or give to incentivize your community to participate in your project. The industry standard is to create 10 million of your tokens, but you can define the number of tokens you want to create. Successful communities such as [Friends With Benefits](https://www.fwb.help/) or [MetaFactory](https://shop.metafactory.ai/) have minted (created) respectively only 1 million and 420k of their Token. Creating your Token on a Fixed Supply means you have full power over the distribution of the native Token.\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F973317a0-2466-44c9-bfb2-76992df09c59_1280x720.jpeg)\n\n$FF distribution by Forefront - the token has been minted on a 10M Fixed Supply.\n\nThe fixed supply model works more around personal tokens. If you're a Creator that wants an easy solution to experiment with Social Token and create new experiences with your fan, you should hands-down mint your Token on a fixed supply.\n\nHowever, in creating your Token on a Fixed Supply, you'll be limited at one point if your project grows exponentially as you won't be able to increase the supply. It's also good to remember that when building on a Fixed supply, your Token has no inherent value as you're the owner of most of the supply, and no one has put money into your project. With a token based on a fixed supply, you'll create experiences that don't require inherent value. Experiences that only live in your economy. We could think of a \"control my life\" type of experience, gated articles or content (your fans will need enough of your Token to read the article), tips for spontaneous help, etc.\n\nBut creating your Token on a fixed supply doesn't mean it will never have monetary value, and you can create a Liquidity Pool, set an initial price, and allow anyone to buy your Token.\n\n**Adding value to your Token is not the first thing you should do when creating one. Indeed, you should first focus on making actual use cases for your Token and gather a strong community around your project.** Without a strong community, you won't increase your Token's value as no one will be keen to buy it. Creating a liquidity pool is more a later stage action when you'll want to accomplish new (and maybe more significant) projects than part of the initial tasks you should make when creating a token.\n\nLet's get into the fun part of Social Tokens: The liquidity Pools (LP).\n\n*(If you want to understand more in-depth the advantages of creating a Social Token on a Fixed Supply, you can read the [more extended version of this essay](https://eliotc.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets)).*\n\n## 2/ Liquidity Pool\n\n**2.1 / What is a liquidity Pool?**\n\nPut simply, creating a Liquidity pool means providing Liquidity for potential buyers. When you're creating a social Token, this Token has no inherent value. **Creating a liquidity pool (LP) allows anyone to buy your Token in exchange for other cryptocurrencies with value in USD**. When the LP is created, users can add the exact value of two Token (your Token + collateral, aka any other token) in a Pool and earn trading fees proportional to their share of the total Liquidity.\n\nUsers putting Liquidity in a pool are named Liquidity Providers, and they make a % of fees on every trade in the pools they participate in and are therefore incentivized to add Liquidity. **Put simply, these Liquidity providers facilitate trading by willing to buy or sell a particular asset at any given time, thereby providing Liquidity and enabling traders to trade without waiting for another buyer or seller to show up**.\n\n**2.2 / So why would you need to pool Liquidity for your Token?**\n\nYou will need to pool Liquidity if you want to create a project that requires collaboration. **By pooling liquidity, you'll drive the value of your Token, define its price and allow anyone to purchase it. Believers of your project will have the power to participate by simply swapping (exchanging) any crypto for your Token. They'll be able to buy your Token by simply going on a decentralized exchange and type the name of your Token.**\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15328316-49e4-4beb-97e3-fcb4a9e1f759_2864x1454.png)\n\nUniswap (decentralized exchange) interface.\n\nWhile centralized exchanges match buyers and sellers to determine prices and execute trades, taking a fee on the transaction, Uniswap uses a simple math equation and pools of tokens and ETH to do the same job. By knowing the balance between the ETH and your $NAME token in a pool (Supply & demand), **the equation can determine the price of a particular token whenever someone buys your $NAME Token with ETH**. If your $NAME Token supply decreases while the Supply of ETH increases, your $NAME token price goes up. **Your Token now has a monetary value**.\n\nAlso, by creating a Liquidity Pool, you'll create a place where anyone can buy your token and therefore participate in the project you're building. **It will give ownership to your fans and**, as the value of your token increases (considering more people are buying it and assuming you still own a decent amount of your Token), **you'll get more money to realize your project**.\n\nHowever, suppose you're creating a community around a vision (e.g., BanklessDAO) or building a protocol (e.g., Rarible protocol or Zora). In that case, it might be preferable to create your Token on a Bonding curve.\n\n*(If you want to understand better the mechanisms of liquidity pools and explore more use cases, you can read the [longer version of this essay](https://eliotc.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets).)*\n\n## 3/ The Bonding Curve Model\n\n**3.1 / What does that mean to create a token on a bonding curve?**\n\nThe core idea of minting a token on a bonding curve is that **its price increases as the Supply or distribution of the Token do.** The more tokens have been distributed, the higher the price. This means that early adopters can buy the Token at a much cheaper rate than when the Supply increases over time.\n\nLet's take an example to illustrate what a bonding curve is. You've just launched your Token on a Bonding curve, and your best friend John wants to buy some. To make it easier, let's say that your Token is on a classic (linear) bonding curve and that the price of the first Token is $1. John will pay $1 for the first Token, $2 for the second, for the third, $3, and so on. This means for John to get the first ten tokens, he will have to pay $1+$2+$3+$4+$5. Totaling at $55.\n\nNow, let's say your Mom wants to buy ten tokens. Your Mom's tokens price won't start at $1 but at $11 (as John already purchased the first ten tokens). Every new buyer **pushed the price up by increasing the Supply.**\n\nOn the other hand, when someone sells a Token, it will be burnt (destroyed), decrease the Supply, and lower the Token price. People that have bought your Token early (at a low price) and have believed early in your project will be rewarded by being able to resell their Token at a Higher price as the price is increasing with the Supply (the more people believing in your project, the more the price of your Token will increase).\n\n\\*\\*Creating your Token on a bonding curve greatly facilitates giving value to the token and allowing you to determine how the discovery price will work in the future. \\*\\*Indeed, a bonding curve has its own AMM (Automated Market Maker - a mathematical function that defines the price of your Token depending on different parameters) that allows you to choose the best model of bonding curve depending on your needs. **You have way more freedom over the price discovery of your Token with a token minted on a bonding curve than on a fixed supply, and you can choose the type of bonding curve you want, depending on your needs.**\n\n*(There are different types of bonding curves, and it might be helpful to dig into those if you're interested in creating a Token on a Bonding Curve. You can read the [more extended version of this essay](https://eliotc.substack.com/p/social-token-as-financial-assets) where we go cover those questions).*\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNow that we've covered what a Fixed supply model, a liquidity pool, and a Bonding curve are, you should clearly understand the differences between them.\n\nAs mentioned before, the fixed supply model and the bonding curve model are entirely different and are not made for the same use cases.\n\nTo make it easier to understand, we'll make a quick recap here covering the main differences between the fixed Supply and the bonding curve models and the pros and cons of each model.\n\n#### Main advantages of creating your Social Token on a Fixed Supply model :\n\n* **Usability and lower barrier to entry**. Anyone can create its Token on a Fixed Supply. You'll receive the tokens in your Crypto Wallet and can then distribute them the way you want. You don't technically need a pre-existing community willing to buy your first tokens. They are already created and exist on the blockchain. You own the whole Supply from day 1.\n* **Full power over the distribution of the native Token.** Centralized control over your token Supply prevents anyone from buying a significant amount of your token and using them in a harmful way. A safe and sustainable distribution strategy is critical for some projects - you must get your Token into the right people's hands if you want the project to succeed.\n* **Easier if you're a solo creator creating a personal token**. The Fixed Supply model will allow you to take your time and think thoroughly about the way you want to build your project. By owning the whole Supply, you can allocate your tokens **the way you want.**\n* **You don't need a strong community that is ready to pay from day one.** As you own the total Supply, you can take your time to gather a strong community around a joint project. This is a great advantage compared to the Bonding curve model as, in the bonding curve model, the early adopters might buy the Token. Still, if the community is not big and strong enough, as the price rises, no one will buy tokens anymore and can kill the project.\n\n#### Main advantages of creating your Social Token on a Bonding Curve model :\n\n* **Guaranteed Liquidity:** you can create a contract and have anyone be able to buy and sell your token right away. It can help bootstrap awareness and interest as backers know they have Liquidity from day one. Tokens can be purchased or sold instantaneously as the bonding curve act as an automated market maker (Market makers are agents that alleviate this problem by facilitating trade that would otherwise not occur. \"Automated market makers\" (AMMs) are algorithmic agents that perform those functions and, as a result, provide Liquidity in electronic markets. AMM buys some of your tokens and agrees to sell them at any given time to anyone wanting to buy your Token.)\n* **Reduced volatility:** in times of changing demand for the Token, the bonding curve allows *both the price and Supply* to adjust in response. Deterministic price calculation decreases the size and probability of boom and bust cycles that frequently plague fixed-supply tokens. Also, it ensures a continuous price. The price of your Token will always be n-1<n<n+1.\n* **Limitless Supply.** There is no limit to the number of tokens that can be minted. You have no limits on how big your project can become.\n* **You have complete power over the future discovery price of your Token.** As seen in this essay, you can adapt it depending on your needs.\n* **Reduces the risks of hacks.** If your platform or project is hacked, as you don't own all the Supply, it limits the risks. Tokens belong to the users that bought them and are on their wallets.\n* **Easier for a protocol or a community with more options.** You usually don't know the Supply you need as you don't know if your project will grow exponentially. With a bonding curve, as long as there is demand, it will be possible to create new tokens.\n\n**If you want an easy solution for your personal Token, you should go with a fixed supply model for your Token**.

We also highly recommend you to [join](https://www.theculturedao.com/) and [follow](https://twitter.com/theculturedao) ThecultureDAO.*\n\n\n---\n\n### Hey Edward, we're excited to have you here! Could you introduce yourself to our audience that might not know you and talk further about your background and what led you to build The CultureDAO?\n\nSure, thanks for having me. I'm originally from the UK and moved to the US years ago. I've worked with the administration during the Obama campaign reelection, creating the reporting and social tool for the Obama Campaign, and [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/) acquired the company and gave us funds to figure out how to tell stories in Virtual reality. I became the Founder of the Oculus Story Studio, and we won several Primetime Emmy and were in the official selection of the Sundance film festival. Then, two years ago, I decided to create [Fable](https://fable-studio.com/), a virtual beings company, and we've raised $15M to go after AI people.\n\n### That's impressive. How did you make the transition from virtual reality into the Metaverse? It seems like a natural progression, but I'd love to hear from you on how that switch happened.\n\nI think what we see with the profile pictures on Twitter is extremely interesting. With the [Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/), for example, or with avatar NFT as profile pictures, people are already creating a sense of themselves before we all fully go into the Metaverse. Many people don't know whom they are following on Twitter. They follow a profile picture avatar.\n\nI realized we didn't need to wait for better virtual reality experiences to start having immersive experiences. It led me to dig more into the Metaverse. In the end, it's about culture, not simply technology.\n\n### That's interesting because we're slowly starting to migrate ourselves into this pseudo-anonymity online. We now represent ourselves with these avatars NFTs, and I think it's natural that we see that progression. How do you see these NFTs in terms of utility? How do you see people utilizing them?\n\nI first see the ability to use these NFTs as an avatar in the Metaverse. We could think of a way to model the \"Bored Apes\" into 3D characters, for example, so that people can do video chats directly as the character.\n\nThere are also some pretty cool creative opportunities for a DAO to run narratives for avatars. Maybe a DAO could work on the life of a Crypto Punk, create scenarios and give them lives. This idea of decentralized creativity is an exciting area to explore.\n\n### I agree. I want now to dive deeper into the token and the community that you're building. What was the idea behind creating the token, and how does that play into helping the community that you're building?\n\nWe want to incentivize people to innovate and to be creative in Web3. I think the Crypto community is still small. Thousands of creatives working at Pixar, at DreamWorks, and at different game studios feel the lack of innovation.\n\nHaving a Token that incentivized them to share information and learn from each other without the structures they are used to is a big step forward.\n\nBeyond that, there are utilities such as discounts for owners of the token. For example, we provide token holders discounts for AI tools, automation tools, modeling tools, etc. We also give them access to a learning committee, and they can have one-on-ones and learn more about how to create avatars, build virtual beings, build AIs, etc.\n\nI think there are two trends so far in virtual beings. The first one is the Bitmojis, like avatars for everyone. I put [Genies](https://genies.com/) alongside that, and we've seen a lot of 10k drops avatars projects recently.\n\nThe second one is the emergence of one-off avatars. In the Renaissance — the portrait was a way to express one's arrival, status, and role in society. Artists were paid handsomely for the hundreds of thousands of paintings needed to claim their place in society for the emerging trading class. The emerging metaverse class will require multiples of 8 billion living portraits of themselves.\n\nThe more ambitious metaverse class will have multiple synthetic identities — some AI-powered, some expressive of sides of their personality, and our community will help create them.\n\nRegarding those trends, what's fascinating to me as somebody who's worked in VR for seven years, is that the Twitter profile pictures is creating a strongest psychological bond to the Metaverse than anything we ever did with a headset. Thinking a little bit more about social psychology, sociology, and status, that seems to be the piece that we missed at Oculus when we were trying to think about how to get people into the Metaverse.\n\nThat's why I think the avatar companies that all focused on a single avatar, a single model like Bitmoji, will go away.\n\n### I agree. Suppose you see it from a neuroscience perspective. In that case, we have the prefrontal cortex that's always looking to confirm our identity. Somehow, these avatars do a great job forming these identities that represent a group of people who all believe in the same thing. That's fascinating. In terms of building a community, what are some steps that you're doing to gather a strong community around your project? What are some real utilities that you see coming up with a community?\n\nWe have created about seven committees so far and gathered a strong community of active members. Some of the early committees that we're excited about are the avatar committee, where contributors are creating drops for members and beyond, and the character committee, exploring how a DAO can run a character. Having DAOs running characters is a fascinating idea that still hasn't been done. I think that's one of the committees I'm the most excited about.\n\nWhat I think, and what the character committee is thinking, is that it could be awesome to create lines of dialogue, back stories or a physical descriptions of a character, each generated by GPT-3. And then, each member in the DAO could take that forward and illustrate it, model it, animate it, and turn it into something fabulous. We could even maybe create a social profile for the virtual character and then vote on what will happen to its' day-to-day lives.\n\n### I love this. I love the idea of a character community. I think it's one of my favorite topic ideas. Do you think there is any potential for other identity signifiers in the Metaverse other than avatars?\n\nThat's a great question. I think owning virtual buildings could be great status signifiers, but if we're talking more about people showing themselves, I think another AI of yourself can be interesting.\n\nJust as the rich have people around them that work for them in the homes and beyond, you may well have an AI that is always with you in the Metaverse, that chat with you, that hang out with you, and that also can represent you in this world and communicate for you. This AI of yourself could give a tour of some of your properties, farms, or lands, for example.\n\nI think an AI of yourself might be a great status signifier in the Metaverse, but even beyond that, the Metaverse with AIs might be a place for longevity. It could be used against death and might also solve the problem that we're not going to be in the Metaverse while sleeping. Most of us aren't going to be in the Metaverse for the majority of our waking hours, so an AI that can represent us whilst we're not in the Metaverse may be a much bigger thing than avatars eventually.\n\n### I love that. This perception, which feels very dystopian, in the sense that we're going to have this Metaverse with a couple of billions of us and just the rest of it by AIs, makes sense because we can't protect ourselves 24/7. I would now like to ask you a question that we're asking to all our invitees. If you had infinite resources, what are some things that you'd like to achieve in your community?\n\nI like this question a lot. I think there's not enough emphasis in Web3 communities on masterpieces, on creating a historical work that great artists can be proud of. Ephemerality is part of the culture with the Pumps and Dumps, and there is an incredible temptation around money.\n\nI would hope we're able to sufficiently resource players in DAOs who are visionary and talented in a way that, while not centralized, we can help and support these talents, allowing them to create lots of pieces. I would hope to create work that lasted a hundred or two hundred years if we had unlimited resources.\n\nHowever, the big question is, \"Can something that isn't centralized create a masterpiece?\" So far, there is no evidence of it anywhere.\n\n### Mmh.. Do you think it's because of the lack of significance on history and historical artwork, or is it because of the pseudo-anonymity? Maybe as you don't have access to the artist's previous work, it somehow leads to not considering certain pieces as a masterpiece? How do you think about creating a masterpiece given the times that we live in?\n\nVery interesting. Well, there are a couple of things. Firstly, is the pseudonymity factor that comes with being decentralized go against the masterpiece?\n\nI think humans need a great man to look at the art piece and say, \"he's a genius. He has created a Masterpiece\". But this cliché has led to many people taking credit for teamwork. Unfortunately, I'm not sure this cliché can be overcome yet, and so it's going to be tricky for decentralized communities to create masterpieces. Don't get me wrong. I think crypto punks will certainly last for a good amount of time. I also think Loot has a good chance to last long because it's so provocative around what has been considered art. But in terms of what a masterpiece looks like in a decentralized age, where things are more ephemeral, I'm not sure.\n\nThat's a fundamental question. We to think about what a decentralized masterpiece looks like once you stripped away the Nation-state, corporations, military power, etc.. Who is telling you that this is a masterpiece at that point, and would you believe them?\n\n### It's fascinating that we live in a world where there are so many masterpieces, but once you remove all these constraints, suddenly, our intellect cannot differentiate between what's significant and what's not. Do you feel the world has become more dystopian and dark in this envision Metaverse that we're talking about? Do you think it's moving to a more dystopian world where we can't differentiate between what's real and what's not?\n\nI'm not sure that I can claim why our lives in the digital world will be much better than our lives in the real world because I don't particularly believe that.\n\nWhat I believe in is AI and the creation of AI virtual beings. I think that does offer us redemption as a species. Hopefully, we will create AI virtual beings that will be the second intelligent species on the planet. And if we do it correctly, if we can help them grow correctly, then I think there is a chance for redemption. I don't necessarily believe that just having digital Genies and pseudonymity necessarily will be better for us. I believe that, for speaking personally, as someone who cares a lot about AI, the Metaverse is a necessary prerequisite for us to interact with AIs on an equal plane, at an equivalent level, because in that case, we would both be avatars, both be virtual. We could start to see and communicate with AIs.\n\nToday, people creating AI and virtual beings are basically creating an avatar with GPT-3 and just walking away. I think what's needed is for virtual beings to live in a simulation of their lives. It shifts from building a virtual being to build that family, that work, that child's school. You have to build the society they live in and introduce emergent situations that will challenge them and allow them to grow over time.\n\nWhen you ask Alexa today, what are you doing right now? She's not doing anything. She doesn't exist in time, in any real way. I think they actually need to have lives. That would be our best shot. Suppose we want to live in the Metaverse. In that case, something completely unexpected will need to happen because it feels like the techniques are growing linearly. We are just not going to get to the point of billions of people living in the Metaverse like that. I think the infinity of the simulation could be the thing that gets us through.\n\n### Thanks so much, Edward, for being here.

First of all, it's essential to know that the SEC is in charge of regulating decentralized projects. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a U.S. government oversight agency responsible for regulating the securities markets and protecting investors. It has a three-part mission: Protect investors. Maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Facilitate capital formation.\n\nThe current regulation suggests Tokens should have as a main utility to offer fans new experiences within digital economies, which means they should buy Token in hopes of special perks instead of getting financial rewards. Indeed, **a token that delivers promises or implies the possibility of any financial return is much more likely to be a security.** For example, a use case that can have problems with the Law could be a Social Token as an ISA (Income Share Agreement). Offering a slice of your future revenue to token holders can be seen as a security, even though it's one of the most exciting use cases. If you want to create a token to share your future earnings with your community, you should be very cautious and ask a lawyer before doing it.\n\n**The Supreme Court is saying about Crypto that if a project is raising money selling a token and the buyers are anticipating profit, chances are it will be considered a Security.**\n\nTokens should rather have as a **primary utility to incentive communities thanks to non-economic advantages**. For example, we could think of Social Advantages, where token holders genuinely do not expect to profit from the tokens and hold them for other reasons such as free access to members-only content, 1:1 call etc.. Even without economic value, your Token can have many social values and unlock new experiences that live in your own economy. **A useful token, which means a Token without the sole interest of earning money, is less likely to be a security.**\n\nOf course, if a Token has a monetary value, it will be tricky to do so. The Law suggests to any community leader to clarify that financial value is not the primary purpose of a Token and that token holders have access to benefits accessible only for them.\n\nKeeping the total power over the Token distribution with a token minted on a fixed supply will be easier. If a Token is transferable (for example, if it's minted on a Bonding curve or if the Token has Liquidity Pools), the Token's creator won't be able to limit the speculations.\n\nThe Supreme Court also warn token creators to be careful with **False Advertising Issues**. If the Token allows fans to access premium experiences, it's obliged that those benefits are really as \"exclusive\" as advertised.\n\nAgain, the fewer financial rewards involved in your project, the better. Here are some incentives that can be considered as security:\n\n* **Don't allow your token holders to earn a return for holding your Token.**\n* **Don't promise to pay** (directly or indirectly) token holders (for work they could do, for example).\n* **Don't allow \"Yield farming\" or A 'buy-and-burn' models** (redirect the revenues or profits to increase the value of the Token).\n\nIt's also good to remember that it's essential to have **Clear Disclosure of Terms** like any other reward or loyalty program. People buying Tokens should clearly understand what they're buying and how they earn and receive rewards.\n\nThere is still quite a bit of a grey area around the legal aspects of Social Token. Still, in general, **if the sole use of your Token is to raise money and advertise to buyers that they will earn profits, chances are it will be considered a Security by the Supreme Court.**\n\n## Further ressources\n\nIf you’re interested to learn more about the Infrastructure Bill and how it will affect the crypto space, here are great resources to start with:\n\n* [Public Statement by Chair Gary Gensier about Crypto](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03)\n* [SEC’s Peirce Takes “Liberty-Loving” Perspective after Gensler Calls for Tighter Crypto Regulation](https://thedefiant.io/hester-peirce/)\n* [Now They Fight Us | Market Monday LITE](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/now-they-fight-us-market-monday-lite?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo2MTI5NjExLCJwb3N0X2lkIjozOTgwODcyOSwiXyI6InBjVEFzIiwiaWF0IjoxNjI4NTUwOTM5LCJleHAiOjE2Mjg1NTQ1MzksImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xNjAxNSIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.G2vI70eSxzkmWMUvGiC9TJ5Kzz_GaYo4-mOZa5RY2-A)\n* [Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Regulation 2021](https://www.globallegalinsights.com/practice-areas/blockchain-laws-and-regulations/usa)\n* [Thread about the Infrastructure Bill](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1423425253968015363)\n\nIf you’re interested to learn more about the legal aspects of Social Token, here are great resources to start with :\n\n* [Securities Law: Social & Community Tokens](https://medium.com/seedclub/securities-law-social-community-tokens-3bb0ffaae62)\n* [How To Navigate Regulation Crowdfunding With Crypto And Blockchain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2020/05/10/how-to-navigate-regulation-crowdfunding-with-crypto-and-blockchain/?sh=38bdf94a3d2d)\n* [Social Tokens & Regulations w/ Reuben Bramanathan, Community Tokens Lead at Zora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcTpuVrXWkY)\n\nIf you're looking for peoples and organizations to keep up with the latest legal news in the crypto space, here are great resources to start with :\n\n* [The Blockchain association](https://theblockchainassociation.org/)\n* [Coin Center](https://www.coincenter.org/)\n* [Jake Chervinsky's Twitter account](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky)\n* [DAO Legal Resource - DAOtalk](https://hackmd.io/@LinXule/BywFKmp6L)\n\nIf they didn't before, Washington now understands the crypto community's power, passion, intensity, and dedication.

We hope you’ll enjoy the conversation as much as we did! 😉*\n\n### Joyce, it's good to have you here. To kick off this interview, could you tell us more about your background, what you do, and what's Global Coin Research?\n\nIn my past life, before Crypto, I was working in Finance and then became a TechCrunch journalist and a reporter for the Information, reporting on tech and software companies. Since I've jumped into Crypto 5-6 years ago, I've focused on Global Coin Research. Global Coin Research (GCR) is a media platform and a Crypto community. You can look at it in two separate entities with a very close and tied approach, anywhere in the media and publishing platforms.\n\nToday, Global Coin Research has three main aspects:\n\n* Firstly, anyone can contribute to creating quality content around Crypto topics. In return, we showcase them to our quality readers that we've been accumulating and working with in the last five years, including founders, such as Brian Armstrong from Coinbase, and investors and also various media partners, such as the Wall street journal or The New York Times. Writers are, on top of that, earning $GCR tokens.\n* Secondly, we have a robust community and a Discord server. We host weekly workshops, AMAs for founders, and showcase projects that are about to launch or that just launched in the Crypto space. We're also helping teams get a little bit more information and contact in the space.\n* Thirdly, we make Crypto investments as syndicates inside the groups. In the past, we have made investments in projects such as space X or several other Crypto projects, and we try to be more involved with those projects, being more hands-on as a community.\n\n### Love this. I also find it interesting that the GCR community was already a very close-knit, engaged community even before launching the $GCR Token. Could you tell us what made you decide that you wanted to do the token and what were some goals that you had in mind?\n\nYeah, for sure. Coming from a background of being a journalist myself and seeing how the traditional reporting space runs and the infrastructure there, it often feels like the writers do not get enough credit and never received the value they deserve in writing and contributing quality content. With platforms such as Substack and Medium, it's effortless to start and write something, but it's tough to monetize and build a brand and traction. You have to keep writing and get new content at least once a week. It doesn't work for the Crypto community because people are busy doing everything else, such as contributing to the communities they're involved in or trading Crypto tokens.\n\nThat's why we've decided to build Global Coin Research, to create a novel platform where it makes sense for the writers to come to earn value and earn a living from day one. We initiated this campaign when we first launched the $GCR token to allow anyone to earn tokens when contributing to the media. Those tokens are immediately liquid, and folks can actually make a living from them because they can withdraw them from our dashboard and then be able to sell them on exchange.\n\nTo be honest, I was resistant to a token until a few months ago because I didn't want to become just a token project for its sake. But virtual community tokens are pretty helpful when you think about incentivizing community and being more innovative around token economics. It's becoming the norm, and we're seeing more and more media platforms introducing a token such as Mirror, The Defiant, Bankless, etc...\n\n### I agree. We spend a lot of time on the internet, and writing becomes crucial as it's how we communicate with most people. Diving deeper into what role the Token plays, could you tell us more about what sort of decision-making you made when launching the $GCR Token and how you've rolled out phases? Also, what advice would you give to someone that wants to introduce a token for its community?\n\nAs a piece of advice for folks who are building tokens, I think it's important to introduce a very simple story that everyone could understand, especially if you're introducing innovative ideas.\n\nWe first told all our writers and audience that they could now write on our platform and get $GCR Tokens in return regarding how we rolled out phases.\n\nRecently, we introduced the second phase of our Token. Now we allow more robust tooling for the writers and more immediate rewards for them. That means that writers are able to contribute and write on our platform, but over time, they will also be able to use the Token for other things, such as joining our discord community. We've been trying to introduce our discord community slowly cause we know it can be overwhelming for newcomers joining large projects. We try to do it slowly, introduce each of these products separately, and build them up over time.\n\nThe last thing we introduced is letting token holders access quality content. We push out high-quality content, and we're able to Token-gate them and offer the best essays to our token holders.\n\n### I like the way you're approaching this. Regarding Social Tokens and community members, there are usually two dynamics. Community members that are in it for the Token price (speculative aspect), and community members trying to participate in attending events and joining the discord server. How do you use the $GCR Token to grow the community, incentivize more participation and less speculation?\n\nI think there's one tip I received from the founding team of Index Coop that helped us. When rewarding your community through Tokens, it's better if the core team managed the token supply and transactions and kept the voting power centralized. By doing so, you'll have a firmer grasp of the token prices. Instead of giving a lot of tokens to a community from the first day in, you could provide them ETH or give them stable coins. It lets the initial team know where the Token is going, so there's no unexpected selling coming from your community. When it comes to community rewards for us, sometimes we give away gifts (e.g . apple headphones), instead of the Token itself because we think controlling our Token's distribution is essential.\n\nWhat's also important to prevent bad token behaviors is to share what you're building with your community; otherwise, a part of the community will get lost in the building. If no one knows what you're working on, they don't have this incentive to participate in becoming a member and helping you grow. So make sure to communicate well and don't be a lock at a loss in the building.\n\nFinally, don't overthink too much about bad token behaviors. Speculative members don't last long in a community, and it's important to just be able to continue to build, continue to ship, and grow the community.\n\n### I agree, it's crucial to focus on your token economics, understand how to allocate your total supply. A follow-up question to this is how do you promote your community to more people and promote the Token's utility? A great way to do it is to crowdfund your project, so how was the crowdfunding process like, or when you did do the Liquidity pool, was it complex or straightforward?\n\nSetting up Uniswap and setting the liquidity pool was one of our biggest pain points. We thought about it starting small and relying on some community members that we trust because many of our community members are angel investors or part of larger funds. They have the capital, and we can offer them the reputational value of being an early community contributor and member.\n\nWe started with a very small pool , I think it was like $50-100K, and I think that's what most folks should do when they're starting, as I honestly don't even think that big size of a pool is needed. It's an all-new kind of problems that we face in crypto like liquidity pool or Tokenomics, and you almost need another team member to figure it out. So in our case, we just wanted to start a small and gather folks that we trust.\n\n### It's a question that we get a lot, and it's nice to hear an opinion from the creator. To close this interview, I would love to know the next steps for what you see the community evolving are? What are some next steps for GCR, and how do you see the future of this idea of decentralized journalism evolving?\n\nInteresting question. Because we're in the Social Tokens space and building a decentralized writing platform, we really have to think about what's going to be next because no one else will be setting the example for that at all. I think there are a lot of great and exciting things coming up in decentralized journalism, and, as I mentioned before, lots of platforms are exploring it. I think there will be some cool products being used and tools being built on that front.\n\nOur primary mission for the future is to continue generating and maintaining the quality content that we have and maintain that high-quality audience. It is one of the most important things that I care about because that's where you build your brand and reputation. We don't put too much weight on not having the largest discord community because I think ultimately, the quality folks will still stay in the space for a long time, and our goal is to create good quality content for them.\n\n###### **Want more?**\n\nFollow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinviseCo)**,  [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/coinvise/?hl=en) and join us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/XQBwvzpZv2) 🔥**", "timestamp": 1631311944, "digest": "NFqxM3RCsInkg3zN2RYyux1n3JrihqYxQm87SRdffLg", "contributor": "0xC0241e384dB48C35E7b3FEded3BfEcd29A3E73e3"}

We also highly recommend you to listen [Mint season 2](https://adamlevy.io/mint-season-2/).*\n\n### Hey Adam, it's good to have you here. Maybe you can tell people about what your journey has been like so far, how you got started with doing podcasts, and how you got to the idea of Mint?\n\nThanks for having me. I got started in Crypto in late 2017. I initially got interested in the space after seeing that some publicly tradable assets like Bitcoin were trading at $20K at the time. It sparked my curiosity and led me to enter the Crypto space.\n\nI also came across this startup called Mediachain that [Jesse Walden](https://twitter.com/jessewldn) founded. At the time, I was very into the music scene, and I've always wanted to see what Jesse was doing and how he was helping artists musicians using Crypto. I thought it was pretty unique and different.\n\nSo between seeing Bitcoin trading at $20K and seeing a compelling use case of blockchain technology solving a real problem, I was intrigued, and that's how I got my start.\n\nThis was around when winter break kicked in at my university, and I spent four weeks diving into Bitcoin's white paper to the extent where I loved it so much. I started posting in my University's Facebook group, \"if anybody wants to learn about Bitcoin, meet me in this room on this day, at this time, and I'll be teaching you.\" I remember the very first session that I held, two people or three people showed up. And then the next week, it was five people, and then ten people showed up, to the point where we were 350 people on campus, all interested in Crypto and blockchain.\n\nThen, I wanted to work in Switzerland, known as the Crypto valley, for my last semester because they had the most regulatory-friendly environment for crypto projects. Long story short, I couldn't get a job because of the visa issue, and I ended up moving to Austria, working with a blockchain startup for a few months. A bank acquired this startup, so they dropped me, and I came back to LA and joined Tim Draper's fund for about two and a half years. I was wearing multiple hats, from fundraising to deal flow analysis to conference producing to marketing communications.\n\nBut one thing that I started there and that I was thrilled to do was Blockchain & Booze. That's kind of how I got into podcasting. Basically, the whole concept was that many things are going on in this space, but as quarantine just kicked in, people can no longer go to their networking events and post-work meetups to share ideas over a drink. So I went up to my boss and proposed that we bring this online, and that's exactly what we did every Tuesday evening from 5 to 7 PM. I hosted a fun \"get together\", where I interviewed someone live over a drink in front of an audience. And 66 sessions later, over 140 guests later, we had about 170,000 live viewers. I interviewed everyone from Mark Cuban, the mayor of Miami, the Binance US CEO, Celsius network CEO, et cetera.\n\nThat's pretty much how I got into podcasting. Since I left Blockchain & Booze, I've started this new concept called [Mint](https://adamlevy.io/mint-season-2/), which is tailored to be more towards the Creator Economy and the development around Web3 communities. As a creator myself, I've always wanted to find a way to empower development at the intersection of Crypto and music. NFTs and Social Tokens have proven to be a cool concept to experiment with and reward audiences and fans.\n\nThis is why I started Mint, strictly for providing content and guides for creators who want to transition from Web2 to Web3. Twice per week, I post new episodes interviewing different thought leaders in space on how they're using social tokens to empower the creator economy, Web3 and communities.\n\n### That's awesome. You've always been good with people, and that's what I like about you. It also shows in the podcasts you've done. What are some things that you learned about this space by just talking to these people? Is there something that excites you going forward?\n\nThis is such a good question. I started Blockchain & Booze in April of 2020. And if you guys remember this timeline, a few months later, DeFi summer kicked in August 2020. I entered the \"Podcasting scene\" at a good time because I built up a few episodes before getting more legitimate people on the show. And when I got to the point where I could invite more legitimate people on the show, that's kind of like where the fun started.\n\nI've also got my alpha into investing by inviting Founders onto the show. I realized that people didn't want to back their projects publicly. They didn't want to put a face to their projects. And there's only a handful of people who would come in front of the camera, in front of a microphone, and talk about why their project was the next big thing.\n\nWhen someone was coming on the podcast talking about his project publicly, and I was learning a lot and finding the project interesting, I was buying some of their tokens. As it happened for more and more projects, I realized that when you talk to someone about their project, if they're willing to come on publicly and talk about the problems that they're solving, regardless of how unregulated friendly the environment is, it says something about them and what they're building.\n\nSo the biggest lessons I learned from interviews are the alpha and insight from those new projects, which led me to invest in their projects. When you have these conversations, you learn about people in a different light, especially when they're drinking and they're a little bit buzzed, aha.\n\n### That's awesome. A follow-up question to that would be how do you see people transitioning between having an audience to a community? How do you see that transition happening, given all the conversations you've had with people, and how did you go about creating a community for Mint?\n\nI'm still trying to figure out what a community like Mint could look like. Right now, it's very much me, but I want to \"decentralize\" that, so it's more about Mint and less about me. I haven't figured out what it could look like, but I'll introduce some concepts that I would like to push out.\n\nFirstly, how can we embrace more of a community? How can we create more content that's more multiplayer rather than just a single-player? Podcasts are very much single player, it's just you and a person, and you talk to them, post it, publish it etc... I'm trying to think about how we can create multiplayer content, and that involves the community. And honestly, it's a tricky question. I haven't figured that out yet, but I think there is a need for every community to find that one thing, that one theme that people are aligned with, and that brings people together beyond your content. For blockchain & Booze, it was alcohol. For Friends With Benefits, it's the network. And every single community has a theme that extends beyond its service or product offering.\n\nWith Blockchain & Booze, I realized that there was a problem that needed to be solved at the time. People wanted to network, and I realized that networking was a common theme that could bring people together because people missed networking. What made the success of this podcast was the interaction, that social interaction that people were missing. That kind of made that community. The interviews were just a plus. What brought them there was the network and the drinking.\n\n### That's so interesting because what you're describing, it's just building culture. You can have all sorts of financial incentives, but it's just not going to work if the culture is not there. Talking about communities, do you see Web2 and Web3 creators as being binary? Do you see that switch happening? Or do you see it more like a complementary to each other where creators exist on Web2 platforms and still create content but are leveraging Web3 to capture the network effect better?\n\nI've quit my job to make that happen. I've quit working at the fund with a steady salary and options to make this happen. So do I see that transition happening? Yes. And it's the reason why I've quitted my job, to double down on the development of this space as more Web2 creators and communities are merging into Web3.\n\nThat's the whole point of Mint. To provide content, provide guidance, and hold people's hands about what's happening in the space and how they can use it to their advantage. Part of transitioning comes with educating. People won't get into something without understanding it.\n\nFor example, let's talk about [Harrison First](https://twitter.com/harrisonfirst). He's like a common name in the community. He's a Web2 creator that has transitioned into Web3. When showcasing his story, when creating content like this, it's that element of education that I hope other creators come across and realize that wait, Harrison First is a legit songwriter, a legit producer, and he made the switch into Crypto. What is he doing? What can I learn from him?\n\nSo yes, creators in Web2 will transition into Crypto. It's just a matter of time and education. And honestly, it depends on platforms like Coinvise and people like you, Jenil. Making this happen by onboarding people and teaching them.\n\nThere are already great projects and people that are doing an excellent job of taking responsibility. I think of Coinvise, [Forefront](https://twitter.com/forefront__), [Whale](https://twitter.com/whale_community), and [Allie McPherson](https://twitter.com/Alliestrasza). Allie is a gamer and the epitome of what a creator should look like transitioning from Web2 to Web3. She's teaching them what Crypto is, and now that she has good distribution, she's slowly transitioning into a DAO, that we could call a modern-day fan club.\n\nSo you already see early instances, and these people are going to be the cornerstone as to how others join Crypto. So yes, it's going to happen.\n\n### We're all going to make it. A follow-up question to this would be what made you take the risk of leaving your job and taking the leap into doing what you're doing now? What was the moment where you just said, I'm going to make the switch?\n\nBlockchain & Booze was such an exciting experience, and I got to talk with over 150 builders, founders, and investors. I was fortunate to build an incredible network from there and make cool friends.\n\nI'll shout out to someone that had a major impact on this decision because we're good friends, and he lives 20 minutes away from me. It's [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa). I remember talking to him a lot, and he was doing cool stuff and was very successful at what he's doing. So I started asking him how I can transition. How can I take more steps? I wanted to be a part of more groups and more communities.\n\nAnd he told me, \"Just quit. You'll be good. Just quit.\" I'm fortunate and forever grateful for the people around me because I couldn't have made that decision myself without consulting some of my friends. It wasn't until I realized the opportunity here is high. The \"risk to reward\" ratio is unlike any other industry. I just said to myself, \"you have enough experience, and you're getting offered positions from other companies, so if you do fail, you have a plan B to sit on, so just do what you did for Blockchain & Booze and create content.\"\n\nCrypto is 100% an employee market right now. There are more job offers than good candidates. So that also gave me a level of security that I have a backup plan if I do mess up.\n\n### Cooper had also had a considerable influence when we started Coinvise, so I completely relate to what you're saying. As a final question, in an ideal world where you would have all the resources and don't have to worry about the constraints, what is something that's missing in the Creator Economy? What is something that you would love to see?\n\nIf I had unlimited resources, money, and access to engineers, marketers, or operations people, I would focus on the intersection of the music industry and Crypto.\n\nYou guys are probably already seeing [3lau](https://twitter.com/3LAU) create a lot of hype around this. He is working around the element of fractionalizing a song or an album and crowdfunded to its fans. So fans can be a part of the creative journey of experiencing and enjoying the content and the financial journey.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about the benefits of consuming the content and being a core contributor to the influencers' future.\n\nAnother exciting thing for me is a solution that would allow people to better interact with their NFTs and collectibles. Today, in the NFT market, we're seeing millions of dollars in volume of people trading and transacting different collectibles, but the wallets where they are stored don't provide people with ways to enjoy that content, enjoy their NFT album, enjoy the NFT video that they just got, so I'm excited to see what's going to solve this in the next years.\n\n#### Thank you Adam, it was a super insightful conversation.

The posts, the stories, the memes, and even the likes you make on other people's content. Imagine them all floating in the air in front of you, forming a cloud.\n\nWhen we post on social media, it often feels like we're releasing something that's weighing us down. As if our content is just a series of shells we've each outgrown; a trail of breadcrumbs we leave behind as we attempt to self-actualize together. Something to be discarded, not something to be treasured. A liability, not an asset.\n\nBut in the back of our minds, we remember that it has to be valuable to somebody, right? We're supposed to be living in the age where \"data is the new oil\". We've all read the headlines about how Facebook sells our data. Yet somehow, the entire thing still feels like a big blur, like we don't really understand how we each fit into the equation. This feeling is not an accident. It is the result of one of the greatest deceptions of our age.\n\nWhile we call them \"social\" media companies, under the hoodie they're just traditional media companies in a new skin. They earn money from selling ad space, and they're much better at it than their incumbents like newspaper or television, because they've figured out a way to show us ads that are custom tailored for us, instead of showing the same generic ads to everyone.\n\nThey're able to do this is because they have better data about us than those existing mediums could have ever dreamed of. Using our data, and sophisticated AI that's trained on everyone's data put together, they can make predictions about what we like. But the AI models are meaningless without our content. Like a car with no gas, these models produce nothing if they aren't being constantly fed our data. Without it, they would stop being the best at delivering ads to us, and would lose their primary sources of revenue. **You can imagine how critical this data is to their business models.**\n\nMost tech companies value the intellectual property data that they gather and use so highly that they actually prefer to keep it **off their books**. [They don't account for this IP as a valuable intangible asset the way that normal Fortune 500 companies normally would](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20539517211017308). They benefit from being able to turn a blind eye to it, so they can avoid ever having to acknowledge how valuable this data is, and how unfair this transaction is for us, the users.\n\nSo, now that we understand that our content is valuable, lets go back to original question: **who owns it?**\n\nIf you read through the TOS agreements of the platforms you use, they'll tell you that you own your content. After all, you created it! However, there's one tiny catch: you grant them the right to use that content for essentially any purpose they please, including \"for future uses which haven't been invented yet\", so that they *effectively* own it.\n\nTake a moment, take a breath.\n\n> **\"FUTURE USES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN INVENTED YET\"**\n\nNow, try that fun thought experiment where you imagine all of the scary and profitable ways that a company like Facebook could come up with to use your data. It's a lot.\n\nBecause as I'm sure you realize, your data isn't like an old piece of fruit that you left in the back of your fridge. It has an infinite shelf life. And in fact, its value only continues to go up over time, the more of it that you can collect.\n\nThis one irrevocable IP clause, hidden deep inside every Terms of Service agreement that we've blindly agreed to, is the key to every single one of these companies being able to sell ads; the key to their ability to make money.\n\nWhen Mark Zuckerberg says \"we're a metaverse company now\", he isn't just talking about VR, he's referring to the collectively-created cloud of media over which Facebook has perpetual usage rights. **This is the Metaverse**, and he is quietly reminding us that he owns it. And although the Metaverse might feel like an endless ocean of data, remember that [an ocean is nothing but a multitude of drops](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1871423-cloud-atlas), and that each drop was not created by any of these platforms. It was created by us.\n\n# THE METAVERSE IS YOURS\n\n# SO YOU SHOULD OWN IT\n\n### Appendix - TOS of Social Giants\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php)\t- 🚨 **REKT**, can use or sell your content\twithout paying you anything\n* [Instagram](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/termsofuse)\t- 🚨 **REKT**, can use or sell your content\twithout paying you anything\n* [Tik Tok](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service?lang=en)\t- 🚨 **REKT**, can use or sell your content\twithout paying you anything\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/en/tos)\t- 🚨 **REKT**, can use or sell your content\twithout paying you anything\n* [Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement)\t- 🚨 **REKT**, can use or sell your content\twithout paying you anything\n* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/static?gl=CA&template=terms)\t- 🚨 **REKT**, can use or sell your content\twithout paying you anything\n* [Medium](https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f)\t- 🚨 **REKT**, can use or sell your content\twithout paying you anything\n* [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/#8-user-content)\t- 🚨🚨🚨 **ULTRA REKT**, they can use or sell your content without paying you anything AND its all exclusive to them for the first 24H\n* [Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018659011-Your-Content-Clause-Explained)\t- ✅ **Great**, you actually own your content\n* [Substack](https://substack.com/pa)\t- ✅ **Great**, you actually own your content, but you can only monotize it through them\n* [Pinterest](https://policy.pinterest.com/en/terms-of-service) - ✅ **Great**, you actually own your content", "timestamp": 1631389011, "digest": "OlcHFb-umaeoQrmSroGMjRKc2mp2Vm898CBUo0CMHeY", "contributor": "0xbfDb50Dc66C8Df9fd9688D8fe5A0C34126427645"}
