It is authoritative, professional, timely and comprehensive to help you tap the potential theme opportunities!\n\nStrong supervision has never been “off-line”, but the illegal stock speculation of securities company employees is still prohibited repeatedly.\n\nRecently, a person familiar with the matter disclosed that at least five employees of Henan Yanshi Shangdu Road Securities Business Department of Donghai securities had illegal financial management and illegal stock speculation. After receiving the anonymous report, Donghai securities brokerage business headquarters conducted investigation and verification with other departments, and punished the above five employees, as well as the head of the business department and two compliance personnel of the business department. The fine ranged from 2000 to 5000 yuan, and dismissed a “temporary worker”.\n\n“After investigation, the daily compliance management of the business department is relatively sound, there is no organized violation of discipline and rules, and only the transaction records of individual employees’ mobile phones are found. According to the investigation results and the company’s accountability system, the company has held relevant personnel accountable and punished.” In the face of the interview of Chinese reporters from securities companies, Donghai securities also gave a reply.\n\nIt is a commonplace for securities practitioners to speculate in stocks in violation of regulations. On the eve of the two sessions of the National People’s Congress and the National People’s Congress, there was also a discussion on whether securities practitioners should be allowed to buy and sell stocks from time to time.\n\nOn February 18, in response to the proposal of relevant CPPCC members, the CSRC said that in the next step, it would further study the relevant provisions on stock trading of securities practitioners, further strengthen the fine management of securities practitioners, strengthen the internal management and external restraint mechanism of securities companies, and gradually consolidate the industry culture of “compliance, integrity, professionalism and stability”, Study and promote relevant work.\n\nOne was dismissed and six were fined\n\n“It can be said that many employees of the securities business department of Yanshi Shangdu road of Donghai securities have been involved in illegal stock speculation for a certain time. Finally, after they were reported to the compliance department of the headquarters, the headquarters went to the business department for joint investigation.” A person familiar with the matter told the Chinese reporter of the securities firm.\n\nAccording to the information provided by the insider, in June 2021, the Donghai securities brokerage business headquarters issued a decision on the handling of seven employees, including Chen Moumou, an employee of the securities business department of Shangdu Road, Yanshi, and listed the relevant punishment contents in detail.\n\nThe punishment decision shows that from May 24 to 26, 2021, the East China Sea Securities brokerage business headquarters jointly dispatched a discipline inspection team and the compliance management department to establish a special investigation team to conduct on-site investigation on the securities business department of Shangdu Road, Yanshi. According to the investigation results and the relevant provisions of the detailed rules for the implementation of compliance management of Donghai securities brokerage branch, the following handling decisions are made for the relevant personnel of the business department:\n\n1、 Chen Moumou has the behavior of financing on behalf of customers. He carries out stock trading for most of the customers under his name. The facts are clear, the evidence is indeed sufficient, and the nature of violation is serious. Therefore, he decided to terminate the labor contract with Chen Moumou;\n\n2、 Wu Moumou, Cui Moumou and Wang Moumou mobile phones have customer transaction entrustment records, and some have stock transaction entrustment, and I can’t provide relevant certificates, which completely eliminates the suspicion of customer agency operation. Therefore, the wages of Wu Moumou, Cui Moumou and Wang are deducted and fined 5000 yuan, 4000 yuan and 4000 yuan respectively;\n\n3、 Duan was fined 4000 yuan for logging in and starting the automatic trading procedure for the TradeStation customers;\n\n4、 Gao Moumou, the person in charge of the business department, as the team leader during the period when the employee’s violation occurred, was directly responsible for the employee’s behavior management, so Gao Moumou’s salary was deducted and fined 5000 yuan;\n\n5、 Wang Moumou, the compliance manager of the business department, failed to perform his duties of daily supervision and inspection, so he was fined 2000 yuan.\n\nAt the same time, Donghai securities brokerage business headquarters said in the handling decision that all branches should take warning, strengthen the standardized management of the practice behavior of branch personnel, establish the concept of full compliance practice, comprehensively improve the compliance risk control awareness of branches, earnestly implement the self-inspection and self correction of the practice behavior of employees, and resolutely prevent and prevent Du Jue’s financial management The occurrence of illegal behaviors such as employee stock speculation.\n\n“Many people in the securities business department of Donghai securities Yanshi Shangdu road speculated in stocks. Finally, one temporary worker was dealt with, and the internal fines of the rest were covered with a ‘pot cover’.” The above-mentioned people familiar with the matter believe that such treatment is unreasonable.\n\nThe Chinese reporter of securities companies noted that according to the information of employees publicized on the official website of China Securities Association (hereinafter referred to as “China Securities Association”), among the above punished employees, the first punished Chen did not have relevant publicity information, that is, he belonged to the “temporary worker” referred to by insiders, while the employment information of other punished personnel was publicized on the official website of China Securities Association.\n\nThere are no organizational violations\n\nAccording to the 2020 annual report of Donghai securities, by the end of 2020, the company had a total of 70 securities business departments, distributed in 20 provinces across the country. According to the organizational structure, the brokerage business headquarters of the company is an important department at the same level as the Research Institute and institutional business department, while the securities business department of Yanshi Shangdu road belongs to the brokerage business headquarters.\n\nWhether the securities business department of Donghai securities Yanshi Shangdu road has collective stock speculation by employees, and whether it will be punished and reported to the regulatory authorities in accordance with the compliance requirements after violations?\n\nDonghai securities responded to Chinese reporters from securities companies. After receiving the anonymous report in 2021, the leaders of the company attached great importance to it. After research, the brokerage business headquarters jointly dispatched the discipline inspection and supervision team and the compliance management department to set up a special investigation team to conduct on-site investigation.

SH) again.\n\nOn the evening of March 2, Zhongtian Technology announced that it planned to acquire two companies from the controlling shareholder Zhongtian Technology Group to improve the layout of the new energy and power industry chain, with a total transaction amount of 381 million yuan.\n\nChangjiang Business Daily reporter found that Zhongtian Technology has repeatedly purchased assets from controlling shareholders. Previously, including the acquisition of Zhongtian broadband, the total transaction amount of assets acquired by Zhongtian Technology from Zhongtian Technology Group was nearly 2.8 billion yuan.\n\nZhongtian Technology is mainly engaged in cable business such as communication cable and power cable. Last year, the company was involved in the Sui Tianli case, which led to its private network communication business stepping on thunder.\n\nIt is precisely because of the radical layout of private network communication business that Zhongtian Technology was hurt by stepping on thunder in 2021. According to the performance forecast, the company made a one-time provision for asset impairment of more than 3 billion yuan, resulting in a sharp decline in the company’s profit of more than 90%.\n\nIt is worth noting that although the one-time provision is as high as 3 billion yuan, the risk of Zhongtian technology still exists because the company’s bill receivable balance and accounts receivable still increase by nearly 4 billion yuan year-on-year.\n\nAccording to wind data, since its listing, Zhongtian Technology has completed six additional issues and one convertible bond issue, including IPO, and its direct financing amount has reached 18.442 billion yuan. Up to now, the company has distributed dividends totaling 1.990 billion yuan.\n\nThe cumulative amount of connected mergers and acquisitions may exceed 3.1 billion\n\nZhongtian Technology plans to implement connected M & A again.\n\nAccording to the announcement, on March 2, Zhongtian Technology signed an equity transfer agreement with the controlling shareholder Zhongtian Technology Group. The company plans to acquire 100% equity of Zhongtian Xinxing Materials Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Zhongtian Xinxing materials) and Zhongtian Electric Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Zhongtian Electric Technology) held by Zhongtian Technology Group with its own funds, with transfer prices of 202 million yuan and 179 million yuan, totaling about 381 million yuan.\n\nThe qualification of the two target companies acquired this time is general. Zhongtian Xinxing materials was founded in December 2015. Its main products are battery cathode materials, which are mainly used in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries. The material technology is mature, the product consistency is good, and the processing performance is excellent. In 2020 and the first eight months of 2021, the operating revenue of Zhongtian Xinxing materials was 54.9228 million yuan and 56.1109 million yuan respectively, and the corresponding net profit was -2.9485 million yuan and 2.5573 million yuan. Last year, Zhongtian Xinxing materials turned losses into profits.\n\nAnother target company, Zhongtian Electric Technology, was established in March 2015 with a registered capital of 250 million yuan.

The book value of Zhongtian Electric Technology’s net assets is 146 million yuan, the assessed value is 179 million yuan, and the assessed value-added is 33.1767 million yuan, with a value-added rate of 22.74%.\n\nZhongtian Technology said that through this acquisition, the company will further improve the new energy industry chain, extend to the upstream materials required for the production of high-performance lithium-ion batteries, control the main material links and improve cost control through joint research and development and scale advantages. At the same time, cultivate comprehensive high-end talents from materials to battery system to realize the sustainable development of the industrial chain. At the same time, the company will enrich the power industry chain products and further improve the layout of the power industry chain. Benefiting from the construction of new infrastructure and smart grid, the company continues to develop high-performance and high-tech power distribution products focusing on energy conservation, environmental protection, safety and reliability to provide solutions for energy systems.\n\nThe reporter of Changjiang business daily found that Zhongtian Technology has frequently purchased assets from major shareholders.\n\nAccording to wind data, in October 2015, Zhongtian Technology added 120 million yuan to the related party Shanghai Zhongtian aluminum line to obtain part of the equity of the target company, which is a subsidiary of Zhongtian Technology Group. In November of that year, the company acquired 100% equity of Zhongtian broadband, 100% equity of Zhongtian alloy and 100% equity of Jiangdong hardware from Zhongtian Technology Group by issuing shares, with a transaction price of about 2.249 billion yuan.

This time, it was paid in cash, and the transaction price was 407 million yuan.\n\nThe total transaction amount of the above mergers and acquisitions was 2.776 billion yuan. If the M & a transaction is successfully completed, the cumulative amount of assets acquired by Zhongtian Technology from major shareholders will reach 3.157 billion yuan.\n\nWith the help of M & A, Zhongtian Technology has continuously improved its industrial layout, and has formed an industrial layout with new energy as the breakthrough, marine economy as the leader, smart grid as the support, 5g communication as the foundation and new materials as the growth point.\n\n11\\.9 billion of accounts receivable remains at risk\n\nIn the cable business such as communication cable and power cable, the operating performance of Zhongtian Technology originally continued to grow steadily.

Response from Hunan Provincial Health Commission", "body": "Tang Xiaobing of Jishou, Hunan Province, encountered a difficult problem after he made an IVF. He wanted to give up the 10 embryos he had saved in the hospital, but the hospital disagreed. The reason given by the hospital is also very simple: both sides of the test tube baby need to be present to process the embryo.\n\nTang Xiaobing felt that he had divorced his ex-wife at this time and could not contact his ex-wife. Should the hospital keep their embryos all the time? Tang Xiaobing immediately contacted the reporter of Xiaoxiang Morning Post and hoped to get help.\n\nRecently, Tang Xiaobing (a pseudonym) of Jishou contacted the medical department of Changsha reproductive hospital several times, saying that he and his ex-wife had divorced and hoped to immediately give up the 10 IVF embryos stored in the hospital. The hospital believes that giving up embryos needs to strictly follow the process, and Tang Xiaobing and his ex-wife need to be present at the same time for confirmation.\n\nTang Xiaobing told reporters that after the divorce, he was blackmailed by his ex-wife and couldn’t get in touch with her. The couple had done IVF in the hospital before. How to deal with the remaining embryos after divorce?\n\nIn this regard, on February 21, the medical administration office of the Provincial Health Commission also gave an answer: if you want to give up the embryo, you must obtain the consent of both parties, and the practice of the hospital is correct.\n\nParty concerned: if you can’t contact your ex-wife, you have the right to dispose of the embryo\n\nOn May 29, 2020, Tang Xiaobing and his ex-wife went to Changsha reproductive hospital for examination to prepare for IVF. One month after taking the medicine, Tang Xiaobing’s ex-wife was hospitalized and began to promote eggs and ovulation. The hospital took out Tang Xiaobing’s sperm and synthesized embryos.\n\nIn July of that year, the first embryo transfer failed, and the doctor advised Tang Xiaobing’s ex-wife to go home for rest. During the recuperation period, Tang Xiaobing had a conflict with his ex-wife. In March last year, the court decided to divorce the two in the second instance.\n\nDuring the first instance of the court, Tang Xiaobing proposed to the medical department of Changsha reproductive hospital for the first time to give up the embryos still preserved in the hospital. “There are still 10 embryos in the hospital.” Tang Xiaobing told reporters, “we have all dissolved our marriage through judicial procedures, and the embryos have no meaning. I asked the hospital to give up these embryos.”\n\nAccording to Tang Xiaobing, before making test tube babies, he and his ex-wife signed an informed consent for embryo freezing, which was kept by the hospital. “At that time, he also paid a deposit of 2000 yuan for the preservation of embryos. If the hospital needs to continue to preserve embryos after six months, 100 yuan will be deducted from the deposit every month.”\n\nTang Xiaobing told reporters that in the process of communication with the medical department of the hospital, the staff of the medical department said that if they decided to give up freezing, both parties who signed the informed consent at that time need to sign at the hospital for confirmation at the same time. “At first, the doctor said that if I couldn’t come to the hospital at the same time, I could come with the power of attorney signed by my ex-wife.” Tang Xiaobing said.\n\nTang Xiaobing believes that when he is unable to get in touch with his ex-wife, he has the right to ask the hospital to give up the embryo due to ethical issues.\n\nOn February 22, the reporter contacted Tang Xiaobing’s ex-wife. She said that she had been shelving the abandonment of embryos because she failed to reach an agreement with Tang Xiaobing on the distribution of the deposit of 2000 yuan for frozen embryos and had no time to go to Changsha to deal with it.\n\nHealth Commission: if the storage period is exceeded, it will be deemed to be automatically abandoned\n\nSince November 2020, Tang Xiaobing has been in contact with Dr. Tan of the medical department of Changsha reproductive hospital through wechat. On February 21, the reporter of Xiaoxiang Morning Post called Dr. tan.\n\nDr. Tan told reporters that the hospital has been actively promoting and dealing with this matter. “We also contacted his (Tang Xiaobing) ex-wife and tried to deal with it through a compliant procedure, but her attitude was’ no matter ‘, so we couldn’t deal with the embryo for the time being.”\n\nAccording to Dr. Tan, the hospital has a strict process for the abandonment of embryos. “There are provisions on the informed consent form on the number of years for the preservation of embryos. Before that, the hospital will keep them. After exceeding the number of years, the hospital will treat the embryos.” In response to Tang Xiaobing’s concerns about ethical issues, Dr. Tan stressed that “there is also a strict process for dealing with abandoned embryos, and the hospital will not divert embryos for other purposes.” At the same time, Dr. Tan said that without the consent of the parties, the hospital could not inform the reporter of the specific storage period.\n\nOn February 21, the reporter called the medical administration department of the provincial health commission. The staff told reporters that after the two signed the informed consent for embryo freezing in the hospital, if they want to give up the embryo, “they must obtain the consent of both parties, and the practice of the hospital is correct. The man did not obtain the consent of the woman, so there is no way to destroy the embryo”.\n\nIn view of Tang Xiaobing’s inability to get in touch with his ex-wife after his divorce, a staff member of the medical administration office said: “the embryo has a certain storage period. If the woman is still not contacted after the storage period, the embryo is deemed to have been abandoned automatically.”\n\nWhere are the remaining embryos going\n\nOver the past 40 years, more than 8 million people have been born with the help of IVF technology in the world. More than 200000 IVF babies are born every year in China. As this technology matures, new problems arise - where should the remaining embryos go during IVF surgery?\n\nIn the UK, an organization dealing with relevant issues was established in 1990, with a clear retention period of 10 years, and those more than 10 years will be destroyed. Germany and Italy stipulate that there can be no surplus embryos in the process of implementing IVF technology.\n\nPeking Union Medical College Hospital is one of the earliest hospitals in China to carry out IVF technology. A doctor of the hospital told reporters that the liquid nitrogen tank used to store embryos in the hospital has reached saturation. Many embryos have been shelved for more than 10 years, up to 30 years. The doctor said: “Multiple embryos will be cultivated in one test tube cycle, and the hospital will generally screen out two embryos and implant them into the uterus. The remaining embryos will be stored in liquid nitrogen tank and can be used again after successful awakening if necessary in the future. In fact, most patients will lose contact with the hospital soon after successful operation, and the remaining embryos become ownerless. At present, the annual preservation cost of an embryo is from 1000 yuan To 3000 yuan, which can only be paid by the hospital. “\n\nAt present, many institutions in Beijing, Nanjing, Wuhan and other places are facing the same problems. Data show that the number of ownerless embryos in some areas has reached more than 60%. The preservation of the remaining embryos was in a dilemma. But is it really impossible to rely on the shelf life of embryos in China?\n\nSince the contract specifies the storage period of embryos in the hospital, why do some hospitals still fail to deal with ownerless embryos in time?

{"id": "u-Fnja4OoPazi7g3m8ZxrdwkXg16rZ51JGGj9droMjg", "title": "Understanding Crypto Maximalism", "body": "Crypto maximalism is by far the strangest but most fascinating thing in the crypto space. People back their chain of choice like it’s their local football team. Ever since taking a deep dive into this space I never really understood maximalism. I personally watch a ton of football (actual football, not handegg) but don’t support any team, however I noticed striking similarities between the hardcore football fans and crypto maximalists. So this is my 50IQ attempt at understanding maximalism.\n\nIdeology\n\nTheoretically, tribalism shouldn’t exist because everyone who is in the crypto space is ideologically aligned in many ways. Everyone has a certain disdain for the traditional system, everyone is skeptical of fiat currencies and the monetary policies surrounding them, people want to opt out of traditional society, people don’t like banks, and most people have that slight sprinkle of degeneracy in their system (some more than others). Yet, with so many similarities, you see some very toxic arguments and fights. Bitcoin maxis crucify ETH maxis, ETH maxis crucify AVAX or SOL maxis, and everyone crucifies ADA maxis. Other than this you even have maxis for applications. You have link marines, Frognation and many others.\n\nThe best way to describe the infighting between such a similar set of people is through what Sigmund Freud describes as the “narcissism of minor differences”. He basically says that when people are so alike, it is the marginal differences that are used as the basis for aversion and toxicity towards the others. This show of anger tends to be much stronger when the differences are marginal. In crypto, the marginal difference boils down to a person’s investment decision. People may have found Cardano through their favourite youtuber, or Ethereum for its decentralization, or AVAX for its usability. At the end of the day it is a minor difference in investment decision amongst ideologically similar people that creates such huge infighting. Luckily it’s all behind a screen.\n\nCommunity and belonging\n\nCommunity is everything in crypto. Building an engaged community is often paramount to the success of your protocol. Often times, when you become part of a strong and growing community within crypto, there is this romanticized sense of solidarity &amp; belonging. Given that most new participants in crypto are often young &amp; not rich, when they find themselves in a group of likeminded people it creates a sense of emotional arousal. It’s exciting to be part of “the mob” sometimes.\n\nWhen their belief and participation in this community pays off, it often makes their bond to the community even stronger. People often never want to leave simply because of what they have accomplished and experienced through being in the community. While it’s fair to think that all participants in any type of market have to be completely objective, we have never seen this kind of community formation around financial products/services ever before. When money is at stake it only makes the vested interest of people in that community that much larger. This leads on people to become tribalistic in some way.\n\nIdentity\n\nRelated to the point above, a person’s brand/identity formation also tends to play a role. When a person is early to a protocol, they consciously or subconsciously build their online persona/brand around this protocol. They constantly write articles about it, they write twitter threads about it, they publicly invest in it, they are extremely involved in the community and so on. This makes them either willingly or unwillingly stuck to this identity they have created. They can be willingly stuck because of how emotionally attached they are to the community or how attached they are to the vision of the protocol. Or, they can be unwillingly stuck due to the community. You have built a brand around this protocol and have been involved in it for so long, then you suddenly “jump ship”, the other community members get extremely pissed. We have seen it with Bitcoiners who started participating in Ethereum. The Bitcoin community absolutely crucified these people and in some cases even sent death threats. This however only keeps a person stuck publicly, they can do as they please privately and even build a new persona/brand.\n\nLaziness\n\nAnother possible explanation is Laziness, but Laziness in two different ways. One is the laziness of those who already made it and just can’t be bothered anymore. Some people who got rich of Ethereum cannot be bothered to get stuck in with AVAX NEAR LUNA SOL ATOM or whichever other protocol there is. They tend to lose that same passion and fire under the belly that they had before they made it, and due to this comfort they become de facto maximalists of their chain of choice.\n\nThe other laziness comes from the bagholder syndrome. These are the people who found a community they liked and joined in, but they joined in relatively late. They bought the coin near the top and have been holding it down ever since. While they hold these coins, they either get married to their bags or are too lazy to look at whether there are other opportunities in the market that they are missing. Lo and behold, while they held their bags down 80% without ever venturing out of their community, some other people have made life changing money by participating in other places. This invokes a sense of irritation in them which often makes them toxic towards the other people who did better.\n\nConclusion\n\nMy personal conclusion from understanding maximalism is don’t be a maximalist. While it is good to be involved in communities, there is major opportunity cost from being stuck. You may want to be a rotatooor profit maxi with no loyalty to any protocol, but they also tend to get crucified by the protocol maxis. Crypto is a vast land of opportunity, everyday there is a new chance and everyday there are major changes that take place within the space. If you get stuck, you will most likely get left behind. Why stick to one protocol when you can benefit from participating in multiple. Innovation &amp; change is at the heart of crypto, being a maximalist is often the opposite of this.\n\nThank You for reading,\n\nIf you enjoyed the article and are feeling generous, then please consider donating to my ETH wallet: 0x43A5D9C141125Cd67B9268ef28C7c6a9dC15F3c9\n\nPlease subscribe to the substack and follow the medium for more content (IT’S FREE)\n\nFollow me on twitter @LeftsideEmiri", "timestamp": 1649006282, "digest": "-GTMT7mTIDai6RtwRQ3veC1XyPj18r2-EAnkCbEC-_Y", "contributor": "0xaE3B664273C810F85Ec65Ca03c5274591fb83034"}

Many stars have cut short hair one after another. Among them, the most popular ones are Lisa’s “iron bangs knife Qi” and Tai Yan’s playful valgus short hair.\n\nThere is also Xin Zhilei’s short hair in previous years. Ni Ni changed to long hair at the end of last year. The casual short hair also made many Jimei move their heart to cut short hair.\n\nKorean egg roll head\n\nOmelet head? Is it not strange? In the early Korean drama “cheese trap”, Jin Gaoyin’s head wool roll became a popular hairstyle at that time.\n\nThis hairstyle is similar to it, but it has become short hair and curls have become more natural. Similar to the radian of water ripple, it can more naturally modify the face shape, and do not pick the face shape, and it will not show aging.\n\nPlayful outward warping\n\nThis hairstyle can be said to be an upgraded version of “Xin Zhilei short hair”, which has been improved by warping out at the end of the hair. The hair is hot and radiant. It is very natural and warped. It is a kind of salt and sweetness.\n\nIf you don’t want to have a perm, you can also cut your hair to shoulder length, which makes it look more flexible with natural valgus.\n\nLisa sharp knife and scissors\n\nSince Barbie changed this short hair, nine of the ten sisters on the street have followed the same style and matched it with ear dye.\n\nEven Rainie Yang, who has had short hair for 10 years, has had her hair cut with a knife.\n\nI have to say that this hairstyle is really very face trimming. It is three centimeters below the ear and just long above the clavicle, which makes the lines of the chin look clearer and instantly achieve the effect of making the facial features three-dimensional and small face.\n\nJapanese short hair\n\nIf you are not satisfied with the above shortness, you can consider Japanese shortness! Before, Zhang Junning, the goddess of sports, also Po produced photos of herself cutting the same hairstyle, which looked neat and handsome.\n\nThe hair will be thinner to the ear, which will make the neck more slender. It will make the face look smaller and more exquisite.

The crude oil suddenly soared by 18%!", "body": "China fund daily reporter Ivan\n\nThe situation in Russia and Ukraine affects the whole world, and the commodity and energy markets fluctuate most violently. Let’s take a look at the latest news.\n\nInternational oil prices soared again!\n\nBrent crude oil once approached $140!\n\nEarly this morning, Beijing time, the situation in Russia and Ukraine made the market worried about tightening supply and soaring crude oil prices again.\n\nBrent crude oil price once rose 18% to US $139.13. At present, it has fallen slightly, but it still reaches nearly US $130.\n\nThe prices of various crude oil futures also generally rose.\n\nOn Thursday, JPMorgan Chase released a research report that if Russia’s oil supply continues to be impacted by European and American sanctions, the international oil price is expected to soar to $185. Since the escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, oil prices have continued to soar, and Brent crude oil prices soared to nearly $120 early Thursday. The background is that traders are trying to avoid Russian oil under the big stick of sanctions. At present, 66% of Russian oil faces difficulties in finding buyers.\n\nGold and base metal prices are approaching new highs\n\nEarly this morning, Beijing time, spot gold stood at the $1990 mark, up 1% during the day.\n\nSpot palladium rose 2.8% to $3094.43 an ounce, hitting a record high.\n\nAll kinds of metal futures prices are also generally rising!\n\nUS officials said they were considering\n\nHow to support the Ukrainian government in exile\n\nAccording to informed U.S. officials, if Ukrainian President Zelensky has to evacuate the capital Kiev, U.S. and European officials have been discussing how to support the Ukrainian government in exile under such circumstances. The scope of the discussion included supporting the relocation of Ukrainian government officials to Lvov in western Ukraine, or the possibility that they were forced to leave Ukraine completely and establish an exile government in Poland. However, these discussions are only preliminary and have not yet involved any substantive decisions.\n\nIAEA:\n\nThe zaborore nuclear power plant is completely controlled by the Russian army\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency said on the 6th that it had received a report from the relevant departments of Ukraine that although the zaporoge nuclear power plant was still operated by the original staff, the management of the nuclear power plant had accepted the order of the Russian military commander who controlled the nuclear power plant. Any action by the management of the nuclear power plant, including the technical operation related to the six nuclear reactors, requires the prior approval of the Russian military commander.\n\nIn addition, Ukrainian authorities also said that the Russian army has closed some network facilities, so it is unable to obtain reliable information about the nuclear power plant through normal communication channels. At present, fixed line telephone, e-mail and fax are no longer in operation, and mobile phone communication is still available, but the quality is very poor.\n\nThe director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency Grossi expressed serious concern about this situation and believed that this move violated the relevant principles of safeguarding nuclear safety. He reiterated his readiness to travel to Chernobyl to ensure the commitment of all parties to the conflict to the safety and security of all Ukrainian nuclear power plants.\n\nPresident of the European Commission:\n\nUkraine needs time to join the EU\n\nOn March 6 local time, European Commission President von delaine once again expounded his views on Ukraine’s accession to the EU in an interview with the media in Berlin, Germany. She said that she welcomed Ukraine’s application to join the EU. “There is no doubt that the brave Ukrainian people belong to the European family”. But at the same time, von delaine pointed out that there are clear regulations and processes for joining the EU, which “cannot be bypassed”, and it will not happen overnight. Nor did she give a clear answer as to when the process could bear fruit at the earliest.\n\nVon delaine stressed that at present, the most important thing is to provide as much support to Ukraine as possible in the current conflict. Previously, von delaine has repeatedly stated that the most important task now is to end the conflict, and Ukraine’s accession to the EU should be the next step. Public opinion generally believes that in addition to expressing solidarity and intention, the EU can not do too much on Ukraine’s accession to the EU. As Ukraine is far from the standards required by the EU in all aspects of political, economic and social development, its accession to the EU is destined to be far away. Some scholars pointed out that at present, it is necessary to manage the expectation of Ukraine’s accession to the EU, not to let the outside world have too much expectation, and the EU should not make too many unrealistic commitments.\n\nMembers of the Ukrainian delegation to the Russian Ukrainian negotiations:\n\nUkraine is no longer committed to applying to join NATO\n\nOn the 6th local time, alahamia, member of the Ukrainian delegation to the Russian Ukrainian negotiations and chairman of the parliamentary group of the Ukrainian people’s public servant party, said that NATO was not prepared to discuss Ukraine’s accession to the organization in the next five to 10 years.\n\nHe said that Ukraine will no longer commit to submitting an application for joining NATO, but will discuss a “non NATO model”. On this issue, it is not just Russia that Ukraine must have a dialogue with.\n\nMembers of the Ukrainian delegation to the Russian Ukrainian negotiations:\n\nBoth sides are satisfied with the current negotiation process\n\nOn the 6th local time, alahamia, member of the Ukrainian delegation to the Russian Ukrainian negotiations and chairman of the parliamentary group of the Ukrainian people’s public servant party, said that both sides were satisfied with being able to listen to each other’s positions and carry out active discussions.\n\nHe said that at present, the only thing that cannot be agreed with Russia is the Crimea issue and the recognition of the independence of Lugansk and Donetsk.\n\nOver 130 tons of humanitarian supplies\n\nFrom Russia to Lugansk\n\nOn the 6th local time, more than 130 tons of humanitarian supplies arrived in Lugansk region from Russia, including rice, cans, sweets and drinking water.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\n\nTelephone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Bennett\n\nOn the evening of the 6th local time, the Kremlin website announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Bennett. The two sides continued to exchange views on Russia’s special military operations and Bennett’s contacts with leaders of other countries on the Ukrainian issue.\n\nOn the 5th, Bennett visited the Russian capital Moscow and held talks with Putin.\n\nShareholder welfare is coming!

If you want to cover up these places, you want to spread some foundation, so that it will not only be easy to lose, but also look bigger than the actual age. The key point of showing young, hydrated and vibrant skin is to apply makeup thinly. “\n\n“First of all, it is necessary to improve the facial makeup. Therefore, skin care is very important. Especially with plenty of make-up water to keep the skin moist. Another key is to make up the front milk. Then, begin to apply the foundation from the blemish. The problem will be eliminated at the beginning, and the rest will be thinner. Make a beautiful foundation. “\n\nThe focus of shaping good skin is basic skin care. Moisturize the skin with make-up water. After one application, apply it again. From the age of 40, this is the most time-consuming place.\n\nActivate the base cream that slightly improves the color of the skin. The dark will disappear, and the texture of the skin will also increase one grade, so the foundation will not be painted very thick afterwards. Only apply it to the triangle area that you want to make people look beautiful, even without makeup.\n\nFoundation is the most important thing to do. At first, apply it from the places where you care more, such as color spots. If these places disappear, they will basically become clean, so the rest can be clicked gently.

The secret of Kuroda Liumei muscle is the application method that can be infiltrated and absorbed! Both the make-up water and the foundation need a little time to improve the texture of the skin. You also have the beauty of the actress.\n\nIn the shaping of Kuroda Liumei muscle, the basic skin care before applying make-up milk takes the longest time, which is this step. It is necessary to fully replenish the skin with make-up water. Use a cotton pad to apply a large amount of make-up water to the whole face slowly and gently.\n\nAgain, put the lotion on the palm of your hand, like wrapping your skin with your hand, to infiltrate and absorb it and make the lotion penetrate. If you have time, repeat carefully to keep your skin moist.

Dull disappears, showing a sense of transparency and color, and will naturally become confident skin. Don’t apply it all over your face.\n\nThe foundation is removed by sponge. Use half a sponge on half your face is appropriate. Direct painting on the face is the cause of uneven color, so first spread the dots on the back of the hand, and fully integrate the foundation into the sponge.\n\nFrom the more prominent spots such as spots began to paint foundation. Generally, it is concentrated in the place with relatively high cheekbones, so apply it from there. Do not rub hard, but gently touch the skin and spread it out in spots to make it infiltrate and absorb.\n\nAfter covering the key position, spread the remaining foundation on the sponge in the order of the photo. Don’t wipe hard at this time, like a sliding sponge. Repeat several times and the gloss will be up. The other half of the face is painted like this.\n\nAfter the face is spread all over the face, it is divided into three parts from the center of the face, gently pressed by the palm of the hand, so that the foundation can penetrate into the skin. The forehead and chin should also be pressed.\n\nFinally, use a little honey powder and apply it only to the forehead that is easy to get oil and the curve part of the face that is easy to be uneven in color. Cheeks and eyes will be smeared with powdered things such as blush and eye shadow and so on, so OK is not needed.\n\nBefore Pink milk makeup\n\nShow skin luster\n\nPre makeup milk can adjust the dullness and wrinkles.

The Changsha teenager ran away from home and blew a cold wind on the roof of the building all night", "body": "On February 17, the waste materials trading market in Wangcheng District, Changsha City. Ms. you, who didn’t sleep all night, received a call from her son’s head teacher, saying that her son Xiaojun didn’t go to school. Ms. you was even more anxious - since the quarrel between her mother and her son led to her son running away from home on the evening of the 16th, Ms. you searched through various ways, but there was no news of her son.\n\nHowever, through the phone call with the head teacher, she learned that her son’s emotional outburst was not only due to the quarrel, but also directly related to her long-time busy safeguarding rights in the community.\n\nThe owners of Ms. you’s community and the industry committee have great differences on various issues in the community, which has affected the daily life of the owners. The owners said that the water had been stopped for more than ten days in January.\n\nAt about 1 p.m. on February 17, Ms. you saw the news in the owner group. A neighbor said she saw the child go home and asked her to hurry back. Ms. you’s uneasy heart was finally relieved. However, when they face each other at home, some of the emotional estrangement that has been caused is still obviously between them.\n\nAfter chatting for a while, Xiaojun was asked about the place where he spent the night last night. His voice suddenly broke out and angrily said that he had been blowing all night on the roof. If a passing college student hadn’t accompanied him for more than three hours and enlightened him, he might not come back now.\n\nMs. you keeps calling\n\nThere was a quarrel over playing with his mobile phone, and his son left home all night\n\nAt about 11 a.m. on February 17, the reporter of Xiaoxiang Morning Post contacted Ms. you, who said she was near the gate of Changsha Medical College. The reporter came to the door of the medical school and saw a woman in a white long down jacket. The other party turned around, and the interwoven depression and urgency on her face basically showed her identity.\n\nAs soon as you open your mouth, Ms. you couldn’t help choking: “My son usually likes to come here to play and play basketball. I can’t get in. Now I can only ask my friends to help me find him. I really don’t know where to find him. We’ve asked him all the hotels and Internet cafes nearby. His head teacher called this morning and said he didn’t go to school. I thought I would help him deliver his schoolbag if he went to school.”\n\nTime goes back to last night. As usual, Ms. you is busy with the protection of rights in the community. Because many owners are only at home at night, her time to deal with relevant affairs is naturally extended to the evening.\n\nWhile she was worried about safeguarding her rights, she saw her son playing with his old mobile phone after he came home from school. She was so angry that she didn’t understand how a student who had been in grade three could not put his studies at ease?\n\nAfter the two glared at each other, their son Xiaojun ran out of the house. Until late at night, Xiaojun hasn’t come back. Ms. you has searched around the big market for many times, but her son has never been found. She waited on her sofa all night and couldn’t sleep. Knowing that her son didn’t bring the key, she specially left the door.\n\nAt 8:00 on the 17th, she received a call from her head teacher saying that Xiaojun didn’t go to school. The news of looking for people spread among teachers, students and students’ parents, and many owners also helped to find and inquire about businesses around the market. Ms. you also called the police, but the monitoring of the big market was mostly abandoned due to no management. Only a nearby monitoring showed that Xiaojun ran out of a gate of the big market at 9:34 pm last night.\n\nBy 12 noon on the 17th, there was still no news about Xiaojun. Some people worry that Ms. you is very active in safeguarding her rights in the community. Will her son’s “loss of contact” be related to this? Ms. you shed tears and was extremely anxious. What she worried most was that her son would be unhappy.\n\n△ the monitoring showed that Xiaojun ran out of the gate of the big market on the evening of February 16\n\nThe son once confided to the head teacher that he often had no water to take a bath and only had cold food when he came home\n\nThe phone call made by the head teacher not only let Ms. you know that Xiaojun didn’t go to school, but also let her understand many of the feelings that Xiaojun didn’t tell her.\n\n“The teacher just told me that every time he (Xiaojun) wanted to take a bath, the water couldn’t be opened.” The water supply in the community is often cut off, and according to Ms. you, Xiaojun is a clean person. Because of the lack of water, he can only run to his uncle’s house every three or five times.\n\nThe instability of the water source from this market is related to the differences between the owners and the industry committee. According to Ms. you and many owners, the market originally had properties, but after leaving at the end of 2015, it was taken over by the industry committee. Owners said that the industry committee was not established by everyone’s election, “most owners did not vote.”\n\nFor several years in a row, the differences between them have become larger and larger, and have reached the level of tit for tat. Ms. you and other owners believed that the industry authority did not act and meddled recklessly, and refused to renew the property fee. The feedback they received from the industry committee was to stop the owner’s water if they did not pay the property fee.\n\n“I want to be really low. I just hope I can pay online and use water like people in other communities. I stopped water for more than ten days in January. During my birthday, my wish on my birthday is to have water every day.” An owner told reporters. The reporter noticed when passing through the community that dozens of barrels of garbage were stacked untreated.\n\nMs. you is one of the early owners in the market. She has led other owners to protect their rights since last year. When talking about these things, Ms. you will become very angry, and she knows and cares about the development of many things and the experience of some owners. It is obvious that safeguarding rights has basically taken up her energy and attention.\n\n“I told his father that if he is really uncomfortable living here, we can move out and rent a house when he comes back.” Ms. you, who is anxiously looking forward to her son, cried.\n\nIn the words of the head teacher, she found that she ignored her son.\n\n“Sometimes I have to go to the owner at night, so I cook four dishes and give them to him. Let him come back and heat them in the microwave.” But for a student who is studying in the third year of junior high school, many students around him may have their parents to accompany him every day. When he comes back, he only has cold meals and empty houses.\n\n△ Ms. you and other owners are searching in the street\n\nMy son blew a cold wind on the roof of the building all night, and the college students talked with him until early morning\n\nAt about 1:00 p.m., someone sent a message to the owner that Xiaojun had died", "timestamp": 1649006924, "digest": "VMcROUzFzfd-weSSkfmEti-X08rUU8Y0TBj4PPrssdg", "contributor": "0x8a969F4b50536230b4ea9d1E5FDfa7A77A479bdd"}

Avoid two minefields, short faced Jimei can also have a variety of hairstyles!\n\nFirst, to increase the length of the chin, the first way is to cover part of the forehead slightly to make the up-down ratio look more uniform. Another way is to move the visual center of gravity up and weaken the position of the chin, which weakens the problem of short chin.\n\nTwo minefields with a short Chin\n\nThe thick Qi bangs, a product of the last century, can completely cover the forehead, but the length of the face seems to be shorter and will also appear wider.\n\nThe middle score and partial score bangs, although the middle score and partial score bangs will slightly cover the forehead, and visually have the effect of thin face. However, the long bangs will make the face longer, and the middle and upper segments will be longer, which will visually shorten the proportion of the chin.\n\nAvoid minefields. These bangs can be cut by Jimei people!\n\nDragon beard bangs\n\nSuitable object: Jimei with wide face and short Chin\n\nThe face is not wide, but thin, with slight curls of bangs on both sides. It is suggested that the length of these two bangs should be kept around the cheekbones, which can better visually modify the upper and middle segments. Coupled with the micro curl radian, it can weaken the edges and corners of the face and make the face look not wide, round and gentle.\n\nEight character bangs\n\nSuitable object: Jimei with long forehead and short Chin\n\nThe eight character bangs, which are so popular in recent years, look similar to the dragon beard bangs, but in fact, the eight character bangs focus more on the “eight” character! Bangs also have more hair. This bangs basically do not pick the face shape, especially Jimei, which can be decorated with the width of cheeks and forehead. It is better to keep the length of the bangs around the forehead so that the center of gravity is too high, which can solve the problem of vision.\n\nAir bangs\n\nAir bangs don’t really pick people, because they don’t completely cover the forehead, so they can better stabilize the proportion of the chin. Plus air bangs will make some natural radians, which is easier to modify the face shape. However, air bangs must pay close attention to the word “air”. Bangs should not be too thick, which will make the face look wide and short. The length of bangs should be controlled well, and do not exceed the eyebrows to cover the eyes! (length after bending)\n\nInstant noodles bangs\n\nLast year’s hot instant noodles, many people did not dare to try, feel too boastful! But in fact, the accusation is not provocative. Choosing such bangs will actually look younger!\n\nThe radian of instant noodles roll can well modify the length of the forehead.

In terms of the number of cities and companies involved, it currently ranks first among all real estate enterprises.\n\nThis situation is based on a group of overdue lists published by the Shanghai ticket exchange on March 3.\n\nThis overdue list is defined as “the acceptor who has more than three overdue payments from September 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022, and has overdue balance as of February 28, 2022 or overdue payment in the current month of February 2022”. It can be seen that the real estate enterprises such as Huaniang, Aoyuan, sunshine city, Xinli and Zhengrong that have “exploded” or will “explode” in the near future are all on the list, but Shimao Group has the largest number of projects involved.\n\nSpecifically, Shimao Group has 24 companies on the list, including both project companies and urban companies, involving 15 new first tier or strong second tier cities such as Fuzhou, Xiamen, Nanjing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Nanjing, Chengdu, Nanning and Ningbo. Fuzhou, as one of Shimao’s headquarters, has the largest number of Companies, reaching 6.\n\nFrom the perspective of overdue balance, there are at least hundreds of thousands, and more are from more than 10 million to more than 30 million yuan. For example, Nanjing Shimao Real Estate Development Co., Ltd., which has the largest amount, has an overdue balance of 33.4675 million yuan. The overdue amount of Shenzhen Shimao new mileage Industrial Co., Ltd., the main body of Shenzhen Longgang project with 6 billion funds of CITIC Trust, is 10.14 million yuan.\n\nAs for the “default” of Shimao Group, the earliest “rumor” can be traced back to November 5, 2021. At that time, a message on the Internet that “Shimao Group and Lujiazui trust talked about the extension” spread like wildfire. For a time, Shimao Group suffered a “double killing of shares and bonds”. On that day, the share price of Shimao Group fell sharply by more than 13%, and the price of many Shimao bonds fell sharply by more than 20%. Then the company urgently clarified.\n\nOn December 30, 2021, Shimao Group’s Shimao shares announced that the previous public opinion and rumors related to the controlling shareholder Shimao Group mainly focused on the cooperation with Minsheng trust and guoxintong trust, and said that “recently, Shimao Group has fully negotiated with the above trust institutions on the arrangement of stock debt, which has been understood and supported by relevant parties and preliminarily reached an agreement”.\n\nIt can be said that in the past five months, Shimao Group has been in constant “market news” about “default” and trying to clarify.\n\nHowever, on the whole, it does not seem optimistic.\n\nOn March 4, CITIC Trust issued the fifth interim information disclosure report on Shimao Shenzhen Longgang project, announcing that the trust product entered the “observation period” from March 4 to May 31, during which the next financial measures will be determined according to the indicators of Shimao. The trust plan has been overdue, with a balance of nearly 6 billion yuan as of February 15.\n\nOn the same day that the Shanghai ticket exchange announced the overdue list, Shimao Group added a new trust extension.\n\nAccording to public reports, a “Chongqing Trust Xinhong No. 1 collective fund trust plan” of Shimao Group and Chongqing Trust has been extended for a period of no more than 16 months, and the specific elements of the extension need to be further determined. The trust was established in phase 6 on February 26, 2021 and expired on February 26 this year. Shanghai Shimao Construction Co., Ltd. issued a joint and several liability guarantee commitment letter, and Shimao Group provided the balance to make up.\n\nSo far, there have been at least five trust institutions that have “disputes” with Shimao Group.\n\nIt should be mentioned that although Shimao Group has not defaulted or extended its debt in the open market so far, it is still unknown what will happen in the next month.\n\nAccording to the open letter phi, on March 19 two weeks later, Shimao Group will have a corporate bond of 950 million yuan due. This year, Shimao’s domestic and overseas bonds of about 14 billion yuan will expire, of which a US dollar bond of nearly US $1 billion will expire in July.\n\nIn other words, March and July this year will be a “stress test” node for Shimao Group.\n\nAccording to the data of Oriental Fortune choice, at present, there are 22 domestic corporate bonds, medium-term notes and ABS under Shanghai Shimao construction and Shanghai Shimao shares of Shimao Group, with a total amount of 25.2 billion yuan. In addition, Shimao Group still has eight US dollar bonds, with a total amount of about US $5.7 billion, or about RMB 36 billion.\n\nIn fact, since last year, Shimao Group has begun to “save itself”.\n\nOn December 17, 2021, Shimao Group announced that it sold a property development project called “Victoria Harbour exchange” in southwest Kowloon, Hong Kong at a price of HK $2086 million; On January 21 this year, Shimao Group transferred a commercial office plot in the core area of Shanghai Bund to state-owned enterprise Shanghai Jiushi at the price of 1.06 billion yuan; On January 24, Shimao sold 26.67% of the equity of Guangzhou Asian Games city project to the central enterprise Zhonghai real estate at the price of 1.845 billion yuan; On January 28, Shimao Group sold Shanghai Bund maoyue hotel to Shanghai real estate group at a price of 4.5 billion yuan.\n\nUnder the general trend of the industry, for real estate enterprises, the more liabilities, the greater the pressure. Whether they can balance the two ends of the balance depends on the ability to collect money after sales and the determination to dispose of assets.\n\nDisclaimer: the articles are sorted according to public information, only for sharing financial information and opinions, and do not constitute any investment advice to anyone.\n\nShareholder welfare is coming!

Hereinafter, I will collectively refer to them as Dad shoes for convenience.\n\nWhy can the “old-fashioned” shoes like daddy’s shoes maintain their popularity for so long? I don’t think there are several reasons.\n\nFirst, the shoes are classic enough, and the shoes themselves have a large number of fans.\n\nSecond, the shoe shape is versatile and retro, which can be competent for a lot of daily shapes. As an important part of matching shapes, I don’t need to say how much points are added to the attribute of versatile.\n\nThe third point is the price. The price of most dad shoes is close to the people, and it is not difficult to start.\n\nSuch a kind of good shoes that can start easily and give consideration to collocation and daily use will be welcomed, which is normal.\n\nNew balance, the ancestor brand, is naturally one of the most influential brands in the category of retro sneakers.\n\nHere are some new b alance retro sneakers summarized for you. They are cheap and popular. You don’t have to worry about hitting shoes. Start easily. Please check ↓↓\n\nNew Balance 530\n\nNew Balance 530\n\nPrice: 600 \\~ 800\n\nAs one of the hottest popular models on instagram, various fashion bloggers can be said to have a pair of human feet, especially girls!\n\nThe advantages of new balance 530 shoes are obvious. The thick midsole can be increased, but the shoe body is different from ordinary dad shoes. It is not bulky as a whole and can show the length of legs.\n\nTherefore, it is better to match with instagram’s most popular combination of “white socks + white ball shoes”. No wonder bloggers love these shoes.\n\nNew Balance 860V2\n\nNew Balance 860V2\n\nPrice: 400 \\~ 600\n\nAfter cooperating with Casablanca and aim é Leon Dore, new balance brought 860v2 back to us, but the heat of this pair of shoes is still not high.\n\nComplex multi material upper, thick midsole and retro shape, standard dad shoe configuration. The most impressive part of this pair of shoes should be the concave convex large cushioning glue on the heel, which adds a lot of color to the whole pair of shoes in appearance.\n\nInterestingly, this pair of shoes is very popular in xiaohongshu. Will it become the next pop of daddy’s shoes? Let’s wait and see\\~\n\nNew Balance 452\n\nNew Balance 452\n\nPrice: 600 \\~ 800\n\nThis pair of new balance’s daddy shoes also has a high heat on xiaohongshu. This pair of shoes also launched xiaohongshu users’ favorite “milk tea color”, which makes them have a preference for this pair of shoes.\n\nThe new balance 452 shoes are plump and have a good heightening effect, but they are slightly “bulky”, which is a little similar to the m2k Tenko, which was popular before Nike.\n\nWhile a pair of shoes is not really popular, pure white color matching and gray color matching are good choices. Buy early and enjoy early!\n\nNew Balance 827\n\nNew balance 827 (non joint)\n\nPrice: 400 \\~ 700\n\nAimé Leon Dore x New Balance 827\n\nthisisneverthat x New Balance 827\n\nNew balance 827 has recently completed two highly popular joint names, namely this snevertha, a South Korean street brand, and aim é Leon Dore, a new york fashion brand.\n\nThe two joint names also brought high attention to the new balance 827 shoes, which made many sneaker lovers know the shoes again.\n\nAmong today’s contestants, new balance 827 should be regarded as a more “exquisite” shoe. The exquisite workmanship and many special designs in detail are enough to make this pair of shoes stand out.\n\nNew Balance 608\n\nNew Balance 608\n\nPrice: 300 \\~ 500\n\nThis pair of 608 is somewhat similar to the 452 described above, but the full leather upper of this pair of shoes is much inferior in texture.\n\nAs a pair of big goods, this pair of shoes will naturally have many colors. You can choose from a variety of colors\\~\n\nIn fact, the first time I saw this pair of shoes, I had a feeling that this is a popular style that Koreans will wear…. In order to promote this pair of shoes, new balance found the famous Korean actress Li Zhien IU to speak for her.\n\nWith her goods, this pair of shoes has a good response and heat.\n\nFriends who like all leather retro sneakers might as well consider this pair of shoes. Some colors of Li Zhien’s same style are only 300 +, and the price is really exciting\\~\n\nNew Balance 850\n\nNew Balance 850\n\nPrice: 400 \\~ 600\n\nN.HOOLYWOOD x New Balance\n\nAt the end of 2019, new balance brought back this pair of shoes born in 1996 through remake.\n\nDuring this period, new balance also launched cooperation with n. housewood. Unfortunately, the sense of existence of these shoes has not been very high.\n\nThe biggest feature of this pair of shoes is to discard the most classic n-word logo in the brand blood on the side of the shoes. The brand logo appears in the form of embroidery at the heel. This operation is not common in a group of shoes of new balance.\n\nTherefore, this pair of shoes also has a different feeling from conventional NB shoes\\~\n\nThe multi-level combination of mesh fabric and leather upper makes the shoes very retro, and the embroidered logo on the heel is the finishing touch. I like the shape and presentation of the whole pair of shoes very much.\n\nIn addition, there are quite a lot of color combinations of these shoes, and there are always styles suitable for your heart.\n\nNew Balance 410", "timestamp": 1649007246, "digest": "GWMJNXrY2iTdnvupu5aUOb4l5t_CKGrrUuw0S--vDsQ", "contributor": "0x23a761DEB206607aAB91684A58e30ce5C3Ab84AA"}

They recommended landing as soon as possible and medical assistance.\n\nAt 14:05, the crew immediately decided to go to the nearest airport Changsha for alternate landing. The ground dispatcher of China Eastern Airlines quickly monitored the flight operation dynamics, contacted the tower, Changsha ground staff and airport first aid, and provided flight alternate information.\n\nAfter 40 minutes, the plane landed smoothly, and the airport ambulance and medical personnel were waiting at the parking stand.

What Jimin likes to buy most is them", "body": "The scale of public funds reached a new high, among which bond funds grew the fastest.\n\nOn the evening of March 3, the data disclosed by the China Fund Industry Association showed that as of the end of January this year, the number of domestic fund managers was 151, the number of managed public fund products was 9288, and the net asset value of managed funds totaled 25.87 trillion yuan, with the scale growing for four consecutive months.\n\nSpecifically, the growth of the scale of public funds in January was mainly due to the growth of the scale of stable products. Among them, the scale of money market funds and bond funds increased by 6.09% and 7.45% month on month respectively, and the scale of stock funds and hybrid funds decreased.\n\nThe scale of public funds has maintained growth for four consecutive months\n\nOn March 3, the data released by the China Fund Industry Association showed that by the end of January 2022, there were 137 fund management companies in China, including 45 foreign-invested fund management companies and 92 domestic fund management companies; 12 securities companies or asset management subsidiaries of securities companies and 2 insurance asset management companies have obtained the qualification for public fund management. The net asset value of public funds managed by the above institutions totaled 25.87 trillion yuan.\n\nData show that the number of fund managers remained unchanged for seven consecutive months at the end of January, still 151.\n\nBy the end of January 2022, the net asset value of public funds had increased by 25.64% year-on-year and 1.22% month on month compared with the end of January 2021, maintaining growth for four consecutive months.\n\nSpecifically, among open-end funds, the net asset values of equity funds, hybrid funds, money market funds, bond funds and QDII funds were 2.41 trillion yuan, 5.67 trillion yuan, 10.04 trillion yuan, 4.4 trillion yuan and 0.24 trillion yuan respectively, with a month on month change of - 6.81%, - 6.36%, 6.09%, 7.45% and - 1.27%. In terms of share, the shares of equity funds, hybrid funds, money market funds, bond funds and QDII funds increased month on month, with growth rates of 4.42%, 2.45%, 6.09%, 7.13% and 8.2% respectively.\n\nIn terms of product quantity, the number of public fund products reached 9428, an increase of 140 compared with the previous month. In addition to QDII funds, equity funds, hybrid funds, money market funds and bond funds have increased to varying degrees.\n\nIn general, the net asset value of money market funds and bond funds increased in January, among which bond funds grew the fastest, and the net asset value of stock funds and hybrid funds decreased. It can be said that the growth of the net asset value of public funds in January was mainly contributed by the growth of the scale of stable fund products.\n\nStable funds are favored by investors\n\nBoth money market funds and bond funds have achieved rapid growth in terms of net asset value and fund shares, which has something to do with their steady market performance.\n\nAccording to wind data, the bond market rose across the board in January 2022, with CSI all bonds, CSI treasury bonds and CSI corporate bonds rising by 0.96%, 0.80% and 0.73% respectively. From the perspective of comparing the returns of the whole category of assets, the steady performance of money market funds and bond funds will undoubtedly increase investors’ good mood for such funds.\n\nIn addition, the recent fund issuance data also show that partial bond funds are more favored by investors. For example, among the newly established funds since February, seven of the top 10 funds in the first offering scale are partial bond funds.\n\nLooking forward to the bond market in 2022, Zhang Liling, general manager of the third fixed income investment department of Boshi fund, said that in the first half of the year, the bond market was escorted by monetary policy and still had good returns. From the long-term logic, the bond market still had band opportunities. This year, we should reduce the expected income of investment and slightly strengthen the prevention of overall risks. Li Jincan, manager of Harvest Fund’s ultra short bond fund, believes that March is an appropriate time to reduce the policy interest rate. In addition to the purpose of stabilizing the growth of fundamentals, expectation management is also a problem that the central bank needs to face. It coincides with the important time node of the release of economic data, the conclusion of the two sessions and the arrival of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate meeting. It is still necessary to stabilize market sentiment by reducing interest rates, Overall, there are still opportunities for the bond market in the medium-term dimension.\n\nThe poor performance of the equity market dragged down the shrinkage of the equity scale\n\nIn January, the A-share sentiment was disturbed by the dual factors of domestic and foreign markets. The A-share index fell all the way down. Among them, the Shanghai stock index fell 7.65% and the gem index fell 12.45%. In terms of sectors, the sector rotation was obvious. Among the 31 Shenwan industries, only banks achieved positive returns, up 2.33%, and the rest closed down, especially the popular track sector, The performance of relevant popular funds is not satisfactory. Therefore, even if the share of equity funds increased in January, the total net asset value of equity funds shrank.\n\nThe poor performance of the equity market has greatly affected the issuance of new equity funds. According to wind data, only 148 funds were announced in January 2022, with a significant decline in the number and scale.\n\nIt is worth noting that after deducting the shares of newly issued funds, the total shares of equity funds are still increasing. The data show that investors are still optimistic about the equity market for a long time and maintain a net subscription status for equity funds.\n\nFor the stock market in 2022, fund companies generally expect that the probability of A-share collective trend falling sharply in the future is low, and the logic of continuing the structural market remains unchanged.\n\nMassive information and accurate interpretation are all in Sina Finance app", "timestamp": 1649007284, "digest": "uTF-aBi4zCbZVFAHdtkosJrehVCiQpRf1H9NMxIGE40", "contributor": "0x370D1d26A692dA4D1b7a90DF315d36BeA9410a41"}

No one’s taking the kids? Don’t have time to pick up the children on time? The new measures of nine primary schools in Changsha will make these troubles a thing of the past. On the 17th, the reporter learned from the Education Bureau of Changsha county that nine primary and secondary schools in Changsha county took the lead in the city’s pilot after-school delay service until 8:30 p.m. to accompany the healthy growth of students, and the school provided a variety of services.\n\nIt is reported that the first nine pilot primary and secondary schools are: Panpan primary school, Zhongnan No. 2 primary school, quantang No. 2 primary school, Tianhua middle school, songyahu middle school, Teli middle school, Xingsha middle school, Baixi middle school and the junior middle school of Xingsha Experimental School of the affiliated middle school. After class delay service courses are mainly conducted in the form of personalized course guidance such as art, sports, science and technology, students’ self-study homework, teacher guidance and Q & A. The extended service time after class can be up to 8:30 p.m. at the latest. Students and parents can choose independently.\n\nFrom the specific practice of the school\n\nSchools in different stages have made different explorations\n\n↓↓↓\n\nIn songyahu middle school, the after-school extended service time is 6:30 to 8:30 in the evening. The school is mainly carried out in the way that students complete their homework independently in the classroom and parents and volunteers accompany in the classroom in turn.\n\nSongyahu middle school\n\nSince the first day of school on February 14, the school has piloted the after-school delay service\n\nTime: 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm\n\nFor ordinary students: it is mainly carried out in the way that students complete their homework independently in the classroom and parents and volunteers accompany in the classroom in turn. In order to answer students’ questions and solve their doubts, the office on each floor of the school has arranged 2 to 3 subject teachers on duty, and has also carried out careful matching in subjects\n\nFor art and sports students: the school provides art and sports training courses\n\nThe teacher of Panpan primary school in Changsha County led the students to practice chorus. Taken by Shu Wen, an all media reporter of Changsha Evening News\n\nPanpan primary school\n\nThe after-school delay service focuses on “enrichment”. The after-school service of the school is divided into two stages\n\nFrom 3:30 to 5:30: basic courses + personality courses (students can choose quality training such as sports, art, labor, science and innovation)\n\nAfter 5:30: if parents have difficulty picking up their children, the school can provide high-quality delay services, which not only provide children with exquisite dinner, but also equip professional teachers in all grades to lead students to read and exercise, and guide their homework. Parents can choose to postpone the end time of after-school service\n\nteacher\n\nReduced work pressure\n\nJiang Jingwen, deputy chief of the education section of Changsha County Education Bureau, introduced that the after-school delay service was piloted in 9 urban primary and secondary schools, mainly to meet the personalized needs of urban parents and students. “In the early stage, we checked the relevant situation. When we learned that some parents had such needs, we referred to some typical good practices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and launched this new measure after investigation and demonstration.”\n\nIn the context of “double reduction”, the needs of students and parents have been met, but to some extent, some teachers will work longer hours and face increased pressure. Considering this problem, Changsha County Education Bureau has also launched humanized measures to reduce pressure for teachers.\n\n“In terms of reducing pressure for teachers, we strictly selected 87 non subject after-school training institutions in four categories: art, sports and science and technology through competitive bidding to enter the white list and provide menu services for students to compare and choose courses for after-school services. After a large number of professionals from these institutions enter the school classroom, they can alleviate the pressure of teachers working pressure. In addition, according to the spirit of relevant provincial and municipal documents, we are currently exploring new measures and ways to alleviate teachers’ work pressure, which will be implemented after demonstration. “\n\nparent\n\nAlleviated educational anxiety\n\nWhat is the response of this new measure? The reporter also conducted a visit and investigation.\n\n“At present, it is still in the pilot stage. Combined with the situation of the previous four days, the response of students and teachers is relatively good. In the eyes of students, doing homework in school helps them concentrate and improve their learning efficiency. Especially after completing all the homework on the day in school, they don’t need to bring their schoolbags home. In addition, teachers also recognize that first, teachers can control students’ homework in time Second, you don’t have to chase the students to do their homework. “ Wang Wen said that some parents do not have time to accompany their children because of their busy work, but when other volunteer parents take turns to accompany them, it undoubtedly solves the problem of family education vacancy for them. According to statistics, at present, 85% of the students in songyahu middle school have voluntarily signed up for this after-school delay service.\n\nZhang Jiacheng, head teacher of class 187 of Panpan primary school, said that the after-school delay service seems to lengthen the teachers’ working hours in school, but it gives teachers more time to guide students face to face. “The purpose of ‘double reduction’ is to let students return to the campus and the essence of education. Therefore, when they learned about this after-school delay service pilot project, the teachers of the school were very active.” It is reported that at present, more than 40 teachers in the school have joined the after-school delay service.\n\nFor parents, especially senior primary school parents and junior middle school parents, this new measure undoubtedly reduces the pressure of family education. “If you have to go on business at ordinary times, ask your parents to take care of your children. Although it solves the problem of no one with your children, it can’t solve the problem of education. First, they can’t control their children playing mobile phones and watching TV at home, and second, they can’t do anything about tutoring and learning. Therefore, the after-school delay service has greatly alleviated our parents’ educational anxiety.” Mr. Wang, the parent, praised him.\n\nWill the after-school delay service be piloted in other schools in Changsha County? Jiang Jingwen said that if a school wants to implement the after-school delay service, it can take the initiative to report to Changsha County Education Bureau, which will gradually push it forward in combination with the actual situation. At the same time, by constantly summing up experience, we can improve the after-school delay service quality and radiate more families in need.", "timestamp": 1649007420, "digest": "1zL7UdyB3SV7FPXSrHhaFYU6EZREJwBPyZolxRPiQx8", "contributor": "0xa2D635a65DFC5717a1281b49762D4A7e1f144B1e"}

After entering 2022, there are still many exposed shoes worth looking forward to, such as the Prada x adidas Forum Series released last week, Or the special edition of the Louis Vuitton and Nike “Air Force 1” by Virgil abloh, which will be released in the form of auction, has attracted the attention of shoe fans all over the world. They will shoulder the important task of helping major brands compete for this year’s sneaker market.\n\nThis time, Hypebeast will lead you to sort out the heavyweight shoes that deserve the most attention this year. In addition to sports brands, it also covers the new attempts of major fashion brands in the field of sports shoes. Although the official sales information has not been announced, shoe fans may wish to prepare in advance to plan and layout the consumption of sports shoes this year.\n\nadidas\n\nadidas x Fear of God\n\nSince Jerry Lorenzo switched to Adidas, shoe fans have been affected by what kind of attempts the two sides will make on sports shoes. Unfortunately, in 2021, we didn’t wait for the birth of the joint brand shoes of the two sides, but only waited for the three joint brand clothes as an “appetizer”. Considering that the R & D and manufacturing of a new pair of shoes usually takes hundreds of days, not to mention the heavy joint name expected by many people, the cooperative shoes of Adidas and fear of God will be carefully polished before they can be seen by the public. Therefore, this series of shoes will be one of the biggest attractions this year.\n\nadidas\n\nadidas YEEZY Foam Runner V2\n\nAs the “best summer shoe” voted by readers last year, I believe Adidas yeezy foam runner will bring more different colors this year, and there have been more spy photos of the latest V2 version. The new version of shoes is similar to animal skulls. In addition to the bone white shoe body, there is a black piece attached to the forefoot and hindfoot of the outsole respectively. Compared with the mellow appearance of the original version, the new generation of shoes seem to be more sharp, and the original oval hollow out has also been transformed into various shapes.\n\nadidas\n\nadidas YEEZY NSTLD Boot\n\nAs the latest member of yeezy family, the design of Adidas yeezy nstld boot is mixed because it is too avant-garde, but this shoe will undoubtedly be one of the main designs of the brand in 2022. Earlier, rapper offset performed a pair of ‘reflective’ reflective versions that have not yet been sold. It can be seen that the barrel shaped shoe body is made of reflective nylon, which not only has certain waterproof performance, but also presents a more eye-catching reflective effect in the dark environment.\n\nadidas\n\nBad Bunny x adidas Forum Low White\n\nThe successful bad Bunny x adidas original forum last year has released three versions: Brown, black and pink, and the popular singer announced the upcoming white version of the forum in a promotional film. It is reported that this will be the last joint version of the two sides. The design still continues the design of shoe body buckle and double-layer tongue, and retains its iconic ‘EI Ojo’ pattern, while the color matching is more versatile and durable. I believe it will be the object of everyone’s rush to buy.\n\nadidas\n\nKerwin Frost x adidas Microbounce T1\n\nFollowing the launch of the oversized version of superstar last year, rapper Kerwin frost earlier aired an unpublished Adidas microbounce T1 on social media. Its biggest feature is the fluffy blue upper design, which echoes with the blue shoelace and microbounce cushioning midsole. The three stripes on the side are compared with silver, and the logo of ‘Kerwin Frost’ appears on the tongue, which once again shows the childlike and funny side of Kerwin’s heart.\n\nBAPE\n\nJJJJound x BAPE STA\n\nAs a ‘co branded master’ in today’s street circles, jjound will join hands with bape to bring a pair of CO branded sta this year. STA, which has frequently launched new works, has once again accumulated a lot of attention. This cooperation with jjound adopts the popular white gray color matching. Other details include silver lace eyelets and shoe heads, replacing the original ‘flat’ shoelaces with round shoelaces, and camouflage shoeboxes printed with golden jjound.\n\nConverse\n\nA-COLD-WALL x Converse Aeon Active CX\n\nSamuel Ross, the manager of a-cold-wall , announced the latest co branded shoes of the brand and converse through social media last year. The two sides chose the new AEON active CX launched by the latter as the blueprint. In addition to the exaggerated CX foam sole and the words ACW  in the details, the color scheme of gray shoe body, red lining and fluorescent green sole, It is reminiscent of the classic nike air yeezy 2. In addition to converse, the cooperative shoes of a-cold-wall  and outdoor brand ROA are also worth looking forward to.\n\nCrocs\n\nSalehe Bemb", "timestamp": 1649007441, "digest": "PLvald5PBKjilzmrq-2Mebd0_mSP3bhnlcJ4gDsAVGQ", "contributor": "0x39fac708A13d8259F826aB5B615E56412f3b560e"}

Walking on the road to find a person who doesn’t wear a down jacket in the north is like playing a fault finding game.\n\nSoon, “canadian goose” and the north were crushed by the wind of fleece coat, and became the standard of a new generation of school uniforms. The streets are full of fleece. It’s hard not to hit your shirt.\n\nSo what will be the standard configuration of school uniforms in the latest winter this year? I dare to predict that it’s a checkerboard sweater. I know everything. In that case, I’ll backhand and place an order for an American Baseball Jacket that won’t go out of style every year to accompany me until 2022.\n\nAll Star Baseball Jacket\n\nIf we say why baseball jackets are especially popular this year, we have to say that half of the credit goes to Blogger kenijima. The vibe style he brought up is simple and clear to wear as a whole, and there are often baseball jackets on his upper body.\n\nThe other half of the credit should be attributed to the upper body goods of the star icon, which has stimulated the design of many brands for baseball jackets.\n\nTravis Scott\n\nCheng fan\n\nLisa\n\nWang Linkai, kid\n\nCheng Xiao\n\nZhang Yanqi\n\nPark Zaifan\n\nOuyang Nana\n\nIt’s so hot that it’s always “saluted”\n\nVarsity Jacket \n\nThere is no lack of some baseball jackets on the market. They are called original designs, but they are actually naked plagiarism. There is no end to plagiarism. Instead of preventing piracy one by one, it’s better to know what the popular “main owner” looks like, and then you can tell whether the Baseball Jacket you added to the shopping cart is an imitation.\n\nLouis Vuitton\n\nInspired by the classic Wizard of Oz in 1939, Virgil abloh designed the LV ss19 Wizard of Oz series, which is a hot part of the series. Kenijima and offset have brought goods, and Travis Scott is also wearing it for documentaries.\n\nThis new LV 21aw Wizard of Oz Baseball Jacket is also a popular item at present and has become a popular player to be honored.\n\nCeline\n\nThe most memorable thing about Celine in the past two years is Lisa’s role as a global brand ambassador and his family’s youth baseball jackets suitable for the rich second generation.

Usually pay more attention to the accounts of some stars who wear the same style as the blogger, and pay attention to some wearing stars who don’t have brand endorsement. Of course, you should wear well.\n\nHere, I’d like to share with you a star who has a secret pursuit of baseball Jackets - giant salamander.

In the new year, what livelihood issues do you pay most attention to and what “wishes” do you make? On February 16, according to the latest public opinion survey results of the Provincial Bureau of statistics, in 2021, the four major areas of people’s livelihood such as social security, public services, environment and education improved significantly. In 2022, four major livelihood issues, including education, medical care, food safety and prices, have attracted much attention. In addition, the concerns from high to low are public services, social security, environment, income distribution, social security, employment, housing and other issues.\n\neducation\n\nNearly 70% of respondents pay attention to teaching quality\n\nThe implementation of the “double reduction” policy has not only reduced the burden of students, but also reduced the economic burden of families and the spiritual burden of parents. At the same time, many parents began to worry: “will it be difficult for children to ensure their academic performance because of ‘burden reduction’?”\n\nUnder the “double reduction”, how to reduce the burden on students and improve the quality of education in the stage of compulsory education has become a matter of concern. The survey shows that nearly 70% of the respondents are concerned about “teaching quality” and “campus food safety”.\n\nIn addition, 59.5% of the respondents hope to further improve the “education equity problem”, and some respondents are more concerned about the “problem of arbitrary school charges”.\n\nThe heavy burden of medical expenses has attracted the most attention\n\n“Seeing a doctor is difficult and expensive.” Ms. Liu, a citizen of Changsha, told reporters that a few days ago she took her 3-year-old son to the hospital to see a doctor. After an examination, she spent 600 or 700 yuan, and then took some medicine at random. This is not the feeling of Ms. Liu alone.\n\nIn this survey, “heavy burden of medical expenses” has become the most concerned and most desirable problem for respondents. Related to it, in the “social security issue”, more than 70% of the respondents expressed their greatest concern about the “medical insurance issue”. Citizen Wang Qiang frankly said, “I hope to increase the reimbursement proportion and expand the reimbursement scope.”\n\nFood safety 77.1% of respondents were concerned about the abuse of additives\n\nFood is the most important thing for the people, and food safety is the first. Recently, the Hunan Provincial Food Safety Commission issued the “four most stringent measures for food safety” notice.\n\nIn recent years, the food safety situation in our province has improved continuously, and the public’s satisfaction with food safety has increased steadily. However, some local and unit responsibilities are not implemented in place, and food safety accidents occur from time to time.\n\nThe exposed food safety incidents have caused a strong social response, and food safety has become a hot and focus topic in the current society.\n\nWhat are you concerned about food safety? Hunan people who participated in the survey gave the answer - five major safety issues such as additive abuse, food quality, supermarket food, genetically modified food and catering and hotel food have attracted much attention, of which 77.1% of the respondents pay attention to “additive abuse”.\n\nphenomenon\n\n“Housing problem” has been at the bottom for two consecutive years\n\nThrough combing, the reporter also found an interesting phenomenon: the residents of our province have always paid low attention to the “housing problem”.\n\nFor example, in the initial survey in 2019, respondents paid more attention to “housing problems” than income and employment. However, by 2020, the respondents’ attention to the “housing problem” has decreased, only higher than that to the “social security problem”. In the 2021 survey, respondents’ attention to “housing issues” ranked last among all livelihood issues.\n\nIn this survey, the respondents’ attention to the “housing problem” has not changed. It is still the existence of “bottom”, and only 44.7% of the respondents pay attention to it. In this regard, some insiders said that this shows that the “housing problem” in our province may no longer be a major problem in the field of people’s livelihood.\n\nAmong 44.7% of the respondents in this survey, 68.5% wanted “stable house prices”, 54.1% paid attention to “housing loan policy”, 52.3% paid attention to “real estate tax”, and 36.5% paid attention to “purchase and sale restriction policy”. Among the respondents who paid attention to the “purchase and sale restriction policy”, 67.7% wanted to “continue to implement the purchase and sale restriction policy” and 32.3% wanted to “lift the purchase and sale restriction policy”.\n\nPrice stability of daily necessities is the most concerned\n\nThe price change of residents’ daily necessities, such as vegetables, affects thousands of households and relates to the national economy and the people’s livelihood. According to the market monitoring data of daily necessities in the seventh week of 2022 (February 7-13) released by the Provincial Department of Commerce, the prices of vegetables, aquatic products, poultry, grain, meat and eggs in the province have decreased since the seventh day of the lunar calendar.\n\nOn the morning of February 16, in a large supermarket in Kaifu District, looking at the vegetables on the shelves, Ms. Ren, a citizen, said happily that the price of the “vegetable basket” rising due to the festival began to fall.\n\nSuch is the case. The survey shows that more than 80% of the respondents want “stable prices, especially the prices of daily necessities”. Secondly, 52.7% of respondents are concerned about “price monopoly of public goods” and 51.8% are concerned about “price fraud of e-commerce products”.\n\nPublic services focus on urban and rural residents\n\n“More than 100 meters out of the parking lot is the outpatient building of Hunan children’s hospital. There is a special parking space for women in the parking lot, which is warm and touching!” On February 16, Zhao Yaxin, a citizen who brought her child to the hospital, parked her car in the newly repaired “new Liuchi lane” parking lot and was full of praise.\n\n“Degree, bed, parking space, toilet space and ladder space” are concerned about the people’s livelihood, and the piles are connected with the hearts of the people. Among the “public service issues”, urban residents are most concerned about “increasing parking spaces” and “ensuring the supply of electricity, water and gas”; Followed by “community entertainment, leisure, sports facilities, venue improvement” and “shopping convenience (including farmers’ market)”.\n\nWhat rural residents most expect is “the improvement of rural medical services” and “the improvement and transformation of rural roads”; Others are “repair of farmland and water conservancy facilities”, “facilitation of rural social security affairs”, “construction of rural cultural and entertainment facilities”, “improvement of sanitary facilities such as rural toilets” and “improvement of electric power, tap water, radio and telecommunications facilities”.\n\n79\\.7% of the respondents concerned about pollution control\n\nEvery winter, haze will come unexpectedly, causing air pollution", "timestamp": 1649007620, "digest": "eLwnfF3bIY71GbWxBOhPYnMbyzTuYDDYLksQO8PgSOk", "contributor": "0x438416ca236B871CFa50f8893C8BcAD736eddeeE"}

{"id": "owJZa-5XJFDDDApzB9kpR1t0Iw1Iuqrv3DBhmtdJLDw", "title": "YIN Finance Joint Liquidity Mining Program with izumi Finance SimplifiedIntroducing Changer, the Integration of Crypto and FX Markets", "body": "The Big Question: WHAT IS LIQUIDITY MINING?Greeting from the Changer team!\n\nChanger is a decentralized forex protocol developed by Chain Partners. It will be released in two versions, CeFi and DeFi, which will be closely linked to each other.\n\nUntil now, the majority of digital asset markets was USD-based stablecoin. However, the current share of USD in the FX market is only 44% (based on BIS statistics). The remaining 56% includes EUR, JPY, CNY, KRW and many more, but the crypto market seems to have eyes for USD only.\n\nChanger is a decentralized forex protocol that enables the issuance and trade of non-USD stablecoin that index more than twenty FX prices. Corporate users that require fast transaction speed and lower transaction fee can use the Changer CeFi version. On the other hand, people who are more familiar with DeFi can use the Changer DeFi version.\n\nChanger offers both versions so that users can get the benefit of CeFi, meaning that it guarantees a high transaction speed and no transaction fee, as well as the benefit of DeFi, which enables access to our service without a complicated sign-up process. The CeFi version beta service has been ongoing since March 24th and the DeFi version will be released for the first time this fall.\n\nWithin Changer, in both the CeFi and DeFi version, there are no real FX transactions taking place. Instead, stablecoin transactions that index FX prices are made. Therefore, we are currently relatively free from existing FX government regulations, but we will actively comply with any changes to regulations on stablecoin transactions.\n\nChanger receives price information from the crypto market and the FX market and creates real time exchange rates between various digital assets. The crypto prices are linked to major exchanges and OTCs. As for the FX process, it is either directly or indirectly connected to major banks and financial institutions.\n\nWhen a user trades stablecoin on Changer CeFi version, Changer holds real foreign currency assets just like a hedge trade in the actual FX market. Just as USDT or USDC have real USD in the bank, when a user purchases eEUR from Changer, Changer CeFi buys and holds the same amount of EUR from the actual FX market. Therefore the Changer CeFi version functions in a way that’s similar to USDT or USDC.\n\nOn the other hand, the Changer DeFi functions like Maker. When the user issues eEUR in exchange for wBTC or ETH, they become the underlying assets. (the real time price feed for wBTC/eEUR or ETH/eEUR is provided by Changer CeFi version, which is already connected to the crypto and FX market therefore becoming an Oracle source to convey price feed to contracts)\n\nIf the collateral value drops, Changer immediately converts the collateral to real EUR (or takes the EUR Long position) to ensure that it reaches 1:1 ratio with the eEUR issued by Changer DeFi. Under such situations, Changer DeFi version can choose to use the CeFi version instead for securing the underlying assets and the liquidation of the collateral.\n\nChanger’s ultimate goal is to become a currency exchange protocol that enables users to exchange ‘Anything to Anything”at the best exchange rate. That is why our brand is called the “Changer”.\n\nExchangeable items will include digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, various foreign currency price indexed stablecoins issued by Changer as well as various asset groups such as gift cards and companies’ mileage, loyalty points, CBDC, tokenized stocks, tokenized art/real estate, and synthetic assets in the future.\n\nInstitutions can have access to all of these digital assets at the best exchange rates and will also be able to easily convert one to another with a single API integration. Retail users will also be able to exchange any digital asset for another at the world’s most competitive price, including the previously inaccessible crypto OTC market price, regardless of the size of the transaction.\n\nChain Partners is one of the most well known blockchain companies in Korea. Led by CEO Charles Pyo, who was an advisor on blockchain and digital currency national strategies at the Presidential Committee on the 4th Industrial Revolution and the National Assembly’s 4th Industrial Revolution Special Committee, it has been leading more than 15 new blockchain related businesses in Korea since its establishment and 13 million dollars worth of VC investment in 2017.\n\nCEO Charles Pyo was a Korean advisor to ETHLend, the predecessor of Aave and currently the world’s top company in the DeFi service area, in 2017, when only a few people in Korea knew about DeFi. Based on its expertise on DeFi, Chain Partners was also the author of the 245-page DeFi report published by the Korean government (Ministry of Science and ICT) in January 2021, the first government in the world to publish such a report.\n\nChain Partners has been working on Changer since 2019 based on four years of experience and knowledge in the blockchain field. Thanks to Chain Partners OTC, Korea’s first over-the-counter digital asset trading desk, released in January 2019, Chain Partners was able to have extensive business relationships and credit lines with global digital asset OTC companies, which is serving as a strong foundation for the Changer.\n\nChanger is fundamentally different from other rushed blockchain projects. From Daybit(Retail Exchange) to CPDA(Institutional OTC trading desk), Coincare(Phone-based trading for HNWIs) , Behind(Non-listed crypto P2P trading platform) and Coinduck(Crypto payment service integrated with the Samsung Blockchain Wallet), Chain Partners has experience in every part of digital asset trading, with Changer being the cherry on top to showcase our knowledge on digital asset market’s fundamental problem and solution.\n\nCFX token, the first digital asset issued by Chain Partners in four years, will be used as the governance token in Changer DeFi version, while in the CeFi version, it will be used as coupons for discounts on transaction fees like BNB in Binance.com.\n\nA strategic round worth $1m held in March 2021 was sold out early, and now, a public pre-sale worth $8m will take place from May 10th 2021 to May 30th. Starting with Batch 1, which will take place from May 10th to 12th, for every 48 hours, a new Batch will open until Batch 10 ends the pre-sale, which is planned to end on the 30th. If there is any token left from any batch, all will undergo a token burn.\n\nAs for the Changer project’s detailed research background, future vision and what we are currently working on, please check the white paper that was pre-released on last November.\n\nRegarding the function of the token, the details for the token sale, and instructions on how to participate in the sale, please check the CFX Token website.\n\nThe beta version of Changer CeFi, which was launched in March, is available on https://changer.io. (At the moment, only a limited number of tokens and trading pairs are possible, but more will be added soon.)\n\nPlease show a lot of interest and support for the Changer project. There might be new obstacles in the process of making CeFi and DeFi products, leading us to make certain unavoidable changes, or the released product might not be perfect in the beginning.\n\nHowever, since we have already been doing business in this field for four years, we believe that as long as we are consistent, we can improve our products. Changer is not a hastily planned project that we came up with just because we wanted to issue a new token or because DeFi is popular these days. It is a carefully crafted project that we have been working on for two years.\n\nChanger team will show our best efforts as we always have to realize Changer’s dream, which is to collect globally fragmented quotes on all kinds of digital assets and foreign currency, then processing and providing the information to our users and passing it on so that it can be utilized in both CeFi and DeFi.\n\nPlease continue to show us support and interest in our project. For those of you who would like to become a part of our community, please join our official Telegram channel!\n\nThank you,\n\nFrom the Changer team\n\n\\[Disclaimer\\] CFX Token is a digital asset and not a security, meaning that it does not give users any right over the Changer service, Chain Partners and its related businesses, bonds, and any other.

This injection of liquidity by investors allows them to “mine governance tokens” that are delivered to those who participate in the system. Liquidity mining is a process in which crypto holders lend assets to a decentralized exchange in return for rewards. These rewards commonly stem from trading fees that are accrued from traders swapping tokens. Liquidity mining is simply a passive income method that helps crypto holders’ profit by utilizing their existing assets, rather than leaving them inactive in cold storage\n\nWHY LIQUIDITY MINING?\n\nLiquidity mining is important because a DEX needs liquidity to enable the trades between different token pairs and this incentive strategy enables users to contribute liquidity to facilitate those trades. This means that the majority of liquidity pools are between trading pairs where users can deposit the two different cryptocurrencies depending on the pool.\n\nImagine when several token swaps take place on a DEX then liquidity mining can turn into a great passive income opportunity for many.\n\nIn Liquidity mining you provide liquidity however you’ll then receive an LP token that needs to be staked in order to earn rewards reserved for the mining program. These liquidity mining rewards come directly from the project’s liquidity provision incentives.\n\nAlthough liquidity mining is a means of earning a passive income, it has even more benefits. This section will discuss some relevant benefits of liquidity mining to both providers and decentralized exchanges. Without further ado, let’s talk about the benefits of providing liquidity to DEX.\n\nYIN Finance is set to launch the new joint liquidity mining incentive program with Izumi finance, offering liquidity providers to target their LP tokens to a certain price point to maximize their reward earning potential.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the strategic partnership between YIN Finance and Izumi Finance; their aim is to bring both communities closer by implementing double reward mechanisms which would benefit all token holders, provide a unique way to explore the innovative solutions for liquidity management and growing the ever changing landscape of DEFI 2.0\n\nDuration — 6 months (from 5th January ,2022)\n\nAvailable Trading Pairs\n\nYIN/ETH — You will earn YIN+iZi: Izumi will give 4 iZi/block over a 30-day period to enable the YIN/ETH one-side pair on the izumi LiquidBox. The pool will receive 720,000 iZi in total, which will last for one month. Meanwhile, YIN will provide 0.5 YIN each block to support YIN/ETH for at least one month, therefore the first month’s token budget is 90,000 YIN..\n\nUSDC/WETH — You will earn YIN: (After unsubscribing, you can earn an extra USDC+WETH incentive). On the platform, izumi does not yet support the USDC/ETH combination.\n\nUSDC/USDT — You will earn USDC + USDT + YIN + iZi izumi has opened a USDC/USDT pool, with a current liquidity mining reward of 15 iZi per block.\n\nYIN (single-sided lock staking) — You will earn YIN periodically: Currently, izumi does not support single token staking.\n\nHow to Get YIN token\n\nSTEP BY STEP GUIDE ON HOW TO PARTICIPATE\n\nHow to Provide Liquidity on YIN Finance Dapp\n\nSTEP1 — Go to YIN Finance’s APP: https://app.yin.finance/yin, then connect to your Ethereum wallet.\n\nSTEP2 — Click the ‘Stake’ button and enter the amount you want to add in the pop-up window.\n\nSTEP3 — Click ‘Approve YIN’ to enable the mining contract to use YIN tokens, then confirm within your wallet.\n\nSTEP4 — .

The national per capita earns 1.37 million. Here comes the list of heavy positions", "body": "Recently, the Norwegian government global pension fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, released its 2021 annual report, which once again showed the market its strong ability to make money from investment.\n\nDue to the sharp rise of global stock markets, the fund achieved a return on investment of 14.5% in 2021, and its investment income reached 1.58 trillion kronor (about 1.02 trillion yuan), the second most profitable year in history.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, the size of the fund had reached 12.34 trillion kroner (about 8.78 trillion yuan), continuing to hit a record high. Norway currently has a population of about 5.35 million, which is equivalent to the value of assets owned by each Norwegian citizen of about 1.65 million yuan. The total value of the fund is three times the size of Norway’s economy and eight times the country’s government spending in 2022.\n\nAccording to the rough estimate of the Chinese reporter of the securities firm, the fund earned about 190000 yuan per citizen last year. Over the past 10 years, the fund has only lost money in 2018 and made profits in the other nine years. It has earned a total of 7.35 trillion kroner (about 4.75 trillion yuan), earning about 1.37 million yuan for each Norwegian. Such a strong investment earning ability is enviable.\n\nSo, how does the Norwegian government’s global pension fund allocate global assets? Which companies are heavily invested in? How about investing in China? Let’s analyze it carefully.\n\nIn the past 10 years and 9 years, the whole people have made 1.37 million per capita\n\nOn March 3, the Norwegian government’s Global Pension Fund released its annual report for 2021. The annual investment income reached 1.58 trillion kronor (about 1.02 trillion yuan), second only to 1.69 trillion kronor in 2019, making the second highest return in history.\n\nIn 2021, the fund achieved a return on investment of 14.5%, 0.74 percentage points higher than the benchmark index return.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, the size of the fund has reached 12.34 trillion kroner (about 8.78 trillion yuan). Norway currently has a population of about 5.35 million, that is, the value of each Norwegian citizen is about 1.65 million yuan.\n\nIt is understood that the Norwegian government’s global pension fund was founded after the discovery of the world’s largest offshore oil field in Norway, so that future generations can benefit from oil wealth. The fund invests in global areas outside Norway, mainly equity assets among the four categories of assets.\n\nBy the end of 2021, the allocation proportion of the fund is: 72% of stocks, 25.4% of fixed income, 2.5% of unlisted real estate and 0.1% of renewable energy infrastructure. Among them, heavily held stocks contributed 20.8% of the income last year, and the proportion of stock positions was further increased to 72%. Equity investments include the shares of more than 9000 companies around the world.\n\nIn addition, the fund’s return on fixed income investment was - 1.9%, while the return on unlisted real estate investment was 13.6%, and the return on unlisted renewable energy infrastructure was 4.2%.\n\n“The good performance is mainly due to the strong rise of the stock market throughout the year. All industries have good returns, but investment in technology and finance has performed particularly well. The return on investment in technology is as high as 30.2%.” Nicolai tangen, CEO of Norwegian bank investment management, said.\n\nAfter a difficult year of the epidemic in 2020, real estate performed strongly in 2021. “The real estate industry has recovered well, especially the listed real estate companies, with a return of 26.8%.” Tangen said.\n\nAccording to a rough estimate by a Chinese reporter from a securities firm, the fund earned 190000 yuan per citizen last year. In the past 10 years, the fund only lost money in 2018 and made profits in the other nine years. Its fund scale has increased from 3.8 trillion kroner in 2012 to 12.34 trillion kroner today, making a total of 7.35 trillion kroner (about 4.75 trillion yuan), earning about 1.37 million yuan for every Norwegian. Such a strong investment earning ability is enviable.\n\nHeavy positions in technology stocks: apple, Microsoft and Google ranked in the top three, while Ali fell out of the top 20\n\nAccording to the 2021 annual report of the Norwegian government’s global pension fund, the top five markets for fund investment are the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France and Switzerland, with positions of 44.7%, 7.3%, 7.1%, 4.9% and 4.6% respectively.\n\nAmong them, China ranked eighth, with the proportion of positions falling to 3.8%, and the market value of positions was 335 billion kroner (about 216.6 billion yuan). At the end of 2020, the fund invested 5.3% in China, with a market value of 419.1 billion kroner (about 270.9 billion yuan), ranking fourth in the world.\n\nIn terms of the return on investment in the global market last year, the United States contributed 30.5%, the UK contributed 20.5%, Japan contributed 4.6%, and France and Germany contributed 24.9% and 7.3% respectively. The Chinese market performed poorly, contributing - 16.7% of revenue and dragging down the overall performance.\n\nFrom the perspective of the fund’s heavy stock allocation, the top five heavy stocks are apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nestle. Among them, apple is the largest heavyweight stock, with a stock market value of about 217 billion kroner, about 140 billion yuan; The market value of Google’s position also reached 210.5 billion kroner.\n\nAmong the top 20 heavyweight stocks, there are two Chinese companies (including Taiwan), TSMC and Tencent, ranking 7th and 14th respectively. The market value of positions is 72.2 billion kroner (about 46.6 billion yuan) and 44.3 billion kroner (about 28.6 billion yuan) respectively.\n\nIt is worth noting that last year, Alibaba ranked the 10th largest heavy position stock, with a market value of 55.56 billion kroner (about 35.9 billion yuan), but it disappeared from the list of the top 20 this year. Obviously, Alibaba’s sharp decline last year has sharply reduced the market value of its positions.\n\nIn 2022, Russia stepped on thunder, and the fund fell by 6.1% during the year\n\nAlthough the Norwegian government’s global pension fund made a lot of money in 2021, it recently stepped on Russia.\n\nDue to the continuous escalation of the situation in Russia and Ukraine, the Norwegian government asked the fund to freeze and divest Russian assets and to be in charge of the fund", "timestamp": 1649007892, "digest": "hnu_FO2ydHJMhGwEvOvHz8O4pC6QI4ek3nFw3mHOSW4", "contributor": "0x4611655dFDaBA2ec78a151227d24F279AD838e9e"}

At the moment of touching, 2-year-old Mingming (a pseudonym) was hit by an electric current, and his small body fell to the ground. Mingming was sent to Hunan children’s Hospital for rescue. Fortunately, there was no damage to the brain and body organs. What’s distressing is that the affected parts of the hand and head need skin grafting, and the treatment time is long.\n\nOn February 17, the reporter saw in the orthopaedic ward of Hunan children’s hospital that Mingming’s left face was wrapped with gauze, and his left index finger and middle finger were charred and rubbed with thick burn ointment. Mingming was in pain and cried from time to time. His parents sat aside and coaxed and comforted in a low voice.\n\nMingming is from Changsha County. At the age of 2, his favorite toy is an electric car at home. It is this electric car that makes Mingming live in the hospital.\n\nOn the evening of February 14, Grandpa charged Mingming’s car as usual. At 7 a.m. on the 15th, Mingming, who had just got up, walked to the car and was ready to play. Unexpectedly, as soon as he touched the car charging line, he was hit by the current. After a loud cry, he fell to the ground. The panicked family hurried forward to move the car away, and was stunned by the electricity and cried loudly. Subsequently, the family immediately sent the child to Hunan children’s Hospital for treatment.\n\n“The child had injuries on his head and hands. We were scared to death.” Recalling the scene at that time, Mingming’s mother is still in shock.\n\n“If the burn reaches three or four degrees, it belongs to deep burn.” Zeng Lingrong, an orthopaedic surgeon at Hunan children’s Hospital, said that Mingming’s burn is serious. At present, the affected area needs to be treated. After the wound scabs, the scabs can be removed for skin grafting. “Without such treatment, children’s fingers will not be able to straighten and their functions will be affected in the future.” Zeng Lingrong said that the whole treatment process will be relatively long and requires the cooperation of multiple departments.\n\n“In recent years, children have been injured by electricity frequently.” Zeng Lingrong said. Floor sweepers, hanging ironing machines and children’s rechargeable toys have brought certain potential safety hazards to children with the hot sale of small electrical appliances in recent years. Hunan children’s Hospital frequently receives such accidental injury patients, showing an obvious trend of increasing.\n\nZeng Lingrong reminded that if the child suffers from electric injury, whether there is trauma or not, first remove the child from the dangerous position, and then immediately contact 120 emergency center to let medical staff check whether the child has brain injury, heart injury and other conditions. In addition, parents should remind their children to stay away from socket holes and charging devices to avoid dangerous situations.", "timestamp": 1649008081, "digest": "6gjzsSdCDmvN54zg2q_FG12XBA73f9Xqg36amkQPTGo", "contributor": "0xBD3cFA447Cf473078d9c00258C5ACdB456ea453f"}

It has always been an issue of great concern to the society. Recently, the Hunan Provincial Department of civil affairs and other 11 departments jointly issued the measures for the identification and assistance of low-income families in Hunan Province (hereinafter referred to as the measures), further clarifying the conditions and procedures for the identification and assistance of low-income families.\n\nThere are three categories of low-income families\n\nThe measures require that the identification and assistance of low-income families should follow the following principles: territorial management and hierarchical responsibility; Dynamic management and accurate identification; Optimize service and make it convenient and efficient; Open, fair and just.\n\nThe measures define the scope of low-income families. Low income families include: families with minimum living security, families with extremely poor people and marginal families with minimum living security. The family members of low-income families are the low-income population.\n\nAmong them, the minimum living security families are determined according to the relevant provisions of the notice of Hunan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs on printing and distributing the measures for the examination and confirmation of minimum living security in Hunan Province, and the families of people living in extreme poverty are determined according to the relevant provisions of the notice of Hunan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs on printing and distributing the measures for the identification of people living in extreme poverty in Hunan Province.\n\nMarginal families with minimum living security generally refer to families that do not meet the conditions of minimum living security and assistance and support for people in special poverty, the per capita income of family members living together is less than 1.5 times of the local minimum living security standard, and the family property status meets the relevant local regulations. According to the provincial Minimum Living Security Guidance standard, the per capita income of marginal families with minimum living security in 2021 is based on 825 yuan / month in urban areas and 6500 yuan / year in rural areas; In areas where the minimum living security standard is higher than the provincial Minimum Living Security Guidance standard, the benchmark shall be determined according to 1.5 times of the local minimum living security standard; The per capita income of marginal families with minimum living security shall be lower than the locally determined baseline. The per capita income baseline of marginal families with minimum living security shall be dynamically adjusted according to the minimum living security standard.\n\nWhen accounting and evaluating the economic status of the minimum living security families and marginal families, the families with serious difficulties in basic life caused by the sharp increase of rigid expenditure or the sharp reduction of income due to causes, disasters and accidents are regarded as expenditure type families.\n\nIdentification conditions and procedures of marginal families with minimum living security\n\nAccording to the “measures”, the minimum family security fringe family should be family based, and a family member who is a family member should be appointed by the applicant family as the applicant to submit written application to the Township People’s Government (Subdistrict Office) where the registered residence is located. Where online application acceptance is implemented, applications can be submitted through the Internet as required.\n\nIf family members living together have difficulties in applying, their legal guardian shall apply on their behalf; If it is impossible to appoint a guardian, it may entrust the village (residents) committee or other person to file an application on its behalf. Where an application for entrustment is made, the corresponding entrustment procedures shall be handled.\n\nIf the Township People’s Government (sub district office) and the village (neighborhood) people’s Committee find that the families with difficulties may meet the conditions in their work, but fail to apply for the recognition of the marginal families with minimum living security, they shall take the initiative to inform them of the recognition of the marginal families with minimum living security and the policies of assistance and assistance.\n\nWhere a registered residence registered in common with a permanent residence is not in the same area, the family member who is in accordance with the registered residence of one of the domicile places shall apply to the registered residence of the household where he lives. If a family member living together does not agree with the registered residence, he may apply to any registered residence.\n\nAt the same time, the Measures specify that family members who apply to identify marginal families with minimum living security should fulfill these obligations: submit residence booklets, ID cards and relevant materials to prove their income and property status, and disabled persons should provide disability cards of the people’s Republic of China Patients with major diseases shall provide disease diagnosis certificates issued by hospitals at or above the county level; Promise that the information provided is true and complete; Perform the relevant procedures of authorizing to check the economic status of their families; Actively cooperate in the investigation of family economic status.\n\nAccording to the measures, after the application is submitted, it must go through the processes of material review, family economic status information verification and investigation, preliminary review, publicity, identification and so on. The identification of marginal families with minimum living security shall be completed within 25 working days from the date of acceptance; Under special circumstances, it can be extended to 40 working days.\n\nWe will strengthen assistance to low-income families\n\nThe measures require that basic living assistance for low-income families be strengthened. The assistance and assistance to families with minimum living security and families of people living in extreme poverty shall be implemented in accordance with existing laws, regulations and relevant policies. For persons with special difficulties such as class I and class II severe disabled persons, class III intellectual disabled persons, class III mental disabled persons and seriously ill patients in marginal families with minimum living security, upon individual application, they can be included in the minimum living security with reference to “single household”. The minimum living security fund shall be determined by the Civil Affairs Department of the people’s government at the county level in accordance with the appropriate proportion of the local minimum living security standard. Temporary assistance shall be given to low-income families who have temporary serious difficulties in their basic life due to accidents such as fire and traffic accidents, sudden major diseases of family members, or sudden increase in necessary living expenses beyond the family’s affordability.\n\nAmong the poverty-stricken people who originally filed and registered cards, those who were included in the scope of minimum living security with reference to the “single household” and those who were identified as marginal families with minimum living security shall be implemented in accordance with the “single household” policy of minimum living security; Those who do not belong to marginal families with minimum living security shall withdraw according to regulations after the end of the gradual withdrawal period of assistance.\n\nWe will strengthen special social assistance for low-income families. All relevant departments shall formulate differentiated assistance policies for the minimum living security objects, the extremely poor and the marginal family members of the minimum living security in low-income families, and timely give corresponding special assistance such as medical assistance, education assistance, housing assistance, employment assistance and disaster relief according to the types of difficulties.\n\nWe will strengthen other assistance to low-income families. Where conditions permit, low-income people who meet the conditions shall be given assistance such as reduction or exemption of basic funeral service fees; For eligible low-income families, water and electricity fee reduction (subsidy), gas fee reduction (subsidy), cable viewing fee reduction (subsidy) and other assistance shall be given. The specific amount of reduction (subsidy) shall be implemented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the development and reform commissions at all levels. have", "timestamp": 1649007851, "digest": "yc0mujHnVf8rxLYY4LIkJzOLmESjVc5GSz1g-gb99m4", "contributor": "0xc121A978eC6a2400AF7E0F388B3E7e05Be3c0AC1"}

{"id": "YuB_9V-zwHhNzOydwNap4opvt_Uw3JdXY1mK4lvpgG4", "title": "Guan Tao: four highlights of active fiscal policy this year", "body": "Opinion leader Guan Tao (global chief economist of BOC securities)\n\nSince the central economic work conference at the end of last year proposed to stabilize the macro-economic market, advance supporting policies and prudently introduce contractive policies, the central bank’s monetary policy has successively made great moves to reduce reserve requirements and interest rates, and the fiscal policy usually can be seen only after the budget is considered and approved by the two sessions of the National People’s Congress. Therefore, the specific arrangement of active fiscal policy in the government work report is of great concern. Among them, the following four highlights deserve attention.\n\nFirst, the reduction of the deficit rate will not reduce the intensity of fiscal expenditure. The government work report made it clear that the deficit ratio is planned to be about 2.8% this year, down from 3.1% last year and 3.7% in 2020. This is conducive to enhancing fiscal sustainability, which reflects that macro policies adapt to the needs of cross cyclical regulation. We should not only maintain the necessary support for economic recovery, but also consider reserving policy space for coping with difficulties and challenges this year.\n\nAlthough the fiscal deficit ratio is 0.4 percentage points lower than last year’s budget and the capital scale is reduced by 200 billion yuan, through cross-year adjustment, such as turning over the balance profits of recent years by specific state-owned financial institutions and franchised institutions according to law, transferring into the budget stability adjustment fund, and the continuous growth of fiscal revenue, the expenditure scale is expected to expand by more than 2 trillion yuan over last year, This is equivalent to increasing the deficit ratio by 1 percentage point. In fact, the available deficit ratio this year has reached about 3.8%. The intensity of fiscal expenditure is guaranteed, and the key is how to use it effectively. The government work report also pointed out that the new financial resources should be sunk at the grass-roots level, mainly used to implement the policies of helping enterprises to bail out, stabilizing employment and ensuring people’s livelihood, promoting consumption and expanding demand.\n\nThe second is to launch a new combination of tax support policies of “tax reduction + tax rebate”. On the basis of successive tax cuts and fee reductions in the previous two years, we will adhere to the combination of phased measures and institutional arrangements this year, and carry out tax cuts and tax rebates at the same time. It is estimated that the annual tax rebate and tax reduction is about 2.5 trillion yuan, of which the tax rebate is about 1.5 trillion yuan, and all the tax rebate funds go directly to enterprises. This will exceed the scale of tax and fee reduction of about 1.1 trillion yuan last year and be close to the scale of tax and fee reduction of 2.5 trillion yuan in 2020.\n\nAccording to the government work report, large-scale tax rebates will be implemented for the retention tax this year. First, priority will be given to small and micro enterprises. The stock retention tax of small and micro enterprises will be refunded at one time before the end of June, and the incremental retention tax will be refunded in full. The second is to focus on supporting the manufacturing industry and comprehensively solve the problem of tax rebate in manufacturing, scientific research and technical services, ecological environmental protection, electric power and gas, transportation and other industries. The retention, deduction and refund of value-added tax has been significantly increased, which helps to provide cash flow support for enterprises and effectively boost market confidence. Moreover, compared with lifelong accountability after investment with financial funds, tax rebate basically has no tail, which helps to improve the efficiency of active fiscal policy.\n\nThird, there is still room for making good use of government funds to drive effective investment. This year, the central budget allocated 640 billion yuan of investment, higher than the levels of 600 billion yuan and 610 billion yuan respectively in the past two years; It is planned to arrange 3.65 trillion yuan of special bonds for local governments, which is the same as last year’s quota, but with the remaining funds of last year, the actual amount of funds available is more. We should give full play to the leading role of local government and private investment, and give full play to the rational use of special policies to support major projects.\n\nFourth, increase expenditures at the central level. This year, the expenditure at the central level will increase by 3.9% (negative growth in the past two years), of which the expenditure of central departments will continue to increase negatively. Central to local transfer payments increased by about 1.5 trillion yuan, with a scale of nearly 9.8 trillion yuan, an increase of 18%, the largest increase in many years. The central government will bring more funds into the direct scope, and the provincial finance should also increase its support to cities and counties. This will help further reduce the burden on local governments and mobilize the enthusiasm of governments at all levels to stabilize growth and benefit people’s livelihood.\n\nThis article was published in the first financial daily", "timestamp": 1649008071, "digest": "guFUFBrTqoEEwLgdEYxTnSYtHHlbWDUbImKB7DrxJNg", "contributor": "0xdf8E65242B0B13ea8302B38654F39766fCC773e5"}

The Spring Festival transportation lasted 40 days. Hengyang public security and traffic police paid close attention to the organization and deployment, road control In terms of accident prevention, publicity services and other work, the city has not had a long growth time, a large area of traffic congestion, and the road traffic safety situation has always been controllable.\n\nOn February 27, the Hunan Provincial Public Security Department heard good news that Hengyang traffic police won the first place in road traffic security during the 2022 Spring Festival transportation in the province.\n\nHu Zhiwen, vice mayor of Hengyang City and director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, led the traffic police to command and dispatch on site.\n\nOn the eve of the Spring Festival transportation, the traffic police detachment of Hengyang Public Security Bureau held a deployment meeting on the traffic safety management of the Spring Festival transportation in advance and carefully formulated the work plan for road traffic security of the Spring Festival transportation in 2022. The leader on duty of the detachment and the person in charge of the Department on duty sit in the traffic command center every day, command and dispatch the road police force in real time, and spare no effort to promote the implementation of work measures. Adhere to the working mechanism of “one dispatch per day”, and the leader on duty will preside over the video dispatching meeting of the city’s public security and traffic police system every day to report the work situation, prompt security risks and deploy specific measures.\n\nIn rainy and snowy weather, the traffic police stick to the road.\n\nIn order to strictly control the road surface, Hengyang public security traffic police detachment dispatched more than 20 capable police to form a special action commando to support the road front line, focusing on strengthening the police support and patrol control of class I risk counties and cities, key national and provincial trunk roads under the jurisdiction, and sections passing through villages and towns. 2779 traffic control stations and persuasion stations were launched, 13449 persuasions were launched, and a total of 1298000 traffic violations were dissuaded. The city’s public security and traffic police worked closely with relevant departments such as transportation, emergency management and meteorology to go all out to prevent ice and snow, maintain order and ensure safety. A total of 5 tons of industrial salt and snow melting agent were sprinkled, and more than 20 short-term traffic congestion points were opened up. They successfully responded to low-temperature rain, snow, freezing weather and heavy fog.\n\nThe traffic police went deep into key sections to carry out special rectification.\n\nAt the same time, the traffic police department focused on large passenger stations and key transportation enterprises, focused on the key drivers of “two passengers, one danger, one goods and one school” and key personnel involved in drugs, mental diseases and traffic accidents, strictly implemented the “three ones” measures, and timely eliminated 47 overdue license renewal, 131 overdue inspection 2 key vehicle drivers who did not learn full marks and other potential safety hazards. All localities focused on the “two battlefields” in cities and rural areas, comprehensively launched 3988 temporary checkpoints (including spring festival transportation checkpoints), solidly promoted special rectification actions such as “two violations” in rural areas, weekend night inspection, drunk driving and so on, and effectively purified the traffic order on the road.\n\nThe traffic police went deep into key sections to carry out special rectification.\n\nIn terms of publicity services, Hengyang public security traffic police made full use of “stations, newspapers, networks, terminals and screens” to carry out traffic safety publicity during the Spring Festival transportation. During the Spring Festival transportation, more than 12000 traffic safety publicity information were released through television, radio, Internet, wechat microblog and other media.

{"id": "LeXyF99qQ7IVhd0uLctz6szhf5s6ESJKIYpHik_4dro", "title": "Lin Caiyi: what will the rise in oil prices bring us?", "body": "Article / opinion leader columnist Lin Caiyi\n\nCore view\n\nAt present, the crude oil inventory in the market is low, and the gap between supply and demand drives the crude oil price stronger. In the short term, there is great uncertainty about the release of idle capacity. In the long term, the insufficient investment of capital in traditional crude oil will affect the future increment of oil and gas supply. Therefore, when the demand prospect is relatively stable, the probability of high oil price shock in the future is high.\n\nAs energy commodities are a key component in the inflation measurement (CPI basket), high oil prices will inevitably push up global inflation.\n\nAs long as political factors such as sanctions are not involved, the future income growth of relevant oil and gas resource enterprises is expected to be stable and have investment value.\n\n1、 The international supply and demand of crude oil is in a tight balance on the whole\n\n 1. Global crude oil inventories are declining\n 2. From the perspective of global crude oil supply and demand structure, the market concentration on the supply side is relatively high. The crude oil output of the Middle East, North America and the Commonwealth of Independent States (Russia) accounts for 73% of the global total, including 31% in the Middle East, 27% in North America and 15% in the Commonwealth of Independent States. The market concentration on the demand side is relatively low, with 38% in the Asia Pacific region, 24% in North America and 15% in Europe. In addition to North America, the demand for crude oil in most other regions depends on imports. The Middle East, Russia and other regions are the world’s major crude oil export markets, while the Asia Pacific and Europe are the world’s major import markets.\n 3. According to the data of the past two years, the crude oil inventory of OECD countries has been in a state of rapid decline. At present, the inventory level is lower than that in 2014, when the shale oil production increased significantly.\n 4. 2. The possibility of long-term idle capacity growth is limited\n 5. According to the data, since 2021, due to frequent supply cuts in Libya and Nigeria and the continuous decline in Angola’s production, OPEC countries (accounting for about 25% of global production) have failed to increase crude oil production as expected (Figure 3).\n 6. As the world’s largest oil producer, the output change of the United States in recent years shows that its production increase is not as strong as expected, especially the recent accelerated rise in the number of drilling rigs has not brought about a corresponding increase in production (Fig. 4).\n 7. In addition, Russia’s output growth is also less than expected. In January 2022, Russia’s crude oil and condensate production was 11 million barrels, just flat with the five-year average. Since February, the situation in Russia and Ukraine has further exacerbated the contraction of crude oil production and exports.\n 8. To sum up, in the long run, the space for new international crude oil supply is limited. However, in the short term, both the United States, OPEC and Russia have certain idle capacity that can be released quickly, especially OPEC. At present, the idle capacity of OPEC is about 5 million barrels per day, most of which come from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iran, of which Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have about 3 million barrels per day of idle capacity \\[1\\].\n 9. In addition, Iran has a potential export demand of 1.3 million barrels per day. As long as the nuclear agreement negotiation is successful, this part of the production capacity frozen due to sanctions can be released.\n10. 3. The demand for crude oil increases gradually with the economic recovery after the epidemic\n11. From a medium and long-term perspective, there are many factors affecting crude oil demand. However, an important indicator that directly reflects the balance of supply and demand in the short term is the price difference of oil cracking \\[2\\]. The expansion of the price difference of oil refining reflects the strong market demand for refined products, which will drive the start-up of refineries and the demand for crude oil.\n12. The data show that since 2022, the price difference of gasoline cracking in the United States and diesel cracking in Europe have been at a high level. Even in the process of oil price rising, the price difference of refined oil cracking is still rising. It can be seen that the rise of refined oil is more violent than that of crude oil, reflecting the strong market demand for refined oil and refining products. Therefore, from the perspective of terminal demand, high oil prices can be smoothly transmitted downward and sustainable in the short term.\n13. At the same time, due to the further elimination of the impact of the epidemic and the continuous recovery of the global economy, the demand for crude oil is expected to return to the pre epidemic level in 2022, that is, the consumption of 100 million barrels per day (Figure 9).\n14. In recent years, with the increasing pressure of low-carbon and green transformation, the change of energy structure has become a global consensus. Most energy enterprises (including oil companies) are shrinking their expenditure on traditional oil and gas investment in the future (Figure 10). Therefore, despite the strong demand growth, in view of the insufficient investment in the past few years and the expectation of future energy conversion, Crude oil supply will not increase significantly on the whole.\n15. In addition, the substitution of green energy for traditional energy is also an important factor affecting the relationship between crude oil supply and demand. The data show that in the past decade, although the capital investment of renewable energy has been increasing, the annual incremental energy supply can only cover up to 3 / 10 of the energy growth demand (the global total energy demand increment is 10 EJO / year, which can only increase 3 EJO / year even if measured by 10% of the capital incremental investment of renewable energy in 21 years). It can be seen that the growth of renewable energy alone is difficult to meet the growth demand of energy consumption. Therefore, the demand for traditional energy still shows a growth trend in the short term.\n16. Considering the above factors, it can be inferred that the global crude oil supply will be in a tight balance in the next two or three years.\n17. 2、 Will rising oil prices push up inflation?\n18. According to the latest U.S. CPI structure released by the U.S. Department of labor, the weight of energy price in CPI composition is 7.35%. Considering the indirect impact of other projects (such as the cost of crude oil in food production, and the cost of commodity production in core CPI is affected by energy price), the impact of actual energy price fluctuations on CPI will be greater.\n19. Empirical data show that over the past seven years, the correlation between oil prices and CPI year-on-year changes is as high as 80%. It can be seen that the continuous rise of oil prices will inevitably push up the global inflation level to a certain extent. Moreover, the price rise caused by the relationship between supply and demand cannot be solved directly through monetary policy.\n20. 3、 Can oil and gas enterprises still invest?\n21. According to the above analysis, the overall tight balance between international crude oil supply and demand will make the crude oil price remain high and volatile for some time in the future. Even if monetary policy is tightened, it will not have much impact on the high oil price caused by supply and demand. At the same time, empirical data also show that oil and gas resource enterprises do make a lot of profits in the rise of oil prices. Taking chevron as an example, when Brent oil price is $60 / barrel, its total shareholder dividends are $75 billion to $80 billion, and the shareholder return is about 7%\n22.

On the whole, the market style is better than the “steady growth” in the early stage, and it is possible to gradually transition to a relatively balanced stage.\n\nAt present, we pay attention to three directions: 1) potential support areas for policy development, including infrastructure, real estate, stable demand related industrial chains (building materials, construction, household appliances, home furnishings, etc.), brokerage finance, etc;\n\n2) For the middle and lower reaches consumption that has been adjusted in 2021, the valuation is not high and the medium and long-term prospects are still clear, choose stocks from the bottom up, including household appliances, light industry and household appliances, automobiles and parts, the Internet, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, medicine, etc;\n\n3) Manufacturing growth sectors, including new energy vehicles, new energy and technology hardware semiconductors, have released risks, and may enter the bargain hunting stage in the future.\n\nMarket review: the index rose first and then declined, and the transaction remained high\n\nAt the beginning of this week, the market rebounded under the background of approaching the two sessions and further warming of stable growth expectation; However, with the rise of geopolitical risks caused by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the accelerated rise of crude oil and other commodity prices, and the fluctuation of European and American markets, the index fell in the second half of this week, and the Shanghai Composite Index fell slightly by 0.1% weekly, maintaining relative toughness compared with the global market. The average daily turnover of a shares remained at a relatively high level of about trillion yuan, with a net inflow of 4.3 billion yuan this week. In terms of style, the growth style performed poorly this week. The gem index and the Kechuang 50 index fell 3.8% and 3.1% respectively. The Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 index with white horse blue chip recorded a weekly decline of 1.7%. In terms of industry, the coal sector continued to perform strongly this week, leading the market; The agricultural sector also performed well; Real estate and construction related to steady growth have relative performance; The performance of automobile, electronics and other sectors was poor.\n\nMarket outlook: steady growth direction deployed by the two sessions\n\nRecently, under the influence of comprehensive factors such as the intensification of external conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the rise in commodity prices, the tightening of US monetary policy, the pressure on domestic growth is still large but the expectation of stable growth policy is rising, the A-share market as a whole shows a volatile trend and a tangled style, but it shows relatively toughness compared with the stock markets in Europe, America, Hong Kong and other emerging markets in the same period. Looking forward to the future, we believe that we still need to pay close attention to the impact of the external environment such as the situation in Russia and Ukraine on the domestic market. The rise of regional risks may make China’s “steady growth” face a more complex situation and make China’s steady growth more urgent.

On the whole, the market style is better than the “steady growth” in the early stage, and it is possible to gradually transition to a relatively balanced stage. Recent progress in the following aspects should be noted:\n\n1) The two sessions were held, and the government work report set the tone of “steady growth” of the economy. On March 4 and March 5, the fifth session of the 13th CPPCC National Committee and the fifth session of the 13th National People’s Congress were held. The government work report stressed that “stability should be the first and progress should be made in stability”, “steady growth should be put in a more prominent position”, the expected growth target of GDP is about 5.5%, and “active fiscal policy should improve efficiency and pay more attention to accuracy and sustainability”, “Prudent monetary policy should be flexible and moderate, and maintain reasonable and abundant liquidity”. At the same time, it explains the key directions such as common prosperity, carbon neutrality and financial system reform. At the industrial level, it is proposed to promote the development of digital economy and strengthen the overall layout of Digital China Construction; Enhance the core competitiveness of the manufacturing industry, implement the project of ensuring and stabilizing the chain of leading enterprises, and strive to cultivate “specialized, special and new” enterprises; Continue to ensure the housing needs of the people, adhere to the positioning of “housing, housing and non speculation”, etc. we expect that the market response to the policy tone of the two sessions may be relatively positive, and the policy beneficiary sector is expected to perform relatively in the near future.\n\n2) In February, manufacturing PMI data rebounded anti seasonally. The National Bureau of Statistics announced that the national manufacturing PMI recorded 50.2 in February, up 0.1 percentage point from January. The month on month increase was higher than that in February 2019 with similar seasonality, exceeding market expectations. The manufacturing industry further stabilized. Behind it may be the local Spring Festival and demand expansion caused by the epidemic, which exceeded expectations. The follow-up trend still needs to be observed.\n\n3) Progress of annual performance disclosure of listed companies. As of March 5, about 65% of the companies in the two cities have completed the disclosure of 2021 performance forecast / express report / annual report. Combined with the median value of the forecast and actual performance, the profit of all a / non-financial companies in 2021 under comparable standards has increased by 52% and 62% year-on-year", "timestamp": 1649008318, "digest": "9s6bV3cjP1zfYg_26cOvPsEGEjmbN_xMQACP2pAy4v8", "contributor": "0xFB277e1F314D4467B2408ac1b9CD0a12382f516F"}

Chinese people overseas, in particular, have a deeper understanding of this. Strangers, because they are all Chinese, have a strong centripetal force and cohesion.\n\nIn Lvov, Ukraine, there is such a Hunan guy. He is an international student in Ukraine. After the war in Ukraine, Chinese compatriots have been going to neighboring countries through Lvov. He actively helped the Chinese compatriots passing through Lvov to pass through customs and enter safe places.\n\nIn the border city of Lvov, Ukraine, Xu Shangming, a young man from Yiyang, took the initiative to give up his residence in order to give Chinese compatriots staying in Lvov a place to rest in recent days, and also actively helped these Chinese compatriots find transportation to neighboring countries.\n\nAt the press time, the reporter got the good news from Xu Shangming. The first batch of Chinese compatriots sent to neighboring countries with his help have safely arrived in neighboring Poland.\n\nOn February 28 local time, Ukrainian evacuees were in temporary shelters in prandemehir, Poland. Figure / people’s vision\n\nWaiting for his friend\n\n“I’m just waiting for my friends to contact me.” On the afternoon of March 1, compared with the tension in Kiev and Kharkov, Lvov in western Ukraine was still blue and white, full of sunshine, and sparse locals passed by Xu Shangming in the street. Xu Shangming has lived in Ukraine for more than three years. At this time, he is anxiously waiting to “go to” his friends.\n\n“Four friends came to my house at more than 7 a.m. they are not in good condition.” Speaking of his friends, Xu Shangming worried, “they have just come to Ukraine for a year, and the Ukrainian language is not very good. I contacted the driver to send them to Poland, but they can only be sent to a place 17 kilometers away from Poland. Four people at $400 are valuable, but there is no way!”\n\nNot long after the first batch of friends were sent away, the second batch of friends had arrived at home. “I made them instant noodles and added a lot of ham sausage. They planned to rest here. Maybe they didn’t want to bother me. Finally, after a simple rest, they chose to go to Poland.” Xu Shangming’s home is only more than 20 square meters. He planned to open a local canteen and bought a lot of food from China: instant noodles, snail powder, sausage… “They transferred money to me, but I didn’t want it. At this time, I think it should be free. But I’m very moved. They’re thinking about it for me.”\n\n“I heard there were a lot of robberies.” Xu Shangming said that he was worried about seeing off the second batch of friends. Because almost everyone of them carried two boxes and had to walk 17 kilometers on foot. There were many variables on the road\n\nHelp the mother to be contact the hospital\n\n“Can you ask me if the local hospital is still operating normally?” At about 10:00 Ukrainian time, a pregnant woman in Kharkov contacted Xu Shangming. Knowing that the pregnant woman had been pregnant for 8 months and could only have a cesarean section, he was on the way to contact the local hospital in Lvov just after seeing off his friend. Several hospitals were contacted, and only one hospital was available. Xu Shangming hurriedly informed the “mother to be” in Kharkov hospital. But he thought that the transfer of the “mother to be” might be more difficult, because he thought that his friend who didn’t squeeze into the train said that “now the train platforms from Kharkov, Kiev to Lvov are full of people”.\n\nWalking on the road, Xu Shangming met several refugees. “Now there are three or four thousand refugees fleeing to Lvov every day. The Lvov government arranges them to live in all Lvov universities. Fortunately, Lvov’s shops are (still) open and they can buy food by themselves.”\n\n“A Chinese was shot in Kharkov, and the local hospital in Ukraine is actively rescuing.” During the interview, Xu Shangming told reporters.\n\n“I’m not going to go!” Watching so many friends leave Ukraine, Xu Shangming has his own plan: because his work stops and the air ticket is too expensive to be borne by his parents, he can wait and see again.\n\nAt more than 6 pm, Xu Shangming received his third batch of friends on the roadside. He has helped to contact the university dormitory. On the way to the dormitory, several peace pigeons passed through them, stopped in the middle of the street and danced leisurely. A local man was holding a cup beside the shop and watched them hurry by. “Lvov has no sign of war now.” Xu Shangming said, “wait until Lvov starts fighting. It’s only more than 50 kilometers away from Poland. At that time, even if I walk, I can withdraw.”", "timestamp": 1649008682, "digest": "FxI_vOlhoVur1sQHQbCsCjHljOLUneEMaCXfL8okz3o", "contributor": "0x7E26B7e9EE463D50f0B26455952F2CAe779234B8"}
{"id": "1vH4o1YfHQp3ydosfhA7LUMmLYJHRRrea6wsmVtIkEk", "title": "BullPerks Is Excited to Inform About an Upcoming VC Deal with DeFiHorseUnderstanding Crypto Maximalism", "body": "The end of 2021 proves to be more dynamic and vibrant for the crypto industry than any previous year. Seeing several record milestones and top-notch games based on blockchain technology and NFTs.Crypto maximalism is by far the strangest but most fascinating thing in the crypto space. People back their chain of choice like it’s their local football team. Ever since taking a deep dive into this space I never really understood maximalism. I personally watch a ton of football (actual football, not handegg) but don’t support any team, however I noticed striking similarities between the hardcore football fans and crypto maximalists. So this is my 50IQ attempt at understanding maximalism.\n\nIdeology\n\nTheoretically, tribalism shouldn’t exist because everyone who is in the crypto space is ideologically aligned in many ways. Everyone has a certain disdain for the traditional system, everyone is skeptical of fiat currencies and the monetary policies surrounding them, people want to opt out of traditional society, people don’t like banks, and most people have that slight sprinkle of degeneracy in their system (some more than others). Yet, with so many similarities, you see some very toxic arguments and fights. Bitcoin maxis crucify ETH maxis, ETH maxis crucify AVAX or SOL maxis, and everyone crucifies ADA maxis. Other than this you even have maxis for applications. You have link marines, Frognation and many others.\n\nThe best way to describe the infighting between such a similar set of people is through what Sigmund Freud describes as the “narcissism of minor differences”. He basically says that when people are so alike, it is the marginal differences that are used as the basis for aversion and toxicity towards the others. This show of anger tends to be much stronger when the differences are marginal. In crypto, the marginal difference boils down to a person’s investment decision. People may have found Cardano through their favourite youtuber, or Ethereum for its decentralization, or AVAX for its usability. At the end of the day it is a minor difference in investment decision amongst ideologically similar people that creates such huge infighting. Luckily it’s all behind a screen.\n\nCommunity and belonging\n\nCommunity is everything in crypto. Building an engaged community is often paramount to the success of your protocol. Often times, when you become part of a strong and growing community within crypto, there is this romanticized sense of solidarity &amp; belonging. Given that most new participants in crypto are often young &amp; not rich, when they find themselves in a group of likeminded people it creates a sense of emotional arousal. It’s exciting to be part of “the mob” sometimes.\n\nWhen their belief and participation in this community pays off, it often makes their bond to the community even stronger. People often never want to leave simply because of what they have accomplished and experienced through being in the community. While it’s fair to think that all participants in any type of market have to be completely objective, we have never seen this kind of community formation around financial products/services ever before. When money is at stake it only makes the vested interest of people in that community that much larger. This leads on people to become tribalistic in some way.\n\nIdentity\n\nRelated to the point above, a person’s brand/identity formation also tends to play a role. When a person is early to a protocol, they consciously or subconsciously build their online persona/brand around this protocol. They constantly write articles about it, they write twitter threads about it, they publicly invest in it, they are extremely involved in the community and so on. This makes them either willingly or unwillingly stuck to this identity they have created. They can be willingly stuck because of how emotionally attached they are to the community or how attached they are to the vision of the protocol. Or, they can be unwillingly stuck due to the community. You have built a brand around this protocol and have been involved in it for so long, then you suddenly “jump ship”, the other community members get extremely pissed. We have seen it with Bitcoiners who started participating in Ethereum. The Bitcoin community absolutely crucified these people and in some cases even sent death threats. This however only keeps a person stuck publicly, they can do as they please privately and even build a new persona/brand.\n\nLaziness\n\nAnother possible explanation is Laziness, but Laziness in two different ways. One is the laziness of those who already made it and just can’t be bothered anymore. Some people who got rich of Ethereum cannot be bothered to get stuck in with AVAX NEAR LUNA SOL ATOM or whichever other protocol there is. They tend to lose that same passion and fire under the belly that they had before they made it, and due to this comfort they become de facto maximalists of their chain of choice.\n\nThe other laziness comes from the bagholder syndrome. These are the people who found a community they liked and joined in, but they joined in relatively late. They bought the coin near the top and have been holding it down ever since. While they hold these coins, they either get married to their bags or are too lazy to look at whether there are other opportunities in the market that they are missing. Lo and behold, while they held their bags down 80% without ever venturing out of their community, some other people have made life changing money by participating in other places. This invokes a sense of irritation in them which often makes them toxic towards the other people who did better.\n\nConclusion\n\nMy personal conclusion from understanding maximalism is don’t be a maximalist. While it is good to be involved in communities, there is major opportunity cost from being stuck. You may want to be a rotatooor profit maxi with no loyalty to any protocol, but they also tend to get crucified by the protocol maxis. Crypto is a vast land of opportunity, everyday there is a new chance and everyday there are major changes that take place within the space. If you get stuck, you will most likely get left behind. Why stick to one protocol when you can benefit from participating in multiple. Innovation &amp; change is at the heart of crypto, being a maximalist is often the opposite of this.\n\nThank You for reading,\n\nIf you enjoyed the article and are feeling generous, then please consider donating to my ETH wallet: 0x43A5D9C141125Cd67B9268ef28C7c6a9dC15F3c9\n\nPlease subscribe to the substack and follow the medium for more content (IT’S FREE)\n\nFollow me on twitter @LeftsideEmiri\n\nThe DefiHorse project promises to become the next big name in the DeFi community due to its futuristic aesthetics, addicting gameplay, and affiliation with NFT horse racing games, all of which are among the most popular and promising trends today.

The $SOCKS tokens were deposited in an Uniswap liquidity pool, meaning the price for 1 $SOCKS (one pair of socks) is dynamic and will rise as demand goes up. The initial price on May 9th was $12, and it has been widely popular reaching a peak of around $164k on August 9, 2021. The all-time price graph looks like many of the successful OG tokens, with the first period the graph looking flat and appearing to trade close to zero because of the huge increase in price over time.\n\n[https://dune.xyz/embeds/500661/947577/b03e8f2c-4143-469c-a434-074a0a60d5f4?display=iframe](https://dune.xyz/embeds/500661/947577/b03e8f2c-4143-469c-a434-074a0a60d5f4?display=iframe)\n\nAs the trading price started at only $12 and reached a peak of $164k, trading and holding $SOCKS would have been hugely profitable over the years. The graph below shows the return on investment when bought on a certain date vs the current $SOCKS price. The returns when buying $SOCKS the first two years are astronomical, as it was trading below $1k till the end of 2020:\n\n[https://dune.xyz/embeds/500670/947594/87647c7d-0044-434e-9ae4-0bc93861e132?display=iframe](https://dune.xyz/embeds/500670/947594/87647c7d-0044-434e-9ae4-0bc93861e132?display=iframe)\n\nThe last year the price has swung a lot between profitable and not profitable as the bullrun matured. The market crash in May/June/July proved to be a good buying opportunity to turn a profit on $SOCKS, or to buy for a cheaper pair of physical socks. Even though the enormous returns are a thing of 2019 and 2020, trading $SOCKS still was profitable this past year if timed right, and the project is far from dead.\n\nVolume logically heavily picked up after the boom in price in early 2021. In total the Uniswap liquidity pools have done $138 million in volume, over half of that coming from v1 as the $SOCKS were initially deposited in that pool. $SOCKS is actually one of the last remaining active pools on v1, as most of the other liquidity has fully migrated to the superior v2 & v3 pools. In the past year $SOCKS accounted for 36% of the total volume on v1 ($43m of $118m).\n\n[https://dune.xyz/embeds/557937/1046342/c58289fe-4806-4363-9721-c61977cd083d?display=iframe](https://dune.xyz/embeds/557937/1046342/c58289fe-4806-4363-9721-c61977cd083d?display=iframe)\n\nIn total 500 $SOCKS tokens were released, so a total of 500 physical pair of socks were ever claimable. As of now 198 pair of socks are claimed, which leaves just over 300 $SOCKS still in liquidity pools or peoples wallets. Because the $SOCKS are in liquidity pools on a bonding curve, the last $SOCKS token cannot be bought even with all ETH tokens in existence. In the 3 liquidity pools only 25 $SOCKS remain to be bought, 19.5 in v1, 5.8 in v3 and 0.45 in v2. The remaining $SOCKS are held in private wallets. There are 157 wallets that hold one or more $SOCKS and could claim a physical pair of socks, but prefer to hold on to their ERC-20 token instead. They hold 257 $SOCKS in total, a vast majority of the total supply, with the top holder having 13 $SOCKS. 2800 wallets hold less than 1 $SOCKS, for a total of 18 $SOCKS.\n\n[https://dune.xyz/embeds/500688/947638/844c4ceb-04d6-48f4-9eea-c3eebc3cdb05?display=iframe](https://dune.xyz/embeds/500688/947638/844c4ceb-04d6-48f4-9eea-c3eebc3cdb05?display=iframe)\n\nThe graph above shows in which months a pair of socks was claimed. The first few months after launch in May it was not possible to redeem $SOCKS, hence why the first $SOCKS was redeemed in September. The spike in July 2020 is because the Uniswap team made a donation to @BlackGirlsCode and @NAACP [\\[1\\]](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1270092224148226049). The donation was $10k in ETH, which came from the $SOCKS liquidity pool. The 55 $SOCKS associated with that ETH liquidity were burned.\n\nThe last day $SOCKS were exchanged for a physical pair of socks was on July 1st, 2021. This has been the longest stretch ever without a $SOCKS token being redeemed, as evidently very few people would buy a pair of socks for $100k, even in the crypto world. In fact, whenever $SOCKS get redeemed it is the talk of the day as seen by this tweet from Hayden:\n\n[https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1389300579839746053](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1389300579839746053)\n\nIf all wallets holding at least 1 $SOCKS redeemed the maximum number of physical socks they could, they would be able to redeem 249 pair of socks. This isn’t far off the total $SOCKS these wallets combined hold (257), because most prefer to hold whole numbers of tokens. Having a fractional token is worth less since you can’t redeem it, hence why for $SOCKS we see a different distribution of fractional holdings compared to other tokens where this matters less. Of the 157 wallets with at least 1 $SOCKS, 93 own $SOCKS as whole numbers, 49 own $SOCKS with a decimal number between 0 and 1, and only 15 hold with a decimal number higher than 1. In fact, 77 wallets hold exactly 1 $SOCKS token!\n\n[https://dune.xyz/embeds/558015/1046452/96178309-7824-481d-b608-ace289e9c084?display=iframe](https://dune.xyz/embeds/558015/1046452/96178309-7824-481d-b608-ace289e9c084?display=iframe)\n\nThe highest price when $SOCKS were ever redeemed was $95k, on the 10th of May 2021. This was also when 9 pair of socks were claimed in a single transaction. The value of the socks claimed at the time was a staggering amount of over $850k by 0xb1.\n\n[https://twitter.com/0x_b1/status/1439652480158212096](https://twitter.com/0x_b1/status/1439652480158212096)\n\nA physical pair of socks isn’t the only thing you receive when redeeming your $SOCKS token, an NFT (ERC-721) is also send to your wallet. There are currently only 144 Unisock NFT’s, as for the donation (and burning) of the 55 $SOCKS in July 2020 no NFT’s were minted. So the NFT’s are at the moment even rarer than $SOCKS!\n\nUnisocks NFT’s recently got relisted on Opensea, so the trading is picking up after a year of close to zero secondary market liquidity, with 3 NFTs sold in March on Opensea. The latest selling between 5 and 18 ETH.\n\n[https://dune.xyz/embeds/558020/1046459/6980aefd-8fb1-40bd-8c49-8c882b9baf75?display=iframe](https://dune.xyz/embeds/558020/1046459/6980aefd-8fb1-40bd-8c49-8c882b9baf75?display=iframe)\n\nHolding $SOCKS or the Unisocks NFT has another benefit in that you get to join an exclusive telegram group when holding one of the two. What goes on in this Telegram chat? Buy some $SOCKS or an NFT and find out:\n\n[https://t.co/uTChqYMm0R](https://t.co/uTChqYMm0R)\n\nAll in all, $SOCKS are a super cool idea that kind of got out of hand, and shows a bit of the craziness of the last 3 years in the crypto space. Initially Uniswap planned to burn unsold SOCKS after 100 days, but they decided not to go through with that idea. Uniswap even rewarded users that redeemed or held at least 1 $SOCKS by airdropping 1000 $UNI to those wallets when it released their governance token in September 2020.\n\nThese NFT/tokens linked to physical goods or real world actions are a very interesting concept that only furthers helps crypto adaption, of which Unisocks is a pioneer.", "timestamp": 1649008804, "digest": "HLRWF_fziJU9TKxlsZyFQO_9t9BsmOYiU0rjQjpvU-Y", "contributor": "0x211F3a6B74D522A207b90310d69f00f7129E990a"}
{"id": "iPtChQFn_BkCHiczMBumUzUlONDsyAi244Pe9RML49Q", "title": "Zhu He: the policy logic behind the deficit rate of 2.8%", "body": "Opinion leaders - China finance 40 Forum\n\nAuthor: Zhu He\n\nOn March 5, the fifth session of the 13th National People’s Congress was held in Beijing. Premier Li Keqiang delivered a government work report. The report puts forward the main expected targets for development this year, of which the growth target of gross domestic product (GDP) is about 5.5%, and the deficit ratio is planned to be about 2.8%.\n\nZhu He, deputy director of the research department of China Financial forty Forum (CF40) and young researcher of China Financial forty Research Institute, believes that the GDP growth target of 5.5% is the anchor of macro policies this year. In order to achieve this growth target, macro policies must make significant efforts.\n\nThe report points out that fiscal expenditure will increase by 2 trillion, or 26.6 trillion, in 2022. The fiscal revenue in 2021 is 20.2 trillion. How can we make up for the 6.4 trillion gap? Zhu he proposed that there are three main channels: first, the deficit ratio should be arranged at 2.8% in 2022. Combined with the actual growth target of 5.5% and the GDP reduction index of 2%, the deficit financing scale should be 3.4-3.5 trillion; Second, the increment of fiscal revenue is about 1 trillion; Third, the transfer in of the budget stabilization fund and the turning over of the profits of state-owned enterprises.\n\nHe believes that the expenditure intensity of the general public budget this year is guaranteed, but there is still uncertainty whether the broad fiscal expenditure included in the government fund budget can achieve a relatively high year-on-year growth rate. This requires the central level to further strengthen overall planning and coordination, pay attention to the intensity of fiscal expenditure in a broad sense, and implement the fiscal force.\n\nIn terms of monetary policy, Zhu he proposed that according to the requirements of the report, monetary policy should not only increase the volume but also reduce the price. However, considering that the task of risk prevention is still important, it is necessary to leave sufficient cushion for the banking sector. The monetary authorities should reduce the real loan interest rate by reducing the short-term interest rate and driving the overall downward trend of the interest rate curve.\n\n”\n\nThe GDP growth target of 5.5% is the anchor of this year’s macro policy. In order to achieve this growth target, macro policies must make significant efforts.\n\nThe government work report points out that fiscal expenditure will increase by 2 trillion in 2022. The fiscal expenditure in 2021 is 24.6 trillion yuan, plus 2 trillion yuan, which will be 26.6 trillion yuan this year, with a corresponding expenditure growth rate of more than 8%. Objectively speaking, the fiscal expenditure growth rate of 8% is at least close to or even higher than the nominal GDP growth rate this year, which can better realize the role of stabilizing the economy.\n\nThe next question is how the fiscal revenue in 2022 should match the fiscal expenditure of 26.6 trillion. Specifically, the fiscal revenue in 2021 is 20.2 trillion, and how to fill the revenue and expenditure gap of 6.4 trillion.\n\nFrom the perspective of existing policy ideas, there are three main channels:\n\nFirst, fiscal deficit financing. The budget deficit ratio in 2022 is 2.8%. Combined with the actual growth target of 5.5% and the GDP reduction index of 2%, it can be calculated that the nominal GDP in 2022 is about 122 trillion, and the corresponding deficit scale should be 3.4-3.5 trillion.\n\nSecond, fiscal revenue increment. The fiscal revenue in 2021 is 20.2 trillion. If the growth rate of fiscal revenue in 2022 is 5%, the corresponding incremental part will be 1 trillion.\n\nBut there is a problem here: fiscal revenue is highly related to the degree of economic prosperity, especially the prosperity of upstream industries. Not to mention whether the tax reduction will increase this year, if we want to achieve a 5% growth rate of fiscal revenue, the corresponding scenario is that the year-on-year growth rate of PPI this year remains high.\n\nThird, the transfer in of the budget stabilization fund and the turning over of the profits of state-owned enterprises. Even though the “report of the state-owned financial institutions” has not mentioned the important way of turning over the profits of the state-owned financial institutions in accordance with the law in recent years. For a long time in the past, the profits of state-owned enterprises were not paid in full as required. In 2021, the total after tax net profit of state-owned enterprises in China was 2.47 trillion, including 1.57 trillion for central enterprises. It should be said that the current profit situation of state-owned enterprises has the potential to support large-scale fiscal expenditure.\n\nIn addition to the general public budget expenditure, the budget expenditure of government funds is also an important aspect of fiscal power. From the experience of previous years, a considerable part of the budget expenditure of government funds is transferred into the general public budget, which is not directly reflected in the expenditure of government funds.\n\nThe expenditure intensity of government fund budget mainly depends on the income. The main revenue source of government fund budget is land transfer fee, which comes from the land purchase expenditure of real estate enterprises.\n\nIn other words, the key to determining whether the government fund budget can work is whether the real estate enterprises can maintain the same enthusiasm for land purchase as in the past five years.\n\nRecently, relevant departments and some local governments have begun to adjust real estate policies, and market expectations are improving. However, there is still a lack of consensus on the extent and speed of the recovery of real estate sales, investment and new construction data.\n\nFrom the policy implementation, to the demand recovery, to the cash flow repair of real estate enterprises, and then to the balance sheet repair of real estate enterprises, this is not a one-step process, which needs to be conducted step by step. Given the current debt scale of the real estate industry, this process may take longer than expected.\n\nBefore the balance sheet of real estate enterprises is substantially repaired, the probability of land purchase decision-making of enterprises will remain cautious. This will directly affect the revenue and expenditure growth of the government fund budget.\n\nTo sum up, the expenditure intensity of the general public budget this year is guaranteed, but there is still uncertainty whether the broad fiscal expenditure included in the government fund budget can achieve a relatively high year-on-year growth rate. This requires the central level to further strengthen overall planning and coordination, pay attention to the intensity of fiscal expenditure in a broad sense, and implement the fiscal force.\n\nCompared with fiscal policy, although the length of the report on monetary policy is less than last year, the macro policy characteristics of monetary policy are more prominent.\n\nAccording to the requirements of the report, monetary policy should not only increase the amount (“keep the growth rate of money supply and social financing scale basically match the nominal economic growth”), but also reduce the price (“promote financial institutions to reduce the actual loan interest rate” and “comprehensive financing rate”)", "timestamp": 1649008757, "digest": "awkPP2AT0-_Ioa6csU701H-c7o6QfoxIP2-Y3IWCcj4", "contributor": "0x440021BaAa789a3a47bF09E654Fd56c84143d49f"}

A sweater is enough to cope with commuting collocation and make you look new", "body": "As we all know, the ability to work in the workplace is very important, but being able and elegant is also your bonus. After the first Spring Festival holiday, do new people in the workplace also suffer from “post holiday syndrome”?\n\nToday, I’ll show you how to plant grass and wear some spring sweaters suitable for new employees in the workplace. The upper body is gentle and does not neglect the style of duty. It can basically deal with all kinds of occasions. Don’t collect it quickly!\n\nKnitted cardigans have the gentle attribute of sweaters, which can not only give us warmth, but also let us coexist with style and fashion. It will not be as capable and domineering as a suit, but soft, natural and grounded.\n\nThis is a loose and short knit cardigan. The hem has the effect of waist sealing, covering the flesh and showing thin. It’s no matter whether to create a sense of hierarchy or optimize the body proportion.\n\nWorkplace collocation pays attention to a simple and generous, and there will be no mistake in choosing black bottoms. There are no problems with black suit pants, black bell bottomed pants and black A-line skirt.\n\nThe cardigan with twisted flowers looks more textured and slightly mature. I feel that the exposed area of V-neck is too large. You can wear a necklace to add femininity.\n\nWhen matching, it is recommended to “short up and long down”. For example, take a pair of high waist small black pants, black and white contrast color, and it can also show high and long legs.\n\nIt’s also a good way to wear a cardigan with a high neck sweater open. Remember to tuck the hem of the high neck sweater into the pants of the lower garment.\n\nIn addition to the pants, the knitted cardigan can highlight the feminine side with the skirt. The length of the skirt is very important, even if it is above the knee.\n\nPullover knitwear must be in sisters’ wardrobe. It’s simple and versatile, and it’s the least error prone to wear on commute.\n\nIf you want to look thin visually, you can try a square neck sweater to decorate the shoulder and neck lines, and you can also wear a necklace to increase the sense of delicacy.\n\nWhite Pullover Sweater with black skirt, simple black and white with work and leisure are very suitable.\n\nAlthough going to work is a serious thing, you have to catch up with the fashion occasionally. For example, this Klein blue sweater is particularly white, and it is a perfect match with white pants. It has a tight temperament!\n\nLook carefully, the body, sleeves and neckline of the sweater are in different blue, and a row of wood buttons on the left shoulder is the finishing touch.\n\nIn addition to the wearing method of color contrast, the matching method of the same color system is even simpler. If you want to sleep a few more minutes in the morning, it’s enough to learn the following matching.\n\nWhen choosing a sweater, don’t choose a style that is too close to your body. Leaving some space will make you look thinner and more comfortable and breathable.\n\nWhen it comes to the necessary items for the workplace in early spring, the knitted vest must have a name and sisters who can’t match. There will be no mistake in folding the basic white shirt, which has a sense of warmth and hierarchy.\n\nThe white shirt inside the brown knitted vest is OK whether it is matched with tofu pants or wide leg pants. If you want to show the leg length or wide leg pants, the effect is better.\n\nThe knitted vest with V-neck can lengthen the neck line and show a small face. The daily folding of white shirts increases the sense of hierarchy. Regardless of height, fat and thin, the upper body is very fashionable.\n\nWhite knitted vest and Black Wide Leg Pants combine the classic “black and white match”. Wide leg pants choose fabrics with strong falling feeling, which can make the legs look straight and long.\n\nBags are also an important part of workplace wear. This black chain bag can provide three back methods: carrying, carrying and armpit\\~\n\nLadies and sisters who are new to the workplace can also pay attention to me. They will share little knowledge about wearing and matching every day, and can also help you solve the problems of wearing and matching!", "timestamp": 1649008790, "digest": "zQMUOWio-_-O5IEidvPu7Vb_23EglLwEAMW7mVsH_pM", "contributor": "0x5aaE4CCFB61f3b455F8eB919c9CAA5aB9d345B1a"}

Even though the enormous returns are a thing of 2019 and 2020, trading $SOCKS still was profitable this past year if timed right, and the project is far from dead.\n\nVolume logically heavily picked up after the boom in price in early 2021. In total the Uniswap liquidity pools have done $138 million in volume, over half of that coming from v1 as the $SOCKS were initially deposited in that pool. $SOCKS is actually one of the last remaining active pools on v1, as most of the other liquidity has fully migrated to the superior v2 & v3 pools. In the past year $SOCKS accounted for 36% of the total volume on v1 ($43m of $118m).\n\n[https://dune.xyz/embeds/557937/1046342/c58289fe-4806-4363-9721-c61977cd083d?display=iframe](https://dune.xyz/embeds/557937/1046342/c58289fe-4806-4363-9721-c61977cd083d?display=iframe)\n\nIn total 500 $SOCKS tokens were released, so a total of 500 physical pair of socks were ever claimable. As of now 198 pair of socks are claimed, which leaves just over 300 $SOCKS still in liquidity pools or peoples wallets. Because the $SOCKS are in liquidity pools on a bonding curve, the last $SOCKS token cannot be bought even with all ETH tokens in existence. In the 3 liquidity pools only 25 $SOCKS remain to be bought, 19.5 in v1, 5.8 in v3 and 0.45 in v2. The remaining $SOCKS are held in private wallets. There are 157 wallets that hold one or more $SOCKS and could claim a physical pair of socks, but prefer to hold on to their ERC-20 token instead. They hold 257 $SOCKS in total, a vast majority of the total supply, with the top holder having 13 $SOCKS. 2800 wallets hold less than 1 $SOCKS, for a total of 18 $SOCKS.\n\n[https://dune.xyz/embeds/500688/947638/844c4ceb-04d6-48f4-9eea-c3eebc3cdb05?display=iframe](https://dune.xyz/embeds/500688/947638/844c4ceb-04d6-48f4-9eea-c3eebc3cdb05?display=iframe)\n\nThe graph above shows in which months a pair of socks was claimed. The first few months after launch in May it was not possible to redeem $SOCKS, hence why the first $SOCKS was redeemed in September. The spike in July 2020 is because the Uniswap team made a donation to @BlackGirlsCode and @NAACP [\\[1\\]](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1270092224148226049). The donation was $10k in ETH, which came from the $SOCKS liquidity pool. The 55 $SOCKS associated with that ETH liquidity were burned.\n\nThe last day $SOCKS were exchanged for a physical pair of socks was on July 1st, 2021. This has been the longest stretch ever without a $SOCKS token being redeemed, as evidently very few people would buy a pair of socks for $100k, even in the crypto world. In fact, whenever $SOCKS get redeemed it is the talk of the day as seen by this tweet from Hayden:\n\n[https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1389300579839746053](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1389300579839746053)\n\nIf all wallets holding at least 1 $SOCKS redeemed the maximum number of physical socks they could, they would be able to redeem 249 pair of socks. This isn’t far off the total $SOCKS these wallets combined hold (257), because most prefer to hold whole numbers of tokens. Having a fractional token is worth less since you can’t redeem it, hence why for $SOCKS we see a different distribution of fractional holdings compared to other tokens where this matters less. Of the 157 wallets with at least 1 $SOCKS, 93 own $SOCKS as whole numbers, 49 own $SOCKS with a decimal number between 0 and 1, and only 15 hold with a decimal number higher than 1. In fact, 77 wallets hold exactly 1 $SOCKS token!\n\n[https://dune.xyz/embeds/558015/1046452/96178309-7824-481d-b608-ace289e9c084?display=iframe](https://dune.xyz/embeds/558015/1046452/96178309-7824-481d-b608-ace289e9c084?display=iframe)\n\nThe highest price when $SOCKS were ever redeemed was $95k, on the 10th of May 2021. This was also when 9 pair of socks were claimed in a single transaction. The value of the socks claimed at the time was a staggering amount of over $850k by 0xb1.\n\n[https://twitter.com/0x_b1/status/1439652480158212096](https://twitter.com/0x_b1/status/1439652480158212096)\n\nA physical pair of socks isn’t the only thing you receive when redeeming your $SOCKS token, an NFT (ERC-721) is also send to your wallet. There are currently only 144 Unisock NFT’s, as for the donation (and burning) of the 55 $SOCKS in July 2020 no NFT’s were minted. So the NFT’s are at the moment even rarer than $SOCKS!\n\nUnisocks NFT’s recently got relisted on Opensea, so the trading is picking up after a year of close to zero secondary market liquidity, with 3 NFTs sold in March on Opensea. The latest selling between 5 and 18 ETH.\n\n[https://dune.xyz/embeds/558020/1046459/6980aefd-8fb1-40bd-8c49-8c882b9baf75?display=iframe](https://dune.xyz/embeds/558020/1046459/6980aefd-8fb1-40bd-8c49-8c882b9baf75?display=iframe)\n\nHolding $SOCKS or the Unisocks NFT has another benefit in that you get to join an exclusive telegram group when holding one of the two. What goes on in this Telegram chat? Buy some $SOCKS or an NFT and find out:\n\n[https://t.co/uTChqYMm0R](https://t.co/uTChqYMm0R)\n\nAll in all, $SOCKS are a super cool idea that kind of got out of hand, and shows a bit of the craziness of the last 3 years in the crypto space. Initially Uniswap planned to burn unsold SOCKS after 100 days, but they decided not to go through with that idea. Uniswap even rewarded users that redeemed or held at least 1 $SOCKS by airdropping 1000 $UNI to those wallets when it released their governance token in September 2020.\n\nThese NFT/tokens linked to physical goods or real world actions are a very interesting concept that only furthers helps crypto adaption, of which Unisocks is a pioneer.", "timestamp": 1649008825, "digest": "HLRWF_fziJU9TKxlsZyFQO_9t9BsmOYiU0rjQjpvU-Y", "contributor": "0x211F3a6B74D522A207b90310d69f00f7129E990a"}

Linyi Unicom: it may be caused by staff mistakes", "body": "On March 15, Linyi Unicom paid an inexplicable 59 yuan of broadband fee per month during the operation. Linyi Unicom: it may be caused by staff mistakes\n\nSina Shandong, March 7, 17:26 attention\n\nLinyi Unicom arbitrarily changed the user package and added inexplicable broadband under its name, with an additional 59 yuan per month. The incident occurred in Linyi Unicom Luozhuang company. The staff forcibly added the superimposed package broadband service to the user name without authorization, resulting in the user paying an extra 59 yuan per month for more than half a year.\n\nOn December 19, by chance, Mr. Zhou, a citizen of Linyi, landed in the online business hall of Shandong Unicom and found that the mobile phone number with almost fixed payment on weekdays has inexplicably increased by 59 yuan per month since July this year. Subsequently, Mr. Zhou called China Unicom 10010 customer service. According to the staff, since July this year, a superimposed package has been added under Mr. Zhou’s main mobile phone number. The service of this package is broadband service, and the discount is 59 yuan per month.\n\nOn December 20, Mr. Zhou came to the Jintan business hall of Linyi Unicom. The inquiry showed that there was a new overlay package broadband service under Mr. Zhou’s name, which had been paid since July and was borne by Mr. Zhou’s host number. Mr. Zhou doesn’t know the new broadband user “Chai “ and his mobile phone number “176     6230”.\n\nThe superimposed package broadband service, which came into effect in July, is handled by the business center of Linyi Unicom Luozhuang branch with the job number of “SD liuyan12”. Mr. Zhou said that his mobile phone number was handled in the Jintan business hall of Linyi Unicom and has been used for more than ten years. Because of the use of package business and now online payment, I have hardly been to the business hall to deal with business, let alone Luozhuang to deal with business. I feel confused about the superimposed package broadband business.\n\nMr. Zhou asked the staff of China Unicom to issue the portrait video of the business handled at that time, which was rejected by the staff and said it might be caused by the staff’s mistakes. Mr. Zhou said that usually because of the more business, the monthly payment time is more or less, and he didn’t care too much. If it were not for the new business query, it would be difficult to detect the new expense.\n\nHe believes that this is the user loss deliberately caused by China Unicom’s covert and illegal operation. Now the business involving citizens’ privacy information needs portrait input. Even if the package package is superimposed on the main number, the main number machine owner must provide identity information to operate. I don’t know which standard Luozhuang Unicom is based on.\n\nThe lawyer said that the user intentionally added the expenses that should have been borne by himself to others without knowledge and without providing any identity certificate, and the illegal operation is suspected of a crime. At present, Mr. Zhou has complained to China Unicom and Shandong Unicom. China Unicom has not replied yet.

{"id": "1-jfh9CENSNUOIhNOS42zJ2tnpWjbIlC0ZIAqNtdIVc", "title": "How to stabilize growth this year from the government work report", "body": "Opinion leaders - China finance 40 Forum\n\nOn the morning of March 5, the fifth session of the 13th National People’s Congress opened in the Great Hall of the people. Premier Li Keqiang delivered a government work report, comprehensively summarizing the achievements in 2021 and clarifying the economic work objectives and specific tasks in 2022.\n\nFor this year’s growth target, the government work report points out that the GDP growth target is set at about 5.5%. From the perspective of macro policy, this year’s monetary policy should be flexible and appropriate, and maintain reasonable and abundant liquidity; Active fiscal policies should improve efficiency and pay more attention to accuracy and sustainability. The policy force should be advanced appropriately, and the reserve policy tools should be used in time to ensure the smooth operation of the economy. This year, the deficit rate is set at 2.8%, which is lower than 3% for the first time since the outbreak of the epidemic in 2020.\n\nWhy is the growth target set at 5.5%? Under the triple pressure, how can monetary and fiscal policies help “steady growth” this year? Since 2020, the government work report has mentioned “no speculation in housing” for three consecutive years, and also proposed “meeting the reasonable housing needs of property buyers”. What signal has this released? In the face of complex situations and multiple uncertain factors at home and abroad, how to “prevent risks” while “stabilizing growth”?\n\nGDP target 5.5%\n\nPrimary policy objective: steady growth\n\nGDP growth of about 5.5%… The setting of the expected target of economic growth mainly considers the needs of stabilizing employment, ensuring people’s livelihood and preventing risks, and is consistent with the average economic growth in the past two years and the objectives of the 14th five year plan. This is a medium and high-speed growth on a high base, which reflects the initiative and requires hard work.\n\n——Government work report\n\nWhy is the growth target set at 5.5%?\n\nIn fact, this growth target is basically in line with the current general expectations of domestic academic circles.\n\nSheng Zhongming, a young researcher of the Chinese Academy of financial Sciences, Yang Bohan, a doctoral student of the University of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and Yu Yongding, an academic consultant of the China Forum of financial forty (CF40) and a member of the academic department of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, also pointed out the general consideration of this year’s economic growth target——\n\nOn the one hand, due to the weakening of the base effect, the growth rate in 2022 should be less than 8.1%; On the other hand, since it can be assumed that China’s potential economic growth rate is 6%, the growth rate in 2022 should aim at reaching the potential growth rate. However, due to many adverse effects and uncertainties caused by the epidemic, it is acceptable that the GDP growth rate in 2022 is less than 6%. The market generally believes that the GDP growth rate in 2022 should be 5.5%.\n\nOn March 5, Xiang Dong, deputy director of the Research Office of the State Council, introduced when interpreting the government work report that the setting of the “about 5.5% target” first considered the needs of stabilizing employment, ensuring people’s livelihood and preventing risks. He said that economic stability is the foundation. If the economy is unstable, it is difficult to stabilize employment income. With a growth rate of about 5.5%, there will be a foundation for expanding employment and increasing income, and the economic operation can be maintained within a reasonable range.\n\nA key word of this year’s government work report is “stability”. The full text appears 76 times, 11 times more than last year. Continuing the statement made at the central economic work conference at the end of last year, the report once again stressed that this year we should adhere to the principle of stability, seek progress while maintaining stability, and place steady growth in a more prominent position.\n\nAlthough China achieved an economic growth rate of 8.1% last year, 2.1 percentage points higher than the expected target, it should be noted that the GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter of last year was only 4%, and the economic growth faced the triple pressure of “demand contraction, supply shock and weakening expectation”, and the pressure for steady growth soared.\n\nXu Qiyuan, a specially invited researcher of CF40 and a researcher of the Institute of world economics and politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, believes that China’s growth rate in 2021 is 8.1%, corresponding to an average growth rate of 5.1% in two years. Therefore, the growth target of 5.5% is slightly higher than the average growth rate of two years last year. Considering that the situation at home and abroad is still challenging, especially when domestic consumer demand is sluggish, the real estate industry is in the throes of transformation and the situation of foreign exports is unknown, it is not easy to achieve the goal. As pointed out in the government work report, this growth target “requires hard work to achieve”.\n\nZhang Bin, a senior researcher at CF40 and a researcher at the Institute of world economics and politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, particularly stressed that among the triple pressures, the current pressure of demand contraction is particularly prominent. To achieve the economic growth target of 5.5%, we must have active policy support.\n\nThe deficit rate is below 3% for the first time since the epidemic\n\nThe fiscal policy is weak in name and strong in reality\n\nImprove the efficiency of proactive fiscal policy. This year’s deficit ratio is planned to be about 2.8%, down from last year, which is conducive to enhancing fiscal sustainability. It is expected that fiscal revenue will continue to grow this year. In addition, specific state-owned financial institutions and franchised institutions will turn in the remaining profits in recent years according to law and transfer into the budget stability adjustment fund. The scale of expenditure will expand by more than 2 trillion yuan compared with last year, and the available financial resources will increase significantly.\n\n——Government work report\n\nThis year’s deficit rate is set at about 2.8%, lower than 3% last year, and lower than 3% for the first time since the outbreak of the epidemic.\n\nUnder the increasing pressure of “steady growth”, why did the deficit rate decline this year? What impact will this have on the expenditure efficiency of fiscal policy?\n\nIn this regard, finance minister Liu Kun said at the first “Ministerial channel” today, “An appropriate reduction in the deficit ratio this year is an important measure to maintain fiscal sustainability. This year’s deficit ratio is set at about 2.8%, 0.4 percentage point lower than last year’s budget, and the scale of funds is reduced by 200 billion yuan. However, through cross-year adjustment, the funds transferred from the central government to the general budget alone reached 1.267 trillion yuan, 6.6 times that of last year. This amount of funds is equivalent to increasing the deficit ratio by one The intensity of fiscal expenditure is guaranteed. “\n\nFrom the perspective of the nominal and actual deficit rate of less than 2.8%, Xu Yuan’s fiscal arrangement may still have a certain positive effect, which is lower than the previous market-oriented rate of less than 2.8%.\n\nFirst of all, from the perspective of the general budget, although the deficit ratio arrangement has been reduced, the scale of fiscal expenditure will still expand by more than 2 trillion yuan over last year, and the available financial resources will increase significantly.\n\nWhy is the deficit rate expected to decline and the scale of expenditure expanded by more than 2 trillion yuan? This is due to the expected fiscal revenue this year", "timestamp": 1649008981, "digest": "qMv7Ma9X_puHALyUUIPPZllTRzVr5XAlzMeEbmI4hcI", "contributor": "0x8525F35D58bDe3a950E29a63DF90dF62274aabc1"}

Some netizens joked: “next time I’ll pretend to be a child and clap hands with him.”.\n\nOn March 1, the reporter of Xiaoxiang Morning Post contacted Ms. Liu who took the video. She told reporters that the video was shot at about 5 pm yesterday. She happened to pass the fifth complete primary school in Tangdukou Town, Shaoyang County with her friends at that time. “My friend told me that the traffic policeman in the video seemed to clap hands with the students every day. He was very enthusiastic.” Ms. Liu herself is also a primary school teacher. She felt that the traffic policeman “loved his work very much, so she took a video and recorded it.”", "timestamp": 1649009221, "digest": "6NsyFfisc61qsSIaG4SKMByjtKTEfmbEZCng_sbr17g", "contributor": "0x2772AB3572d10936CE35846EAC9168eB8a5C015a"}

原创\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3OWmRocY2U7-THXIYkATy?height=608&width=1080)\n\n**作者：唐晗**\n\n作为一个文化符号，Bored Ape Yacht Club是如何在短短一年成为Web3文化标志，并快速向Web2世界扩散的？\n\n复盘整个过程至关重要，我们必须明白我们在投资以及在创造什么，否则就是盲动。\n\n**PFP NFT的价格究竟来自于哪里？**\n\n在回答这个问题之前，首先想请大家思考一个问题：当你在买NFT的时候，是在买什么？\n\n相信很少会有人真的只是在买一张图吧！“炒图片”只是一种戏谑，若以图片的估值来看NFT那满满都是泡沫。在去年8月份，我就得出了一个结论，PFP NFT的估值最终是对NFT背后社区的估值，而不是对一张图片的估值。这就是为什么要购买并持有BAYC。\n\n如果说CryptoPunks是10k项目的鼻祖，那BAYC就是第一个懂得用NFT来调动社区和组织社区的10k项目方。自此之后，所有的10k项目都沿袭了BAYC的道路：号召大家在推特上换头像；建立项目的Discord群；在线下组织只有持有NFT才能参与的线下活动；在城市做PFP涂鸦……请记住，这些都是BAYC的创举。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C0LSq3FSgQnjjjJ9SrvaX?height=518&width=924)\n\n**名人效应：让你的社区更值钱**\n\nBAYC的NFT卖完整整花了7天，它的初始社区成员质量并不好。但是，BAYC并没有像艺术创作者那样，止步于将作品卖完。他们想要更高质量的社区。既然PFP项目估值等于社区估值，那么引入名人自然会提振NFT的价格。于是，当其他项目还在想着怎么卖完跑路时，BAYC已经在NBA做推广，让巨星们在推特换头像了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F_ET75oG46BmqA1VIZUvy?height=518&width=924)\n\n将BAYC向名人圈推广带来了两个效应：首先，Web2世界非常想要了解Web3世界和NFT的时候（尤其是在Beeple那赫赫有名的七千万美金拍卖后），通过名人网络的传播，BAYC成为了全球普通人认知NFT世界的第一个窗口，这为它后面成为Web3文化的标志符号奠定了基础。另一方面，此举夯实了它在NFT市场的地位。\n\n**开放版权：调动社区二创，促进符号传播**\n\nBAYC也是第一个将作品商用权下放到NFT持有者的项目，他们鼓励作品持有者进行对作品的一切二次创作。这也奠定了后面10k PFP项目的另一个范式：鼓励二创；Meme大赛；鼓励持有者做项目形象的纹身、美甲和cosplay，并在社交媒体曝光……这一切都是为了塑造社区氛围，和名人一起促进符号的传播。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EinNgbLLqFTa88LWPRKZ7?height=518&width=924)\n\n符号的每一次传播都是一次共识的增加。Web3比Web2更加渴望流量，因为Web2的流量是以广告来变现的，中间存在着磨损；而Web3的文化直接转化为购买（NFT/Token）。这意味着流量在Web3领域更值钱。BAYC率先看清楚了这一点，从早期号召社区成员twitter换头像地推，到后期和名人经纪公司签约，都非常明智。\n\n**社区扩张：平衡项目方、老社区和新社区的关系**\n\n在向外扩展上，YugaLabs还很好的处理了项目方和社区的关系。不同于拘泥于“去中心化”、“自组织”这些字眼上、非常拧巴的团队，YugaLabs将自己和社区的关系视为一种利益共同体。他们都有相同的目标：抬高BAYC的地板价，让BAYC成为PFP NFT中最伟大的项目，持有BAYC的人成为NFT社区中的核心圈层。\n\n当进入元宇宙的人越来越多，BAYC的地板价涨至30-40ETH时，YugaLabs决定增发项目来创收，并扩大社区。方式是：荷兰式拍卖一万个MAYC，再给BAYC的持有者空投一万瓶变异药水。此举非常明智：这让新进持有者进入了NFT OG们的圈层（如不给BAYC空投，则新人无法和OG一个社区），又维护了原社区的利益。\n\n很多人抨击YugaLabs向Web2倾斜过多，脱离了社区。我只能通过帮助大家回顾这些历史，来证明YugaLabs的社区运营其实有多么强大。买过YugaLabs发行出来的NFT的社区成员，几乎没有后悔的。事实上，也只有有如此强大的Web3社区和文化，YugaLabs才有底气去撬动Web2世界的杠杆。\n\n在成为最强大的PFP之后，YugaLabs依然没有停下它扩张的脚步。它像罗马人那样敢于进攻，不满于在拉丁世界称雄，而是要建立起一个帝国。于是又有了Deck里的Ape计划，要发行土地项目。其攻击的目标不再是CryptoPunks（已经被它纳入到自己的版图之下），而是Sandbox和Decentraland。\n\n**YugaLabs Deck：不留活路的震撼**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NT5T2HC3XNtA2c3Fpawgf?height=518&width=924)\n\n3月18日前后，YugaLabs的融资Deck在网络上疯狂流传。90页的Deck，七八十页都在凡尔赛，剩下几页都指向了一个目标：配置团队，继续进攻。\n\n**团队配置**\n\n不同于很多Web3创业团队，YugaLabs已经完成了自己和Web2的融合，并且基本完成了顶层团队的构建。除了来自Web3的原来四位创始人外，其他高管分别是：合伙人Guy Oseary是U2和麦当娜经纪公司的创始人；CEO Nicole Muniz有过长达十年的互联网营销经验，客户包括Google、Nick、HBO等。\n\n首席运营官Jasmin Shoemaker有着长达15年的运营增长经验，运营对象包括苹果和Facebook等；首席创意官Patrick Ehrlund有过15年的品牌经验（尤其是Storytelling，难怪成就了这么强的Deck…），客户包括HBO、Kanye、Google等。从配置上看，这是一个横跨硅谷互联网巨头和美国时尚界、重营销运营的配置。\n\n很多人都被Crypto Native的口号给迷惑了。殊不知，即便进入Web3，元宇宙最重要的资产仍然是流量。从这个角度，Web3和Web2融合是大势所趋。不必脸红说Web3的从业者渴求Web2的流量，迫切需要借助Web2扩展自己的品牌，改善自己的产品体验。一天到晚鼓吹生产关系变革只是空投，长期只会让人疲倦。\n\nYugaLabs从Web3的母体中生长出来，先人一步构建了自己强大的横跨Web3和Web2的团队，并完成了来自Web2世界和Web3世界的资本站队和资源融合。这是一个极大的先发优势，领先了其他NFT蓝筹团队至少一年。这意味着YogaLabs在接下来一年不会有与自己抗衡的对手，那么我们来看看这一年他们计划做什么。\n\n**目标：统一元宇宙！**\n\n是的你没有看错，YugaLabs的计划是统一元宇宙。说实话当我看到这里的时候我被震撼了。大家都以为元宇宙才刚刚开始，还有那么多人根本就没有踏进元宇宙的大门，很多创作者连PFP是什么都不知道，YugaLabs就要统一元宇宙了？开什么国际玩笑？看看YugaLabs是怎么说的吧。\n\nYugaLabs首先喷了土地类NFT项目，指出MMO早已有之，Decentraland和Sandbox一点都不让人Exciting（亏DCL还有那么高的估值），不是人们想要的元宇宙。紧接着又喷了PFP，指出所有的项目方都想搭建自己的元宇宙，并且不互联互通，这不是未来。Deck里甚至都没有提到AXS这样的游戏，因为根本没有体验。\n\nYugalabs认为，真正的元宇宙要有能让人着迷并愿意参与的故事；人们能找到目标并下注，做出重要决定；人与人之间可产生紧密联系。而YugaLabs的优势在于他们建立的令人艳羡的Web3文化、强大的社区和影响力。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vPR8GgIloZpNQVun43mg8?height=518&width=924)\n\nOpensea去年交易量增加了600倍，日均交易额超过1.5亿美金，其中10%由BAYC贡献。\n\n**前所未有的虚拟游戏**\n\n基于此，YugaLabs将建立一个和DCL以及Sandbox完全不同的虚拟游戏。它有故事和文化；开放（允许用户带着其他的PFP形象接入，或者创作游戏内资产）；为开发者提供SDK（让他们能够基于该平台创作游戏）；土地可与真实世界的土地结合（这似乎结合了最新元宇宙项目Dropp的故事，是前所未有的）。\n\n很多人指责BAYC系列资产价格太贵，普通人无法参与，社区太小。那么，20万块元宇宙土地构建的社区总足够大了吧（超过了Sandbox）。此外，这些土地可与真实世界产生联系。考虑到YugaLabs公布的团队成员有来自Oculus的，并且看他们在2022年将投入3700万美金进行产品和技术研发，游戏体验值得期待。\n\n用YugaLabs的话说，这种游戏是前所未有的。如果成功的话，它能够实现现实世界和虚拟世界的联动、Web3所有PFP项目的联动、Web2品牌和Web3世界的联动，这种全新的体验和来自两个世界的强大共识将早就一个统一体：被所有人认可的元宇宙空间。就这样，DCL、Sandbox会成为过去式。\n\n**威胁OpenSea**\n\n甚至，YugaLabs还计划搭建一个体系内的交易平台。我个人认为这会是对Opensea的真正威胁。Ape宇宙里将产生大量的UGC内容，这些内容的首选交易平台将不再是Opensea。根据历史经验，交易所的兴起往往伴随着大量的财富效应，而YugaLabs本身就是财富的代名词，他们有这样的潜力。\n\n在这种情况下，Ape也将成为许多游戏的通用代币。现在大家可以想想YugaLabs讲了一个多大的故事：干掉DCL和Sandbox，统一所有的PFP元宇宙，打通虚拟和现实的连接入口，威胁Opensea。YugaLabs去年赚了1.3亿美金，今年计划赚4.6亿美金。这一轮估值50亿美金完全不贵，手里最不缺的就是钱和资源。\n\n最后我们来思考几个问题：你更愿意花钱买3700万美金制作出来的NFT，还是10万块钱制作出来的NFT？反过来也可以问：接下来中小创作者在NFT市场的机会是什么（是去Ape宇宙UGC被官方扶持吗）？接下来的NFT市场会往哪里走？\n\n**Web3的罗马帝国是怎么兴起的？**\n\n让我们来回顾YugaLabs的兴起与扩张之路，看看一个Web3的罗马式怎么兴起的。\n\n首先，YugaLabs看到了Web3新贵钱多、无法被Web2文化商品满足的市场空白，通过发售10k NFT初步建立了社区；社区建立后，YugaLabs组织社区在Twitter上发动攻势，通过头像地推和线下活动扩大共识；之后，又联合Web2名人和知名品牌，变成了Web2世界认知Web3的门面，以及Web3中昂贵的超级蓝筹。\n\n至此，YugaLabs仍未停下扩张的脚步，开始增发NFT扩张社区，没有给酷猫等项目留太多机会。等到BAYC、MAYC、BAKC圈层构建完成后，YugaLabs又兼并了CryptoPunks和Meebits等OG项目，将全球最顶级的几个Web3 IP都收入麾下。这时，在PFP领域已经找不到能够和YugaLabs站在一个量级的对手了。即便如此，YugaLabs还是没有停止扩张——在集中PFP领域的头部共识后，最终向土地进发。\n\n这个过程第一步是有社区（虽然质量不高），第二部是洗社区（洗掉认知不够的，换成名人和web3中高认知的人），第三步是在保护既有社区利益的前提下扩展社区，第四步是兼并其他OG项目形成项目的外围。这样核心、次核心、再次核心、外围的整体布局就形成了。\n\n这个架构在某些方面也与罗马类似：罗马皇帝（YugaLabs）、贵族或元老院（BAYC）、保民官等其他（MAYC）、公民（BAKC）、行省（CryptoPunks、Meebits等）。这是一个Web3 IP的帝国，帝国的成员都是利益共同体。这种关系非常复杂，但YugaLabs做的很好，能把他们团结起来去实现更大的目标，确实有很多可学之处。\n\n**结论：保持进攻！**\n\n最后我想总结几个从YugaLabs身上产生的感悟：\n\n首先，Web3需要有自己的文化，并且一定会产生自己的文化代表，这是Web2的大厂无论如何都产生不了的（参见YugaLabs的Deck：我们有令他们嫉妒的文化）。\n\n其次，这种文化符号标志一经确立必定值钱。Web3有钱，想要购买符合自己身份和立场的文化商品；Web2无法产生这种文化商品，但为了不落后于时代，他们非常愿意和这种文化符号做结合（参考阿迪达斯、耐克等）。\n\n其三，YugaLab聪明地利用了Web3世界和Web2世界两边对Web3文化的需要，撬动了两边杠杆，于是疯狂扩张，加速成功。\n\n其四，由于金融属性较强，Web3文明生来就有寻求扩张的倾向，求稳定的NFT项目方被强势的项目方吞并或者走向沉寂是必然（例如YugaLabs吃掉CryptoPunk）。\n\n其五，社区是由人构成的，他们希望跟随能够带领他们赚钱并且取得胜利的领导者，这是所有要调动社区的人必须认识到的。\n\n基于以上，我们的最终结论只有一个，那就是像罗马人那样无所畏惧，保持进攻！\n\n\\*\\*注：\\*\\*这篇文章由Crypto领域KOL@Diana19959295的两条推文合并而成。",

{"id": "ulqc1ZBrGkWJ_I7AOECXGFu0vjzTd6UL7KbKoBpkqAI", "title": "Zhang Yu's interpretation of the government work report: a six sentence summary and five perspectives", "body": "Opinion leader Zhang Yu\n\nThe goal is extraordinary\n\nFirst, 5.5% itself is extraordinary. The growth target of about 5.5% is higher than the general expectation of the society, which confirms our thinking from the 2021 annual report to now. Under the dual pressure of employment pressure (tens of millions of fresh graduates) and China US racing (this year or the closest year of China US economic growth in 30 years), steady growth this year is not only an economic demand, but also a strategic demand.\n\nSecond, the direction of 5.5% is extraordinary. It is the first time in the past decade that the growth target is higher than the economic growth rate in the fourth quarter of the previous year. In other words, since the economic trend fell in 2012, this year is the first time to “counter the trend” to determine the economic growth target upward.\n\nFiscal policy has two puzzling surprises. First, in terms of financial resources, debt reduction and tax reduction were reduced, the deficit ratio and deficit amount were reduced, and the tax reduction and tax rebate exceeded the expectation to reach 2.5 trillion (equivalent to the scale of tax reduction and fee reduction in 2020). Second, in terms of fiscal expenditure, the scale of fiscal expenditure increased more than expected, more than 2 trillion more than last year, a record high (except for the adjustment of caliber in 2015). The next question is, what will make up for this year’s fiscal revenue and expenditure gap (the first account)? In addition to the normal deficit and income growth, three supplementary sources deserve attention.\n\nThe first is the fiscal surplus of the previous year. Among them, the excess revenue balance left by the central government last year for this year is about 0.3 trillion. The second is the balance of the budget stability adjustment fund of more than 0.1 trillion. The third is the profits handed over by specific state-owned financial institutions and franchise institutions in recent years according to law. Therefore, we can understand the statement made by Minister Liu Kun of the Ministry of Finance in an interview that “the amount of funds allocated by the central government to the general budget is equivalent to increasing the deficit rate by 1 percentage point”. The first and third are large.\n\nThis year’s assessment of fiscal strength is easy to take for granted. If we understand the above fiscal calculation, we should not look at the deficit ratio, We should look at the available financial resources of the final two accounts (in addition to deficit + special bonds, there are three large amounts of money other than “conventional” this year. The special bonds issued last year were used for nearly 1.5 trillion this year, the central local fiscal surplus last year was used for nearly trillion this year (including 0.3 trillion central surplus), and nearly trillion retained profits were paid from specific financial institutions and franchise institutions this year). In a word, the available financial resources have increased significantly this year, and the finance is in a state of increasing strength, which is not contradictory to the demand for steady growth.\n\nThe manufacturing industry is taken care of in every way, and the focus of many policies is to support the manufacturing industry. At the level of tax reduction, we will continue to implement the policy of tax reduction and fee reduction to support manufacturing, small and micro enterprises and individual industrial and commercial households, and increase the scope of reduction and exemption and expand the scope of application. At the level of VAT rebate, we will focus on supporting the manufacturing industry and comprehensively solve the problem of VAT rebate in manufacturing, scientific research and technical services, ecological environmental protection, electric power and gas, transportation and other industries. We expect that the manufacturing industry accounted for more than half of the VAT rebate of 1.5 trillion, with a scale of only 100 billion last year.\n\nAt the employment level, we will use 100 billion yuan unemployment insurance fund to support job stabilization and training, and accelerate the training of urgently needed talents for high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. At the level of industrial base reconstruction, enhance the core competitiveness of the manufacturing industry, start a number of industrial base reconstruction projects, promote the upgrading of traditional industries, accelerate the development of advanced manufacturing clusters, implement the national strategic emerging industry cluster project, and strive to cultivate “specialized and special new” enterprises. At the level of foreign investment, expand the scope of encouraging foreign investment, and support foreign investment in medium and high-end manufacturing, R & D, modern services and other fields. At the credit level, financial institutions were guided to increase medium - and long-term loans to the manufacturing industry. Last year, only the “proportion” of manufacturing loans was raised. In fact, the increase of the proportion of manufacturing industry last year had a passive effect on the pressure drop of real estate credit. This year, the absolute amount increased. A little more flexible understanding means that as long as the manufacturing credit increased, the increase of real estate credit is acceptable.\n\nIn a word, the tax reduction and tax rebate of manufacturing industry are given priority, the talent training and transportation are also given priority, the supply side reform and industrial upgrading are also given priority, the guidance of foreign capital is also supported, and more credit money must be given.\n\nThe overall tone of real estate is in line with the rules, and there is only one sentence. In fact, for the capital market, the gradual relaxation of real estate and striving to reverse the downward trend is the visible policy direction. Therefore, no “bad news” is “good news”, which means that the relaxation of local real estate in the past month is tacit.\n\nThe mention of “implementing policies due to the city” is basically the subtext of the marginal loosening of real estate policy. Since the real estate has formed an obvious independent real estate small cycle at the national regional level and the first, second and third tier level, it is unrealistic to expect the relaxation of the general tone of the policy from top to bottom, because the implementation of urban policies is actually the subtext of flexibility and relaxation. In the government work report, the year of “implementing policies due to the city” is often the year when the margin of real estate policy is loose. This year is the year. (in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022 and 2017, although the first line was tightened, the monetization of the third and fourth line shed reform was still significantly promoted).\n\nThe understanding of “three stabilities” should be flexible. Although they are all expected to stabilize house prices and land prices, the meaning is flexible. Raising prices in overheated years is a signal of tightening, and raising prices in downward years is a signal of relaxation. 2021 is the former and this year is the latter.\n\nThe spread of real estate risk may be difficult to bear. The government work report makes it clear that a financial stability guarantee fund will be established this year to prevent and resolve risks. For this year, the biggest explicit risk is undoubtedly the cash flow pressure of private real estate enterprises. The establishment of the stability guarantee fund may also prepare a safety valve for some risks of real estate enterprises in advance.\n\nIn the government work report since 2015, the unit energy consumption has decreased only twice without mentioning the quantitative target - 2020 and this year. This year’s energy consumption is mainly coordinated with steady growth through scientific statistics, and two parts - raw material energy consumption and new renewable energy consumption are exempted from energy consumption statistics, so as to avoid the contradiction of power restriction and shutdown in the second half of 2021. On the basis of last year’s sports carbon reduction, we have clearly corrected the deviation, and made a soft treatment of “energy consumption constraints” for steady growth.\n\nThe keynote of the two sessions is very clear, steady growth and no tossing; The objectives of the two sessions are very clear, about 5.5%.", "timestamp": 1649009220, "digest": "BhvZhTPlSeYm9M30swxf0jnCb1m4Rws9pY6TqIMz0Mg", "contributor": "0xc159f513c787f8BF0Ec6EF1208b0eE36314c2064"}

With the system reminder, we don’t have to worry about missing the payment time, improve work efficiency and reduce work errors.” Zhang Mengyun is the deputy director of the asset Office of Hunan cancer hospital. The contract management of asset payment is her main work.\n\nZhang Mengyun’s contract management system, which makes the work more rigorous and easier, is an excellent case that enables Hunan cancer hospital to win the title of excellent unit in the activity of “economic management year of public medical institutions” in 2020-2021 selected by the National Health Commission and the national administration of traditional Chinese medicine, “building a contract life cycle management system, from making up for the lost sheep to strategizing”.\n\nDevise strategies for the contract life cycle management system to create “fist products”\n\nUnder the background of the information age, medical institutions are facing the transformation to digital hospitals with diagnosis and treatment information and management information. On November 13, 2019, the smart contract information system of Hunan cancer hospital was launched. The system realizes seven functions, including contract content digitization, format standardization, process efficiency, progress visualization, link simplification, upload synchronization and information accuracy.\n\n“The development of hospitals urgently needs to seek benefits from high-quality management. Taking improving quality and efficiency as the main line, we should change the current situation of emphasizing business over management and improve the overall level of unit economic management. The requirements of hospitals for contract management information system are very complex, and the system used by enterprises now can not meet our requirements.” Liu Chenhui, director of the Finance Department of Hunan Cancer Hospital, told us that in order to make the common development of medical management and economic management, the finance department will integrate the daily work experience with the concept of modern enterprise management and independently develop the smart contract information system for two years. This system is in a leading position in the national medical and health units.\n\nNonstandard contract format, no trace of OA approval and modification, many contract approval links, low efficiency of back and forth submission for approval, and no record of contract execution… These problems have been solved through the smart contract information system.\n\n“As the fulcrum of the internal control system, the smart contract information system runs through the implementation and supervision of economic activities with the contents of the contract, regulates economic activities in accordance with laws and regulations, and makes the project implementation and project management clear.” Xiao Yaya, President of Hunan Cancer Hospital, said, “the smart contract information system conforms to the development trend of building a smart hospital, promotes the intelligent, standardized, legalized, refined and efficient construction of hospital office, and reduces the waste of resources, time and manpower.”\n\nInnovating economic management mode to help hospitals develop with high quality\n\nIn 2020, taking the opportunity of the National Health Commission’s economic management year, Hunan Cancer Hospital accelerated the filling of weaknesses, consolidated the foundation, innovated economic management and made every effort to build a smart hospital.\n\nFrom the three dimensions of “smart medical treatment” for medical staff, “smart service” for patients and “smart management” for hospital management, the smart hospital project has realized “one machine in hand, go all over the hospital”, seamless connection of all medical processes, interconnection with the information system in the hospital, and full coverage before, during and after diagnosis, A new medical service format of early diagnosis and treatment of cancer has been established.\n\nTalking about “intelligent management” for hospital management, Xiao Yaya said: “the hospital is committed to the deep combination of artificial intelligence and hospital operation management through the use of digital technology, the establishment of business operation, the construction of ten systems such as comprehensive budget management system, full cost accounting system and price and medical insurance management system, and the coordination of economic management and business management.”\n\nThe ultimate goal of Hunan cancer hospital is to further promote the construction of medical insurance settlement, drug supply and circulation, medical consortium, Internet nursing, performance management and comprehensive supervision, further improve the ability of Internet hospitals to benefit and facilitate the people, and make the construction of smart hospitals more scientific and accurate.", "timestamp": 1649009486, "digest": "uBVK7luPDLhOP-ktmYHQHlN_narkdGBSpGfTasVHOD0", "contributor": "0x65322ebbe91A8088939382f568d857CB8d278f89"}
{"id": "tt17ayOVaXtTQmFb_c329M0S_C7Uqpdn0v09u2ktihs", "title": "Xue Hongyan: the two sessions grew steadily, and a shares were \"red\" in March?", "body": "Article / opinion leader columnist Xue Hongyan\n\nAs expected, the government work report released over the weekend reiterated “steady growth”, defined the annual GDP growth target of 5.5%, put forward practical requirements in terms of wide currency, wide credit and stable real estate expectations, responded to market concerns and stabilized market confidence.\n\nAfter the second confirmation of the steady growth policy in the government work report, the spring market expected by investors is expected to come, and the A-share market in March is worth looking forward to.\n\nReason analysis: Why did a shares fall since the beginning of the year?\n\nAs early as after the central economic work conference in December 2021, the tone of steady growth has been determined, and the steady growth sector has also ushered in a wave of market. However, in the first two months of the year, the market was basically in a data vacuum, and the steady growth policy was lack of data verification. In addition, affected by factors such as the downturn in real estate sales, the expectation of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the steady growth market since the beginning of the year was mostly the valuation repair after the policy bottomed out, but not the big reversal expected by the market did not appear, Affected by the adjustment of the growth sector with a large increase in the early stage, the overall A-share has still a downward trend since the beginning of the year, and the restless market in spring expected by the market has not come yet.\n\nThe core reason lies in the increase of uncertain factors. Instead of reaching an agreed optimistic expectation, the market is dominated by pessimism and the downward trend remains unchanged. Through the positive feedback cycle of capital, the micro liquidity of A-share market has deteriorated, and the adjustment range has greatly exceeded expectations.\n\n 1. Real estate sales have not recovered, and the fundamentals lack strong support\n 2. Since the beginning of the year, many places have issued real estate deregulation policies, which are involved in purchase restriction, loan restriction, land supply, price control and other aspects, which has boosted market confidence to a certain extent. However, according to the feedback data from various places, the current real estate industry has not yet come out of the decline, which is reflected in the weak demand of residents for house purchase, the low enthusiasm of real estate enterprises to acquire land, the land transaction area Premium rates are at the lowest level in the same period in recent five years.\n 3. As a pillar industry in the old economy, the upstream of real estate corresponds to the local land revenue and building materials industry chain, and the downstream corresponds to the consumption demand of home appliances, which is indispensable in the policy combination of steady growth. Therefore, although major infrastructure projects have been introduced one after another, in a sense, the market is still waiting for the recovery of real estate data to confirm the effect of the steady growth policy, while the real estate data in the first two months have not recovered, affecting the market’s consistent expectation of the steady growth effect.\n 4. In this context, at least for the first two months of 2022, the steady growth line failed to dominate the A-share market.\n 5. 2. The adjustment of growth sector intensifies pessimism and the market micro liquidity deteriorates\n 6. In 2022, the hot track with good profit-making effect last year ushered in the pressure of institutional position change, which led to the rapid decline of the track plate in the short term, which led to the withdrawal of the net fund value of heavy track stocks and the profit stopping and selling of Jimin, which in turn accelerated the speed of plate adjustment. At this time, due to the lack of consensus expectations in the market and the limited bottom effect of new funds, the adjustment of the track plate soon exacerbated the market pessimism, and then amplified the negative impact of factors such as the Fed’s interest rate hike, the downturn in real estate sales and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, forming a positive feedback cycle.\n 7. The result is that the decline is driven by the decline. Due to the influence of factors such as private equity fund control withdrawal and quantitative fund selling, the micro liquidity of the market continues to deteriorate, the newly issued share of the fund is significantly lower than that of the same period last year, the raising speed slows down, the market enters the bottom grinding stage, and the market sentiment is low.\n 8. Valuation digestion and expected changes\n 9. At present, things are changing.\n10. 1. With the continuous digestion of valuation, the market as a whole is more attractive\n11. The market has always been viewed dialectically. Adjustment is frustrating, but to a certain extent, it will lay the foundation for the best. Historically, the rise after the fall has always been the most reassuring. As of March 4, 2022, the dynamic P / E ratio of wind CSI 300 has been adjusted to 13.04 times, taking the reciprocal as 7.67%, which is significantly higher than the yield level of ten-year Treasury bonds, and has long-term allocation attraction.\n12. From the perspective of valuation quantile, taking the total market value as the weight, from the end of 2014 to March 4, 2022, the current price earnings ratio of wandequan A is 34%, that is, the valuation level is lower than 66% since the end of 2014. In terms of industries, except for food and beverage (66%), public utilities (58%), automobile (54%) and power equipment (50%), the P / E ratio of all other industries is within 50%, including high boom sectors such as electronics, computer, national defense and military industry and communication.\n13. It should be said that from the perspective of medium and long-term holding, the current A-share market has been highly attractive.\n14. 2. The two sessions reaffirmed steady growth and restored market confidence\n15. Infrastructure and real estate are two major suck for steady growth. Since the beginning of the year, local governments have responded to the policy call and moved forward the infrastructure projects, and have announced a series of major projects. The current market is concerned about the steady growth. This is not the problem of infrastructure construction, but mainly because of the lack of real estate data, whether it is sales of new houses, land auctions or new housing starts. We still can’t see the data that excites the market.\n16. In terms of the real estate market, restricted by factors such as the decline of economic growth, the aging of population structure and the slowdown of urbanization, the medium and long-term trend is undoubtedly downward; However, in terms of short-term trend, even if the investment house purchase is removed (investment house purchase has been suppressed under the shock of real estate tax), only the demand for rigid and improved housing is still enough to support the house prices in major cities. Therefore, in the short term, as long as the loan and purchase restriction policies for rigid demand and improved demand are gradually relaxed, and the detailed rules of real estate tax are further clarified to reasonably guide market expectations, it is not a problem to reverse the decline of the real estate market.\n17. During this period, the local level continued to introduce real estate relaxation policies, but due to the lack of clear support from the central level, the market is still on the sidelines and expectations have not been reversed. The government work report once again reiterated that “we will support the commercial housing market to better meet the reasonable housing needs of buyers, stabilize land prices, house prices and expectations, and promote the virtuous cycle and healthy development of the real estate industry due to urban policies”. It is expected that the real estate easing policy will still be issued after the two sessions, so as to reverse the declining real estate market and market expectations.\n18.

It plans to raise 1.03 billion yuan for high-speed optical module product line expansion and upgrading construction projects, optical transmission subsystem platform R & D projects and supplementary working capital. Guotai Junan acts as the sponsor and lead underwriter. According to the official website of Shanghai Stock Exchange, dekeli will hold the meeting on March 9.\n\nIt is worth noting that dekeli, who began to submit IPO applications in October last year, was sued by Jiangsu torch, the controlling shareholder of Hongtu microelectronics, a joint-stock company, in the same month. Jiangsu torch said that dekeli’s investment in Hongtu microelectronics in 2012 may have the situation of capital withdrawal, and asked dekeli to bear the liability for breach of contract that damages the interests of shareholders and compensate for the loss of 28.28 million yuan and relevant litigation fees and preservation fees.\n\nThis has aroused the focus of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The Shanghai Stock Exchange asked dekeli to explain the specific assets involved in the case for capital contribution, whether it involves the company’s main assets and core technology, and whether the issuer will be fined by the competent administrative authority and whether it constitutes a major violation of laws and regulations if it is found to constitute capital withdrawal.\n\nAs disclosed in the prospectus, the case is still under trial, but it has caused dekeli to freeze 30 million yuan. This undoubtedly adds another unfavorable factor to dekeli, whose net cash flow from operating activities has been negative for four consecutive years.\n\nDekeli’s IPO is still in doubt. On the one hand, in terms of capital operation, dekeli’s controlling shares have been replaced for many times. ZTE, one of the founders and the former controlling shareholder, is now the company’s largest customer. At the same time, the company paid a surprise dividend of 80 million when the net cash flow from operating activities continued to be negative one year before submitting the IPO application. On the other hand, in terms of the company’s operation, dekeli still has some problems, such as dependence on large customers, high accounts receivable, pressure on operating capacity and so on.\n\nThe former controlling shareholder is now the largest customer, with a surprise dividend of RMB 80 million before IPO\n\nDekeli, founded in 2000, focuses on optical and electronic devices. Its main business covers the R & D, production and sales of optical transceiver modules, optical amplifiers and optical transmission subsystems. Its products are applied to communication trunk transmission, 5g forward transmission, 5g medium return transmission, data link acquisition, data center interconnection, UHV communication protection and other fields.\n\nThe optoelectronic device industry is in the middle of the optical communication industry chain, and its performance is affected by the downstream 5g market and the demand of the end consumer market. In 2018-2020 and the first three quarters of 2021, the company’s operating revenue was 265 million yuan, 387 million yuan, 665 million yuan and 383 million yuan respectively, with a year-on-year change of 46.17% (2019) and 71.57% (2020). The net profit attributable to the parent company was 14 million yuan, 47 million yuan, 142 million yuan and 67 million yuan respectively, with a year-on-year change of 229.55% (2019) and 205.07% (2020).\n\nIt is worth noting that dekeli has changed its control right three times in the past decade. ZTE, one of the founders and the former controlling shareholder, transferred all 65% of its equity in the first change. ZTE was dekeli’s largest customer in 2018-2020 and the first half of 2021. ZTE contributed 43.22% of dekeli’s revenue in the first half of 2021.\n\nDekeli was formerly ZTE optoelectronics, which was jointly invested and operated by ZTE, Wu peichun and Wei Yuzhang in 1999. At the time of establishment, the equity structure was 65% invested by ZTE, 22% invested by Wu peichun and 13% invested by Wei Yu.\n\nIn October 2013, dekeli began to change its control right for the first time. ZTE transferred its 65% equity of ZTE optoelectronics to Zhongke Baiyun for 101 million yuan at a transfer price of 15.6 yuan / registered capital. At this time, the control right was changed from ZTE to Zhongke Baiyun.\n\nIn January 2016, Zhongke Baiyun and Zhongke venture capital transferred 51.85% and 27.92% equity of ZTE optoelectronics held by them to shuobaid holdings for 135 million yuan and 72 million yuan respectively, of which the transaction price of Zhongke Baiyun is 5.19 yuan / registered capital and that of Zhongke venture capital is 5.16 yuan / registered capital. At this time, the control right was changed from Zhongke Baiyun to shuobaid holdings, and the equity price of this change decreased significantly compared with the previous time.\n\nIn May 2019, shuobaid holdings transferred its 40.11% equity of dekeli Co., Ltd. to Tyco Lingke at a transaction price of RMB 112 million / registered capital. At this time, the control right was changed from shuobaid holdings to Tyco Lingke, and the transaction equity price increased slightly.\n\nAs of the disclosure date of the prospectus, dekeli’s equity structure is that Dongtai Keling branch, the largest shareholder, holds 33.91% of the company’s shares, Qian Mingying, the second largest shareholder, holds 14.9% of the company’s shares, and deduotai investment, the third largest shareholder, holds 7.51% of the company’s shares. There is no absolute controlling shareholder holding more than 51%, and the stability of dekeli’s controlling stake is in doubt due to the history of multiple changes of controlling stake.\n\nAfter ZTE withdrew its shares, it did not cut off its contact with dekeli and became its largest customer. In recent years, dekeli’s dependence on ZTE, a single major shareholder, has increased. From 2018 to 2020 and the first half of 2021, ZTE contributed 96 million yuan, 215 million yuan, 365 million yuan and 166 million yuan of sales revenue to dekeli, accounting for 36.27%, 55.59%, 54.94% and 43.22% of operating revenue.\n\nIn the same period, the sales amount of dekeli’s top five customers was 185 million yuan, 272 million yuan, 474 million yuan and 244 million yuan respectively, accounting for 69.77%, 70.17%, 71.34% and 63.65% of the operating revenue respectively, with high customer concentration.\n\nIt is worth noting that dekeli, whose net cash flow from operating activities has been negative for four consecutive years, paid a surprise dividend of 80 million yuan the year before applying for IPO, while it did not pay dividends in 2018 and 2019.\n\nPressure on operating capacity\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020 and the first half of 2021, the net cash flow from operating activities of dekeli was - 02 million yuan, - 52 million yuan, - 175 million yuan and - 30 million yuan respectively, which has been continuously", "timestamp": 1649009669, "digest": "QpCWDd9lXgVKoASn5gxSDwhc2FW2btlwzljb2nGxkGM", "contributor": "0x79904BEdEBAF62525CF58ae0E62d6C6372Fb5683"}

In addition, the number of enterprises that terminated registration (including non registration) in February also decreased significantly to 0 compared with 6 in January.\n\nIn terms of issuance and fund-raising, a total of 17 enterprises (by listing date, the same below) were successfully listed in February, raising a total of 20.649 billion yuan, down 81% from 109.238 billion yuan in January. This is mainly due to the Spring Festival holiday in February, less working days and less issuance. Moreover, in January, large enterprises such as China Mobile and Jingke energy were listed, and the fund-raising amounts of the two companies were 56 billion yuan and 10 billion yuan respectively.\n\nThe monthly meeting rate of gem hit a new low since the registration system\n\nIn January, a total of 26 A-share IPO companies attended the meeting, and 23 had passed the meeting, with an overall passing rate of 88.46%. By sector, the Beijing stock exchange has maintained a 100% attendance rate since its establishment; Main board 7 passes 6, and the passing rate is 83.33%; Science and technology innovation board 8, and the passing rate is 100%; The gem passed 7 in September, and the passing rate was only 77.78%, the lowest in a single month since the registration system.\n\nIn July 2020, the gem will test the water registration system. As of February 28, 2022, a total of 422 companies (data from wind, including the second meeting companies, the same below) proposed to IPO on the gem (under the registration system) had attended the meeting, and 403 had passed the meeting, with an overall passing rate of 95.5%.\n\nPreviously, the lowest monthly meeting rate of gem was in December 2021. In that month, 16 enterprises attended the meeting, 13 attended the meeting, 2 were rejected and 1 was cancelled. The monthly meeting rate was 81.25%.\n\nFrom July 2020 to November 2021, when the registration system was implemented, 382 enterprises attended the meeting under the gem registration system, and 368 passed the meeting, with a passing rate of 96.34%. From December 1, 2021 to the end of February 2022, a total of 40 enterprises on the gem attended the meeting, and 35 attended the meeting, with a passing rate of 87.5%. From December 2021 as the dividing point, the passing rate of GEM has an obvious downward trend.\n\nIn February, Hunan hi tech Fisheries Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as hi tech Asia) and hi tech Hong Kong Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as hi tech Asia) failed to pass the audit. Among them, the acceptance of Asian fishing ports is of wind vane significance, which conveys the firm determination of gem to focus on “three innovations and four innovations”.\n\nWhat is “three innovations and four innovations”? The measures for the administration of the registration of initial public offerings on the gem (for Trial Implementation) stipulates that an issuer applying for initial public offerings and listing on the gem shall meet the positioning of the gem. The gem thoroughly implements the innovation driven development strategy, adapts to the general trend of relying more on innovation, creation and creativity, mainly serves growth innovative and entrepreneurial enterprises, and supports the deep integration of traditional industries with new technologies, new industries, new formats and new models.\n\nAccording to the prospectus, the main business of Asian fishing port is the R & D, sales and distribution services of standardized fresh catering ingredients. It is a brand supplier of fresh catering ingredients. The company’s main products and services are divided into: raw and fresh food products of deep-processing products and primary processing products, as well as warehousing and logistics services.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Asian fishing port is a processing plant for raw and fresh ingredients. Although the company’s statement in the prospectus is like clouds and rain, which is exaggerated, it can not change the essence of the company as a fresh processing plant. Investors use simple concepts to analyze, and the company does not belong to “three innovations and four innovations”.\n\nAt present, the compound growth rate of operating revenue and net profit of Asian fishing ports from 2018 to 2020 is negative, and the proportion of R & D expenses in operating revenue during the reporting period is 1.17%, 0.83%, 0.84% and 0.71% respectively. The four invention patents owned by the company were obtained in 2013, and the income of products related to invention patents accounted for 5.00%, 2.74%, 2.45% and 2.16% respectively. At present, the company only controls its own factories and some OEM manufacturers through z-network, but has not achieved the whole process control. The company mainly adopts outsourcing processing mode to carry out production.\n\nAt the review meeting on GEM, the municipal Party committee clearly required Asian fishing ports to explain whether the issuer’s specific embodiment of “three innovations and four innovations” conforms to the positioning of gem in combination with business model, business growth, innovation ability and R & D transformation ability.\n\nThe main reason for the rejection of Huanyang shares: doubts about the financial authenticity\n\nIn February, in addition to the IPO failure of two companies on the gem, another rejected company was Ningbo Huanyang new materials Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Huanyang Co., Ltd.) from the main board. The main business of Huanyang Co., Ltd. is the R & D, production and sales of epichlorohydrin. The main product is epichlorohydrin, which accounts for more than 94% of the revenue, and the product structure is relatively single.\n\nThere are three major categories of issues raised by the CSRC on the IEC, involving independence and related party transactions, financial authenticity and sustainable profitability.\n\nAs for independence and related party transactions, Huanyang shares is related to Wanhua chlor alkali and Wanhua chemical. The CSRC requires Huanyang shares to explain: (1) the rationality of the free transfer of three patent application rights, whether there are other interest arrangements, and whether the issuer’s core technology is dependent on Wanhua chlor alkali; (2) Wanhua chlor alkali increased the capital of the issuer’s predecessor with the land use right, the reason and rationality of withdrawing soon after the capital increase, and the legality and compliance of the acquisition of the land use right; (3) The background and reasons why some indirect shareholders are employees of Wanhua chlor alkali and are held by Fang Fuliang; (4) The issuer’s purchase price of hydrogen chloride is significantly lower than the commercial rationality and sustainability of the third party. Is there any benefit transfer.\n\nWith regard to financial authenticity, the CSRC mainly focuses on Huanyang shares", "timestamp": 1649009892, "digest": "6yOOu-MwIS0JKRNQGqoazm6KKks_UaMPPJ0iMbhFjF8", "contributor": "0x5e7BE949312f48EB5592f29B7694DF90D49Bb7F8"}

Member units of aging committees at all levels should closely focus on their respective responsibilities, do a good job in the relevant connection after replacing the elderly card with the resident ID card, and introduce specific measures to ensure that the elderly can easily and quickly enjoy the relevant preferential treatment policies.\n\nThe implementation start date specified in the above notice is approaching. Can the elderly take the bus and subway free of charge with their ID card? On the morning of February 28, the reporter came to the martyr park east station of Changsha Metro Line 3 and asked the staff of the subway customer service center for relevant information. According to the staff, since March 1, even if the elderly over 65 do not have an old-age card, they can pass through the green channel with their ID card and take the subway directly for free; Those who have handled the old-age certificate can continue to use the old-age certificate and take the subway free of charge. “The ID cards of passengers from other provinces have the same effect as those of passengers in the province. As long as the age meets the requirements, they can go through the green channel.” The staff member said.\n\ntwo\n\ntransit\n\nThe driver and hotline staff said they had not been notified\n\nOn the morning of February 28, the reporter took bus No. 143, 213 and 805 successively, and asked the bus driver about it.\n\n“I don’t know. I didn’t receive this notice.” “I haven’t heard of it. I have to ask the group for details.” “I haven’t heard from the company about this. I should still use love card or old-age certificate.” The above bus drivers said they didn’t know about it. Subsequently, the reporter called the hotline of Changsha Public Transport Group Co., Ltd., and its staff also said that they had not received the relevant notice of replacing the old-age card with ID card. According to the relevant regulations, why are the preparations of subway and bus operators different? The reporter learned that Changsha urban public transport affairs center is responsible for publicizing, implementing and implementing the guidelines, policies, laws and regulations of the state, Hunan Province and Changsha City on road passenger and freight transport and stations (yards), urban public passenger transport (including urban subway, rail transit, bus, taxi, etc.), motor vehicle maintenance, logistics market and so on. At about 2:40 p.m. on the 28th, the reporter asked the staff of the center about the content of the “notice”. The staff said that the “notice” was printed and distributed by provincial departments. It needs a process to be implemented and must be done step by step. “This matter is under discussion and has not been formally implemented.”\n\nthree\n\nAging Office\n\nForeigners enjoy preferential treatment in Changsha with their ID cards\n\n“The purpose of replacing the old-age card with ID card is to reduce the number of cards for the convenience of the people and make it easier for the elderly to enjoy the preferential treatment policy.” According to the staff of Changsha Aging office, after the Provincial Health Commission and the provincial Aging Office jointly issued the notice, the municipal Aging office has transmitted the notice to the member units of the municipal Aging Committee such as the Municipal Bureau of transportation and the Municipal Bureau of culture, tourism, radio, film and television, and the above units have also received the notice. Previously, when the elderly used the elderly card in their daily life, it was mainly used for taking buses, subways and tourism. The above staff members said that in accordance with the relevant provisions, the implementation of the measures to replace the elderly card with ID card, the 65 year old man can enjoy the relevant preferential treatment policy in Changsha with the identity card, whether it is registered residence in Changsha or registered residence in or outside the province. According to the staff member, many of the tourist attractions in Changsha that were originally free for the elderly over the age of 65 had been allowed to enter free with their ID cards before. The transportation department will also hold a meeting to discuss specific implementation measures according to the contents of the above notice. “It’s inconvenient to operate if the bus driver checks the ID cards of the elderly to determine their age.” The staff believes that a more convenient measure is to add an identification module to read the age information of the ID card on the bus card swiping equipment, and the addition of the module not only takes a certain time, but also needs to be authorized by the public security department to read the ID card information. The reporter learned that since July 15 last year, Liuyang has successively installed smart card swiping machines on buses, and the elderly can swipe their ID card directly for free. Shenzhen, Guangdong, Jining, Shandong, Tongling, Anhui and other places have also implemented the practice of swiping ID cards for the elderly to take buses free of charge.

Can stock incentive save performance", "body": "Stock speculation depends on the Research Report of Jinqilin analyst. It is authoritative, professional, timely and comprehensive to help you tap the potential theme opportunities!\n\nProduced by: Sina Finance listed company Research Institute\n\nIn 2020, the epidemic accelerated the development of the compound condiment industry, but only one year later, the performance of the leading companies in the industry began to decline sharply.\n\nYihai international, one of the top 3 hot pot seasonings, saw its net profit decline by nearly 13% in the first half of 2021. Another Tianwei food company recently disclosed its performance forecast and realized a revenue of 2.026 billion yuan in 2021, a year-on-year decrease of 14%; The net profit was 179 million yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 51%.\n\nThe direct reason for the decline in the performance of Tianwei food is the pressure on goods in the rapidly expanding channel. In 2020, the revenue of Tianwei food showed a high growth of 37%, behind which was the large expansion of the company’s dealer team, which caused serious channel pressure. Since the second quarter of 2021, Tianwei has entered the de channel inventory cycle.\n\nAfter the rapid expansion of Tianwei food, the dyspepsia channel pressed the goods, resulting in the decline of performance in 2021\n\nAt the end of February, Tianwei food launched a stock incentive plan, which plans to grant 11.97 million shares to incentive objects, accounting for 1.59% of the total share capital of the company. The total number of incentive objects is 237, including current directors, senior managers, middle managers and technical backbones.\n\nAmong them, three vice presidents, Yu Zhiyong, Wu Xuejun, Shen Songlin and he Changjun, the board secretary, were awarded 330000 shares, 380000 shares, 300000 shares and 300000 shares respectively. As of March 3, the share price of Tianwei food was 21.42 yuan and the granted price was 10.96 yuan. According to the market price, the per capita floating profit of the four executives exceeded 3 million.\n\nThe performance assessment objective is that the revenue growth rate in 2022 shall not be less than 15%, and that in 2023 shall not be less than 15%. From 2015 to 2020, the compound annual growth rate of Tianwei food’s operating revenue is 22%, compared with the growth target of 15%, which is not high. The corresponding revenue in 2022 is 2.33 billion yuan, which has not reached the level in 2020.\n\nThe stock incentive plan was launched against the background of the sharp decline in the performance of Tianwei food.\n\nAccording to the performance forecast disclosed by Tianwei food at the end of January, the annual revenue decreased by 14%, the net profit attributable to the parent decreased by 51%, and the net profit deducted from non net profit decreased by 62%.\n\nThe sharp decline in the revenue of Tianwei food is related to the previous channel pressure on goods. In 2020, Tianwei food carried out a round of dealer system reform to accelerate investment. By the end of 2019, the number of cooperative dealers was 1221, and by the end of 2020, it had expanded to 3001, which led to a high growth of 37% in revenue in 2020, of which the channel sales revenue of dealers increased by 40%, and the direct consequence was the high channel inventory.\n\nIn 2021, Tianwei food began to clear its inventory through channels, and the channel sales revenue of dealers in the first three quarters decreased by 15% year-on-year, which is the direct reason for the decline of the company’s revenue.\n\nLooking at the revenue growth of Tianwei food by quarter, the revenue growth of Tianwei food increased by 56% in the first quarter of 2021, and increased by - 15%, - 37% and - 25% respectively in the second, third and fourth quarters. The de channel inventory from the second quarter continued to the fourth quarter.\n\nAt the same time, the company invested a lot of sales expenses in market development and advertising. In the institutional research in November 2021, the management said that the company was “moderately increasing sales personnel, strengthening the training of sales personnel and dealers, and improving capacity”. In the first three quarters of 2021, the sales cost of Tianwei food was 326 million yuan, an increase of 41% year-on-year.\n\nThe rising cost of raw materials has reduced the gross profit margin, and its comprehensive gross profit margin has decreased from 41% in 2020 to 34% in the first three quarters of 2021. The sharp increase in sales staff salaries, advertising fees and channel promotion fees has reduced the company’s net profit margin. In the first three quarters of 2021, the net interest rate of Tianwei food was only 5.73%, compared with 21% in the same period last year. This together led to a sharp decline in the company’s performance last year.\n\nIndustry competition intensifies. When will Tianwei food usher in an inflection point?\n\nFrom the perspective of the industry, the compound condiment industry experienced the problems of intensified industry competition and rising raw material costs in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, under the catalysis of the epidemic, a large number of competitors poured into the track of compound seasoning, including both traditional condiment enterprises, such as Haitian flavor industry and Zhongju high tech, as well as catering enterprises, such as Dezhuang, Dalong, Xiabu, Xiabu, etc.\n\nAccording to the condiment investment and financing data report in the first half of 2021 launched by enterprise investigation and the big data information center of China condiment Association, there were six condiment brand financing events in the first half of 2021 alone, with a disclosure amount of more than 140 million yuan. Gaoling and IDG stand behind the “added taste” of financing, while another “Meixin food” is invested by Jinding capital.\n\nOn the one hand, a large number of new competitors have entered the game. On the other hand, existing players are still expanding their categories. For example, Haitian flavor industry expanded its product line to 9 products in 2021 after launching 2 hot pot seasoning products in 2020. Yihai international has developed 17 new products in the first half of 2021. The capacity expansion projects of various companies have also been put into operation, and the supply has expanded rapidly.\n\nIn this case, the performance growth rate of relevant listed companies declined to varying degrees in 2021. Yihai International’s revenue growth in the first half of 2021 decreased from 34% of the previous year to 19%; The annual revenue of Tianwei food fell by 14%.\n\nIn terms of revenue structure, compared with the same period in 2020, Tianwei food’s hot pot seasoning revenue decreased by 19% and dish seasoning revenue decreased by nearly 4% in the first three quarters of 2021. These two types of products account for the largest proportion of the company.\n\nFor compound condiment companies, the rise in the cost of raw materials is mainly due to the rise in the price of oil raw materials and packaging materials, which increases the cost to a certain extent and lowers the gross profit margin of relevant companies.\n\nIn view of the rising cost of raw materials, Tianwei food has raised the price of some products in the fourth quarter of 2021. In the institutional research in early November, the management of Tianwei food said that “in mid October, the company has raised the price of two products, and we are comprehensively sorting out other products.”\n\nIn the short term, the effect of the price increase will be reflected in 2022. To what extent will the price increase improve the performance and whether it will affect the sales volume in turn is the most noteworthy question next", "timestamp": 1649010343, "digest": "Cp1H4MfIMTB25ZbjzXerXJdON8tAiM-D3wKbEVYaBrw", "contributor": "0x2582c0822aDe54D48A08f44ceb05F57209A0828E"}

What is the intention of \"listing without financing\" between the two places?", "body": "Stock speculation depends on the Research Report of Jinqilin analyst. It is authoritative, professional, timely and comprehensive to help you tap the potential theme opportunities!\n\nProduced by: Sina Finance listed company Research Institute\n\nOn March 1, Weilai automobile updated its sales data. In February this year, the company delivered 6131 electric vehicles, with a year-on-year increase of 9.91% and a month on month decrease of 36.48%; From January to February, 15783 vehicles were delivered, with a year-on-year increase of 23.3%. According to the currently released sales data, Weilai’s sales ranking in the first two months has fallen out of the top three and was surpassed by the second-line brand Nezha.\n\nWhile sales “fell behind”, Weilai automobile was busy with capital operation. According to the news on February 28, Weilai has passed the hearing of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and obtained the approval for the secondary listing on the main board of the Hong Kong stock exchange. It will carry out the Hong Kong stock IPO by “introducing the listing”, that is, it does not involve the issuance of new shares and fund-raising.\n\nIn addition, the public information also shows that Weilai has applied for the second listing by introduction on the main board of the new stock exchange, and the new stock exchange is reviewing the application on the last practical date In other words, in addition to US stocks and Hong Kong stocks to be listed soon, Weilai will also be listed in Singapore and will become the first auto enterprise to be listed in three places.\n\nWhat is the mystery behind the “Sao operation” of Weilai’s continuous listing without financing, which puzzles the market. However, the latest operation of the company may reflect “Wei Lai’s anxiety about the future” to a certain extent.\n\nIs sales lagging behind a capacity bottleneck or a positioning problem?\n\nOn the first day of March, several domestic new forces successively released the sales volume in February. Excluding the influence of the Spring Festival disturbance, the cumulative sales volume in January and February is more convincing for measuring the cold and hot start of each car enterprise in 2022.\n\nSales volume of domestic new forces in January and February\n\nStatistics show that from January to February this year, the cumulative sales of ideal, Xiaopeng and Nezha ranked among the top three, and there is little difference in sales. Weilai automobile has sold less than 10000 vehicles in a single month for two consecutive months, with a year-on-year increase of only 23% in the first two months. The growth rate is an order of magnitude higher than that of several other leading automobile enterprises.\n\nIn fact, the lag of Weilai’s sales volume did not start only this year, and there were already signs before.\n\nSina Finance and economics noted that in 2020, Weilai automobile delivered 43728 units in the whole year, accounting for 3.20% of the domestic sales of new energy vehicles that year; In 2021, the sales volume was 91429, accounting for 2.60% of the sales volume of domestic new energy vehicles in that year; In January this year, the sales volume was 9652, accounting for 2.24% of the domestic new energy vehicle sales in the same period.\n\nIt can be seen that the proportion of sales volume of Weilai shows a downward trend, and the market share is rapidly losing.\n\nAccording to the feedback from the market, Weilai has had a production capacity crisis since last year. The delivery of many models has to be delayed. Some car owners even have to wait 10 weeks after locking the order. Lack of core is considered to be the main reason for this phenomenon.\n\nHowever, it is also the overall lack of core in the industry. Why can the year-on-year growth rate of sales of other new forces and car enterprises such as BYD and gac-e’an reach 10 times that of Weilai automobile?\n\nSina Finance and economics learned that Weilai has always used the model of OEM to build cars. Although Jianghuai Automobile has expanded the annual production capacity of OEM Weilai automobile to 240000, due to the lack of core, the actual production capacity is only 10000 units per month.\n\nEven so, after the contract expired last year, the cooperation between Weilai and JAC continued to be extended until May 2024.\n\nIn contrast, Xiaopeng also initially chose the OEM mode. However, on the one hand, Xiaopeng is OEM through Haima automobile, on the other hand, he is also working hard to obtain production qualification and continuously expand his own production capacity.\n\nSince Xiaopeng’s self built capacity has begun to take shape, at the end of 2021, after the expiration of Haima automobile OEM contract, the two sides terminated the OEM cooperation.\n\nIn fact, in addition to the constraints of lack of core and self owned production capacity, Weilai’s high-end product positioning has also been questioned by the market.\n\nThe electric super run ep9 gave Wei Lai a high-profile start. After that, the first car es8 directly benchmarked the traditional luxury car brand BBA. Subsequently, the company launched ES6 and ec6 successively, hoping to continue to consolidate the positioning of high-end products.\n\nAccording to the car number data, in the middle of 2021, the average selling price of Weilai automobile is 433000 yuan, second only to Mercedes Benz (436000 yuan), and even higher than well-known brands such as Lexus (393000 yuan), BMW (391000 yuan), Lincoln (372000 yuan), Audi (322000 yuan).\n\nWith the increasingly fierce competition in the new energy vehicle market, whether Weilai’s high-end product positioning can continue to be recognized by consumers, the recent sales volume seems to have explained the problem.\n\nWhat is the intention of listing without financing?\n\nWeilai automobile has been listed in the Hong Kong market and Singapore market continuously through introduction, and the listing is not financed, which is considered to be the performance of “no lack of money”.\n\nAccording to the financial report, by the end of the third quarter of 2021, Weilai automobile had cash and equivalents of 21.59 billion yuan and other short-term investments of 21.71 billion yuan, totaling 43.3 billion yuan, higher than the short-term and long-term loans of 16.7 billion yuan in the same period.\n\nHowever, can the net cash of more than 20 billion explain that Weilai is “not bad for money”?\n\nRough statistics show that from 2016 to 2021, Weilai’s financing from the capital market was 2.264 billion, 12.23 billion, 7.610 billion, 0 billion, 34.61 billion and 12.7 billion, totaling 69.414 billion yuan. With 7 billion yuan given by Hefei in 2020 and 2.4 billion US dollars before listing, the cumulative financing was about 90 billion yuan.\n\nAt the same time, from 2016 to 2020, Weilai’s losses were 3.5 billion, 7.6 billion, 23.3 billion, 11.4 billion and 5.6 billion. Weilai continued to lose 8.4 billion in the first three quarters of 2021. From 2016 to the end of the third quarter of 2021, Weilai’s cumulative losses reached 60 billion yuan.\n\nMore importantly, compared with peers, the high-end product positioning makes Weilai “lose more and lose more”.\n\nFrom 2018 to the third quarter of 2021, not only the net loss of Weilai automobile was significantly higher than that of Xiaopeng automobile and ideal automobile, but also its single vehicle loss was significantly higher than that of the above two peers.\n\nWith this speed of “burning money”, how long can Weilai car, which seems to be in no shortage of money, last? “Introduction and listing” in Hong Kong and Singapore", "timestamp": 1649010116, "digest": "yhbRnXXPiNbM72J2koduIWgIqiymgrg_h2Ako9BLWeY", "contributor": "0x6eE554587304c3EE3342E009C4CA87356d7420c4"}

Since becoming a member of the National Committee of the Chinese people’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Wang Guohai has closely followed the major themes of rural revitalization, economy and finance to make suggestions on senior management and administration. While speaking “Mandarin” well, he also speaks “Hunan dialect”, which has contributed to the economic and social development of Hunan.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, Wang Guohai was recommended as the judge of the national poverty alleviation Award for three consecutive years, and he was also the only judge in Hunan. During the selection period, appointed by the leading group for poverty alleviation and development of the State Council, as the leader of the grass-roots research group of the national poverty alleviation award, he led a team to investigate and investigate some candidates and projects in many places, and deeply participated in the comprehensive supervision and stage evaluation of the poverty alleviation battle.\n\nIn 2020, covid-19, Wang Guo Hai, took part in the initial evaluation, investigation and review of the new crown pneumonia, and completed the appraisal of the year of the year’s poverty reduction award, which witnessed the victory of tackling poverty.\n\nWhile serving as the “Examiner”, Wang Guohai is also a “respondent” for poverty alleviation. In October 2015, he led a team to the coral village in Ningxiang city to join in poverty alleviation, and identified the coral village as the targeted poverty alleviation base of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Zhigong party. Through various efforts, today’s coral village has not only won many honors such as provincial Tongxin beautiful village and municipal advanced village for targeted poverty alleviation, but also achieved full marks in the assessment of targeted poverty alleviation in Hunan Province in 2020.\n\nIn Wang Guohai’s view, only by going deep into the grass-roots front line and communicating with the masses can we find real problems and put forward targeted and effective suggestions, which can be regarded as “offering good policies” and “building truth”. At the beginning of 2021, Wang Guohai visited malanshan video cultural and Creative Industrial Park in Changsha for many times and submitted the proposal on strengthening “culture + science and technology” to help the disabled and popularizing the national common sign language. At the end of that year, the national disabled persons’ Federation replied to the proposal, saying that it would promote the standardization, informatization and scientific research of national general sign language into the “14th five year plan” of the National Language Commission and relevant national scientific research projects.\n\nDuring the two sessions this year, Wang Guohai carefully prepared seven proposals, which will focus on the in-depth economic and trade cooperation between China and Africa, helping small and medium-sized enterprises boost confidence, and promoting the transformation and upgrading of employment assistance workshops.", "timestamp": 1649010352, "digest": "af_AQFbWj2hxiEgyUdTXIFGlh7a33SrC4fZTHVkWZ0w", "contributor": "0xb59B9075be9F07BCa2267a4739c6FdDFBe9362C4"}

The domestic epidemic prevention and control is rigorous, and the market may not be optimistic", "body": "Stock speculation depends on the Research Report of Jinqilin analyst. It is authoritative, professional, timely and comprehensive to help you tap the potential theme opportunities!\n\nProduced by: Sina Finance listed company Research Institute\n\nIn March 4th, China’s pharmaceutical and health industry Limited by Share Ltd (hereinafter referred to as: Chinese Medicine) issued a notice that China had recently had a partnership with COVID-19, a multinational pharmaceutical company, and said that the relevant matters are being discussed in communication, and there is still uncertainty.\n\nThis basically confirms the previous market rumors that China Pharmaceutical and Pfizer are negotiating paxlovid domestic agency. Due to the Hong Kong epidemic and the expectation that the global new crown will coexist with mankind for a long time, China Pharmaceutical’s share price has continued to rise by the limit recently.\n\nHowever, we believe that the market prospect of paxlovid in China is not as optimistic as expected.\n\nPaxlovid --- the best new crown oral medicine at present\n\nAs COVID-19 will continue to rise with the expectation of mankind, the combination of “anti plus treatment” of influenza vaccine + oral game player will become one of the most important solutions.\n\nMolnupiravir of MSD: Although molnupiravir has been approved by the United Kingdom and the United States to be listed on the EUA, its treatment of mild to moderate new coronal patients can only reduce the hospitalization rate or mortality by 30%, which is about 50% lower than that in the interim analysis.\n\nCovid-19 Paxlovid: for non hospitalized new crown pneumonia adults, Paxlovid based on a randomized, double-blind, 3 stage trial data showed that PAXLOVID reduced the risk of any hospitalization or death by 89% for any reason that occurred within three days after symptom onset.\n\nTherefore, at present, the effect of 3CL protease inhibitor is better than that of RNA polymerase inhibitor, but the synthesis process of protease inhibitor is difficult and the cost is high. Previously, Pfizer has granted FDA emergency use authorization and signed a contract worth $5.29 billion.\n\nAt present, paxlovid sells for $529, or about 3378 yuan, for a course of treatment. At the same time, molnupiravir’s current treatment in the United States costs about $700, even more expensive than paxlovid.\n\nIn the “prevention + treatment” combination of “influenza vaccine + oral specific drugs”, with the listing of vaccines such as Kexing biology, Zhifei biology and Watson biology, China has basically achieved independent and effective vaccine production and prevention. In terms of oral drugs, with the phased decline of AR inhibitors in the pharmaceutical industry, at present, the leading progress is Junshi biological vv116 (RNA polymerase inhibitor), which has entered the stage of clinical trial in China and may not be listed until the second half of the year.\n\nAt present, Pfizer’s paxlovid is the best oral drug.\n\nDomestic short-term difficult to fully liberalize paxlovid pricing or not cheap\n\nAt present, China’s epidemic prevention and control strategy is “dynamic clearing”. In the past period of time, the number of newly confirmed cases in China has been less than 100 every day, and the control effect is still the best in the world. This makes China have no large-scale diagnosis and corresponding medical and pharmaceutical needs, and this situation is expected to continue for some time.\n\nIn addition, in the cases of local infection, with the increase of the proportion of Omicron, the proportion of severe patients who need to use drugs and even hospitalize is significantly decreasing. Therefore, even if China Pharmaceutical now successfully acts as an agent for paxlovid, it may be difficult to form effective sales performance in the short term.\n\nIt is worth noting that China’s vaccination level is also among the highest in the world. According to the statistics of Caixin securities, the number of vaccination shots per 100 people in China is 216 so far. In other words, at present, China’s basic per capita vaccination is 2 shots, and some are vaccinated with booster shots. Adequate vaccine prevention and control measures will also reduce the use of oral drugs.\n\nAs stated in the China Pharmaceutical announcement, even if the cooperation is carried out smoothly, the final use and sales of relevant drugs are affected by factors such as epidemic prevention and control, and there is uncertainty, which has no significant impact on the company’s recent operating performance.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that paxlovid’s domestic agency price may not be cheap.\n\nPreviously, molnupiravir of MSD and paxlovid of Pfizer have liberalized the imitation in low-income countries around the world. Although some Chinese pharmaceutical enterprises can produce, the market does not include China. Therefore, even if paxlovid and molnupiravir are imported with the approval of nmpa, their domestic selling prices may not be low, and may even refer to the United States.\n\nA course of treatment costs thousands of yuan. I’m afraid it’s unbearable for ordinary Chinese people.\n\nDomestic oral drugs with the same mechanism pile up in the late stage of clinical or fierce competition, and even enter the centralized collection\n\nIn China, in addition to paxlovid, molnupiravir may also approve agent import, and there may be competition between the two. In addition, many domestic pharmaceutical enterprises are also laying out oral drugs, among which the fastest is the vv116 of Junshi biology.\n\nVv116 of Junshi creature\n\nIn October 2021, Junshi biological announced that it had reached a cooperation with Wangshan wangshui to jointly undertake the global clinical development and industrialization of vv116 (RNA polymerase inhibitor). At present, vv116 has entered the clinical trial stage in China, and it will not be available until the second half of the year at the earliest.\n\nSince vv116 has been authorized for emergency use in Uzbekistan, it has become another new crown oral drug approved for marketing in the world after paxlovid and molnupiravir. It is expected that the probability will be listed in China, which may have a great impact on the price of paxlovid.\n\nReal azvudine\n\nAztudine is a new type of nucleoside reverse transcriptase and accessory protein Vif inhibitor. It is also the first double target anti HIV-1 drug in the world. At present, the phase III clinical trials for New Coronavirus pneumonia have been completed at home and abroad. Covid-19, the administrative micro blog “Pingdingshan issue” released in February 28th, azfudin became the world’s first anti AIDS nucleoside dual target drug, and will soon be listed as a new antifungal agent for new crown pneumonia.\n\nAsc11 of geley pharmaceutical\n\nAsc11 yes", "timestamp": 1649010569, "digest": "31rbOMU3f5yXWhdH7gJ6LdGkW04jEZMbcih2bViPNlA", "contributor": "0x5087605674308bAc62aC23B4947c6493fBff2f80"}

Beware of excessive dependence by major shareholders", "body": "Stock speculation depends on the Research Report of Jinqilin analyst. It is authoritative, professional, timely and comprehensive to help you tap the potential theme opportunities!\n\nProduced by: Sina Finance listed company Research Institute\n\nIn recent years, the price and service of real-time distribution are no longer in the blue ocean, and the development speed of real-time distribution is no longer in the blue ocean. Taking dada group and SF as an example, although they both rely on leading enterprises such as jd.com and SF holdings, it is still difficult to change the embarrassing situation of perennial losses and successive declines in share prices.\n\nAt the same time, due to the low entry threshold of the industry and an endless stream of new market entrants, the advanced entrants have to be involved in a money burning war in order to maintain their vitality and increase their market share. Under multiple difficulties, is instant delivery a good business? Leading enterprises have “brought capital into the group” and new small and medium-sized enterprises continue to enter the group. What strategic significance does this imply?\n\nThe blue ocean is no longer listed, and the loss of listed enterprises has become the norm\n\nIn recent years, the domestic intra city distribution market has become a hot topic in the eyes of giants. Jingdong, hungry, Shunfeng and other leading enterprises have “brought funds into the group” to grab cakes; At the same time, a large number of small and medium-sized start-ups have sprung up.\n\nAccording to the enterprise survey data, in 2011, there were only 26 local distribution companies in China, and in 2016, there were only 510 local distribution companies. Just after 2016, the registration of intra city distribution related enterprises soared. By 2021, there were more than 3100 existing intra city distribution related enterprises nationwide.\n\nThe number of registered enterprises in the industry is increasing rapidly. Why can intra city distribution attract many players?\n\nAccording to the estimates of iResearch consulting and other institutions, the average daily order volume of intra city distribution reached 83 million in 2019, and it is expected to reach 160 million in 2023. The CAGR from 2019 to 2023 is 18.1%. This trillion blue ocean market expected by investors is indeed particularly charming. But is the market as good as expected? The answer is clearly no.\n\nAfter 2017, the growth rate of average daily orders for intra city distribution continued to decline, from 49.4% in 2017 to 21.2% in 2019. Over the same period, the number of registered enterprises related to intra city distribution is still growing rapidly, with an increase of 576, 719 and 582 respectively from 2017 to 2019. For a time, how advanced market entrants hold their “cake” and expand, and how new entrants quickly divide up market share has become a difficult problem.\n\nUnder the perplexity of this problem, the city’s errand market has fallen into serious internal volume - fighting for price, speed and service, which is inseparable from the low entry threshold, fierce competition, high labor cost, high price sensitivity and high service requirements of industry consumers.\n\nFirst of all, from the perspective of industry entry threshold. The threshold of intra city distribution industry is low, and the technical barrier is low for new entrants. Therefore, a large number of new entrants in the field of intra city distribution have emerged, quickly running horses and enclosure through price advantages and marketing, so as to seize the market share.\n\nSecondly, from the perspective of consumer characteristics. Consumers in the same city errand market are mainly characterized by high service requirements, high price sensitivity and high timeliness requirements. Therefore, after the service end is rolled up, the homogenization of industry services will put the local express enterprises into the dead cycle of price war.\n\nThe industry competition intensifies and is deeply involved in the price war. The labor cost and storage cost of couriers are increasing year by year, which has become a black hole swallowing the profits of the local distribution industry. The huge losses of listed companies have become the norm. Both dada group and SF group suffered losses to varying degrees in the same city. From 2018 to 2020, the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of dada group was -2.390 billion yuan, - 2.465 billion yuan and -2081 billion yuan respectively; SF’s net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders in the same city was - 328 million yuan, - 470 million yuan and - 758 million yuan respectively.\n\nIn the intra city distribution business, labor costs account for a large part. In addition to the vast majority of riders required by the business itself, there are also a large number of employee riders. For example, in 2020, the labor outsourcing cost of SF City alone reached 4.86 billion yuan, accounting for 96.6% of the current operating cost.\n\nThis may also be the fundamental reason for the contrast between “hot primary market and cold secondary market” in capital sentiment. SF suffered a break on the first day of listing in the same city, and fell endlessly in the two months after listing. As of the closing on March 2, 2022, SF’s share price in the same city was HK $9.95/share, down nearly 40% from the issue price of HK $16.42/share. The stock price of dada group fell from US $61.27 to US $8.22 per share.\n\nWith high labor costs, large losses throughout the year and not popular in the secondary market, why do JD and SF join the bureau one after another? What is the strategic significance of real-time distribution?\n\nIt’s good to have a cool place with your back against a big tree, but you still need to prevent the risk of over dependence\n\nThe strategic ambition of building a super platform is behind the large manufacturers’ “bringing capital into the bureau”, and real-time distribution is the key to supporting the near-field e-commerce ecology.\n\nThe core of the super platform strategy is to expand the flow pool and form a closed loop, so as to control the flow distribution related to local life services, feed new businesses internally with low customer acquisition cost, form barriers externally, and form a dimensionality reduction blow to single business line companies. As a high-frequency business, intra city distribution is conducive to accumulate a huge flow pool.\n\nIn the demand scenario of intra city distribution, catering takeout accounts for the highest proportion. Meituan distribution and Hummingbird + point Wuda, which operate with the help of meituan and hungry takeout platforms, have become the duopoly in the ready to serve industry. As a local retail platform of dada group, Jingdong home continuously delivers traffic to Dada, and dada group also takes this opportunity to expand its distribution business; SF in the same city is backed by SF holdings, and began to focus on real-time distribution in 2016.\n\nFrom the average daily orders, the average daily orders of dada group and SF are 2.9 million and 2.74 million respectively, although they are not as good as meituan distribution and Hummingbird distribution backed by the takeout platform; However, the average daily orders of both are much higher than flash delivery and UU errands. Therefore, it can be seen that dada group and Shunfeng, which are backed by jd.com and Shunfeng, do enjoy certain business dividends in the same city.\n\nHowever, this has also led market investors to question their excessive dependence on major shareholders for revenue. A large part of dada group’s revenue comes from", "timestamp": 1649010788, "digest": "2Px1jQ2N3RT2ZMWSOpnJZrDiirA_MvKf92CNMZWIPIs", "contributor": "0xcC53D99A8eEFE0520b14c1fA9B21370E62a940ca"}

Founder Lin Fan said at the spring recruitment media communication meeting that the traditional boasting recruitment model has strong information asymmetry, and it is difficult for job seekers to master multi-dimensional real information. The company comment system helps job seekers understand the recruitment enterprise more objectively and realize the adaptation between talents and enterprises through the comments of on-the-job and resigned employees on the enterprise.\n\nOne stone provoked thousands of waves, and the new mode of workplace comments triggered continuous hot discussion throughout the network. On March 2, Lin Fan clarified the objectivity of comments, community rumors and praise of Shuijun brush on personal social media. The response said that the enterprise that can stand the comments of employees is an excellent enterprise, and the enterprise that can stand the comments of resigned employees is an excellent enterprise. Pulse will join hands with enterprises and users to promote the reform of recruitment mode.\n\nWorkplace social dilemma\n\nProspering in the wave of mobile Internet, pulse’s goal at the beginning of its establishment was to become “China’s leading UK”.\n\nFounded in California in 2002, LinkedIn has successfully gathered 690 million users and tens of millions of employers by virtue of multi-dimensional network expansion, enterprise recruitment and high-quality content community based on real name authentication mechanism. It is the most successful workplace social platform in the world.\n\nThe giant has not yet made plans to explore the Chinese market, but pulse has taken the lead. In October 2013, it launched a real name workplace social software that comprehensively benchmarked Lingying. In terms of content community, pulse does not copy Lingying’s business news section, but allows users to share the inside information of the company and industry anonymously.\n\nThis localized workplace social model is quite convincing. In the same month when the software was launched, pulse obtained a round of financing of US $5 million from Wuyuan capital.\n\nUnfortunately, even with the help of capital, the pulse is still lost in front of Lingying, which has a mature business model and its own aura. In 2014, LinkedIn joined hands with Sequoia China and broadband capital to establish a Chinese subsidiary. Three million users were added to the Chinese version three months after it was launched, while only 800000 users were accumulated at that time. The following year, Lingying took advantage of the victory and developed the younger workplace social software “Red Rabbit”. In addition to helping professionals carry out group activities offline and expand business contacts, it also launched an anonymous communication area online, eclipsing the differentiated characteristics of pulse.\n\nWhen the round B financing was completed in 2014, the slogan of pulse has changed from “China Lingying” to “working wechat”. The latest version of the software has launched group chat and private letter functions, weakening the color of recruitment tools and further tilting the focus to “workplace social networking”.\n\nThe development of things has deviated from Lin Fan’s expected track again. Wechat has split from instant messaging software into a super software integrating communication, social networking, payment and other functions. Almost all work functions can be completed through wechat. Rising stars nailing and flying book can only seek breakthroughs in internal coordination, department management and work progress visualization. In contrast, it only has the function of communication.\n\nIn 2017, pulse announced the completion of round C financing of US $75 million, which was led by DCM, followed by IDG capital and Wuyuan capital, and recruited by Zhilian as a strategic investor. In the internal letter, Lin Fan mentioned that pulse has broken the habit of Chinese workplace people only relying on the network of acquaintances in the past, and has also made establishing and building a real professional image in pulse a standard for tens of millions of workplace people.\n\nBut in fact, the “acquaintance society” formed in China for thousands of years is difficult to change overnight, and the operation and management of unfamiliar contacts is lack of soil for flowering and fruiting in China. People who don’t want to spend less time and energy on maintaining a weak relationship with strangers; If there is a demand for job hunting, users are more likely to choose recruitment software in vertical fields such as Zhilian recruitment, 51job, Liepin and boss direct recruitment, which gather many enterprise hr.\n\nThe wechat dream of the working version has been broken, the recruitment function is not dominant, and the social concept of acquaintances is difficult to change in the short term. The function of pulse to retain users is only the eye-catching but unconfirmed anonymous gossip: corporate mergers and acquisitions, business reduction, massive layoffs, sudden death from overwork. Negative news can always be quickly spread from pulse and fermented on other social platforms, setting off bursts of public opinion carnival, “According to pulse app,” has become the beginning of many articles.\n\nIn order to change the image of “workplace gossip platform”, pulse worked with Cisco, fashion group, focus media and other companies to create a “ladder plan” for full-time career growth path in 2018. According to public reports, the plan invested 1 billion yuan to provide peer career consulting resources for enterprise users and build a career growth system for internal employees.\n\nFinally, the plan ended, the road of commercialization was blocked again, and capital no longer paid for it. According to the public data of tianyancha, since the round D financing of US $200 million in 2018, no new funds have entered, and the plans to expand the overseas market and impact the overseas listing in 2019 have been shelved indefinitely.\n\nFour years later, the biggest label on Maimai is still “Internet tea room”.\n\nCan comment mode save itself\n\nReviewing all kinds of commercialization exploration, it seems that the famous saying of the writer Stephen Zweig has been fulfilled: “all the gifts given by fate have already been priced secretly”.\n\nAccording to public reports, the main revenue sources of pulse are recruitment, advertising and membership. Among them, in 2021, the operating revenue generated by providing talent solutions to enterprise users accounted for about 50%, the revenue of paid members accounted for about 33%, and the advertising revenue accounted for 17%. The revenue composition was similar to that of Lingying before being acquired by Microsoft.\n\nBut LinkedIn’s global talent database, elite business leaders and accurate matching algorithms are all important reasons why employers are willing to pay for them, while the relationship between gossip and enterprise users is very subtle.\n\nIt is undeniable that all of pulse can sit on 110 million registered individual users, mainly relying on the enterprise insider and gossip hidden behind the anonymous ID. These negative news has brought huge traffic to the pulse as a “gift”, but at the same time, it also makes it bear the “price” of making friends with enterprise users.\n\nAccording to the public information of Tianyan investigation", "timestamp": 1649011014, "digest": "ERpzudZkSNauOeUzaP3oLFYoDP3xbnFegx_2OjBs0qM", "contributor": "0x90569Ed8EA3a94D7A6Bf69756dCcDeE07E23d8A5"}

As a front-line distributor of an enterprise, his monthly “income” is as high as 380000 Yuan. Is it because his work performance is really excellent or his investment and financial management is reasonable? Next, let’s solve the mystery together.\n\nOne day in January 2022, Li, a Jiahe man who had just returned to Dongguan to work, suddenly received a call from a “friend” to invite him to dinner. After receiving the invitation of “friends”, although li felt a little sudden, he was invited to the appointment on time. After drinking and eating, the “friend” pointed out a “way to get rich” for Li: some of my friends are doing a lot of business, but now the bank has a limit on the amount of daily transfer, so they need someone to help transfer the transfer. As long as they are willing to help, they will have a commission every month. Seeing that the “friend” was well-dressed and generous, and the conditions he put forward were also very attractive. Although Li mouming knew that the money might come from a wrong way, he readily agreed after a sip of wine and provided him with his bank card account number.\n\nIn the following time, Li’s mobile phone SMS successively received the SMS of bank card funds. Looking at the large number on the SMS, he felt very excited, as if he were a rich man, and almost sent it to the circle of friends to share.\n\nThe money goes to your bank account, but it doesn’t belong to you after all. According to the guidance of “friends”, Li came to the bank and transferred the money in his card to other accounts. At the same time, after each successful transfer, he would receive the cash red envelope sent by “friends”. Transfer money can make money. Li thought the money could come really fast. However, when he was ready to continue happily, he received a call from the police. “We are the police of Jiahe County Public Security Bureau. You are suspected of engaging in illegal and criminal activities through bank cards. Please take the initiative to the public security organ for investigation”. On February 24, the police of Shiqiao police station of Jiahe County Public Security Bureau summoned Li to the case according to law.\n\nAs of Li’s arrival, he has transferred more than 380000 Yuan through his bank card three times, and the funds he transferred are the stolen money that needs to be transferred by criminal gangs engaged in telecom network fraud. Police tips: renting, lending, selling and buying bank cards and mobile phone cards are suspected of crimes.

{"id": "9evfXHKFfQiy3CzottistSKYUzolHD87DiwznzasdB0", "title": "Research on the continuous profitability of IPO | three \"stubborn diseases\" of era decoration: the decline of net profit or just the beginning", "body": "Produced by: Sina Finance listed company Research Institute\n\nRecently, the CSRC mentioned in its legislative plan that regulations such as the measures for the administration of the registration of initial public offerings and the measures for the administration of the registration of securities issuance of listed companies should be formulated. This move aims to implement the central government’s decision and deployment on the full implementation of the stock issuance registration system and lay a legal foundation for the full implementation of the registration system.\n\nStarting from 2019, the science and innovation board, the gem and the Beijing stock exchange have successively tested the water registration system. With the continuous promotion of the registration system, more and more IPO companies have lined up in the past two years. As of February 15, a total of 859 A-share companies (including companies that have passed the meeting but have not issued shares, excluding companies that have terminated IPO) have lined up for listing.\n\nThe research shows that whether it is the approval system or the registration system, the sustainable profitability (operation) ability is always the first main reason (also the substantive condition of the issuance) for the proposed IPO company to be rejected. Since 2010, a total of 394 companies have been asked whether they intend to IPO, of which 151 companies have been asked about “sustainable profit”, 49 companies have been asked about “sustainable operation”, and 9 companies have been asked about “sustainable operation” and “sustainable profit”. In a simple calculation, 191 companies were inquired about their sustainable profitability (operation), accounting for 48.48% of the total number of enterprises, nearly 50%.\n\nIn the current regulatory regulations, the provisions on sustainable profitability (operation) can be mainly divided into five categories: Policy Supervision, industry trend change, issuer’s operating conditions, financial indicators, other negative effects, etc. Among them, industry trend changes mainly include: (1) cyclical recession, overcapacity, sharp reduction of market capacity, growth stagnation and other situations in the issuer’s industry; (2) The issuer’s industry has low access threshold and fierce competition. Compared with competitors, the issuer does not have obvious advantages in technology, capital and scale effect; (3) Significant changes have taken place in the upstream and downstream supply-demand relationship of the issuer’s industry, resulting in significant adverse changes in the purchase price of raw materials or product price; (4) The issuer’s industry status or the business environment of the issuer’s industry has changed or will change significantly, which will have a significant adverse impact on the issuer’s continuous profitability.\n\nNote: relevant provisions on sustainable profitability\n\nOn March 3, the sustainable profitability of Shidai decoration, which will be reviewed at the conference, may be affected by the change of industry trend, because there is great uncertainty in the business environment of its downstream industry - real estate development industry.\n\nSustainable profitability is subject to the downstream business environment\n\nThe prospectus shows that the main business of times decoration includes residential fine decoration, public building decoration, curtain wall and landscape engineering decoration services. From 2018 to 2020, the company’s residential fine decoration business revenue accounted for 73% - 81%.\n\nThe major customers of residential fine decoration business are real estate developers. Therefore, the rise and fall of the real estate industry directly determines the performance of decoration business in the times. In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulatory policies for the real estate industry to curb the demand for speculative house purchase, promote the timely development and utilization of land supply, and strictly prevent banks and other financial institutions from providing financing to real estate enterprises.\n\nThe prospectus shows that the regulation and control policies of the real estate industry are still gradually deepening. If the real estate regulation policy is upgraded or the real estate financing policy is tightened significantly, it may lead to the real estate development enterprises to adjust the long-term operation deployment, reduce land investment, delay project development and prolong the payment cycle, which will have an adverse impact on the business development of times decoration in terms of business order volume, construction progress and customer payment collection.\n\nFor times decoration, the company’s performance depends not only on the policies of downstream industries, but also on the “face” of major customers. From 2018 to 2020, the sales revenue of the company’s top five customers accounted for 72.89%, 79.25% and 80.95% of the current main business revenue respectively, and the company was highly dependent on major customers.\n\nFortunately, among the top five customers of times decoration, there are no enterprises with high storm index such as China Evergrande, Huaxia happiness and Taihe Group. According to the prospectus, the company’s top five customers include developers such as Vanke, China Resources, poly, China shipping, China Merchants Shekou, Jinke and country garden.\n\nBut unfortunately, even relatively high-quality real estate companies such as Vanke have shouted the slogan of “living”. Jinke, one of the company’s major customers, was also violently hit by creditors into the company’s headquarters building.\n\nAs long as there is one of the top five customers of times decoration, the sustainable operation of times decoration will be greatly challenged, because the company’s accounts receivable and liabilities are high, and the tight operating capital chain can not withstand any twists and turns like real estate developers.\n\nThree persistent diseases\n\nAccording to public information, times decoration submitted a share offer in 2016, which was rejected at the meeting in January 2018. At that time, the IEC raised five major issues, including high asset liability ratio, large and continuous growth of accounts receivable, concentration of key customers, rationality of transactions with illegal persons, rationality of related procurement, etc.\n\nAt present, there are still three major problems in times decoration, namely, the large amount and high proportion of accounts receivable, the high asset liability ratio and the concentration of key customers.\n\nAs for the concentration of key customers, it has been mentioned above. As for the asset liability ratio, the asset liability ratios of times decoration from 2015 to 2020 were 81.92%, 82.33%, 84.73%, 76.04%, 76.67% and 78.35% respectively, with a slight decline on the whole.\n\nAlthough the asset liability ratio has declined, the leverage ratio of times decoration is still higher than that of peer comparable companies. From 2018 to 2020, the average asset liability ratios of peer companies were 61.32%, 62.95% and 62.4% respectively, about 15 percentage points lower than that of times decoration.\n\nTimes decoration said that the asset liability ratio was higher than that of its peers. First, the growth rate of revenue was higher than that of its peers, which increased the demand for external funds; Second, as a listed company, comparable companies in the same industry can raise a large amount of funds through equity financing to reduce the asset liability ratio.\n\nIn fact, another reason for the high asset liability ratio of times decoration is that huge accounts receivable occupy the company’s funds, and then resort to external borrowing. From 2018 to 2020, the net accounts receivable and contract assets of times decoration were 1.654 billion respectively", "timestamp": 1649011247, "digest": "vzF73owa-FqDR9Mu-4Gccsl8T2_-kDNKvYxpUdffWIk", "contributor": "0xDF73e39f08B3D919E5712C4F961e97EC3A338159"}

It turned out that this was a “stolen” oolong.\n\nAt about 3:40 PM that day, after the train k1374 from Huaihua to the south of Shanghai started from Jishou station, Xiao Guoan, a passenger surnamed Shi, 59, who was on duty on the Huaihua railway, was working in the carriage. He found the policeman tightly in carriage 2 and said he had brought 1100 yuan to work in Shanghai, but now the money has been stolen and it’s useless to go to Shanghai, Please help the police solve the case and get back your hard-earned money.\n\nThe policeman took the passenger to car 2 and asked him to describe his seat and the situation after getting on the bus. After listening to the passenger surnamed Shi, the police found the conductor on duty in carriage 2 to understand the situation of passengers in Jishou station. According to the information provided by the conductor, the passengers in the carriage are waiting in line and are not crowded. At this time, the traffic police have understood a little after comprehensive analysis.\n\nThe police asked the passenger surnamed Shi if he had put the money in his luggage bag, but the passenger surnamed Shi promised that the money was in his pants pocket. The policeman asked him what trousers he was wearing when he entered the station. At this time, the passenger surnamed Shi suddenly smiled and suddenly realized that after entering the waiting room, he felt that the temperature was a little high. He changed his thick trousers in the bathroom, took a pair of thin trousers from his luggage bag and put them on. The police then asked the passengers to look in the changed thick trousers. The first mock exam was made by the passengers who had raised the thick trousers from their bags. They actually touched a pair of money and a bank card in their pants pocket. They took out a few from their pockets. Not much, but not much, just 1100 yuan.\n\nHolding the 1100 yuan and the bank card in his hand, the passenger surnamed Shi smiled and said to the traffic police, “I made a mistake. I didn’t take out the money and the bank card in my pocket when changing my pants. I thought it was stolen. I’m old and have a bad memory. Thank you, officer.”", "timestamp": 1649011180, "digest": "nvyG13LyMEY9ZHxtKSEs15gGnKXGJJL3zeCUpbikwzw", "contributor": "0x2608e44229453BF08341C59ee46a453334c6EC66"}

{"id": "afDgdogkueKWYm3P_RuX02-bxx3eR8frioWRUxKOiZ0", "title": "The main industry is decadent, the performance fluctuates greatly, and the supervision \"regular customer\" Hongyuan pharmaceutical gem IPO has a good chance of winning?", "body": "Produced by: Sina Finance listed company Research Institute\n\nSince the listing of the new third board in 2014, it has not been delisted. It failed to switch to the main board of Shanghai Stock Exchange and received the warning letter from the CSRC. Recently, Hongyuan pharmaceutical wants to sprint the gem of Shenzhen Stock Exchange. It has been eight months since the prospectus was submitted to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in June 2021. After replying to the first round of inquiries of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in November last year, Hongyuan pharmaceutical, a “sick” IPO, has not received the notice of the GEM Listing Committee.\n\nIt is not common in China’s capital market to always remain in the new third board without delisting and sprint for listing declaration twice in a row. Hongyuan pharmaceutical, located in Luotian County at the south foot of Dabie Mountain in Hubei Province, was once an IPO poverty alleviation concept stock in the new third board market and is still a listed company in the innovation layer of the new third board. Some analysts said that it may be out of concern about the failure of the previous listing of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. It coincides with the establishment of the Beijing stock exchange. If the company does not delist, it is equivalent to retaining the two listing paths of the Beijing stock exchange and the gem.\n\nAccording to Article 1 of the listing conditions stipulated in the Listing Rules of Beijing stock exchange (for Trial Implementation), the issuer is an innovative listed company that has been listed in the national share transfer system for 12 months, which may be a reason why Hongyuan pharmaceutical is unwilling to delist on the new third board. Retaining the alternative listing path also reflects Hongyuan pharmaceutical’s strong demand for listing.\n\nWhy is Hongyuan pharmaceutical’s IPO bumpy? On the one hand, Hongyuan pharmaceutical has been punished by regulators for many violations. On the other hand, the company also has some problems, such as the decline of its main business, large fluctuations in performance, the difficulty of cross-border lithium batteries to become a long-term performance growth point, the decrease of dealers year by year, the lower R & D cost rate than peers, and the questioning of financial internal control.\n\nCan the cross-border lithium battery industry become a new growth point?\n\nHongyuan pharmaceutical was founded in 2002, mainly engaged in the R & D, production and sales of chemical raw materials, pharmaceutical intermediates, APIs and pharmaceutical preparations. The API products include metronidazole, benzoyl metronidazole, demenidazole and acyclovir. Pharmaceutical intermediate products include glyoxylic acid, methylimidazole, sulfate, guanine, 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole, diacetyl guanine and diacetyl acyclovir. Organic chemical raw materials include glyoxal and oxalic acid.\n\nFor a long time, API and pharmaceutical intermediates have contributed more than half of Hongyuan pharmaceutical’s revenue, accounting for 64.39%, 68.96%, 67.74% and 53.29% in 2018-2020 and the first half of 2021, respectively. Organic chemical raw materials are the second largest source of revenue, accounting for 19.78%, 17.68%, 21.86% and 24.65% of revenue respectively. The two types of products together contribute most of the revenue and are the most important business of the company.\n\nIt is worth noting that the performance of Hongyuan pharmaceutical has been unstable in recent years. From 2018 to 2020 and the first half of 2021, the operating revenue of Hongyuan pharmaceutical was 1.329 billion yuan, 1.574 billion yuan, 1.303 billion yuan and 699 million yuan respectively, with a year-on-year change of 3.98%, 18.46%, - 17.24% and 3.32%, and the revenue fluctuated significantly. In the same period, the net profit attributable to the parent company was 12 million yuan, 314 million yuan, 257 million yuan and 198 million yuan respectively, with year-on-year changes of - 62.8%, 2489.13%, - 18.1% and 62.8%, and the net profit fluctuated greatly.\n\nIn its prospectus, Hongyuan pharmaceutical acknowledged that the company’s operating performance fluctuates greatly due to multiple factors, and suggested that the company’s future development will still be affected by external factors such as macroeconomic environment, industrial policies and downstream market demand. At the same time, it is also closely related to the company’s R & D and innovation, new product development, market development, capacity layout and other internal factors, If there are major adverse changes in the above factors, or the company’s new production line fails to reach full production for a long time after it is put into operation, and the expected benefits cannot be realized, the company’s operating performance will be affected.\n\nIn recent years, the main business of Hongyuan pharmaceutical industry has declined significantly. On the one hand, the growth rate of the sales scale of China’s systemic antimicrobial drugs market has slowed down, on the other hand, the continuous changes of medical reform policies also make the company face business challenges.\n\nHongyuan pharmaceutical is one of the largest manufacturers of metronidazole in China. According to the data quoted in the prospectus, the sales growth of China’s systemic antimicrobial drugs market slowed down significantly from 2015 to 2019. The applicable drugs in this field include metronidazole, tinidazole, ornidazole, secnidazole and other varieties.\n\nSource: prospectus\n\nAffected by market changes, the sales volume and production and marketing rate of metronidazole in Hongyuan pharmaceutical industry have decreased significantly in recent years. The sales volume in 2019-2020 and the first half of 2021 were 3717.06 tons, 3122.54 tons and 1353.77 tons respectively, and the production and marketing rates in the same period were 98.59%, 96.2% and 72.85% respectively. The first half of 2021 was 25.74 percentage points lower than that in 2019.\n\nSince December 2016, the medical reform office of the State Council, the national health and Family Planning Commission, the food and Drug Administration and other institutions have issued policies to implement the “two ticket system”, requiring drug manufacturers to issue invoices once to circulation enterprises and circulation enterprises to issue invoices once to medical institutions. This has changed the downstream customers of Hongyuan pharmaceutical from traditional dealers to distribution dealers, and some market promotion subjects have also changed.\n\nIn recent years, the number of distributors of the company has decreased year by year. From 2018 to 2020 and the first half of 2021, the number of distributors of organic chemical raw materials, APIs and pharmaceutical intermediates of Hongyuan pharmaceutical was 370, 361, 355 and 231 respectively, and the number of distributors of pharmaceutical preparations was 775, 634, 492 and 346 respectively. The number of distributors of different categories of main products decreased significantly, This is also one of the factors affecting the sharp fluctuation of the company’s performance.\n\nIt is worth noting that in order to seek the growth point of performance, Hongyuan pharmaceutical and Wuhan University jointly developed lithium hexafluorophosphate products in 2010, which is one of the main materials of lithium battery electrolyte. Later, due to the serious surplus caused by the rapid expansion of domestic lithium hexafluorophosphate production capacity and high capital pressure, the company stripped off the production unit with an annual output of 4000 tons of lithium hexafluorophosphate and the corresponding R & D, production and purchase and sales business. As of the disclosure date of the prospectus, Hongyuan pharmaceutical only retained the production unit with an annual output of 1000 tons of lithium hexafluorophosphate.\n\nThe layout of new energy for cross-border lithium batteries makes Hongyuan pharmaceutical face cross-border R & D and management on the one hand", "timestamp": 1649011483, "digest": "cxA5d1kgTvHvON9XX702n4xPwhu7rwkg6Muziqk8IDA", "contributor": "0x656F1812C3300051842c296a05cC5652c6256a7e"}

Seeing this, the man’s friend rushed forward for first aid. Worried that the man might bite his tongue when he twitched, the friend put his finger into the man’s mouth and was bitten by the other party.\n\nAfter receiving the call for help, the medical staff rushed to the scene.\n\nWhen the medical staff arrived at the scene, a man was sitting on the ground, and others were helping him up. At this time, the man’s mind had recovered and temporarily stopped convulsion. Just when the medical staff sent the man to the hospital, the man’s friend standing aside said he was bitten during first aid.\n\n“At that time, he put the middle finger of his right hand into the mouth of the convulsive patient. Maybe his first reaction was that he was afraid of the patient biting his tongue. Out of kindness, he was bitten. It was all tooth marks and bleeding.” Wu Kai, the attending physician of the emergency medical department of the second people’s Hospital of Hunan Province, told reporters that after they were sent to the hospital, they entered the emergency internal medicine and emergency surgery respectively. After treatment, both of them are not seriously affected at present.\n\nThe doctor warned that in case of similar convulsions, do not put your fingers into the mouth of the convulsor, because the convulsor has lost consciousness at this time, which is likely to cause accidental injury.\n\n“First of all, ensure the safety of the site, remove the sharp things around him to avoid him falling. The most important thing is to let him lie on his side, remove the secretion from his mouth, prevent suffocation caused by blocking the respiratory tract, and dial 120 in time.

When I was ready to eat, I saw something hairy inside.” Recently, Mr. Liu told reporters about his dining experience in Longxi Yuanyu soup and seafood (Zhonglian Plaza store) in Shinan District, Qingdao. “There were a lot of people at our party that day, so we ordered more than 10 dishes. Other dishes were all right. I ate hair in Spanish mackerel ball soup. Now I’m still uncomfortable when I think of it.” Mr. Zhao believes that the problem exposed by such a thing may be that the purchase channel of restaurant dishes is irregular, or the hygiene of back kitchen is not up to standard. The relevant person in charge of longxiyuan restaurant told reporters that in the future, they will strictly control the hygiene of the restaurant and avoid similar incidents.\n\nMr. Liu told reporters that on the evening of February 26, he and his friends had a dinner in longxiyuan (Zhonglian Plaza store). I thought the overall taste of the dishes was very good and satisfied. But I found that hair appeared in one bowl of Spanish mackerel ball soup.\n\n“Because there were a lot of people at the party, in order to disturb the interest of others, I didn’t say anything about it and didn’t call the waiter to deal with it. I just threw the problematic dishes aside.” Mr. Liu said that the dishes they consumed were ordered at the scene. The dishes included more than ten kinds of dishes, including pocket Sibao, maoxuewang, powdered turnip, fished sausage and so on, which cost more than 1000 yuan. Although the price is not very expensive, as a customer, he feels that the consumption dining experience is really poor.\n\nMr. Liu said that he had been to the store with his friends many times. The dishes were economical and tasted good. Unexpectedly, there were health problems this time. By observing the evidence provided by Mr. Wang, the reporter saw that the hair was about 3cm long and stuck to the Spanish mackerel pill. If you don’t look carefully, it’s difficult to find it.\n\n“I don’t want to investigate anything about this, but to question the hygiene problems in their restaurant. I just want them to pay a little attention when cooking or serving.” Mr. Liu doesn’t know which link of the restaurant has problems, which leads to the emergence of health problems.\n\nIn order to further understand the situation, the reporter contacted the restaurant where Mr. Liu ate, longxiyuan Zhonglian Plaza store. The other party said that at present, the customer has not contacted them, and they will verify the matter as soon as possible.\n\nStaff told reporters: “first of all, customers don’t have to worry about raw materials at all. We have to carry out quality control when purchasing goods. Secondly, when cooking, the back kitchen chefs will wear masks and hoods as required in order to avoid such things.” At the same time, the staff also said that the service personnel have also been trained and pay great attention to the hygiene of dishes.\n\nAccording to the staff, at present, their store manager is in a meeting and it is inconvenient to come forward. After the meeting, they will ask the service personnel one by one to verify the matter. “Now that the customers have reported this, we must attach great importance to it. I will convey it immediately after the store manager’s meeting. At the same time, we will strictly control the hygiene of the restaurant in the future.\n\nThe staff of Qingdao Shinan District market supervision and Administration Bureau said that they would send law enforcement personnel to inspect the hygiene status of the restaurant to determine whether the hygiene status of the restaurant meets the standard. “According to the case handling process, in this case, we’d better mediate between consumers and businesses first. In this process, no matter whether the mediation is successful or not, we will send a law enforcement squadron to check the hygiene problems, purchase channels and cleanliness of food materials in the back kitchen of the restaurant involved. If it is determined that there are violations in this intermediate process, we will be punished according to relevant laws and regulations Regulations. “", "timestamp": 1649011728, "digest": "guuyL-YrEpFzISsDUUGa_9x9n_6WQhJvLIDEtP3IWXA", "contributor": "0xa5968e2a00e74D0d04a54918c81c8c6B54DFcB2e"}

One person plays the role of leader, employee and driver to cheat", "body": "If one person plays many roles and pretends to be a member of all walks of life to cheat, he will not escape the law in the end. On February 21, Shi, a suspect in a series of fraud cases, was arrested by Baojing Public Security Bureau in Western Hunan, with a total amount of nearly 17000 yuan.\n\nAt about 7:30 that night, when the suspect Shi appeared near the county traditional Chinese medicine hospital for the last time, he was following the same deception routine several times and targeting a commodity sales store on the street again; But what he didn’t expect was that his deception method was just ready to be used. At the moment, the police had already stepped forward and backward, and took it away on the spot.\n\nThe police handling the case learned that the suspect Shi had many criminal records in previous years, and the recent way of committing the crime was mainly to fake the staff of various industries to defraud the relevant victims. During the period from the end of December 2021 to February 21, 2022, there were 6 cases of crimes, including 3 cases of counterfeit tobacco company personnel handling cigarette certificates, 2 cases of collecting deposits in the name of selling cigarettes privately, and 1 case of counterfeit resettlement housing staff cheating in the name of providing resettlement housing.\n\nAs early as the end of the year, Shi felt that he was nervous. In addition, he had seen many fraud cases on the Internet, so he had the idea of imitating the crime. On the occasion of the new year’s Eve, I found that there was a shortage of cigarettes in many stores. Shi deliberately pretended to be an insider of the tobacco company and lied that he could provide all kinds of cigarettes privately through his own relationship. Many shopkeepers were credulous; In addition, Shi also deliberately targeted some newly opened stores, took advantage of the difficulty of the store owner’s license, and lied that he could charge in private to help handle the tobacco monopoly license. Therefore, combining the above factors, many shopkeepers have been cheated in the short term.\n\nDefrauding trust is a key step in a series of fraud cases. In order to forge his identity more vividly, Shi rented four wechat signals from the Internet to play the roles of leaders, employees and drivers of the tobacco company. At the beginning of gaining trust, Shi gave his expensive cigarettes to the store owner for free to show his generosity. When the victim began to believe and intend to pay the amount, Shi returned one after another in a hard to get attitude, and recommended another wechat account used to play the role of leader to the store owner. He turned to play the role of company leader to further win the trust of the other party, that is, to catch a big fish in the long line.\n\nIn one of the typical cases of a series of fraud cases, after lobbying by all means, Ms. Xue, the owner of a sales store, finally began to trust herself, and successively paid about 13000 cash to Shi as a deposit for cigarettes. At this time, the suspect Shi knew that he had succeeded. At the same time, his true colors began to show. Therefore, after that, Shi delayed the delivery for various reasons and pushed the micro signal decorated with the corner of the truck driver to Ms. Xue, while Shi continued to play the role of the truck driver behind his back. When Ms. Xue asked the truck driver the reason for the delay in delivery, Shi continued to delay on the grounds of road snow and Chinese new year through wechat.\n\nIn this way, over and over again, Ms. Xue began to notice the mistakes. Until she learned that many shopkeepers around had encountered similar situations, she realized that she might have been deceived and sought the police’s investigation. At present, the suspect Shi has been dealt with by the public security organ in accordance with the law.", "timestamp": 1649011637, "digest": "d81qCqT8lPWWzsMkCo-bwQbdkXI4nMpf6nk-VeKWpqo", "contributor": "0x3f3cd146317E9597060382070A87fdCbcC2B6a21"}

The company has deducted non loss for three years", "body": "Stock speculation depends on the Research Report of Jinqilin analyst. It is authoritative, professional, timely and comprehensive to help you tap the potential theme opportunities!\n\nProduced by: Sina Finance listed company Research Institute\n\nOn February 14, laiyifen issued a shareholder reduction announcement. Its major shareholder Aiwu enterprise management plans to reduce its holdings of no more than 10.1039 million shares in the next six months, accounting for 3% of the company’s total share capital.\n\nAt present, Aiwu enterprise management holds 55.38% of Laiyi’s shares, and with the shareholding of those acting in concert, Aiwu enterprise management controls 65.15% of Laiyi’s shares in total.\n\nSince October 2019, Aiwu enterprise management has been throwing out share reduction plans. The company’s share price has not improved. At present, the market value is only more than 4 billion yuan. The reason behind this is that Laifen’s performance has stagnated all year round and has deducted non loss for three years.\n\nWhile reducing the holdings of major shareholders, the company also launched an employee stock ownership plan to grant shares to the management at half the current market price. Can this give market confidence?\n\nMajor shareholders continue to reduce their holdings\n\nLaiyifen was listed in September 2016, and the shares held by the controlling shareholder Aiwu enterprise management have a three-year sale period. Since October 2019, its shares have been officially listed and circulated. At the end of October 2019, the controlling shareholders and their persons acting in concert threw out the reduction plan. However, the controlling shareholders did not reduce their holdings after the expiration of the period.\n\nThe controlling shareholders plan to reduce their holdings again. From April 8, 2021 to October 15, 2021, Aiwu enterprise management will reduce a total of 10.0106 million shares, accounting for 2.97% of the total share capital of the company. The reduction price range is 12.5 yuan - 21.3 yuan. As of February 14, Laifen’s closing price was 12.93 yuan.\n\nOn January 26 before the disclosure of the reduction announcement of major shareholders, Laiyi disclosed the announcement of 2021 earnings forecast. Turning losses into profits in 2021, the net profit attributable to the parent company was 28 million yuan, compared with -65.1954 million yuan in the same period of last year. However, there was still a loss of 62 million yuan after non deduction, and 105 million yuan in the previous year.\n\nThis “positive” did not boost market confidence at all. Laifen’s share price has fallen by more than 10% since January 26.\n\nAt the end of 2021, laiyifen also launched an employee stock ownership plan, which plans to grant shares to no more than 50 people, including directors, supervisors and core managers. The shares in the stock ownership plan come from the shares repurchased by the company in the first half of 2019. The repurchase price is 12.19 yuan and the grant price is 6.1 yuan, which is almost half of the current market price.\n\nCan major shareholders give market confidence by reducing their holdings and pushing the employee stock ownership plan at the same time?\n\nContinue to burn money and doubt the expansion effect\n\nSince 2018, Laifen has deducted non losses for four consecutive years, with a total loss of 246 million yuan. Mainly rely on non recurring profits and losses to barely maintain the positive return to the parent net profit. The two largest amounts of non recurring profits and losses are government subsidies and investment income of financial products.\n\nThe main reason for the sharp decline in net profit is the increase in expenses caused by the company’s expansion. Since 2017, in order to expand its scale, Laifen has vigorously developed the third-party e-commerce business and Laifen app on the one hand, accelerated the opening of offline stores on the other hand, and continued to expand its categories at the same time.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2020, Laifen’s revenue growth rate was 12.35%, 7.01%, 2.86% and 0.59% respectively, and the growth rate of expense rate in the same period reached 13.62%, 18.58%, 2.69% and 1.58% respectively.\n\nIn 2017, the amount of sales expenses exceeded 1.1 billion yuan and has remained at 1.3 billion yuan since 2019. Administrative expenses are from\n\nPreviously, it was less than 300 million yuan, increasing to nearly 500 million yuan. The highest net profit of the company is only about 130 million yuan.\n\nLaiyifen has always maintained an ultra-high expense rate. The expense rate was about 39% in 2017, increased to more than 43% in 2018 and reached 44% in 2020. In the same period, the expense rate of liangpin shop, Qiaqia food and three squirrels was between 10% and 25%. The ultra-high expense rate depressed the company’s net interest rate, which was less than 4% before 2016. Due to the low net interest rate, the increase of expenses is easy to erode the net profit, resulting in deduction of non losses.\n\nHowever, the strong investment did not bring the synchronous growth of revenue. In recent years, the number of offline stores in Yifen has increased continuously, from 2460 in 2017 to 3004 in 2020, but the revenue scale in 2020 is only 11% higher than that in 2017. Among them, the revenue of online e-commerce was only 594 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 15%.\n\nWhen will the omni channel layout claimed by the company really enter the harvest period?\n\nCan Laifen transform offline stores into competitive advantages\n\nIn fact, as early as 2014, Laifen’s revenue growth stalled, with a single digit growth rate throughout the year, with an increase of only 1.71% in the first three quarters of 2021. Compared with other nut snack enterprises, Laifen’s revenue growth is at the bottom level.\n\nAfter the failure of foreign port and online expansion in recent years, the company is readjusting its development strategy.\n\nFirst look at online channels. From 2018 to 2020, the compound annual growth rate of online channels is only 13%, and the total scale of online channels in 2020 is less than 600 million yuan. Both the growth rate and the scale of online sales are obviously low. When online is less than expected, the company has gradually abandoned its own team operation mode and replaced it with operation.\n\nOffline expansion also had little effect. Before 2017, Laifen stores were mainly concentrated in six economically developed provinces: Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong and Anhui. After 2017, Laifen expanded its offline stores to more than 30 provinces, and the offline stores in these provinces were not successful.\n\nThe stagnation of revenue growth is on the one hand, and the decline of single store revenue on the other hand. According to the data of Dongxing securities, from 2018 to 2020, the single store revenue of its direct stores and franchise stores declined, with a slight decline in Direct stores and a significant decline in franchise stores. Since the second half of 2020, Laifen has accelerated the closing speed of Direct stores and turned to franchise stores.\n\nIn the short term, whether Laifen can get out of the trough depends on whether the expansion of franchise stores can bring significant growth in performance and whether online channels can usher in more than expected growth.\n\nExpense rate is another factor worth looking forward to. Compared with companies in the same industry, Laifen has an extremely high cost", "timestamp": 1649011712, "digest": "hNI2VQulcSoh82OtZ0-rm_SzafYGtFGbeaSN2gW1IFg", "contributor": "0x9c6C48048319f0C4e646d8183167dEF01F44b0C0"}

We should not forget that the explorative state of WEB3 today (march2022) is not to become something new. It is a potential that is finding its purpose, but eventually has to return and connect to the rest of its users.\n\nMore on this later. For now… A Tale about a TAIL.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ymczqwKOYneQKrOKVQKH6.png?height=1504&width=1504)\n\n**A Tale about a TAIL**\n\nA fox is a cunning animal. Contrary to its bright friendly color, it is fast, deliberate and deadly. He/she is a predator and therefore a fine-tuned creation of nature. The fox is an integral part of the forest and its rural surroundings and through its unique character has found its way into Human Lore and Legend. Its capabilities make it a perfect metaphorical match with their HUMAN counterparts…like Disney’s Robin Hood.\n\nThe Fox has a purposeful relationship with its senses. It knows what it wants and what it can do with what it has been given. It is for this reason that YOU find yourself reading about foxes in this CUBED Story.\n\nA FOX is one with its TAIL. It give it balance, it is a communication tool and at night it keeps these wondrous beasts warm.\n\nIn this short story the FOX is losing its tail. It has detached itself from its natural position to seek its own purpose elsewhere. Sometimes special features (like a TAIL) need to follow their own path.\n\n![flowing tail - looking great on its own](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jvci_P_y01NCBecDyCtF8.png?height=1503&width=1503)\n\nOne might conclude that “TAIL” grew tired of hanging at the backend of its host and thought it might be time to go off and do things on its own. By ripping itself away from its host Tail was free to roam, float and dance around to see where it would belong. It started to find new and exiting places that would conform its thoughts and actions and help it hone into its specific purpose.\n\n![Tail finding its own flow.... but looking the same as FOX](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wnuyiGTbh9PYoEFv1uIT5.png?height=1503&width=1504)\n\nAfter a while TAIL was happy on its own and started to get notice for its newly found purpose and confidence in applying it. One day when Tail met up with FOX to catch up  they both realised that they had grown into something new, but with a large hole where they once were connected.\n\n![finding attachment](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YLOrq48_ZsdEaZ5vY-DvG.png?height=1504&width=1504)\n\nNow this story of FOX & TAIL can find similarities in a lot of situations.

We plan to collaborate with L1 foundations, groups and organisations like **Solana Foundation**, **NEAR Foundation,**  **Buildspace**, **AWET**, **Blockchain Engineering Lagos,** **Blockchain Acceleration Foundation**, **Rust Lagos**, who are creating funnels for Web2 to Web3 talent onboarding, general technical education on blockchain development and other budding technologies\n\nIn that same vein, it is especially important to bring underrepresented groups into the fold from inception by devoting resources to upskill people who have systematically been excluded from leading development. **For nascent technologies to be truly resonant with the masses, we must be seen to be deeply embedded in the solution.**\n\nThe past few months have been about laying the foundation, proving our concepts and nurturing organic growth. We have cultivated a space where bright, bold ideas turn to impactful solutions. We remain nimble to adapt to the contours of imagination and flexible enough for the dynamic nature of the space. Over the next few months, we will work to further establish our position within the Web3 landscape as a community-oriented, culturally-forward institution and incubator of paradigm-shifting ideas which reflect our mission of **making knowledge, resources and products pertaining to Web3, crypto and blockchain technology accessible to and effective for Africans.**\n\n## What is our story? How are we telling it?\n\nIt is one thing to realise the existence of something, and another to design systems that effectively harness its power. **Storytelling** and **world-building** are values highly pertinent to the overarching mission of COLDS. **Lorecrafting** sits at the crux of these two values.\n\nWe believe that new paradigms yielding new fruit must be navigated with intention, so every chapter of our story is being written with care. Lorecrafting, and establishing a coherent organisational story are crucial to ensuring that all members of our community are well-aligned in context, expectations and priorities. The narratives and belief systems that emerge from this period of deep exploration  will work to sustain a common thread of vision and work across the spread. We are deeply researching and reviewing our organisational practices against existing critical theories like *The 8 Metaphors of Organization* and using these frameworks to conjure up our true North Star.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cSQBRHlkYb51sQ_gIRhi3.PNG?height=502&width=491)\n\n![From Rafa’s Community Operational Framework](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QJTTv-piziMoZ8AdXj6Uk.jpg?height=224&width=262)\n\n## So what’s next for COLDS?\n\nWe have a ton planned for the next quarters to keep creating value for our community members, expanding our offerings and writing our story. To name a few;\n\n**💸 Fundraising:** We are scaling up in every way, and that requires funding. More to come on COLDS fundraising efforts.\n\n**📌 Hiring:** Digital Artisans, Lorecrafters, Developers, Metaverse Architects, Community Cultivators etc. We are looking to connect with individuals to explore this landscape with in a meaningful way\n\n📚**Research:** Deep inquisition and deep learning spanning across disciplines and sharing what we find from this.\n\n**🛠 Development kickoff:** We aim to build and incubate a suite of products capable of operating agnostically and nested in a symbiotic ecosystem where one can contribute to the other’s success. A swiss-knife of sorts.\n\n**👩🏾‍🎤 COLDS Cohort #2:** We will be expanding the Cohort Program and onboarding another creator to support.\n\n**🎉 More super fun community programming:** Twitter Spaces, Workshops, Metaverse meetups, Curated community exhibits, investment clubs, IRL events (Catalsyt 2.0 😉)\n\n**✍🏿 Documentation and Preservation:** COLDS Community Zine\n\n**🔓 More open source contributions:** Open source everything! This is how we grow and promote digital public goods. By making resources accessible to all and learning/building in public.\n\n**🤝 More partnerships and collaborations**\n\n🎖 **Contributor bounty structures**\n\n**💌 Mutual aid**\n\nWe are all constituents of the free and open network-states and societies. We consider this tribe of soul-led, mission-driven futurists one of the founding networks of the new human age. With this knowledge, and with the tools at our disposal we will work to subvert archaic systems and enable a more inclusive, free, playful, collaborative future. We are reclaiming our agency and power, and redefining our relationships with ourselves and the world around us.\n\n> ***We will write protocols beyond the edge of the map, scored with stories of the things that move us.***\n\nThank you for journeying with us 💡♾\n\nTo stay in touch, find us at the following links:\n\nTo stay in touch, find us at the following links:\n\n**COLDS Tellie:** <https://tell.ie/COLDS> \n\n**COLDS Discord:** <https://discord.gg/colds>\n\n**COLDS Twitter:** <https://twitter.com/coldscollective>\n\n**COLDS Instagram:** <https://www.instagram.com/coldscollective/>\n\n**COLDS Email:** [info@coldscollective.io](mailto:info@coldscollective.io)", "timestamp": 1649011834, "digest": "SF6cr11J4rGdJijHfypBzxaih9EgoQsx7bvEdIOWPck", "contributor": "0x0A647E9CaD17D178110a66b07358CD5a5fb9bf72"}

I initially started to write it to explain the current state of the WEB3/Crypto spaces that are running away from the general public. These spaces are developing at such a rate that onboarding people into its possibilities is becoming too difficult. We should not forget that the explorative state of WEB3 today (march2022) is not to become something new. It is a potential that is finding its purpose, but eventually has to return and connect to the rest of its users.\n\nMore on this later. For now… A Tale about a TAIL.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ymczqwKOYneQKrOKVQKH6.png?height=1504&width=1504)\n\n**A Tale about a TAIL**\n\nA fox is a cunning animal. Contrary to its bright friendly color, it is fast, deliberate and deadly. He/she is a predator and therefore a fine-tuned creation of nature. The fox is an integral part of the forest and its rural surroundings and through its unique character has found its way into Human Lore and Legend. Its capabilities make it a perfect metaphorical match with their HUMAN counterparts…like Disney’s Robin Hood.\n\nThe Fox has a purposeful relationship with its senses. It knows what it wants and what it can do with what it has been given. It is for this reason that YOU find yourself reading about foxes in this CUBED Story.\n\nA FOX is one with its TAIL. It give it balance, it is a communication tool and at night it keeps these wondrous beasts warm.\n\nIn this short story the FOX is losing its tail. It has detached itself from its natural position to seek its own purpose elsewhere. Sometimes special features (like a TAIL) need to follow their own path.\n\n![flowing tail - looking great on its own](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jvci_P_y01NCBecDyCtF8.png?height=1503&width=1503)\n\nOne might conclude that “TAIL” grew tired of hanging at the backend of its host and thought it might be time to go off and do things on its own. By ripping itself away from its host Tail was free to roam, float and dance around to see where it would belong. It started to find new and exiting places that would conform its thoughts and actions and help it hone into its specific purpose.\n\n![Tail finding its own flow.... but looking the same as FOX](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wnuyiGTbh9PYoEFv1uIT5.png?height=1503&width=1504)\n\nAfter a while TAIL was happy on its own and started to get notice for its newly found purpose and confidence in applying it. One day when Tail met up with FOX to catch up  they both realised that they had grown into something new, but with a large hole where they once were connected.\n\n![finding attachment](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YLOrq48_ZsdEaZ5vY-DvG.png?height=1504&width=1504)\n\nNow this story of FOX & TAIL can find similarities in a lot of situations. The moral of this particular tale might be to sometimes let your TAIL go, but always keep the backdoor open for it to eventually return and re-attach itself to complete The FOX.\n\n![Happy and re-attached](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zznnZlLGDqceCB-vYEXP7.png?height=1504&width=1504)\n\n![print out and fold to share this tale with others](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VYUgATGY0hz5Rrfc99B6-.jpg?height=2829&width=2000)\n\n", "timestamp": 1649012169, "digest": "f4tGI8eumMHoM92ZU0YEbZdL0kqnj5JWNPG9Q5ubjys", "contributor": "0x553eBf9B7380cf010efc38eEE8387868D3141fF4"}
{"id": "oil52ow7iixTZ_v0JVfJVpPn8tvB4VoWgz5ugRB0j7Y", "title": "The Art of Finding the Perfect Book", "body": "There is a thing about books. They can educate or teach us. They can entertain us. Books can help us unwind and escape to a magical place and books can transform our lives, but the problem is how to weed through all the hundreds of thousands of books to find the best ones.\n\nReading has always been fundamental in my life but as things become more digital and resources multiply, I do find it becoming increasingly challenging to weed through the junk. I keep my mind open to hear about recommendations from my co-workers, my Twitter community, YouTube and Podcasts that I listen to and of course all of you. Feel free to share your book recommendations with me at any time.  \n\nI recently completed work on my book reading system database using Airtable that helps me track the entire book reading journey from when I first heard about the book through completion of a published review.\n\nIn summary, this is what the system does:\n\nKeep track of all the books that I want to read, where I heard about them and why I want to read them.\n\nTracks the progress on where I am with all books on a weekly basis.\n\nGives me a quick visual of the types of topics that I am reading and helps me maintain a balance. Reading too much about one topic can be dangerous as it can create reading burnout and a false sense of knowing everything.\n\nHolds me accountable for taking effective notes and sharing those with my community.\n\nEncourages me to experiment and find new ideas to read about.\n\nI hope you have a system for your reading. If you are interested in getting a copy of my Airtable database just let me know and I will be happy to share it with you.\n\n## 🎥**The Latest on my YouTube Channel**\n\nI just completed my latest video on YouTube discussing How to find and READ books that are actually worth your time which actually inspired this weeks newsletter topic. You can view the full video here:\n\n## **🏆What I am learning**\n\n🎓Harvard University’s CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science Course is coming along nicely. I am up to week three of the course and could not be happier with the content.\n\n📊I also started with my Codecademy courses. I chose the Data Scientist learning path so I can make sure that I approach software programming from different angles. My multi-specialty approach of learning general computer programming, data science and blockchain technology is taking shape and should open up my eyes to a world of different options and possibilities.\n\n🎬If you watched my video you will notice that I am stepping up my video making game. I subscribed to a new service to get copyright free music and sound effects. This can really impact the quality of videos that I am about to produce. I am still using Camtasia as my main editing tool, however, I did subscribe to the Adobe cloud suite of products and will be learning how to use those soon to give me a more comprehensive approach to video making.\n\n## **📖What I am reading**\n\n📚I am still listening to Sing to Me by LA Reid on Audible. It has gotten me feeling nostalgic just as I thought it would. It’s been a while since I spent any time with music. I had some great times in the industry and I miss some of my friends and networks that I built there, but mostly I miss simply enjoying music. I have to start listening to it a little more frequently again.\n\n## **🛠️Project Updates**\n\n⌨️**Increasing my typing efficiency**: I abandoned the typing tests on 1fastfingers.com to replace it with some hardcore practice on the touch-typing method. This new website that I found helps me practice typing in a way that forces you to memorize where the keys are on the keyboard, so you commit them to your muscle memory. It is a little frustrating because my 40 wpm dropped to 20 wpm when I first started as I no longer rely on my old typing habits. They say sometimes you must take one step back for two steps forward. Time will tell but I do feel good about my results. I realized my biggest challenge so far has been with the letter “S” as it is in a weird place on the keyboard and my finger does not want to cooperate with me.   \n\n🎥 **Editing and Video Making:** I enrolled the 14 Day Filmmaker course and have been taking notes in my Notion Dashboard. So far I have learned about different camera gear, focal lengths, Ideal image composition,  camera angles and movement  and I am only on Day 4. Over the next week I am excited about getting into  the editing course that will help me start playing with Adobe Premier.\n\n🚀**Becoming a Blockchain Developer:** I am still trucking along here. I found some new powerful courses that I am excited about and added them to my Becoming a Blockchain Developer Roadmap that I am working on. I hope it will become a great resource for others that are looking to get into the filed once I am completed with it.\n\n## **❤️What I am loving**\n\n📺My wife and I started binge watching a new series on Netflix. It is called Young, Famous and African. It is another addition to the world of “reality TV’. It is a mixture of the “housewives” model crossed with the “love and Hip Hop” model. I like it mostly because it highlights successful Africans opens our eyes to the luxury world of South Africa which many of us may not even know exists. There is plenty of the usual “reality TV drama” of course with tensions between the characters and whirlwind romance twists. It is a must see if you like that type of thing. There is only 1 season available right now, but my guess is they will renew it for more seasons that will be available shortly.\n\n## **📊Random Insights**\n\nMusic. I have some random thoughts on music this week. I mentioned earlier that I have been feeling a little nostalgic listening to Sing to Me by LA Reid. It was written in 2016 just as the entire music industry started undergoing the current digital transformation. His experience spanned the golden years of music as I will call it as hip-hop and rap music transcended into the mainstream. I remember being an early adopter of rap music with Run DMC, The Fat Boys and LL Cool J. It was not cool for a white boy to listen to rap music back then. I was chastised for it during high school and often laughed at. It’s amazing to see how things have changed over the years. Rap music has created muti millionaires and has become a key part of our society.\n\nMusic was an outlet for me to express my creativity and uniqueness and my early adoption of the art form opened many exciting doors for me. I started my journey into entrepreneurship in high school by starting my own record label and eventually branched out into several other directions over the years. My last entrepreneurial endeavor in the music business was an attempt to start a music publishing company that would license music for commercial use. It was called Nothing Like This Music and we had a diverse roster of artists and producers willing to create music for us to license. This was in the early days of digital music. My project eventually died because of a lack of funding as life got the best of me and I had to focus on my family obligations.\n\nI look at companies like Epidemic Sound and Artlist and wonder, was I on to something at that time? I just spent $300 for a one year subscription to Artlist. They are operating in the exact model that I was looking to adopt.  \n\nWas I too early of a visionary? Was I just a bad businessperson? Maybe I was just underfunded? Whatever the reason, I know that I was on the cutting edge of the industry at the time and I was there because of my willingness to learn and try new things.  I continue that practice today. I am always looking to learn the latest technologies and be on the forefront of innovation. Maybe my learning journey into computer science and blockchain technology will bring me the next million dollar idea.

{"id": "tGWV60XgbsvDZ2J_tucXryz2tAzGkiYM82U1obCGspw", "title": "Every comment: the release of warmth from real estate financial policies is expected to be \"three stabilities\"", "body": "Special commentator Yin Zhongli\n\nIn the government work report of this year’s two sessions, the expression of real estate policies is basically consistent with the central economic work conference held at the end of last year: we should adhere to the positioning that houses are used for living, not for speculation, strengthen expectation guidance, explore new development models, adhere to the simultaneous development of rent and purchase, accelerate the development of long-term rental housing market and promote the construction of indemnificatory housing, Support the commercial housing market to better meet the reasonable housing needs of buyers, and implement policies to promote the virtuous cycle and healthy development of the real estate industry.\n\nCompared with the government work reports of the two sessions in the past few years, “promoting a virtuous cycle of the real estate industry” is a new formulation, which is a targeted policy requirement according to the new situation in the real estate market.\n\nSince the second half of 2021, the real estate market has been adjusted to a certain extent. After the downward trend of house prices, there has been a wait-and-see mood in the market. Especially after the financial default of some leading real estate development enterprises, there has been a certain degree of credit contraction in the real estate market: the requirements of financial institutions for credit financing risk control of real estate development enterprises have been greatly improved, The local government has obviously tightened the supervision of mortgage loans, which is directly reflected in the rapid slowdown of the growth rate of real estate financing. Therefore, the sales of the real estate market has declined, and the house prices have also declined to varying degrees. There is a typical “negative feedback” between funds and prices in the real estate market. Generally speaking, there is a vicious circle in the market. To promote the virtuous circle of the real estate industry is to stop this vicious circle.\n\nAt the press conference of the State Council held on March 2, Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, expressed his targeted views on the real estate financial policy. He said that some changes in the structure of real estate demand is a good thing for the financial industry, but he doesn’t want to adjust too violently and have too much impact on the economy. He still needs to convert smoothly. Last year, housing prices declined, real estate bubble, the problem of monetization has fundamentally reversed.\n\nIn the past few years, Guo Shuqing has repeatedly referred to the risks of real estate finance, worried that the real estate industry has taken up too much financial resources and worried about the impact and impact of the real estate bubble burst on the financial operation. Comparing his speech before and after, we can clearly feel that his view of the real estate market has changed greatly. If the previous speech was a severe warning to real estate finance, then the current speech released a considerable degree of warmth.\n\nThere are also changes in the real estate regulation policies of various cities. Since the fourth quarter of last year, cities have taken a series of measures to resolve the debt risk of real estate enterprises according to the operation of the local real estate market. For example, for the overdue debt of a real estate development enterprise in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Development and Reform Commission and other government departments will take the lead in coordinating with financial institutions. Hebei provincial government helped Huaxia happiness pass the debt restructuring plan in December 2021.\n\nIn order to stabilize market expectations, all localities have also taken various measures to stabilize real estate expectations. Many places have issued house purchase support policies, including house purchase deed tax subsidies, consumption voucher subsidies, new residents “house purchase vouchers”, housing provident fund loan concessions and other support for reasonable needs; Recently, some cities have reduced the down payment ratio of mortgage loans to 20%; Guangzhou and other major commercial banks coordinated to reduce the interest rate of mortgage loans at the same time.\n\nUnder the policy warm wind, the transaction volume of the real estate market has begun to rebound to the bottom. From the transaction data of second-hand houses, the average daily transaction volume in February this year has increased by about 30% compared with that in January, reversing the previous continuous decline. The second-hand housing prices also stopped falling and rebounded. In the first tier cities, the second-hand housing prices in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou increased slightly, and the second-hand housing prices in Shenzhen also increased slightly month on month. This is an important market signal.\n\nAccording to the data of Shell Research Institute, in February 2022, the number of customers in shell 50 cities increased by about 10% month on month, and the number of newly listed houses increased by nearly 60% month on month. In terms of market expectations, in February 2022, the prosperity index of second-hand houses in shell 50 city rebounded to 21, and the market is expected to maintain repair. It is expected that the overall trading volume of the second-hand housing market will increase significantly month on month in March, and the price will remain stable. From past experience, the sensitivity of the second-hand housing market to policies is ahead of that of the new housing market. After a quarter of the recovery of second-hand housing transactions, the transactions in the new housing market will begin to change.\n\nWhile there are positive changes in the market as a whole, we cannot ignore the potential risks. At present, the main problem affecting the virtuous cycle of the real estate market is that the debt risk of individual large-scale real estate development enterprises has not been fundamentally resolved, and the average debt level of the industry is still too high. How to realize the “soft landing” of financial deleveraging in the real estate industry is an important problem in real estate regulation and control this year.\n\nMassive information and accurate interpretation are all in Sina Finance app", "timestamp": 1649012259, "digest": "wuaPASIWw61_HXqb8HgGOzEPtCBV40JQl-jCiN_kUGs", "contributor": "0x32b63e4ACcfd105fCE52998467210A8ABDd228d8"}

As a result, there were twists and turns at the beginning of the “journey”.\n\nAfter the closing on March 2, Kaitai Petrochemical disclosed that the company received the consumption restriction order No. 2619 issued by Qingdao intermediate people’s Court (2021) Lu 02 on February 28, 2022, and took consumption restriction measures against Wang Zhiqing, Zhao Xia, Shandong qiwanda Petrochemical Co., Ltd., Shandong qiwanda Group Co., Ltd., Shandong qiwanda group Haizhong Petrochemical Co., Ltd. and Kaitai petrochemical.\n\nIt is disclosed that Kaitai petrochemical and the legal representative of the company shall not carry out the following high consumption and consumption behaviors that are not necessary for life and work:\n\nKaitai Petrochemical said that the measures taken to restrict consumption will not have a significant impact on the company’s operation and finance. However, Kaitai Petrochemical also stressed that the company is actively communicating and coordinating with creditors to deal with relevant matters and seek the best solution.\n\nJointly and severally liable for 130 million yuan\n\nIt is understood that when Kaitai Petrochemical built an 80000 ton acrylic acid project in 2012, qiwanda unilaterally guaranteed Kaitai petrochemical and the bank granted a credit of 500 million yuan to Kaitai petrochemical, making the project successfully completed. Later, qiwanda asked Kaitai Petrochemical to guarantee its current loan of 220 million yuan. Out of the cooperative relationship of equality and mutual benefit in bank loans, Kaitai Petrochemical provided guarantee to qiwanda.\n\nIt is disclosed that the 220 million yuan guaranteed by Kaitai Petrochemical to qiwanda is divided into two parts: 70 million yuan from Qilu Petrochemical Branch of China Construction Bank and 150 million yuan from Qingdao Branch of Huaxia Bank. Actual Loans: 65 million yuan from China Construction Bank and 130 million yuan from Huaxia Bank. Among them, the lending dates of Huaxia Bank are June 28 and 29, 2020 respectively.\n\nIn 2021, Huaxia Bank Qingdao Branch announced that the loan was due ahead of schedule, requiring qiwanda to repay the loan principal and pay interest, penalty interest, compound interest and other expenses, and the other guarantors shall bear joint and several liability for repayment.\n\nAccording to the judgment on June 23, 2021, qiwanda Petrochemical is required to repay the loan principal of 130 million yuan and the interest, penalty interest and compound interest of 3.765 million yuan of Huaxia Bank Qingdao branch within 10 days after the judgment takes effect (temporarily calculated to January 5, 2021, and then to the date of actual payment, the interest, penalty interest and compound interest shall be calculated and paid at the agreed interest rate).

At that time, new changes will take place in the development of transportation, culture, tourism and industry in Changsha.\n\n\\[Changsha Pingtang general airport project\\]\n\nHunan general airport and low altitude tourism demonstration base\n\nThe urban design of Xiangjiang Zhihang new town has officially passed the expert review recently. Changsha Pingtang general airport, located in Xiangjiang Zhihang new city, has started demolition work and will start construction within the year.\n\nAs a strategic emerging industry, the navigation industry occupies the largest incremental market in the world. In September 2020, Hunan was approved as the first pilot province of low altitude opening-up in the whole country. With the help of policy advantages, Hunan Xiangjiang new area plans Xiangjiang Zhihang new town in dawangshan area. The planned land area of the new town is 8.52 square kilometers, and the total investment in phase I development is about 14 billion yuan. According to the urban design scheme, Xiangjiang Zhihang new town is positioned as a national advanced intelligent manufacturing highland for navigation research and development, a headquarters base for navigation operation in Hunan Province and a well-known “immersive” science, technology, culture and tourism experience resort in China. The project will also become the “take-off T platform and Shanshui cloud hall” in the core area of Chang Zhu Tan integrated development.\n\n“Xiangjiang Zhihang new town will take shape by 2025 and become an important engine for the integrated development of Changsha, Zhuzhou and Xiangjiang according to the strategic goal of” building an image in three years and building a scale in five years. “ According to the relevant person in charge of Xiangjiang group, Xiangjiang Zhihang new town will focus on the navigation technology industry and build an industry city integration demonstration area integrating aviation manufacturing, R & D incubation, airport operation, cultural tourism, aviation exhibition and marketing, branch line transportation, flight training, research and education, aviation logistics and emergency rescue.\n\n\\[Xiangfu East Road Project\\]\n\nAdd another Liuyang River Bridge in the south of Changsha\n\nXiangfu East Road (Liuyang River Huangxing Avenue, including Xiangfu road Liuyang River Bridge) project is located in Changsha County.

When he withdrew the money, he found that the 13000 yuan cash he had put on the bedside table in his bedroom had disappeared.\n\nMr. Li found the cash on the bedside table in his bedroom missing\n\nAfter excluding the loss of money caused by external factors, Mr. Li began to suspect that the money was taken away by his 15-year-old son. After calling and asking his son, he learned that the money was indeed taken away by his son and has been used to recharge mobile games.\n\nRecharge record\n\nMr. Li’s son Xiao Li said that he had been addicted to online games since 2017 and had recharged more than 32000 yuan, and the money was taken secretly from home. Xiao Li said that after taking the cash from his home, he exchanged it into wechat change in a small shop near his home, and then recharged the mobile game with his mother’s wechat signal.\n\nIn order to further understand the situation, the reporter also asked the shopkeeper. According to the store owner, Xiao Li has repeatedly taken cash to the store to exchange wechat change, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, totaling tens of thousands of yuan.\n\n“Xiao Li cashed the money here. He said it would be more convenient to use it in school so as not to put it in his pocket. He also told me that the money was taken care of by others. If I knew that he cashed the money to recharge and play games, I would tell his parents and scold him.” The shopkeeper said.\n\nSon Xiao Li\n\nAs early as early November 2019, the State Press and Publication Administration issued the notice on preventing minors from indulging in online games. The notice puts forward six measures and makes specific provisions on the real name system, time management and consumption. Including: online game enterprises shall not provide game payment services for users under the age of 8; For game payment services provided by the same network enterprise, the single recharge amount of minor users over the age of 8 and under the age of 16 shall not exceed 50 yuan, and the cumulative recharge amount per month shall not exceed 200 yuan; For minor users over the age of 16, the single recharge amount shall not exceed 100 yuan, and the cumulative monthly recharge amount shall not exceed 400 yuan.\n\nMr. Li told reporters that last year, the couple were hospitalized due to car accidents and acute cerebrovascular accidents. Due to economic constraints, after treatment for a period of time, they both decided to leave the hospital and go home for conservative treatment. Now, the only money in the family is recharged by the children to play games, and then the cost of his wife’s treatment is gone. Some of the money is donated by colleagues. The money left for treatment was taken by his son to recharge the game. The husband and wife were at a loss.\n\nXiao Li: I know. I regret it very much now. I was addicted to playing games at that time. Now I just want to get the money back.\n\nMr. Li’s wife\n\nSubsequently, the reporter reflected this situation to the minor game supervision special line of the two game development and operation parties. The customer service of the game development and operation party said that it needs to provide game account, recharge record, mobile phone number and other information. After verification, it is confirmed that it is indeed an irrational consumption of minors, and it will be properly refunded.\n\nWe will continue to pay attention to the follow-up progress of this matter.\n\nWarm reminder\n\nParents should try not to control the cash card and password of minors, and do their best not to manage the cash card and password of minors. At the same time, schools and families should strengthen the education and management of minors, promote children to establish a correct concept of consumption and prevent the occurrence of impulsive consumption.", "timestamp": 1649012579, "digest": "iiYoLlanvNrfUZEfIBlqYFCtzNs9287VM4FrF80LkIQ", "contributor": "0xe7c6E036124294Ab256cC2fef55dbcf9f86Cf824"}

Caché dans ton ombre, j’ai fait mes premiers freestyles et enregistré mes récentes chansons.\n\nEnsemble, nous avons vécu tellement de choses. Des moments de gloire bien sûr, mais aussi des périodes de doutes et de frustrations. Nous avons encaissé les coups de notre ignorance, pleurés ensemble nos erreurs et nos mauvais choix. Tu es celui qui restait près de moi quand le rideau tombait, et que tout le monde partait, acteurs comme spectateurs.\n\nCombien de fois, dans ma chambre bassamoise, tu m’as écoutés parler de comment je voulais changer le monde ? Comme réponses à chaque fois, tu me promettais que nous allions y arriver, que j’étais le meilleur, que peu importe le temps que ça prendrait, nous verrions ensemble le bout du tunnel. Wolfy, mon ami, sans toi, je me serais sûrement tiré une balle.\n\nNotre histoire a été belle, trop belle. Mais comme dans toutes les histoires, il faut un point final, c’est le rôle joué par cette lettre. Ça tomberait dans le cliché de dire que le problème ne vient pas de toi, mais de moi, pourtant, c’est la strict vérité. Il faut qu’on soit honnêtes l’un envers l’autres, nous deux ça ne fonctionne plus. Nous sommes devenus trop différents. Avec l'age, mes rêves ont changé, mes ambitions aussi. Malheureusement, ta silhouette ne rentre plus dans le moule de ces dernières. Je veux aller à gauche, quand tu ne jures que pour la droite. Bref, nous sommes devenus trop différents, il faut qu’on s’arrête là.\n\n![Mixtape .CS disponible partout](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vAqb9Bd0l0diVaiuIWzhi.jpg?height=1080&width=1080)\n\nAvant que tu partes, je tenais à te remercier pour ce cadeau que tu m’as laissé ce premier avril. Cette mixtape dont moi et mes frères du côté sud rêvions depuis si longtemps, tu m’as permis de la finir. Pour cela, je te suis énormément reconnaissant. J’ose espérer que les personnes qui t’ont connu dans ma vie pourront profiter de ce dernier témoignage de ta présence.\n\n[https://fanlink.to/Cotesud-PointCS](https://fanlink.to/Cotesud-PointCS)\n\nAu revoir mon ami, au revoir Wolfy.\n\n`Abraham`", "timestamp": 1649012616, "digest": "QGPlBzfcZGNOu3SNNaEeZMy69FsezXSxQzLzSr9g-d0", "contributor": "0x96dbBd7A37f808c3879537c6FB5968f76126E05b"}

Many cadres of Liaoning rural credit system have been investigated", "body": "“Including Liu Bo, three leading cadres who once served as the ‘first and second leaders’ of Liaoning associated press have been sacked.”\n\nOn March 2, the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission reported that Liu Bo, party secretary and chairman of Liaoning financial holding group, was investigated on suspicion of serious violations of discipline and law.\n\nAccording to the official resume, Liu Bo, 56, joined the work in August 1992 and worked in the debt Department of Liaoning Provincial Department of Finance for 10 years in his early years; In 2002, he served as the head of the second financial department of the financial office of Liaoning provincial government; In May 2008, he was promoted to deputy director of Liaoning Provincial Finance Office; 6 years later, he was transferred to vice chairman and director of Liaoning Rural Credit Cooperatives Association.

In December 2020, he served as party secretary and chairman of Liaoning Financial Holding Group Co., Ltd. Liu Bo was still in office at the time of investigation.\n\nIt is worth noting that, including Liu Bo, three leading cadres who once served as the “first and second leaders” of Liaoning associated press have been sacked.\n\nSeveral cadres of Liaoning rural credit system were investigated,\n\nSomeone intervenes and interferes in the loan business of lower level banks and social security institutions\n\nIt is worth noting that Liu Bo once served as the director of Liaoning Rural Credit Union for more than three years. Before him, many cadres of the rural credit system in Liaoning had been investigated.\n\nOn March 2, the official website of Liaoning Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and supervision showed that Niu Jiliang, the former president of Fuxin Rural Commercial Bank, was suspected of serious violations of the law and is currently under supervision and investigation. According to official data, Niu Jiliang, 59, has worked in Fuxin Rural Credit System for many years since 1985 and served as president of Fuxin Rural Commercial Bank in 2014. In March 2019, he quit his leadership post and was demoted to the staff of the comprehensive office of Fuxin Rural Commercial Bank. After April 2021, he was appointed as the collector of the centralized non-performing assets clearing and collection center of Fuxin Rural Commercial Bank.\n\nDu Benwei, who once served as the first chairman of Liaoning Associated Press, was informed to accept the review and investigation on February 25. According to the official resume, Du Benwei served as the party secretary and chairman of Liaoning Rural Credit Union from June 2005 to March 2011. In the following five years, he successively served as vice mayor, mayor and Secretary of Huludao municipal Party committee. In February 2016, Du Benwei left politics and was transferred to the party secretary of Northeast University of Finance and economics, where he worked until August 2018. In March 2019, Du Benwei retired. The period from August 2018 to March 2019 has become a blank on Du Benwei’s resume.\n\nOn February 14, Wang Zhongyin, former Secretary of the Party committee and chairman of Liaoning Rural Credit Union, was opened. Wang Zhongyin, 59, served as the party secretary and chairman of Liaoning Rural Credit Union in December 2013 and was dismissed in April 2021.\n\nThe circular said that Wang Zhongyin illegally received gifts and gifts, illegally borrowed the vehicles of management and service objects, and accepted banquets that may affect the fair performance of official duties; Failing to report personal matters as required and seeking benefits for others in the selection and appointment of cadres; Engage in power trading, make profits through private lending and other financial activities, and illegally occupy the original unit’s house for personal use; Intervene and intervene in the loan business of subordinate banks and cooperatives; Taking advantage of the convenience of his position or the convenience formed by his power and status, he seeks benefits for others in matters such as job adjustment and bank loan handling, illegally accepts property, and abuses his power in the exercise of administrative power, resulting in heavy losses to public property and the interests of the state and the people.\n\nDu Benwei, Wang Zhongyin and the latest checked Liu Bo have sacked three leading cadres who once served as the “first and second leaders” of Liaoning associated press.\n\nLiaoning Provincial Associated Press governs 60 rural commercial banks and credit cooperatives\n\nAccording to the information on the official website, Liaoning Rural Credit Cooperatives (hereinafter referred to as “Liaoning rural credit”) was founded in 1952. The management system has undergone many changes and the management organization has changed several times. On July 20, 2005, with the consent of the provincial government and the approval of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the Liaoning Federation of rural credit cooperatives (hereinafter referred to as the “Provincial Association”) was officially established. According to the relevant requirements, the provincial association is led by the Liaoning provincial Party committee and the provincial government. It is a local financial institution with independent legal personality, consisting of municipal agricultural commercial banks, municipal agricultural associations, County-Level Agricultural commercial banks and county-level agricultural associations. It implements democratic management, mainly performs the functions of industry self-discipline management and service, does not directly engage in banking business activities.\n\nLiaoning rural credit main business covers absorbing public deposits; Issue short-term, medium-term and long-term loans, and handle bill acceptance and discount; Handle domestic settlement; Acting as an agent for issuing, cashing and underwriting government bonds; Buying and selling government bonds and financial bonds; Engaging in interbank lending; Acting for collection and payment of funds and insurance business; Engage in bank debit card business; Providing safe deposit box services and other business areas approved by the banking regulatory authority of the State Council. It has 27747 employees (including 26431 in-service employees) and 11798 party members.\n\nAt present, Liaoning Provincial associated press has 20 departments, 6 regional audit centers and 12 municipal liaison service offices. It has jurisdiction over 2 Municipal Agricultural commercial banks, 28 County-Level Agricultural commercial banks and 30 county-level credit cooperatives in Shenyang and Dalian. By the end of 2021, the province’s deposits had exceeded 700 billion yuan, loans had increased by 46 billion yuan, 41195 Pratt & Whitney small and micro loans with a single credit of less than 10 million yuan, and the balance was 55.91 billion yuan. The total amount and increment of agriculture related loans ranked first in the Province.\n\nThe strengthening of financial anti-corruption in Liaoning may be related to risk disposal\n\nInsiders pointed out that Liaoning Province is a place with heavy regional financial risks. In recent years, some enterprise defaults in Liaoning Province are mostly intertwined with the operational risks of local banks. It is very important for Liaoning’s economic development to effectively prevent and resolve the hidden dangers of financial risks. Recently, Liaoning Province has been cracking down on financial anti-corruption, which is also likely to be related to the financial risk disposal of the banking industry in Liaoning Province.\n\nOn March 3, the financial stability bureau of the central bank issued a document pointing out that after concentrated tackling, the risk points accumulated for a long time in China’s financial system have been effectively disposed of, including the safe disposal of the risks of a number of small and medium-sized financial institutions with large Risk Spillover to the financial system, such as Jinzhou bank.\n\nRecently, the provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection at all levels issued a summary of the key areas of discipline inspection in the city in 2021", "timestamp": 1649012499, "digest": "XsC8qx3StnljtR6VUxzyxxdE3OIAUynhZt_ZOJsUp-E", "contributor": "0x415c4BEd0d0f04f858EbCb955DA9B62358CC5d14"}

The younger brother of the second middle school of the post-90s generation must be one of them. He majored in science and engineering. In six years, he traveled all over Guangzhou in his spare time and took 100000 photos.\n\nAiqun Hotel \n\nUnder his lens, behind the CBD building in Guangzhou, which has thousands of faces and the most prosperous economy, is a dilapidated village in the city.\n\nXian village, Guangzhou\n\nThe crowded and noisy streets were as silent as an empty city due to the sudden epidemic.\n\nLianxiang building\n\nPearl River New Town\n\nA collection of photos taken in Guangzhou in 2017 made the second middle school brother burst into flames. Many people call his photos “God’s perspective”, looking down from high altitude, covering everything, real and novel!\n\nStone chamber\n\nThe shared bicycles cleaned up due to the cleanliness of the city are stacked on the open space. Last Monday, we went to Guangzhou to interview the second middle school brother and listen to him tell his shooting story, “if I can, I want to be the person who shoots the most in Guangzhou.”\n\nTianhuan square\n\nA talent of science and technology, he took 100000 photos for Guangzhou in six years\n\nMy name is Chen Chong. Because the word “Chong” is composed of two points of water and middle, I take the net name “Er Zhong brother”.\n\nHe grew up in Chaozhou and went to university in Guangzhou in 2009. I got off from Zhujiang New Town and saw hundreds of meters of buildings rising from the ground. It was very shocking and I had the desire to shoot it.\n\nCanton Tower\n\nBut at that time, first, I didn’t have money to buy a camera. Second, I was not familiar with photography when I studied optics in China.\n\nBecause I like walking, I visit every place over and over again. South to the big port of Longxue Island, north to the small village next to Baiyun Airport, down to the underground tunnel, up to the spire of the tallest building in Guangzhou.\n\nThe more you know, the more you feel about Guangzhou. It is not only a rapidly developing metropolis, but also retains many buildings of the Republic of China, which is full of historical details.\n\nGradually, the city became more and more complex and three-dimensional in my heart. In the ancient and modern, prosperous and desolate collision.\n\nI had the idea to write it down completely. So I began to read books, watch videos and learn photography a little bit.\n\nSacred Heart stone chamber Cathedral\n\nIn 2015, I bought a camera with my salary and began to take photos.\n\nBecause he is introverted and doesn’t like to communicate with people, the urban architectural landscape has become the focus of shooting.\n\nSita\n\nSita usually takes pictures after work and on holidays. Until now, about one or two thousand pictures are taken every month. Up to now, there are almost 100000 photos.\n\nWhen one location is finished, shoot another. From spring to winter, looking back at this place, it is a different perspective, and then it is a new feeling.\n\nLu Xun Museum\n\nThree Guangzhou in my eyes\n\nIn 2019, when sorting out the photos, I found an interesting thing. If divided according to the type of buildings, I took “three Guangzhou”.\n\nNansha Port\n\nThe old Guangzhou is dominated by ancient buildings and old urban areas, the new Guangzhou is dominated by the skyscrapers of the Pearl River New Town, and the other is Guangzhou represented by villages in the city.\n\nLiwan Flower Street\n\nIf you want to use a word to describe the old city, it is “years are quiet and good”.\n\nThere are more traditional old Guangzhou people living here. The towering trees on both sides of the road, like the surrounding buildings, have a history of nearly 100 years.\n\nLiurong tower\n\nWhen you see the neighbors cycling through the streets, you can strongly feel the integration of architecture and nature. The time is still the same. It is completely two worlds with the noise outside.\n\nZhongshan Hall\n\nNew Guangzhou is not much different from other big cities. Office buildings and shopping malls gather and the pace is also very fast. There are many young people walking on the street, in a hurry and dressed brightly.\n\nBut when you arrive at a village in the city hundreds of thousands of meters away, it looks completely different. Most of them are self built buildings built by local people. The floors are low and very dense.\n\nXian Village\n\nIn the morning, you can also see some recruitment signs. Sewing workers and cement workers are like entering a small town with a strong flavor of life.\n\nIn the evening, many fashionable white-collar workers working in the city center came back to live. Despite the noisy environment and dark tide of the room, almost every young man from other places has lived here because the rent is cheap.\n\nGuangzhou three towers from the perspective of Datang Village\n\nTherefore, when I take the CBD as the background and shoot it together with the village in the city to make a more three-dimensional and intuitive comparison, the sense of contrast and drama arise.\n\nOnly separated by a wall, one is full of dreams and one makes people feel that the future is bleak!\n\nI dare not say that this is the most comprehensive Guangzhou, but it will let you know it from another perspective.\n\nThere are different scenes on both sides of the transparent tunnel of Huangpu Avenue\n\nA photo, a story\n\nAlthough I seldom deal with people, for me, taking a picture is a different experience and an unforgettable story.\n\nLiuhua Lake\n\nIn 2018, the kapok tree photographed in Panyu school palace was my favorite work.\n\nIn order to get the feeling you want, I climbed to the rooftop. At first, I just wanted to take pictures of the trees and the surrounding environment. But in the process of constantly adjusting the angle, a girl who looked up at the flowers entered the mirror and echoed with me.\n\nLater, this photo became a red map of the Internet. Many people came here to punch in and pose the same pose. A small accident, a big surprise, a moment of beauty, can be met but not sought!\n\nTanchun, Panyu school Palace\n\nOf course, the sad picture was also recorded.\n\nIn August and September 2018, several urban areas in Guangdong suffered a flood once in 50 years, and many villages were flooded.\n\nEverything in front of me was painful. I took the camera and restored the scene as much as possible.\n\nThe roads were destroyed, and the victims tried all kinds of ways to travel and transfer. Lifebuoys, bulldozers and all kinds of self-made boats went into battle together.\n\nLate at night, the rescue team has also been sticking to their posts, which is very touching.\n\nGuangzhou has already turned hot in May.\n\nHowever, affected by the epidemic, hard-working workers and school children have to wear masks.\n\nIt’s a good time for flowers to bloom, but I feel very heavy. All the bad things should disappear quickly!\n\nI don’t want to take photos deliberately. I just want to be a recorder in Guangzhou\n\nAfter shooting for so long, it began to be known by more and more people. Some people asked whether they would deliberately take photos and use PS to make their photos more beautiful and get more awards.\n\nI still follow my heart when taking photos. I won’t set many goals in advance. I must get something and enjoy the process of taking photos while walking.\n\nTianhe Sports Center Square\n\nAt ordinary times, I have seen a lot of reports about the award of swing shooting. If the rules allow, it is understandable to pursue a visual effect.\n\nIt is used in documentary photography", "timestamp": 1649012719, "digest": "lcZEV8eoZJhj5kG5x_C45nIlwPv5ZeXdZLRZ8fG_UP0", "contributor": "0xd1e5ffa436E0DF7d72a21D00C8f486384D1FfFDD"}

Consumers: the quality is not worthy of the name", "body": "Recently, Ms. Zhang, a citizen of Jinan, complained to reporters through a black cat complaint that there was a quality problem with the about brand three seat sofa she spent 10000 yuan to buy in Jinan home, and the sofa still had obvious defects after exchange. Ms. Zhang’s coordination has not been resolved for nearly three months. The reporter contacted the left and right sofa brand manufacturers, which said they were urging dealers and consumers to solve it as soon as possible.\n\nAccording to Ms. Zhang, on October 7, 2021, she ordered a conventional three person sofa of left and right brands in a store of Jinan home. After receiving the sofa on December 6, she and her family found that the leather part of the sofa was worn in many places, so they communicated with the merchant to return the sofa, and then communicated with the merchant to return the sofa. However, the merchant refused to return the sofa because it was a customized product, but promised to replace it with a new sofa.\n\n“The sofa we bought is not customized, and it is not stated in the contract that it is a customized product.” Ms. Zhang said that the merchant agreed to replace it with a new sofa, so she reluctantly agreed.\n\nBut to her surprise, the sofa after replacement was received on January 6, and this sofa also had defects. “The sofa has obviously used dust, and the leather behind the backrest also has traces of repair. It’s not a new sofa at all.” Therefore, she asked the merchant to return the goods again, but the merchant took a tough attitude and did not accept the return.\n\nIn desperation, Ms. Zhang complained to the mayor’s hotline 12345. The feedback given to her by the 12345 mayor’s hotline is that the merchant does not accept the return. The merchant asks the consumer to prove that the product is not a new sofa before giving the return. Ms. Zhang consulted the relevant appraisal department, which told her that she could not issue such a certificate. “The staff of the appraisal department told me that the defects of this product are visible to the naked eye, and there is no corresponding appraisal standard for this certificate.”\n\n“It’s hard for them to put forward such identification requirements and make it clear!” Ms. Zhang said helplessly.\n\nPicture provided by the interviewee\n\nIn this regard, the reporter contacted the customer service of the left and right sofa merchants and reflected Ms. Zhang’s experience to them. After that, the relevant staff of the left and right brands contacted the reporters. According to the staff of the left and right sofa, the dealers have been urged to contact consumers and solve the problems encountered by consumers as soon as possible.\n\nRecently, the reporter received feedback from Ms. Zhang. Ms. Zhang said that the customer service of stores and manufacturers have contacted her these days. “Yesterday I went to the merchant to talk about it. The merchant said that it was to replace the opened sponge of the backrest with a whole piece, replace the leather with repair marks on the backrest with a new one, and replace the seat cushion splicing sponge.”\n\nMs. Zhang said: “I was originally buying a new product, so I have to replace the parts before they are useless. In addition, I have changed it once, and there are some problems. Will there be any problems when I repair it? I have no confidence in the business. What if there are more problems?”", "timestamp": 1649012745, "digest": "SPutFDzE8a3UJD47iJczrwBfKeiK5fKWymsoBZLwjAo", "contributor": "0x813e077C75a597E98e8bCd8a301dd41aD006Ca35"}

On the morning of September 1, the Xiangxi detachment of the armed police held a farewell ceremony for veterans in the summer and autumn of 2021.\n\nAt about 9 am, with the solemn national anthem, the ceremony officially began. Three flag guards, escorting the bright red flag of the armed police force, walked forward with sonorous steps and straight military posture.\n\n“Welcome the flag of the armed police force and salute the flag of the armed police force!” The flag bearer waved the flag of the armed police force vigorously. At this moment, all retired veterans were full of deep feelings, extended the most solemn military salute to the military flag, and said goodbye to the barracks and comrades in arms accompanied by day and night in gratitude and reluctance.\n\nLooking around the camp, veteran Xie Geng found that every corner here left unforgettable memories: “five years of military life is fleeting. I really don’t want to leave this warm family! I felt bitter during training in the past and wanted to end it quickly. Today is really going to end, but I hope to do it again!”\n\n“The discharge ceremony is not only a ‘farewell ceremony’ for everyone to leave the military camp, but also a ‘charge horn’ for everyone to start a new journey.” At the ceremony, Chen Junyu, the leader of the Xiangxi detachment of the armed police force and the commissar of political commissar, paid the highest respect to the veterans respectively, and encouraged them to continue to maintain the true colors of the soldiers, and to carry forward the spirit of “taking the road as if they were so strong, and now stepping forward from the beginning” to create a new career in their new job.\n\n“Squad leader, come back often.

Mango TV international app (mangotv), official channel of youtube, world TV, IU TV channel of Portugal, Chinanet, yoywow overseas all media matrix and other platforms are popular all over the world.\n\nLi Fulin, a graduate of Dalian Ocean University majoring in aquaculture, works in Beijing Aquarium and is mainly responsible for large-scale pond fish culture in seawater area. Li Fulin has been full of longing for the ocean and marine life since she was a child. Now she has been struggling to protect the ocean and marine life. In this issue of the guardian of the aquarium, we will follow Su Xiaoxiao, a senior fan of the aquarium from Russia, to Beijing Aquarium, the largest aquarium in Beijing, experience the daily work of marine fish breeder Li Fulin, and visit the story behind her work in the aquarium as a large-scale marine tank breeder.\n\nWith enthusiasm, busy every day, complex work makes a beautiful ocean world\n\nLi Fulin led Su Xiaoxiao to the shark hall and excitedly introduced her to all kinds of fish and their names, which surprised Su Xiaoxiao: “it turns out that every fish has its own name.” In addition, she was also deeply moved by the lovely and warm interaction between Li Fulin and these fish. Then, Su Xiaoxiao followed Li Fulin to the bait room in the backyard and the cold storage for temporarily storing the bait of the fish. She listened to her detailed explanation of the bait of the fish and the sterilization of the bait.\n\nThis “cold storage trip” made Su Xiaoxiao understand that although the outside ocean world is very beautiful and spectacular, when you go behind the scenes, you will find that this job is more cumbersome and complex than expected. Li Fulin enjoys it. In the eyes of her colleagues, she insists on doing these repetitive and boring work with the fullest enthusiasm every day. “She is very busy every day. Her cell phone rings from morning to night. She wants to know what the secret is in her cell phone.” Li Fulin’s colleagues said with a smile. Su Xiaoxiao found that she had set nearly a dozen alarm clocks to remind the work process from 7:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. See the true chapter for details. Her seriousness and perseverance vividly show the persistence and struggle of young Party members at the grass-roots level.\n\nCheck carefully, take care of patiently, and highly integrate professional and life\n\nLi Fulin’s daily work is to carefully check and record the fish conditions, equipment and exhibition environment, and prepare fresh bait for fish and feed them. Sometimes when fish don’t eat, farmers need to be more patient and wait for its appetite to recover. But what worries Li Fulin most is when the fish is sick. “We can’t determine the cause of his illness at once, so it takes some time, but during this time, I often feel so anxious that I can’t sleep.”\n\nLi Fulin recalled an impressive experience. At that time, parasitic diseases broke out in the pool of the swimming pool, but these parasites were rare in the inland aquarium. Relevant personnel immediately tested various drugs to treat the fish. Under careful care, they slowly recovered their health, and Li Fulin’s hanging heart finally settled down. Through this event, Li Fulin reflected on her work and continuously strengthened her thinking on work, improvement of details and improvement of herself in practice.\n\nYoung Party members, brave and responsible, and protecting the marine environment urgently need to be paid attention to\n\n“What makes you stick to it?” Foreign friend Su Xiaoxiao raised his questions to Li Fulin. Li Fulin admitted that this is my responsibility. “We repeat these boring work every day. In fact, it is also very hard, but seeing these fish grow from small to large, from illness to health, and breed the next generation makes us feel that our efforts are worth it.” She also explained to Su Xiaoxiao the reasons for raising fish in the aquarium - on the one hand, to give them a stable environment, on the other hand, to tell tourists to protect the marine environment and protect the home where fish live.\n\nThe one-day experience made Su Xiaoxiao deeply understand that many young people like Li Fulin are making contributions to the sustainable development of aquarium industry. With the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind, more and more Chinese people overcome all difficulties and contribute their strength to the marine biodiversity of the world!\n\n“Shining ordinary: Youth relay” officially ends today. The program tells the struggle process of Chinese young Communists in the new era, new industries and new posts from an exotic perspective, which fully and vividly shows the Chinese story and the ideological and spiritual power behind it. In the future, mango TV will continue to take content as the carrier, further explore the diversified ways of “international expression of Chinese stories”, tell Chinese stories well with works, and promote Chinese culture to go global.", "timestamp": 1649012965, "digest": "7U5WSDzdD_Irzp7Am7YCBYC25L1-2TwNXHOJxuvFTOA", "contributor": "0xD32f3D167004Ae4FEdfb28f482FF89297628D246"}

Management Office: the male bear is photographed, and efforts are being made to photograph the female bear and the baby bear", "body": "According to Shaoyang daily, recently, Hunan Nanshan National Park photographed a precious video of black bears foraging honey, a national secondary key wild animal under protection, for the first time. In the video, a strong male black bear leisurely walks out of the bamboo forest and sniffs a beehive placed by the rock. After confirming that there is no honey in the beehive or honey is scarce, the black bear staggers into the depths of the bamboo forest. It is very cute.\n\nXiao Huigui, senior forestry engineer of jintongshan Nature Reserve Management Office of Nanshan National Park Administration, told reporters that this image was found by the staff of jintongshan nature reserve management office when sorting out the image data taken by infrared camera on August 24. At about 6 p.m. on July 29, the image of a black bear weighing about 150 kg swaggering for honey appeared in front of the infrared camera lens in the Mingzhu Laoshan area.\n\nThis is the first precious video of black bear, a national second-class key wild animal protected in Shaoyang in recent 20 years. “The black bear is fat, shiny and healthy.”\n\nAccording to Xiao Huigui, as early as 1997, a girl from jintongshan village, Tingping Township found a pair of black bear cubs while pulling pig grass up the mountain. Later, the local forestry police station sent them to the provincial botanical garden for breeding, and now they have successfully bred their offspring. In recent years, according to the local residents of Jintong Mountain Nature Reserve, the beehives they placed in Mingzhu Laoshan area are often destroyed by unidentified animals, and the beehives inside are also swept away. “Local residents suspect that the black bear did it.” According to the clues reflected by residents, the staff of the reserve conducted in-depth field investigations for many times and found footprints, feces, claw marks, etc. left by suspected black bears. However, because the black bear has a sensitive sense of smell and hearing and a wide range of activities, no living image of the black bear has been taken.\n\nThe staff of the management office consulted the relevant materials of the black bear, described the “trouble making” situation of the black bear in combination with visiting local residents, carried out all-round control, constantly adjusted the monitoring scheme, and finally took the high-definition image of the black bear four months later.\n\nAt the bottom of the video, some netizens worried that “it seems that we should pay attention to safety when going to Nanshan in the future”.\n\nHow to prevent accidents in which black bears hurt people? In this regard, Xiao Huigui said that the black bear has poor eyesight, sensitive sense of smell and hearing and strong alertness. It is generally difficult for the surrounding residents to see it. Even if they encounter it occasionally, they will walk away soon. “This is a male bear. According to local bee farmers, the female bear has also appeared with a group of cubs, but it hasn’t been photographed yet. We’re working hard.”", "timestamp": 1649013098, "digest": "I85JpDlVoVLIaZyZ6mDxU161gbIIeDTubaZane7U1QQ", "contributor": "0xDb8D150E30a760939B864F459d3Ecd0dB9649d99"}

The six high-end brands of Swatch Group, baopo, Baoji, yakdro, hairy Winston, grasuti original and omega, concentrated their efforts in this activity and released the key new products of the whole year at one time. What key styles worthy of attention have been released this time? Let’s follow the Xiaobian to taste one product. (Editor: Julien \\[microblog\\])\n\nBlancpain \n\nHeaven is fearless into the sea\n\nAir command Watch\n\nTechnical features: fly back timing function, limited to 500 pieces\n\nThe most important new product of baopo in 2019 is a newly launched replica pilot style air force commander watch. I believe many people don’t know that baopo once produced pilot watches. This watch was born out of the 50th series. In the 1950s, Pope ordered 12 sample watches for the US Air Force with his highly successful 50th series diving watch.\n\nOn the right is a replica watch, and on the left is a prototype air command removed from Mark Hayek’s wrist\n\nTherefore, the prototype wristwatch is extremely rare. This time, we were lucky to see one of the 12 wristwatches on the wrist of mark Hayek, the Global CEO of bopper, which is also a valuable private collection of the boss.\n\nThe replica watch faithfully restores all the details of the prototype watch in the 1950s, and the back transparent design is the biggest highlight. The 22K Gold pendulum is designed in the shape of a hollowed out aircraft propeller. Senior media people who have been immersed in the watch ring for many years can’t help exclaiming at the moment of seeing the back design. According to Mr. Hayek’s introduction, this watch will not form a new series, but only as a limited style with great collection value, and will not necessarily be reproduced in the future.\n\nFifty bar akuda limited edition watch\n\nTechnical features: two color rectangular time scale\n\nAll the replica diving watches launched by the 50 series in the past two years, without exception, are on fire, which once again confirms the strong vitality of this series. The prototype of the replica 50 meter launched in 2019 comes from a 50 meter civil diving watch sold by barakuda, a German professional diving equipment manufacturer in the 1960s.\n\nThe most remarkable feature of the fifty year barakuda limited edition wristwatch is that the time mark adopts the way of two-color display, and the end of the time mark is covered with bright red, which is clearer when reading underwater. 6. 9. The 12 point time scale adopts a wide rectangle, which is completely consistent with the prototype watch. The raised ceramic bezel is round and smooth with excellent hand feel. Limited to 500 pieces, it can be predicted that many people will be crazy about her this year.\n\nBaoji\n\nJi carving shows the peak craft\n\nClassique classic series 5395 ultra thin Tourbillon hollow out wristwatch\n\nTechnical features: Ji carved hollow splint Tourbillon\n\n5395 is the master of craft and technology offered by Breguet in 2019. It integrates three superb watchmaking processes: tourbillon, Breguet carving and hollow splint. The four point Tourbillon uses a titanium frame and weighs less than 0.3 grams. In order to achieve the ideal hollowed out effect, the watchmakers of Baoji removed up to 50% of the raw materials on the splint and retained only the necessary parts of the bridge, achieving an unprecedented transparent effect.\n\nA large number of hollows make the chamfering grinding process very difficult. At the edge of the hollow movement splint, you can see the sharp 45 degree chamfer, and all of them have been polished. Only the pure manual chamfer can achieve such a sharp angle.\n\nJi carving is another amazing craft. On the only splint left in the movement, the craft masters of Baoji all decorated the Paris nail pattern decoration with a diameter as thick as hair by hand. Only under the microscope can we see the perfect conical details of the Paris nail pattern like a pyramid.\n\nBaoji marine navigation series\n\nTechnical features: navigation style, titanium material, calendar / timing / ringing\n\nOne of the pride of Breguet in history is that it was awarded the title of “Royal Navy watchmaker” by the French royal family, which witnessed the proud achievements of Breguet master in the production of navigation precision instruments. The marine navigation series newly launched in 2019 pays tribute to the navigation tradition of Baoji brand in a modern tabulation style.\n\n5547 music alarm watch\n\nThe three new marine navigation series are all made of titanium, including 5547 music alarm watch, 5527 timing watch and 5517 calendar watch. It covers the whole line from complex functions to daily use, and the design of functions is closely related to the history of navigation, with both traditional elegance and sports vitality.\n\nHarry Winston \n\nThe watchmaking attack of the “king of diamonds”\n\n20th anniversary lunar phase function watch of Fifth Avenue classic series\n\nTechnical features: diamond inlay and lunar phase function\n\n2019 is also the 20th anniversary of the launch of the Fifth Avenue series. Therefore, Harry Winston has launched a new lunar phase series. The quartz movement with lunar phase function is exclusively developed by baopo. Among them, the 20th anniversary lunar phase function wristwatch of Avenue classic series is limited to 20 pieces, especially showing the impeccable diamond inlay technology of the “king of diamonds”.\n\nOn the beautiful white 18K gold watch chain, 216 blue and purple sapphires with different color scales are embedded to form a unique double row shape. With 66 round bright cut diamonds, the whole watch chain is very flexible. The manufacturing technology of mother of pearl dial with gradual color is still confidential to the outside world.\n\nGlashütte Original \n\nGo to the underwater world!\n\nSpezialist sea Q diving watch\n\nTechnical features: Retro diving German calendar\n\nIt’s a new series release of “see you for a long time”! Did you know that glasudi once made diving watches? This time, with the spezimatic type RP TS 200m diving watch produced in 1969 as the prototype, grasuti launched a brand-new diving watch series, with a total of three watches, including a limited number of 69 reprints, an unlimited ordinary version and a large calendar diving watch.\n\nnineteen", "timestamp": 1649013096, "digest": "Nsst0sR71h52eVAZKMCxWZOTU2MLqUAa3NL1cS7XlbQ", "contributor": "0xa5DD914E8fb6d313072d85b278D61d762598C89b"}

Wang Wei of Tang Dynasty proposed that “there is painting in poetry and poetry in painting”. Su Dongpo of the Northern Song Dynasty has a poem saying: “if you want to make poetry beautiful, there is no weariness of space and stillness, stillness leads to group movement, and emptiness leads to all kinds of environment”. In the creation of landscape painting, the blank is handled well, the picture has the air of emptiness, and the realm is fully open, which makes people daydream.\n\nSong fan kuanxi Mountain Travel Map collected by Taipei Palace Museum\n\nTo draw a good landscape painting, we must first learn landscape poetry well. Only poetic landscape painting can better express the artistic conception and ethereal beauty in landscape painting, such as: “half of the mountain is buried with rain clouds, the mountain is in the void and misty, the mountain scenery is also strange with empty rain, the smoke has no roots and trees, especially the boneless mountain outside the rain, the smoke and clouds come out, half in the void and half in the mountain, the river flows out of heaven and earth, and the mountain scenery is in the void”, These poems describing scenery are full of hazy feeling and ethereal beauty.\n\nEthereal is a kind of realm, which is the meaning outside the image pursued by landscape painters. It uses limited artistic images to express infinite artistic realm.\n\nSong Guoxi’s early spring picture collected by the National Palace Museum in Taipei\n\n“All things are content to observe quietly. The Tao leads to heaven and earth. Outside the visible, the rivers and mountains are picturesque, beautiful inside and quiet in the middle”. The rivers and mountains have great beauty without words. Painters should be good at observing the mysteries of mountains and rivers, and then form bamboos in their chest, and use lyrical pen and ink to shape the beautiful scenery of natural mountains and rivers, so as to convey the spirit of mountains and rivers and achieve the artistic realm of the unity of heaven and man.\n\nWhen we enjoy the scenery of Huangshan Mountain, if there is no sea of clouds, we suddenly feel at a glance and uninteresting. Huangshan Mountain is haunted by a sea of clouds, covered with clouds, and white clouds are ready to move. It gives people a kind of fairyland on earth, which is wonderful. This is the ethereal beauty of mountains and rivers, which can not be ignored by painters.\n\nMeditation of Yungu temple in Huangshan, Hongren, Qing Dynasty\n\nThe creation of landscape painting should be half ethereal and half mysterious. The white plan should be black, pay attention to implication, and get the charm outside the painting without a stroke. If the blank is handled well, the picture will be vivid and moving, otherwise it will not succeed. To draw a landscape painting with ethereal beauty, we have to work hard on the word “emptiness”. Mountains, stones and trees are originally physical objects, which are applied with the emptiness of clouds and fog. The picture suddenly feels emptiness, emptiness and reality coexist, emptiness means spirit, emptiness is both qi and charm is vivid. If you fill the picture with objects and images, you will lose vitality and the interest of emptiness. The composition of Chinese landscape painting leaves a large area of blank on the picture. Its purpose is to explore the aesthetic feeling of space outside the picture with the viewer.\n\nZhang Daqian’s poetic map of Shaoling, 1979\n\nWhen we appreciate the ink splashing and color splashing landscape paintings of Mr. Zhang Daqian and Mr. Liu Haisu, we can especially appreciate the ethereal beauty of landscape painting.\n\nTheir paintings are large, vertical and horizontal, freely splashed, guided by the situation, dripping ink, flowing naturally, unexpected and interesting. In the picture, the clouds in the mountains flow, and the distant mountains seem hidden. Adding scenery, figures, houses and fishing boats, it is really wonderful to create nature and full of fun, highlighting the ethereal beauty of landscape painting, and has made outstanding contributions to the development of Chinese freehand landscape painting.", "timestamp": 1649013394, "digest": "VHaWBY1cwSjTD24P9bPbkDPc9s47FWlAqMCA37GCPX0", "contributor": "0xd5eC07B0E1C28CfE10925733a4Ee99813c8292B7"}

It shows all the many big companies that emerged each of which tackled just one small segment of what Craig’s List did. You could go with the phrase [Unbundling Craig’s List.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/craigslist-unbundling/) Craig Newmark never bothered with a Craig’s List 2.0. The first version is still chugging along. It is still in business.   \n\nWhen I look at the Blockchain, I see something like this, only much, much larger. Google is not your local library digitized. When you digitize a service, you birth a whole new animal. Because you can add intelligence every which way. \n\nIn a way, it is just money on the Blockchain. But then it is not because it is digital and intelligent. Governments around the world are all geared to make the mistake of thinking it is just money, just digitized. And so let’s introduce the digital dollar, the digital yuan, the digital rupee. But a fundamental element of the Bitcoin is that there are going to be only so many. Governments on the other hand like to conjure up new money out of thin air. They want to be in charge. They want to increase the money supply. \n\nIt is obvious that numerous large companies are going to be built along the way as the Blockchain promise is realized. There are going to be a ton of trillion-dollar companies. Old industries stand to be upended. But entirely new industries will be created. \n\nThe beauty is that it is going to be bottom-up this time. The Blockchain is going to eat up Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Alibaba, and Tencent. It is going to eat up the Chinese Communist Party, yet another Big Data monolith waiting to be broken up. \n\nI have met [Craig Newmark](https://www.netizen.page/2010/01/craig-newmark-dennis-crowley-jennifer-8.html), by the way.

Using crypto-native tools that provide tamper-proof, permanent action accountability and security from the beginning and also work to relieve common frictions in the fiat realm like *key-person dependency risk*, we saw in practice the potential of crypto to defend democracy and preserve agency in open societies.

From this experience, we found that there’s a large gap to fill with onboarding technical talent to Web3 in a frictionless way. We plan to collaborate with L1 foundations, groups and organisations like **Solana Foundation**, **NEAR Foundation,**  **Buildspace**, **AWET**, **Blockchain Engineering Lagos,** **Blockchain Acceleration Foundation**, **Rust Lagos**, who are creating funnels for Web2 to Web3 talent onboarding, general technical education on blockchain development and other budding technologies\n\nIn that same vein, it is especially important to bring underrepresented groups into the fold from inception by devoting resources to upskill people who have systematically been excluded from leading development. **For nascent technologies to be truly resonant with the masses, we must be seen to be deeply embedded in the solution.**\n\nThe past few months have been about laying the foundation, proving our concepts and nurturing organic growth. We have cultivated a space where bright, bold ideas turn to impactful solutions. We remain nimble to adapt to the contours of imagination and flexible enough for the dynamic nature of the space. Over the next few months, we will work to further establish our position within the Web3 landscape as a community-oriented, culturally-forward institution and incubator of paradigm-shifting ideas which reflect our mission of **making knowledge, resources and products pertaining to Web3, crypto and blockchain technology accessible to and effective for Africans.**\n\n## What is our story? How are we telling it?\n\nIt is one thing to realise the existence of something, and another to design systems that effectively harness its power. **Storytelling** and **world-building** are values highly pertinent to the overarching mission of COLDS. **Lorecrafting** sits at the crux of these two values.\n\nWe believe that new paradigms yielding new fruit must be navigated with intention, so every chapter of our story is being written with care. Lorecrafting, and establishing a coherent organisational story are crucial to ensuring that all members of our community are well-aligned in context, expectations and priorities. The narratives and belief systems that emerge from this period of deep exploration  will work to sustain a common thread of vision and work across the spread. We are deeply researching and reviewing our organisational practices against existing critical theories like *The 8 Metaphors of Organization* and using these frameworks to conjure up our true North Star.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cSQBRHlkYb51sQ_gIRhi3.PNG?height=502&width=491)\n\n![From Rafa’s Community Operational Framework](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QJTTv-piziMoZ8AdXj6Uk.jpg?height=224&width=262)\n\n## So what’s next for COLDS?\n\nWe have a ton planned for the next quarters to keep creating value for our community members, expanding our offerings and writing our story.

He had more than $2.2 million of NFT art stolen, The 15 disappeared NFT works come from the famous online series of “bored ape Yacht Club” and “mutant ape Yacht Club”. It is said that the theft is due to an online fraud. Opensea, the NFT trading platform, intervened by preventing further transactions in the series.\n\nTodd Kramer’s stolen NFT collection, one of the boring ape man series\n\nKramer and his partner Ryan Ross jointly founded Ross + Kramer Gallery in New York. At the age of 24, Kramer entered the art world because of his enthusiastic interest in American new pop artist Keith haring. With the popularity of NFT art, Kramer became an NFT collector again.\n\nKramer asked for help online and said, “I was attacked by hackers. All my ape men are gone.” The twitter community quickly responded to his post and received more than 500 forwards. Some users support and actively help collectors find stolen tokens, while others sneer at this unfortunate encounter through expression packs. Opensea platform and other buyers helped him recover several NFTs. “Update… All ape men are frozen. Wait for the opensea team to intervene. Learn a lesson… Use a hard wallet.”. Five hours after the first tweet for help, Kramer updated the news. The representative of opensea platform said in an email that the platform will not freeze or remove NFT that already exists in the blockchain, “but we do organize people to use opensea to buy and sell stolen goods.” Kramer later deleted all his related tweets, and neither Kramer nor opensea responded further.\n\nThis incident once again highlights the vulnerability of buyers in this largely unregulated market. Similar incidents also include the theft of three paintings of “boring ape man”.\n\nIn 2021, NFT art became very popular. It allows ordinary people to contact the collection field in a low threshold and low cost way, and can also bring more production profit opportunities for producers in the cultural field. However, on the other hand, the essence and fancy tactics of pursuing profits in the art market are also staged again through NFT trading.\n\nWith the rise of NFT value, network fraud is frequent. More experienced users protect themselves by using hard wallets or cold wallets, which are physical and only connect to the Internet when plugged in and connected. Kramer previously used the so-called hot wallet, which is always connected to the Internet, so it is more vulnerable. On the other hand, there is a more common form of theft than cyber fraud: some people make NFTs with art they don’t create themselves, which is difficult to solve.

Unexpectedly, after receiving the goods, she found that “the goods are not the right board”. Ms. Zhan originally purchased the “super track series” blind box, but received the “magic card series”. Because of the special properties of the blind box, she does not support the return without reason for seven days. The reporter contacted the official customer service of bubble Mart on this matter, but the other party did not answer the question positively.\n\nBubble mart is a trendy culture and entertainment brand established in 2010. With the brand culture of “creating trend and delivering beauty”, it has rapidly swept through contemporary young people. According to Ms. Zhan, on January 20, 2022, I bought the “super track series” blind box through the bubble mart wechat applet, with a consumption of 89 yuan. I thought I could be happy waiting for the express, but when I received the goods, I poured cold water on Ms. Zhan.\n\n“What I bought was obviously ‘super track series’, but what they sent me was’ magic card series’. I also repeatedly confirmed that the order was not taken wrong, and they sent it wrong.” Ms. Zhan told reporters that she immediately contacted the official customer service of bubble Mart. The customer service said that the product does not support 7-day return without reason. I’m really sorry for this. Ms. Zhan said: “obviously they sent the wrong goods, and I didn’t open the blind box. Why can’t I return it?”\n\nIt is impossible to return the goods within 7 days due to the special reason. However, it is impossible to contact the merchant to return the goods within 7 days, which also leads to the phenomenon that the goods can not be returned within 7 days.\n\nSubsequently, the reporter contacted the customer service of bubble Mart. The customer service said that after verifying the question, a special person would reply, but did not give a positive reply.\n\nMs. Zhan later said that bubble Mart customer service can send back the goods. After the after-sales verification is successful, she will send the originally purchased series again to the original registered address.\n\nIn this regard, the reporter contacted the China Consumer Association on this matter. The staff said: because the concept of “blind box” is relatively novel and the relevant laws and regulations have not been standardized in such detail, if there are goods differences in the case of blind box that has not been unpacked, you can contact the market supervision and Administration Bureau in the area where the store is purchased, The local market supervision and Administration Bureau shall come forward for negotiation.\n\nIn addition, when consulting relevant materials, the reporter found that on January 26, 2021, the China Consumer Association issued a warning on “blind boxes”: operators should regulate the sales of blind boxes, and consumers should not buy blind boxes blindly. The article points out that operators should earnestly abide by the provisions of laws and regulations such as the consumer protection law, the e-commerce law and the product quality law, especially: 1. The basic attribute of the blind box is the commodity, and the operator must bear the legal quality guarantee responsibility. 2。 Blind box operators shall ensure the authenticity of commodity quality information and ensure consumers’ informed choice. 3。 Blind box marketing should be moderate, and consumers’ curiosity seeking psychology should not be over marketed to mislead consumers into impulsive consumption. At the same time, the China Consumer Association also reminds consumers to have the awareness of risk prevention, maintain a rational consumption concept, recognize the risk, consume rationally, consume moderately, and don’t blindly follow the trend. 2。 To retain shopping bills and other relevant vouchers, rights and interests should be protected according to law.\n\nAs for the issue that the blind box is related to the return and replacement without reason for seven days, lawyer Li Ruiyuan of Shandong Deheng Law firm said: due to the special properties of bubble Matt and other blind box products, the blind box products are not applicable to the “return and replacement without reason for seven days” stipulated in Article 25 of the consumer rights and interests protection law. According to Article 24 of the law of the people’s Republic of China on the protection of consumers’ rights and interests, “If the goods or services provided by a business operator do not meet the quality requirements, the consumer may return the goods or request the return in accordance with the provisions of the state and the agreement of the parties. The business operator shall perform the obligation of replacement and repair. If the state does not provide for it and the parties do not agree, the consumer may return the goods within seven days from the date of receiving the goods; if the conditions for terminating the contract are met according to law after seven days, the consumer Can return goods in time; If the law does not meet the conditions for terminating the contract, the consumer may require the business operator to perform the obligations of replacement and repair. “", "timestamp": 1649013584, "digest": "3iG701TkaPF0pWC-xvxJDarFK6UpOy7FFIKu5CD_P-k", "contributor": "0xf992f745A9411c49a36351DFFcF5387076a835ad"}

If the water is not drained out in time, it will seriously affect the follow-up rescue and post disaster reconstruction. On July 26, after receiving the instruction from the Fire Rescue Bureau of the emergency management department and the request of the subway company, 41 fire commanders and fighters from Xiangxi, Hengyang Changde and Changsha rushed to Metro Line 5, line 2, line 6 and line 14 to urgently carry out waterlogging drainage.\n\nThe subway station has serious ponding\n\nDrainage site of line 5\n\nAt the Zhengzhou people’s Hospital Station of line 5, the underground environment is humid and the water pipeline is complex. The fire rescue personnel of Hengyang detachment use strong lights to move forward in the dark.\n\nThe drainage point is located on the negative second floor of the subway. The internal electrical appliances, pipelines and facilities are complex. It is difficult to lay the drainage pipeline, poor communication and narrow working space. According to the site conditions, the detachment drainage formation will replace the large flow pump with the high lift pump, use the exhaust pipe to lay the cable vertically, extend the water belt 40m downward to the drainage point on the second floor of the subway, and connect the water pump at the drainage point for drainage.\n\nSince 2 a.m. on July 27, five drainage lines and five groups of high lift pumps have been started at the same time with full load, and the displacement of each water pipe is 100 cubic meters per hour. During this period, all fire commanders and fighters stayed at the scene, fought day and night, and carried out waterlogging drainage and equipment inspection in turn. At present, the drainage operation is still in order.\n\nAt the beach Temple Station of Metro No. 5, where the Xiangxi detachment is located, the water accumulated in the two stations of the subway station tunnel is up to 500 meters, and the maximum water depth is about 5 meters. It is difficult to operate. The rescue workers use the enclosure to store water, pump water laterally into the reservoir, and finally pump water vertically. From 1:00 on July 27 to 10:00 on July 28, the Xiangxi detachment drained 7400 cubic meters, and the drainage work of the current working point has been completed.\n\nDrainage site of Salmonella station of Zhengzhou Metro Line 2\n\nAs of 18:00 on the 28th, the tunnel drainage of Salmonella subway station has reached 26000 cubic meters\n\nThe Salmone station of Zhengzhou Metro Line 2, where Changde detachment is located, is about 350 meters away from the platform and 30 meters vertically from the ground. There are many vertical holes in the subway, high voltage, complex lines, and the width of the pedestrian passage in the tunnel is only 60 cm, which is very difficult to fight. The rescuers finally decided to carry out the drainage operation by means of cofferdam relay. As of 18:00 on the 28th, the tunnel drainage of Salmonella subway station has reached 26000 cubic meters.\n\nChangsha Fire drainage site\n\nChangsha fire rescue workers are working in the transfer station between line 6 and line 14 of Zhengzhou Olympic sports center subway station. The subway station has three floors. The deepest part is 43 meters from the ground, and the height difference between the ponding water surface and the ground is more than 33 meters. The high-power waterlogging drainage vehicle cannot carry out conventional waterlogging drainage, and the water belt is very easy to be damaged by friction with the wall. The rescuers saw the move and successfully developed the outlet belt corner bridge protection on site to avoid the water belt damage caused by the direct friction between the water belt and the wall and corner; The utility model can effectively fix the water hose lines and avoid mutual interference and winding of the water hose lines; It also provides an effective fixed hanging point for the water belt in the process of vertical water supply, so as to ensure that the water belt will not break or burst due to its excessive gravity.\n\nAt 22:30 on July 26th, with water belt, the drainage line of the corner protection bridge successfully discharged water, and the water pressure and drainage line were very stable. As of 16:00 on July 27, the Changsha detachment had drained 31000 cubic meters. At present, the drainage operation has been completed, and the feet are on their way to the next rescue point.\n\nAs of 18:00 on July 28, the Hunan fire support force in Henan has drained 3.416 million tons of waterlogging, dredged 20700 cubic meters, transferred 23 personnel and transferred more than 500 materials. At present, all kinds of rescue work are being carried out in an orderly manner. Work together to overcome difficulties.

Большинство игр NFT предпочли монетизировать полезную ценность, в то время как их игры могли бы лучше монетизировать ценность социальную .\n\n*\"Я считаю, что инновации модели бизнеса являются более разрушительными, чем технические инновации\" - Фред Уилсон, кофаундер Union Square Ventures.*\n\nИгровая индустрия, как и ее вымышленные персонажи, продолжает развиваться. Этот сектор постоянно находится на грани срыва, где он обнаруживает как технологические инновации, так и инновации моделей бизнеса и адаптирует их к постоянно меняющимся требованиям.\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b3f6f9411c28ca70ed99f40312c3a4d22daa2aed-1018x568.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nПоследней инновационной волной в игровой индустрии стало появление GameFi - более широкой финансиализации игровых активов. Первая модель монетизации GameFi - play-to-earn (P2E) - была предоставлена в игре Axie Infinity. Игроки могут покупать аксей, чтобы заработать SLP-токены, внутриигровой товар, используемый для разведения и улучшения аксей. Экономический успех Axie привел к появлению множества рипофов и NFT-игр, которые усовершенствовали модель \"P2E\" с помощью стейкинг-моделей.\n\nPay to Play2Earn: Недостатки спекулятивных игр \n\nСпекулятивная и рефлексивная система, присущая игровой модели \"P2E\", привела к созданию игровых брендов с многомиллиардной оценочной стоимостью, таких как Axie Infinity, DeFi Kingdoms, Star Atlas и другие. Однако у существующей игровой модели play-to-earn есть несколько серьезных недостатков, которые препятствуют ее долгосрочному успеху.\n\nВо-первых, возможность покупки НФТ или внутриигровой валюты создает определенную механику \"pay-to-win\", чего избегает большинство крупных франшиз и успешных игр. Самые успешные игры часто делают упор на скилл, предпочитая создавать “Ranked matchmaking” и избегая принципа \"спамь кредиткой пока не победишь\".\n\nВо-вторых, большинство P2E игр требуют предварительных инвестиций в НФТ только для того, чтобы начать играть. Это, естественно, становится существенной преградой для многих пользователей и еще больше усиливает принцип \"pay-to-win\".\n\nДа в принципе, спросите 100 крипто-геймеров, на счет того, весело ли играть в игры, и почти каждый вам даст ответ: \"Нет... но я зарабатываю деньги\". Игроки, зарабатывающие деньги с помощью MonkeyWork игровых действий, не являются явным показателем успеха франшизы. Конечный результат всегда будет один - игроки будут постепенно переходить от одной игры, в которой им удалось заработать, в другую, постоянно находясь в поисках новых платформ для подобного рода заработка.\n\n**Немного о “Стипендиальной программе“**\n\n*\"Вы продолжаете использовать это слово. Я не думаю, что оно означает то, что вы думаете\". - Иниго Монтойя - Мейсон Нистром*\n\nЧасто деятельность P2E фармилки поддерживаются \"стипендиальными программами\". Например, стипендиальная программа Axie позволяет более бедным геймерам заимствовать активы у богатых НФТ владельцев, делясь с ними частью прибыли,. По сути, стипендиаты выполняют повторяющиеся внутриигровые действия и делят часть прибыли с владельцами NFT. Игровые гильдии, такие как Yield Guild Games, расширили программу стипендий, поддерживая более 20 000 стипендиатов. Несмотря на восхищение тем, что YGG позволяет людям получать экономическое вознаграждение за свой труд, такая динамика игры, скорее всего, неустойчива. Продолжение стипендиальной программы, которая больше похожа на работу, требует дальнейшего роста возможностей дохода в Axie Infinity.\n\n**Заимствование из традиционных игр: Монетизация в играх NFT** Сегодня большинство игр монетизируют периодический доход по одной из двух схем. Первая схема - социальная ценность - продажа внутриигровых активов, которые демонстрируют статус или визуальную/косметическую ценность, но не влияют на игровой процесс. Fortnite - прекрасный пример, который построил успешный бизнес на продаже скинов или визуальных улучшений для оружия. Roblox монетизируется за счет подписки на Robux, которые можно потратить в различных играх, созданных сторонними разработчиками, некоторые из которых во главе полезность, а у других - социальную ценность. Наконец, такие игры, как GTA, позволяют игрокам приобретать предметы, которые помогают быстрее завершить сюжетную линию; однако в обладании определенными видами имущества есть и элемент социальной ценности (например, Lambo против Prius).\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/d325fe76d3c89d40ffafb9c0a56872685db3020b-1024x728.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nЭта модель может быть широко применена и к криптоиграм, только лишь с тем отличием отличием, что постоянный доход будет поступать через вторичные торговые платежи, а не подписки (например, Fortnite V-Bucks и Roblox Robux).\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/49c8a6c9ba24e2baf3c6d86191bfbf421856bd7f-1442x1138.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nИгровая книга НФТ сфокусирована на продаже НФТ и свомещении стейкинга и доходности для создания стимулов именно \"играть\" в игру. Не существует заметных игр NFT, которые концентрируются на монетизации через социальную ценность, хотя есть проекты NFT, такие как BAYC и другие коллекции, которые монетизируются в основном из-за социальной ценности.\n\nБольшинство NFT игр не могут преодолеть Entertainment Threshold(порог развлечения) - точку, в которой компания или разработчик создали игру, достаточно захватывающую, чтобы крепко стоять на ногах не только из-за финансовых стимулов, предлагаемых пользователям.\n\n**Краткая заметка о коммунальных НФТ**\n\nКак было сказано ранее, наличие торгуемых НФТ, обеспечивающих конкурентные преимущества, быстро превращается в систему pay-to-win, поэтому большинство игр с НФТ должны избегать этого в принципе. Однако есть случаи, когда НФТ, суть которых - польза, имеют смысл в игре. Экономия времени - это механизм, с помощью которого разработчики игр могут подойти к интеграции с НФТ. Одним из ярких примеров являются MMORPG, такие как Runescape или World of Warcraft, в которых есть множество общих предметов: ресурсы, например, дерево, золото и кирпичи, необходимые для строительства других более значимых ресурсов, но по своей сути не делающие игрока лучше в соревновательных аспектах игры. Сочетание этих типов обычных НФТ с неторгуемыми соревновательными или социальными НФТ - гораздо лучший способ создания НФТ игр, основанных на схеме полезности.\n\n**Исследуем пробелы: Free-to-Play-to-Earn (F2P2E)** \n\nДаже несмотря на свои недостатки, модель \"P2E\" представляет собой новую динамику для создания игровой экономики. Игровая модель free-to-play-to-earn (F2P2E) может подойти для криптоигр лучше, чем модель pay-to-play-to-earn (P2P2E).\n\nСтоит отметить, что плохо продуманные игры free-to-play (F2P) все равно остаются такими же играми, как и P2E-игры, а значит, F2P-игры должны использовать более эффективные стратегии монетизации. Представьте себе игру, в которой скины (например, одежда для персонажа) дают только косметические преимущества, но люди в игре все равно должны играть, чтобы заработать ресурсы, необходимые для создания того же скина для персонажа.

В ближайшие годы в эту сферу будут инвестированы миллиарды долларов, но большинство ищет игру в стиле Axie, несмотря на то, что новая модель - это то, что привлечет следующие миллионы геймеров.

This behavior has attracted many disputes, and citizens have different comments on it. The staff also understood the situation reflected by the citizens.\n\n“When our children pay the fee, the teacher made it clear that they don’t accept cash, so some parents have to queue up at the bank to save money for them, and some teachers ask that they have to print the receipt. It was a very simple thing, because the various requirements of the school have added a lot of unnecessary trouble to us.” A student’s parents said.\n\nSome parents believe that it is very convenient to pay fees by bank transfer or card swiping, which can minimize the risk of losing money when children take money to school.\n\nIt’s illegal to refuse cash!\n\nAccording to Article 3 of the regulations of the people’s Republic of China on the administration of RMB, “the lawful currency of the people’s Republic of China is RMB. No unit or individual may refuse to pay all public and private debts within the territory of the people’s Republic of China in RMB.” Article 6 “all units and individuals shall take good care of the renminbi. It is prohibited to damage the renminbi and hinder the circulation of the renminbi.”\n\nOn February 22, the official wechat of Xinhua news agency released an article entitled “32 units reject cash, punish!” Article. The article clearly points out that it is illegal for relevant units not to receive cash, and the relevant units involved have been punished ranging from 1000 yuan to 100000 yuan.\n\nIn the process of understanding, we also found that some school websites publicly announced that they would not accept cash.\n\nTaking the official website of Weifang Wenhua school as an example, the school only accepts the payment method: 1 Pay by swiping the card at the POS machine. The UnionPay debit card of each bank (credit card is not supported). There is no service charge for swiping the card. Please prepare the bank card in advance and do not accept cash. 2。 Parents who open mobile banking can use mobile banking on-site transfer to pay fees.\n\n“I think the school is a holy land for teaching and educating people.

Until today, lotus’s road car is still very popular. Since it was acquired by Geely, lotus Chinese brand has been changed to lutes. At the same time, it will also carry out electric transformation in an all-round way under the wave of global electric vehicles. The just launched Emira will be lotus’s last internal combustion engine model, the upcoming evija super run will be the first pure electric vehicle, and the type 132 will become the first electric SUV, which has been confirmed to be launched globally on March 29, 2022.\n\nIn addition to confirming the release date, lotus also released a series of preview diagrams showing the appearance, interior and powertrain of the new type 132. From the preview, starting from the appearance, we can see that the new car is equipped with slender LED headlights, aerodynamically optimized wheels, digital rear-view mirrors, Lotus brand brake calipers and carbon fiber decoration. Steering interior, the new car is equipped with a digital instrument panel, a sports steering wheel with contrast color stitching, luminous shift equipment and drive mode switching paddles. In addition, the previous trailer also shows a floating infotainment system and the immersive start-up process of multiple screens, sounds and lights.\n\nFinally, lotus’s official preview video also shows the electric power system of the new type 132. Although lotus has been reluctant to disclose specific details, it has previously confirmed that the new car adopts 800 volt charging technology and battery pack with a capacity of 92-120 kwh, which has excellent performance. It can accelerate 0-100 km / h in less than 3.0 seconds and complete the charging process of 0-80% power in about 20 minutes.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the new type 132 will be built based on the lotus premium architecture, which can support a variety of models with 2889-3100mm wheelbase, from medium-sized cars to luxury cars, including the new four door sedan to be launched in 2023, the small crossover car to be launched in 2025 and the sports car to be launched in 2026.\n\nA few years ago, Geely, a Chinese carmaker with Volvo and Jixing, once again saved lotus from the brink of bankruptcy. At present, Geely and lotus maintain a relatively non-interference mode of operation, allowing lotus to have more experts to continue to cultivate in chassis development, new lightweight technology and design. The two new cars of evija and Emira previously released have proved to be very effective. For more information about type 132, please pay attention to the follow-up reports.

The production date of the product is August 14, 2021, and the shelf life is 180 days. It has expired for 4 days when it is sold. After reflecting the situation to the supermarket service desk, Mr. Yang put forward the demand for compensation according to law. At present, the two sides have discussed the specific amount of compensation.\n\nBoth bags of food expired, and the consumer demanded compensation of 2000 yuan\n\nOn February 14, Mr. Yang, a citizen, bought 2 bags of jujube kernel magic cube sandwich red dates at the store of HEMA Xiansheng Jinshui Road, Licang District, Qingdao, with a unit price of 19.9 yuan. The production date of the product is August 14, 2021, and the shelf life is 180 days. It has expired for 4 days when it is sold. Mr. Yang believed that supermarkets selling expired food should be compensated in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. He immediately reflected this situation to the staff of the service desk, but it was not effectively solved on the spot.\n\nIn order to implement the situation, the reporter contacted the supermarket. The supermarket staff said: “it may not be my class that day. I’ll ask my colleagues later. Please provide the order number and the contact information of consumers. I’ll check the order number first, and then find consumers to verify the situation.”\n\nAccording to Mr. Yang, on February 22, the supermarket staff contacted him by telephone. Because he bought two bags of expired red dates in two orders that day, he proposed a compensation claim of 2000 yuan to the supermarket. At present, the two sides have discussed the compensation. Mr. Yang said: “the other party is willing to take the initiative to find me, indicating that his attitude is good. The staff said that he can’t be the master and needs to report to the store manager first. Anyway, I’m not in a hurry to deal with this matter. As long as the supermarket acknowledges this fact, I hope they will strengthen supervision in the future.”\n\nIn view of the situation encountered by Mr. Yang, the staff of Qingdao Municipal Bureau of market supervision and Administration introduced that according to Article 148 of the food safety law of the people’s Republic of China, when operating food that knowingly does not meet food safety standards, consumers can not only claim compensation for losses, but also ask the producer or operator to pay compensation 10 times the price or 3 times the loss; If the amount of increased compensation is less than 1000 yuan, it shall be 1000 yuan.\n\nFood safety problems of Qingdao HEMA fresh food\n\nIn recent three months, Qingdao HEMA fresh food safety problems occurred frequently. In accordance with the law, the fresh coconut juice box in Yancang district (xianma Square) was sold to consumers on December 12, 2021. On December 7, 2021, HEMA Xiansheng (xinduxin store), the fourth branch of Shanghai HEMA Network Technology Co., Ltd., located at No. 88, Harbin Road, Shibei District, Qingdao, was punished by Shibei District market supervision and Administration Bureau for counterfeiting patents on food sold. On February 9, 2022, Mr. Wang, the consumer, bought expired Pu Meiduo ramen and Pu Meiduo sliced noodles at HEMA Xiansheng (imixpark store), and received a compensation of 1000 yuan.\n\nAccording to public information, HEMA fresh has opened eight stores in Qingdao, with sales of about 300 million yuan in the first half of 2021. Although the development trend is rapid, the frequent food safety problems should attract the attention of all stores. Wang Fanwu, former member of the trial committee of the second intermediate people’s Court of Beijing, once said: “the best way to stop beating dummies for profit is to solve the chaos of making and selling fake goods. From a logical point of view, professional crackdowns are parasitic on making and selling fake goods. Once the problem of making and selling fake goods is solved, the problem of knowing and buying fake goods will be solved, and we must not put the cart before the horse.”\n\nHow to dispose of temporary food\n\nIn an interview with reporters, manager Meng of HEMA Xiansheng harmonious square store once said: “the store will improve the tally frequency and strengthen supervision in the future to avoid such overdue problems.” The fundamental reason for the frequent occurrence of food expiration events is that the supply volume of supermarkets exceeds the purchasing power, resulting in the unsalable of some commodities, which are placed on the shelves for several months. For operators, to eliminate such problems from the source, they should learn to use data to achieve scientific order quantity, or set up temporary food counters, so as to maximize and avoid the expiration of a large number of products.\n\nFood comes first. In order to avoid the safety risk of temporary food in the sales process, merchants must update and distinguish the goods more carefully. According to the staff of Qingdao Municipal Bureau of market supervision and administration, at present, China has laws to follow in the management of temporary food. Article 12 of the anti food waste law stipulates that food operators such as supermarkets and shopping malls should strengthen the daily inspection of their food, and classify and manage the food close to the shelf life, make special marks or display them for sale.

{"id": "otYw1hRYcwpn8gXtDjtsw_cwaOOcsi5_TMlvwIB7NYc", "title": "How to choose a family car with more than 300000 children?", "body": "Two days ago, I talked with my friends about # what is a successful person #. From my father’s point of view, no mortgage, car loan pressure, stable work, both children and a car of about 300000 have exceeded most people. My friend asked me, how can I buy 300000 models? For this problem, we also launched a vote in the microblog. We choose between MPV, SUV and luxury brand medium-sized cars with the price dimension of 300000. The voting rate of SUV is higher, followed by MPV. What are their respective advantages? Next, dad will interpret it one by one.\n\n300000 MPV\n\nThe price of this kind of car is more suitable for the family than that of the MPV. There is no more obvious advantage in the price of this kind of car than that of the MPV. The models we recommend this time are the two popular models at present, namely Kia Jiahua and GAC Honda Odyssey.\n\nModel: Kia fourth generation Jiahua\n\nGuide price: 2889-339900 yuan\n\nHighlight: the most important reason why Kia’s fourth generation Jiahua is recommended is that it has the most balanced product power in the 300000 level. First of all, it is Kia’s global flagship model, which is produced by CKD (imported parts, domestic assembly). Moreover, compared with the joint venture brand models at the same price, they do a relatively balanced job in terms of space, comfortable configuration, safety and power. Although the pricing gap of GAC Toyota Saina, which is the closest to its size, is not very large, considering the price increase, it has completely deviated from the 300000 level. On the whole, its practicability is not very high.\n\nFirst of all, in terms of appearance, as a MPV for both home and business, its shape design is younger. The family tiger roaring air intake grille and the medium mesh made of diamond chrome plated material, combined with the shape of angular LED headlights, make the whole front face full of fashion. Compared with GL8, the business atmosphere is not so heavy that you won’t feel like a driver when you drive out.\n\nThe body side adopts a younger design style like the front face. The A / B / D column adopts black coating to create the effect of suspended roof. At the back of the side sliding door, it also uses thick silver trim strips to separate the front and rear, which looks very delicate. The through LED light set at the rear of the car effectively increases the horizontal visual effect, which increases the fashion sense of the whole car.\n\nThe interior design also adopts the latest family design style. The double 12.3-inch screen design has achieved a good balance between home style and scientific and technological style. In terms of materials, the center console and door panel are soft materials, which have reached the level of 300000 models with sewing technology.\n\nIn terms of intelligent configuration, the fourth generation Jiahua is equipped with Baidu 3.0 intelligent Internet connection system, which supports Baidu carlife, voice control, car home interconnection, BLUElink Bluetooth key, user location sharing service and other functions. It is also equipped with apps such as QQ music, listening companion and Baidu map, which can play children’s songs and fairy tales through voice control. What is more worth mentioning is that Jiahua takes good care of the rear passengers. The system has rear vision, rear dialogue, rear silence and rear passengers forgetting reminders, which can always understand the dynamics of rear passengers and babies. Therefore, in terms of humanized care for the rear row, Jiahua, the fourth generation of household MPV, performed very well, especially the rear row visual dialogue function, which I believe can make many dads pay the bill.\n\nAs an MPV, the body size is very important. The length, width and height of the fourth generation Jiahua are 5155 / 1995 / 1795mm respectively, and the wheelbase is 3090mm. It has obvious size advantages in models of the same level. The front, middle and rear rows can have spacious seating space. In addition, as the most important second row, the adjustable angles of the two one button compression seats are very wide, which can bring a good riding experience with a comfortable touch.\n\nIn terms of space, the fourth generation Jiahua built based on Kia’s third-generation i-gmp platform has a very high space utilization rate. Under the condition of full load, the trunk can still provide very abundant storage capacity, which is enough to support the storage of luggage in the middle and short distance of the whole car.\n\nIn terms of safety configuration, Kia’s fourth generation Jiahua is also equipped with L2 intelligent driving assistance system (including FCA front collision assistance system, BVM blind area display system, HDA high-speed driving assistance system, etc.).\n\nIn terms of power, the fourth generation Jiahua is equipped with a 2.0T + 8at power system. The maximum power of this engine is 233 HP, the maximum torque is 353 n · m, and the comprehensive fuel consumption per 100 km is only 7.8l. In addition, it also provides four driving modes: comfort, economy, sports and intelligence. Even under full load, the power performance is enough. Moreover, the overall handling performance is not as big as the flickering feeling of MPV in the past. The better handling performance can also provide some driving fun when driving alone.\n\nModel: GAC Honda Odyssey\n\nSelling price: RMB 480.35\n\nHighlight: Odyssey is definitely a popular model in the 300000 class household MPV market. Many consumers can still pay for it because of its first mover advantage and strong comprehensive product power. Although the newly launched new Odyssey can not be called a new generation, the changes in appearance and interior are comparable to the generation. In terms of intelligent configuration and space utilization, it is still a very good player at this price. The most important thing is that at present, all Odyssey series are equipped with 2.0L hybrid system, which has a stronger performance in fuel economy. It can be said that it is still a very good model at the same level.\n\nThe appearance of the new Odyssey has been greatly adjusted. The front face looks heavier and the overall style looks more mature by using a heavier front and a wider Chinese open. An appropriate amount of chrome plated decoration maintains the youthful flavor of Odyssey.\n\nCompared with the old models, the side shape is basically the same. The simple and capable waistline makes the side shape look less bulky than MPV. At the same time, the new car is also equipped with blackened 18 inch rims. At the same time, the new car is still equipped with very easy to use and a sense of science and technology", "timestamp": 1649014328, "digest": "_-16FHgJoqXSunamVOgGHnru-7lLIUI68IyNfQ-leWU", "contributor": "0xF3c8b35246dF30a0fCFc95A221c7E8dF7dbbD1d4"}

Lu Tingting patiently demonstrated fingering to these new college students over and over again, and taught hand-held single finger single note counting and hand-held single note counting.\n\nThe “teacher” taught attentively and the “students” studied seriously. The scene was both serious and lively.\n\nAccording to the relevant person in charge of Shandong Zibo Branch of Agricultural Bank of China, “counting money” is only a link in the training content.\n\nIn order to improve the professional ability of new employees, the bank organized induction training for new employees in strict accordance with the training arrangements of the head office and provincial banks. In terms of training content, in addition to the courses set by the head office and provincial banks, the bank has specially added a three-day counter skills training to enable new employees to master the necessary basic vocational skills in the shortest time.\n\nThe teachers selected by Shandong Zibo Branch of Agricultural Bank of China are all business models of all lines.\n\nXing Meiqin, a member of the operation management department of Shandong Zibo Branch of Agricultural Bank of China, has successively won the honors of “technical expert of counter business of Municipal Bank” and “advanced worker of Municipal Bank organs”.\n\nNiu Xia, the customer manager of the business department of Shandong Zibo Branch of Agricultural Bank of China, has successively won many honors, such as “national financial May Day Labor Medal”, “Agricultural Bank of China may day labor medal”, “female workers of Shandong finance, trade and finance system who have made achievements”, “provincial bank advanced worker”, “Zibo banking service star”, “female skill model”, etc.\n\nLu Tingting, the internal affairs president of Zichuan huangjiapu sub branch of Shandong Zibo Branch of Agricultural Bank of China, has successively won the honors of “business and technology expert of provincial bank”, “business and technology model of provincial bank”, “advanced individual of provincial bank” and so on.\n\nBai Yang, the internal service president of jiahuang Banking Office of Shandong Zibo Zhoucun sub branch of Agricultural Bank of China, has successively won the honors of “head office level may day female model”, “Shandong Labor Model”, “Provincial Youth May 4th Medal”, “provincial business and technical expert”, etc.\n\nZhou Suya, internal affairs president of Zibo Huantai Qifeng sub branch of Agricultural Bank of China, participated in the sixth business technology competition of the head office in 2020 and won the 12th place in China; It has successively won the honors of “business and technical expert of provincial bank”, “advanced individual of provincial bank” and so on.\n\nZhou Suya, a “business and technical expert of the provincial bank” and “advanced individual of the provincial bank”, is a “mother to be”. After hearing the news of the new employee’s induction training, she took the initiative to find the person in charge of relevant departments and offices of Zibo Branch and asked to teach the new colleagues the operating procedures and experience of “Boeing input”.\n\n“I grew up with the help of the hands of the older generation of Agricultural Bank of China. I want to pass on my business skills and experience to the next generation of Agricultural Bank of China. I have the responsibility!” Zhou Suya said.\n\nBecause the electric classroom for training is on the fourth floor, there is no elevator. The staff in the training course of Zibo Branch made detailed arrangements to accompany her up and down the stairs. ABC people’s feelings of “leading the new with the old and helping the new” have deeply infected these new college students.\n\nJust out of school and into school. This training enables new employees to have a further understanding of the history of the party, the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, national macroeconomic and financial policies, bank history, ABC corporate culture, basic knowledge of credit management, and further improve the basic operation points of centralized authorization business and super counter business, single note counting, abacus and other professional skills.\n\nAfter the training, Han Yinghao, a new recruit, said that the content of the training was very rich, with both theoretical knowledge and professional skills. In particular, he was very touched by the “abacus” course added by Zibo Branch. Through the abacus class, while mastering this traditional skill, he felt that it was also the inheritance of the excellent traditional culture of the Chinese nation.\n\n“Although intelligent devices in banking institutions are becoming more and more popular, I personally feel the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle of the older generation of ABC people through learning abacus.

{"id": "3EMIuexM_BDjTfvnughhxvaR-Z0ntd-jj59oUsvWIvM", "title": "What signal does the post-80s CEO release when he takes over Longhu?", "body": "Produced by: Sina Finance listed company Research Institute\n\nYoung man, it’s more powerful to roll up!\n\nOn February 28, Longhu group announced that Shao Mingxiao resigned as CEO and appointed him as vice chairman of the board of directors. At the same time, Chen Xuping was appointed as the new CEO. At present, Chen Xuping’s position is CEO, and he is also the general manager of real estate channel and a member of the investment committee.\n\nChen Xuping, a 40 year old young man, was entrusted with the important task of doing real work on the front line, while Shao Mingxiao, who was only 56, retired from the second line to become a consultant for Wu Yajun. In terms of age, Shao Mingxiao is not old enough to retire. We think this is more than a simple personnel change, which may mean that the development strategy of Longhu group will change.\n\nWu Yajun is concerned about Longhu’s ability to deal with extreme situations\n\nIt is said that under the background of a series of regulatory policies such as three red lines and centralized land supply, Chairman Wu Yajun convened a meeting of senior executives at the beginning of 2021, made assumptions and asked: “if the bank closes the door to Longhu and sales are halved, can Longhu still pay employees’ wages and repay debts normally?”\n\nSuch questions may seem extreme, but the CFO can get the answer simply by tapping the computer. Facing the boss’s vigilance in times of peace, the answer of Longhu executives is, no!\n\nThis sense of crisis has gradually spread from small, medium-sized and micro real estate enterprises to leading real estate enterprises in the real estate industry since 2018. With many leading real estate enterprises gradually thundering, looking back, it is not too late for Wu Yajun to put forward the response to such extreme risks in early 2021, even with some foresight.\n\nBecause the property market cooled rapidly in the second half of last year, it is still declining!\n\nAccording to Kerui data, in the first two months of this year, the top 100 real estate enterprises only realized a sales trading amount of 401.58 billion yuan, and the month on month sentiment fell to the freezing point. In January, it continued to decrease by 23.5%, a year-on-year decrease of 47.2%, an increase of more than 10 percentage points compared with January, and a decrease of 56.5% compared with the monthly average level of 2021.\n\nData source: CRIC\n\nAlthough there is a trend of easing and improvement in the current policy, the market seems to form a certain potential energy of downward dive in the short term. It remains to be seen whether the market can recover in March and April. The transaction area of new houses in 28 key monitoring cities of Kerui decreased by 32% month on month and 35% year-on-year. The market transaction reached a new low in recent years.\n\nAccording to Kerui data, in the first two months of this year, Longhu group achieved full caliber sales of 20.06 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 46.5%, and equity sales of 13.07 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 50.21%. Among them, the equity sales announced by Longhu in January was 6.99 billion yuan, and it is known that the equity sales in February was only 6.09 billion yuan.\n\nThe scale fell below 300 billion in 2021, and sales halved this year. Perhaps now, for Longhu, which has always been stable, it is an extreme situation in a sense.\n\nIt is also logical to change a young CEO at this time.\n\nFrom de real estate to real estate channel to become CEO\n\nIn fact, Chen Xuping’s promotion has long been foreshadowed.\n\nOn July 8, 2021, half a year after Wu Yajun asked senior executives, Longhu issued an internal announcement announcing the establishment of a new real estate channel. Chen Xuping was appointed general manager of real estate channel and general manager of real estate channel marketing department.\n\nAt the subsequent interim performance meeting, Chen Xuping attended with Wu Yajun and Shao Mingxiao for the first time, and the positioning of Figure 3 has initially attracted attention. At that time, Shao Mingxiao commented on him as “an executive with a very comprehensive knowledge structure, very diligent and strong leadership.”\n\nSource: Internet, first from the right: Chen Xuping\n\nChen Xuping graduated from Tsinghua University with a master’s degree in civil engineering in 2008. In the same year, he joined Longhu as an “official student” and has worked for 14 years. At the end of 2016, starting from the front line of Engineering Manager, he became the general manager of Chengdu company. Since then, Chengdu Longhu has made great progress in real estate sales and multi-channel coordinated development under the strategy of “space as service”.\n\nAt the time of in-depth adjustment of the industry, it is not surprising to take office as a young, diligent and capable CEO. It is worth noting that Chen Xuping is also the person in charge of the real estate channel.\n\nFrom the renaming of Longhu real estate to Longhu group in 2018, and later the rental and sale of houses and house decoration of four channels including residential, commercial, long-term rental apartments and property services to six channels, Longhu’s intention of “de real estate” is obvious, and the proportion of income from property development continues to decline. In July last year, the group established a separate real estate channel, which was in line with the other five channels, streamlined the group and achieved initial diversification results.\n\nIn the past few years, the diversification of many real estate enterprises, including Evergrande, Aoyuan, sunshine city and jiazhaoye, has been blocked and even consumed a lot of cash flow, which has sounded an alarm for many real estate enterprises. Sales have been cold since July last year, which has strengthened Yu Liang’s judgment of “black iron era”, so that he believes that reducing the watch in 2022 is a battle of life and death for Vanke.\n\nThe opportunity of making big money in the industry has passed, which is almost the consensus in the industry, and everything points to fine operation.\n\nVanke will change the past decentralized investment to intensive investment, and spin off and list everything cloud. Similarly, Longhu, which spin off Longhu Zhichuang, is no exception. It is put on the development agenda of Longhu in the new era to more finely manage the capital use of various channels, especially the fine management of real estate channels.\n\nGen reported that Longhu will continue to shrink the investment in some non real estate businesses except commerce and Guanyu this year. Fine operation of basic business of real estate development is Chen Xuping’s next important task of reform.\n\nFocus on sales, control risks and deal with extreme situations\n\nIn Longhu, Wu Yajun and Shao Mingxiao have the most words in their evaluation of Chen Xuping: diligence, attention to details, deep involvement in business, strong risk control ability and so on.\n\nChen Xuping, who is in his prime of life, is in line with Wu Yajun’s intention of the company’s next reform and development direction, and Chen Xuping has also taken the lead in “rolling” up in the past six months and asked for benefits from management.\n\nFirst, pay attention to organizational reform. After China Resources and Vanke, the headquarters of Longhu group was renamed as the group empowerment platform to realize flat and agile organization. The adjustment of organizational structure is conducive to streamlining the headquarters, reducing intermediate links, shortening decision-making time and improving operation efficiency.\n\nSecond, focus on sales. In the interior of Longhu Lake, Chen Xuping particularly stressed that the land taken at the end of last year was in March and April this year", "timestamp": 1649014551, "digest": "6b2ueuZS5A1NTvZIZxypLeSohWpqamvdHKaoNd-lHl4", "contributor": "0xBef0a53e80FbF6a6818c155735B5c5A14f5d1E2F"}

She finally withered with a kind of almost tragic withering, leaving us the most painful memory at the turn of the new year - the withering of Chunmei, but the righteousness will never fade!\n\nZhou Chunmei\n\nOn the morning of January 12, an excellent comrade in arms on the political and legal front left us in this way. We are very sad. Sad for her death, sad for her life that can no longer be recovered, and sad for her comrades in arms who stick to the bottom line of judicial responsibility. Chunmei’s life has explained to us the loyalty, selflessness and fearlessness of a political and legal worker. We should strengthen our faith and determination to defend judicial justice.\n\nWe will never bow to sin, even if we give our lives! Any attempt to force us to bow down and give in through violence, injury and intimidation will not work, but will strengthen our determination to fight crime. All despicable souls who trample on the law willfully will eventually be put to the harshest trial in the face of noble justice. The murderer of Chunmei will be severely punished by the law - Chunmei, on the public prosecution bench, we will get justice for you!\n\nOnce, someone was called a “cold-blooded animal” because he didn’t succeed in probing cases; Nowadays, there is no such truth in the world because the fellow Townsman’s request to “say hello” is not successful? We are not born with an inhumane “iron wall”, but our faith and awe of justice have trained us to be a clank iron bone - only when we are willing to cut all over can we dare to do politics and law.\n\nYes, the law is cold, but judges, prosecutors and police… Every judicial officer is hot-blooded and warm-hearted. However, we leave the cold and cruelty to those who try to undermine judicial justice, and unreservedly dedicate our patience and warmth to faith and the people. Because of the expectation and longing of the people for us to perform our duties according to law, we will sacrifice our lives for justice and have no regrets.\n\nThe development of the rule of law today is really not easy. It is countless political and legal people who stick to judicial faith and abide by judicial responsibilities like Chunmei who have lit the raging fire of the rule of law. And “those who hold salaries for everyone” will never “freeze to death in the wind and snow”. We can see that the due respect and authority of the judiciary have been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and people’s due respect and trust in the judiciary has gradually become a consensus on the rule of law. We should also see that the general trend of the wave of progress in the rule of law is irreversible, and those who try to challenge justice will be swallowed up by the wave of people’s justice.\n\nLaw, we cannot give in to lawlessness, because taking a step back is an abyss. We must stick to the bottom line of fairness and justice!\n\nLaw, there is no need to make concessions to lawlessness, because the pace of the rule of law will be more sonorous in the coming spring and every spring thereafter.", "timestamp": 1649014526, "digest": "TFBB2QKzwW1HISQU01D1T15XVeyoHJeO3EWekP-0Dw0", "contributor": "0x4e4500402e13E5778389D06c0d124b0AE5ba5EAd"}

The number of newly registered undergraduate majors ranks second in the country, with a total of 53 colleges and universities adding such majors.\n\nAmong the newly approved undergraduate majors, the number of newly added Cyberspace Security majors in China is the largest, with a total of 21. Three universities in Shandong have added Cyberspace Security majors, namely Qingdao University of technology, Taishan University and Qilu Normal University. Among the withdrawn majors, information management and information system were withdrawn by 33 universities, ranking first. Followed by the major of public utilities management, 31 colleges and universities were abolished.\n\nAccording to the introduction, according to the regulations on the administration of undergraduate specialty setting in ordinary colleges and universities, the Ministry of Education organized the setting and adjustment of Undergraduate Specialty in ordinary colleges and universities in 2021. After application, publicity, review and other procedures, 1773 filing majors and 188 examination and approval majors were added (including 145 national controlled distribution majors and 43 new majors outside the catalogue), 48 degree granting categories or length of study majors were adjusted, and 804 majors were revoked. 31 new majors, including carbon storage science and engineering, aerospace intelligent electric propulsion technology, biological breeding science, resource and environment big data engineering, wetland protection and restoration, intelligent forestry, labor education and science history, have been officially included in the undergraduate specialty catalogue. The professional points recorded, approved and adjusted this time will be included in the undergraduate enrollment plan of relevant colleges and universities in 2022.\n\nThe Ministry of education has made it clear that in the adjustment of undergraduate specialty setting this time, it supports colleges and universities to actively serve the national strategy, regional economic, social and industrial development needs, and set up majors that meet the orientation and characteristics of running schools; Guide colleges and universities to make good use of the “catalyst” of interdisciplinary integration, promote the construction of new engineering, new medical, new agricultural and new liberal arts, and add new majors of interdisciplinary integration such as arts, science, engineering and medical engineering.\n\nLet’s take a look at the details:\n\n1、 List of newly registered undergraduate majors (105 majors in 44 universities)\n\n2、 List of newly approved undergraduate majors (15 majors in 13 universities)\n\n3、 Adjust the list of degree granting categories or years of study (2 majors in 2 universities)\n\n4、 Cancel the list of majors (37 majors in 15 colleges and universities)", "timestamp": 1649014606, "digest": "DdL8KNsI0SLspyHP49ejfbqO-OWA8OCeQub7GNOsVKw", "contributor": "0x9E0305a415939543f8b9cc173A51027F42Ccb657"}

Этот сектор постоянно находится на грани срыва, где он открывает как технологические инновации, так и инновации моделей бизнеса и адаптирует их к постоянно меняющимся требованиям.\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b3f6f9411c28ca70ed99f40312c3a4d22daa2aed-1018x568.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nПоследней инновационной волной в игровой индустрии стало появление GameFi - более широкой финансиализации игровых активов. Первая модель монетизации GameFi - play-to-earn (P2E) - была предоставлена в игре Axie Infinity. Игроки могут покупать аксей, чтобы заработать SLP-токены, внутриигровой товар, используемый для разведения и улучшения аксей. Экономический успех Axie привел к появлению множества рипофов и NFT-игр, которые усовершенствовали модель \"P2E\" с помощью стейкинг-моделей.\n\n**Pay to Play2Earn: Недостатки спекулятивных игр** \n\nСпекулятивная и рефлексивная система, присущая игровой модели \"P2E\", привела к созданию игровых брендов с многомиллиардной оценочной стоимостью, таких как Axie Infinity, DeFi Kingdoms, Star Atlas и другие. Однако у существующей игровой модели play-to-earn есть несколько серьезных недостатков, которые препятствуют ее долгосрочному успеху.\n\nВо-первых, возможность покупки НФТ или внутриигровой валюты создает определенную механику \"pay-to-win\", чего избегает большинство крупных франшиз и успешных игр. Самые успешные игры часто делают упор на скилл, предпочитая создавать “Ranked matchmaking” избегая принципа \"спамь кредиткой пока не победишь\".\n\nВо-вторых, большинство P2E игр требуют предварительных инвестиций в НФТ только для того, чтобы начать играть. Это, естественно, становится существенной преградой для многих пользователей и еще больше усиливает принцип \"pay-to-win\".\n\nДа в принципе, спросите 100 крипто-геймеров, на счет того, весело ли играть в игры, и почти каждый вам даст ответ: \"Нет... но я на этом зарабатываю\". Игроки, зарабатывающие деньги с помощью MonkeyWork игровых действий, не являются явным показателем успеха франшизы. Конечный результат всегда будет один - игроки будут постепенно переходить от одной игры, в которой им удалось заработать, в другую, постоянно находясь в поисках новых платформ для подобного рода заработка.\n\n**Немного о “Стипендиальной программе“**\n\nЧасто деятельность P2E фармилки поддерживается \"стипендиальными программами\". Например, стипендиальная программа Axie позволяет более бедным геймерам заимствовать активы у богатых НФТ владельцев, делясь с ними частью прибыли. По сути, стипендиаты выполняют повторяющиеся внутриигровые действия и делят часть прибыли с владельцами NFT. Игровые гильдии, такие как Yield Guild Games, расширили программу стипендий, поддерживая более 20 000 стипендиатов. Несмотря на восхищение тем, что YGG позволяет людям получать денежное вознаграждение за свой труд, такая динамика игры не является устойчивой. Стипендиальная программа, которая больше похожа на работу, требует дальнейшего роста возможностей дохода в Axie Infinity.\n\n**Заимствование из традиционных игр: Монетизация в играх NFT** \n\nСегодня большинство игр монетизируют периодический доход по одной из двух схем. Первая схема - социальная ценность - продажа внутриигровых активов, которые демонстрируют статус или визуальную/косметическую ценность, но не влияют на игровой процесс. Fortnite - прекрасный пример, который построил успешный бизнес на продаже скинов или визуальных улучшений для оружия. Roblox монетизируется за счет подписки на Robux, которые можно применить в различных играх, созданных сторонними разработчиками, у некоторых из них во главе - полезность, а у других - социальная ценность. Наконец, такие игры, как GTA, позволяют игрокам приобретать предметы, которые помогают быстрее завершить сюжетную линию; однако в обладании определенными видами имущества есть и элемент социальной ценности (например, Lambo против Prius).\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/d325fe76d3c89d40ffafb9c0a56872685db3020b-1024x728.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nЭта модель может быть широко применена и к криптоиграм, только лишь с тем отличием, что постоянный доход будет поступать через вторичные торговые платежи, а не подписки (например, Fortnite V-Bucks и Roblox Robux).\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/49c8a6c9ba24e2baf3c6d86191bfbf421856bd7f-1442x1138.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nИгровая книга НФТ сфокусирована на продаже НФТ и совмещении стейкинга и доходности для создания стимулов именно \"играть\" в игру. Не существует популярных игр NFT, которые концентрируются на монетизации через социальную ценность, хотя есть проекты NFT, такие как BAYC и другие коллекции, которые монетизируются в основном из-за социальной ценности.\n\nБольшинство NFT игр не могут преодолеть Entertainment Threshold (порог развлечения) - точку, в которой компания или разработчик создали игру, достаточно захватывающую, чтобы крепко стоять на ногах не только из-за финансовых стимулов предлагаемых пользователям.\n\n**Краткая заметка о коммунальных НФТ**\n\nКак было сказано ранее, наличие торгуемых НФТ, обеспечивающих конкурентные преимущества, быстро превращается в систему pay-to-win, поэтому большинство игр с НФТ должны избегать этого в принципе. Однако есть случаи, когда НФТ, суть которых - польза, имеют смысл в игре. Time-saving NFTs - это механизм, с помощью которого разработчики игр могут подойти к интеграции с НФТ. Одним из ярких примеров являются MMORPG, такие как Runescape или World of Warcraft, в которых есть множество общих предметов: ресурсы, например, дерево, золото и кирпичи, необходимые для строительства других более значимых ресурсов, но по своей сути не делающие игрока лучше в соревновательных аспектах игры. Сочетание этих типов обычных НФТ с неторгуемыми соревновательными или социальными НФТ - более лучший способ создания НФТ игр, основанных на схеме полезности.\n\n**Исследуем пробелы: Free-to-Play-to-Earn (F2P2E)** \n\nДаже несмотря на свои недостатки, модель \"P2E\" представляет собой новую динамику для создания игровой экономики. Игровая модель free-to-play-to-earn (F2P2E) может подойти для криптоигр лучше, чем модель pay-to-play-to-earn (P2P2E).\n\nСтоит отметить, что плохо продуманные игры free-to-play (F2P) все равно остаются такими же играми, как и P2E-игры, а значит, F2P-игры должны использовать более эффективные стратегии монетизации. Представьте себе игру, в которой скины (например, одежда для персонажа) дают только косметические преимущества, но люди в игре все равно должны играть, чтобы заработать ресурсы, необходимые для создания того же скина для персонажа. Это все еще воплощает игру с динамично развивающейся вторичной экономикой, но не переходит в среду \"pay-to-win\".\n\n**Заключительные размышления об Play-to-Earn** \n\nP2E-модель, популяризированная играми на подобие Axie Infinity, стала значимым моментом в игровом секторе NFT. В ближайшие годы в эту сферу будут инвестированы миллиарды долларов, но большинство ищет игру в стиле Axie, несмотря на то, что новая модель - это то, что привлечет новые миллионы геймеров. Модель free-to-play-to-earn позволит использовать систему play-to-earn, одновременно поддерживая конкурентную среду и устойчивую экономику. \n\nСложно судить что будет дальше, еще недавно никто не мог подумать, что люди будут покупать виртуальные кроссовки и зарабатывать с того, что просто бегают по пару минут в день. Но с другой стороны - отличный оздоровительный ход, хотя бы небольшая часть криптокомьюнити начала немного активничать, а не тупо сидеть за компуктерами дома, хотя, уже слышал, как кибер-умы придумывают схемы, с установкой Степна друзьям-курьерам, которые и так весь день на ногах.)", "timestamp": 1649014691, "digest": "wC8MZWZRivHnHNDxjVYiyzq28bQaK77h9FA8TPjOfZk", "contributor": "0xAD4bE496A44072E2f4A000ad870674aa597447f3"}

But it never actually gave us the tools to really build a healthy relationship, a family, a household, or even a lasting friend circle. It taught us that we had to *post* and *perform* in order to find connection. And most (in-market) web3 projects are no better, centering our social worth around our ***wallets***, requiring us to bid for and buyout generic digital assets just to find the social connection and sense of belonging that we’ve all been starved for.\n\nMany of us have understandably lost our capacity to, and our appetite for intimacy during this age of social disintegration and pandemic-induced isolation. It’s still easier (and arguably *“psychologically safer”*) to click, like, scroll, and swipe, rather than go down the rabbithole of forging and sustaining a real intimate and genuine connection with someone. These days, even a simple act like giving someone a phone call, feels like *such* a damn chore. Or worse, like something that’s rudely interruptive or borderline unwelcomed…😔\n\n> ***If we all took a good hard look at our inner circles right now, I think we’d find that there are holes, gaps, and inconsistencies in almost all of our social fabrics.***\n\nMany of us don't have much of a semblance of an inner circle anymore, and those of us that do, may be feeling like the people orbiting our world aren’t even the truest reflections of who we are anymore.\n\nBut it’s not our fault. We’ve grown and we’ve changed, and in many ways, the social platforms we’ve been fed on for the last decade haven’t changed *with* us.\n\n> ***As the world rapidly shifts and evolves, those shallow, artificial connections and instant, fleeting flashes of social gratification just don’t cut it anymore.***\n>\n> ***Those old-world constructs have no real place in our future.***\n\nBecause where we’re going, we’re going to need a much stronger social foundation to anchor us to this new, fast-spinning world, and we’re going to need a ***much more*** ***heavy-hitting*** sense of belonging if we truly want to thrive in the next decade.\n\nPrimal was conceived after we started to ask ourselves if the average person actually has the tools, resources, and the ability to truly build their *idealized* social fabric ***however*** they want, ***whenever*** they want, and ***wherever*** they want, across any, or all of the spaces that they occupy. Years of social research and intuitive investigation tells us that the answer is **NO**.\n\nIsn’t it *terribly ironic* and just a little bit ***maddening*** that in Year 2022 where truly miraculous technological possibilities exist (I mean, we can send liquid engine rockets up to space for crying out loud!), we’re still finding it a pain in the ass to connect:\n\n1. Online\n2. In person\n3. And on dating apps?\n\nThese universal barriers to finding, forming, and initiating high-quality intimate relationships means that every day, **we are missing out** **on** opportunities to connect with ***our meant-to-be mates***.\n\nAt Primal, we believe that there are certain people in the world who are meant to orbit our lives at various moments in time (and possibly even forever). We believe that there are individuals out there with whom we are meant to learn from, create with, build with, make music with, make love to, have children with, laugh and cry with, cultivate a home with, grow old with, and all of the above, and all of the in-between.\n\n> ***Our team at Primal is on the insane mission to sync every single one of us to our already-existing mates in the world.***\n\nCause why shouldn’t the next era of our lives be about having some good old-fashioned fun with the ones who rock our world!? We’ve done our part for the social-industrial complex, working hard to pump out the never-ending streams of content to feed the big tech beasts, quietly starving our most primal needs, while contributing to their bottom lines. But as the pandemic winds down and our social media metrics plateau, ***we believe this is the perfect window of opportunity for us to retire to The Roaring 2020s***, and finally extract some real value out of the social platforms we utilize most.\n\nFor us, The Roaring 2020s looks like the masses (both young and old alike) living in a blissful state of ***“high-intimate alpha,”*** which we define as the highest sense of social belonging felt possible, and our aim is to create the tools and the spaces necessary to facilitate and scale this on a metalevel. We want all of the alt moms, solo parents, divorcées, lonely celebrities, poly babes, hot dads, spectrum riders, and weirdly normal individuals out there to have what they need to make it happen, and fill their lives with all of the people meant to be in them.\n\n### Imagine us living in a world…\n\n1. Where our most rich, raw, and authentic *intimate identities*, (not our carefully-curated feeds and social profiles) is what we leverage to find, form, and initiate our intimate connections\n2. Where the technology which powers our *intimate identities* is something we all have collective ownership over\n3. Where we don’t need to perform or perfect ourselves in order to attract meaningful relationships\n4. Where we can truly have the choice, freedom, and the power to individually decide *when* and *how* we want to bring intimate relationships into our lives\n5. And where we can actually make that happen instantaneously, with something as simple as a swipe of a toggle\n\nThis has been our vision since 2016, and from 2019 onwards, we’ve been working underground in stealth mode, engineering a deep solution to make this a tangible reality for us all.\n\n> ***After almost 3 years of incubation, we’re extremely proud to announce that Primal World is finally on its way to becoming accessible to the masses.***\n\nAs we move into the next layer of consumer social, into the more experiential, immersive world of the metaverse (particularly as ***avatars***), it is deeply important that we do not forget to ground ourselves in *who we really are* (in our real-life identities) and build the tools and the platforms necessary to ensure we all have the stronger social foundations in place for our collective mental, emotional, physical, and financial well beings to thrive.\n\nAs the true layer 1 for consumer social, we’re calling out to all the devs, designers, founders, builders, badasses, and next generation of internet stakeholders to come build with us and join the Primal World revolution.\n\n***Because*** ***this is the infrastructure that the internet has always been missing, and*** ***this is the paradigm shift that’s going to make The Roaring 2020s a true global reality***\n\n***…for real, and for us all.***", "timestamp": 1649015095, "digest": "IKMibZoV1_MRiJGXHdHx22mcDC4JEAAEZupzbIsuYfk", "contributor": "0xD9B63Bf44467CAfF2c2E18c149a83097BAcd5790"}

Roblox монетизируется за счет подписки на Robux, которые можно применить в различных играх, созданных сторонними разработчиками, у некоторых из них во главе - полезность, а у других - социальная ценность. Наконец, такие игры, как GTA, позволяют игрокам приобретать предметы, которые помогают быстрее завершить сюжетную линию; однако в обладании определенными видами имущества есть и элемент социальной ценности (например, Lambo против Prius).\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/d325fe76d3c89d40ffafb9c0a56872685db3020b-1024x728.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nЭта модель может быть широко применена и к криптоиграм, только лишь с тем отличием, что постоянный доход будет поступать через вторичные торговые платежи, а не подписки (например, Fortnite V-Bucks и Roblox Robux).\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/49c8a6c9ba24e2baf3c6d86191bfbf421856bd7f-1442x1138.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nИгровая книга НФТ сфокусирована на продаже НФТ и совмещении стейкинга и доходности для создания стимулов именно \"играть\" в игру. Не существует популярных игр NFT, которые концентрируются на монетизации через социальную ценность, хотя есть проекты NFT, такие как BAYC и другие коллекции, которые монетизируются в основном из-за социальной ценности.\n\nБольшинство NFT игр не могут преодолеть Entertainment Threshold (порог развлечения) - точку, в которой компания или разработчик создали игру, достаточно захватывающую, чтобы крепко стоять на ногах не только из-за финансовых стимулов предлагаемых пользователям.\n\n**Краткая заметка о коммунальных НФТ**\n\nКак было сказано ранее, наличие торгуемых НФТ, обеспечивающих конкурентные преимущества, быстро превращается в систему pay-to-win, поэтому большинство игр с НФТ должны избегать этого в принципе. Однако есть случаи, когда НФТ, суть которых - польза, имеют смысл в игре. Time-saving NFTs - это механизм, с помощью которого разработчики игр могут подойти к интеграции с НФТ. Одним из ярких примеров являются MMORPG, такие как Runescape или World of Warcraft, в которых есть множество общих предметов: ресурсы, например, дерево, золото и кирпичи, необходимые для строительства других более значимых ресурсов, но по своей сути не делающие игрока лучше в соревновательных аспектах игры. Сочетание этих типов обычных НФТ с неторгуемыми соревновательными или социальными НФТ - более лучший способ создания НФТ игр, основанных на схеме полезности.\n\n**Исследуем пробелы: Free-to-Play-to-Earn (F2P2E)** \n\nДаже несмотря на свои недостатки, модель \"P2E\" представляет собой новую динамику для создания игровой экономики. Игровая модель free-to-play-to-earn (F2P2E) может подойти для криптоигр лучше, чем модель pay-to-play-to-earn (P2P2E).\n\nСтоит отметить, что плохо продуманные игры free-to-play (F2P) все равно остаются такими же играми, как и P2E-игры, а значит, F2P-игры должны использовать более эффективные стратегии монетизации. Представьте себе игру, в которой скины (например, одежда для персонажа) дают только косметические преимущества, но люди в игре все равно должны играть, чтобы заработать ресурсы, необходимые для создания того же скина для персонажа. Это все еще воплощает игру с динамично развивающейся вторичной экономикой, но не переходит в среду \"pay-to-win\".\n\n**Заключительные размышления об Play-to-Earn** \n\nP2E-модель, популяризированная играми на подобие Axie Infinity, стала значимым моментом в игровом секторе NFT. В ближайшие годы в эту сферу будут инвестированы миллиарды долларов, но большинство ищет игру в стиле Axie, несмотря на то, что новая модель - это то, что привлечет новые миллионы геймеров. Модель free-to-play-to-earn позволит использовать систему play-to-earn, одновременно поддерживая конкурентную среду и устойчивую экономику. \n\nСложно судить что будет дальше, еще недавно никто не мог подумать, что люди будут покупать виртуальные кроссовки и зарабатывать с того, что просто бегают по пару минут в день. Но с другой стороны - отличный оздоровительный ход, хотя бы небольшая часть криптокомьюнити начала немного активничать, а не тупо сидеть за компуктерами дома, хотя, уже слышал, как кибер-умы придумывают схемы, с установкой Степна друзьям-курьерам, которые и так весь день на ногах.)", "timestamp": 1649014732, "digest": "wC8MZWZRivHnHNDxjVYiyzq28bQaK77h9FA8TPjOfZk", "contributor": "0xAD4bE496A44072E2f4A000ad870674aa597447f3"}

Leju new media launched the “wide face” column, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of real estate products.\n\nHaidian Yongfeng North China Resources happy Lirun Park and zhonghaihui Delhi are expected to open in March. The two projects next to each other are low-density board buildings, and the four bedroom house structure is almost the same. On the whole, the function and scale are very good. The difference between them is 6 square meters, but there are differences in many details and there is a big gap in the total price.\n\nWhich four dwelling house type is more worth buying becomes a direct PK war! Leju new media does some PK on the house type for the reference of house buyers!\n\nThe house type diagram is as follows: happy Lirun garden is 119 square meters, and zhonghaihui Delhi is 125 square meters.\n\nPK1 structure: the house type structure is the same, and China Sea is slightly larger than 6 square meters\n\nThe picture on the left shows the house type of Runyuan, and the picture on the right shows huidelhi\n\nComments: the structure is a classic North-South transparent three wide house type. The inner master bedroom, the right guest bedroom at the entrance, the living room, dining room and a side bedroom (activity room) realize the super large North-South transparent pattern; The kitchens are on the left side of the entrance, and the guest bathroom and the main bathroom are next to each other on the inside. Because Runyuan is 6 square meters large, two guest bedrooms and one master bedroom are slightly larger than huidelhi.\n\nPK2 entry: the porch is more traditional and concise\n\nThe picture on the left shows the entrance of Runyuan, and the picture on the right shows huidelhi\n\nComments: both have entrances, but the details are slightly different. Zhonghaihui Delhi entrance is traditional and concise. It is on the right side of the house, which is convenient to change clothes, shoes and hats; There is a corner in the happiness garden, which is slightly inferior.\n\nPk3 toilet: the guest bathroom realizes the separation of dry and wet, and huidelhi has an independent housekeeping room\n\nThe picture on the left shows the bathroom of Runyuan, and the picture on the right shows huidelhi\n\nComments: both Runyuan and huidelhi bathrooms are on the same side of the house type, and the main bathroom is adjacent to the public bathroom. From the house type in hand, both bathrooms are Mingwei, and the guest bathroom has achieved the separation of dry and wet. The house type of huidelhi has specially designed the housekeeping room, and the washing machine is placed separately next to the living room. In addition, huidelhi master bedroom Mingwei is determined, but Runyuan master bedroom bathroom is not Mingwei if it is a non border household.\n\nPK4 living room: Runyuan living room is wider and deeper\n\nThe picture on the left shows the living room of Runyuan and the picture on the right shows huidelhi\n\nComments: the living room is a benchmark for the comfort scale of the house type. From the current house type, the smaller Runyuan living room is 4m wide, while the larger huidelhi living room is 3.8m. However, huideli has more depth, that is, the TV wall is long enough, which is estimated to be 0.6-0.7 meters longer than the director of Runyuan. You can see the schematic diagram of the restaurant connected by the two family living rooms. Runyuan uses a round table and huidelhi uses a square table. Who is better and who is better may be judged differently by different buyers.\n\nPk5 master bedroom: there is an L-shaped cloakroom in huidelhi\n\nThe picture on the left shows the master bedroom of Runyuan, and the picture on the right shows huidelhi\n\nComments: the main bedroom of huidelhi is 3.7m wider, and the Runyuan is 3.4m; The depth is 4.6m and 3.75m respectively. The result is the difference between 17 square meters and 12.75 square meters. This directly leads to a more private L-shaped corner cloakroom in Zhonghai Runyuan, while Runyuan can only be designed as a bedside wardrobe. For families that pay attention to privacy, especially the hostess’s attention to the cloakroom, it is obvious that the advantages of Zhonghai are reflected.\n\nPk6 second recumbent: slightly different in size\n\nThe picture on the left shows Runyuan second bedroom and the picture on the right shows huidelhi\n\nComments: the two Recumbents are basically the same. The slight difference is that the area of the two lateral Recumbents in the north and south of huidelhi is slightly larger. In addition, there are bay windows on the south side, but not in Runyuan.\n\nPk7 location: huideli is obviously better than Runyuan\n\nThe picture on the left shows the location of Runyuan and the picture on the right shows huidelhi\n\nComments: the location of the two buildings in the community is the biggest difference between the two. The four residences of huidelhi are obviously better than Runyuan, which are in the middle of the core of the community, while Runyuan is in the corner, adjacent to the street or the edge of the community. This is the most obvious disadvantage.\n\nPk8 total price: RMB 600000-1 million cheaper for Runyuan\n\nComments: I have to PK the total price of both. In terms of total price, the four houses with 125 square meters of Zhonghai are about 10.4 million-11 million, and the four houses with 119 square meters of China resources are about 9.8 million-10 million, with a difference of about 600000-1 million. Moreover, it is said that what China Shipping provides is simple decoration, and at least 200000 will be added if it can follow the fine decoration of Runyuan PK. Therefore, the total price of shangrun park is obviously less than 800000-1.2 million.\n\nThe main bedroom is larger than the traditional one, and the main bedroom is more convenient. The main bedroom is located in the central entrance of Delhi, which is the same as that in the central entrance of Delhi. The main bedroom is 6 square meters, and the main bedroom is set in the central entrance of Delhi. The living room of happy Lirun garden is wider, but the total price is about 600000-1 million. It is said that Zhonghai is a simple decoration, and 200000 + will be added to each set for fine decoration, so the gap of the same house type between the two projects will be about 800000-1.2 million.", "timestamp": 1649014881, "digest": "3g2pnLn1DkSgPBlrf4lhLy7Ty1900tIuP39oBpO0Znk", "contributor": "0xd6a92cc73cEd114b83963A5ae0Adc85901C8904E"}

On February 23, the Propaganda Department of the provincial Party committee held a press conference to invite some national and provincial moral model representatives to meet and exchange with reporters.\n\nIn recent years, Shandong Province has carefully selected models. Last year, Zhao Li, Zhang LIANGANG and Xie Liting of Shandong won the honorary title of the eighth national moral model, which is one of the provinces with the largest number. At the same time, Tian xiangxia and other seven comrades won the nomination award.\n\nAt the eighth provincial moral model commendation meeting held in December 2021, 60 comrades were awarded the honorary title of the eighth provincial moral model, which further promoted the formation of a strong atmosphere of advocating morality, goodness and Qi in the province.\n\nEnter the grid, buildings and families, go around the house to ask for needs, classify and build archives, initiate the establishment of the first “Neighborhood Watch Association” in Shandong, and build a green channel to help and solve the difficulties of vulnerable groups in the community… Recalling the community work in the past 39 years, the winner of the eighth national moral model nomination award, the joint party secretary of the West District, Nancun street, worker’s new village, Tianqiao District, Jinan Tian xiangxia, Secretary of the community Party committee of the Western District, felt deeply: “there is no ‘big project’ in community service. What we are engaged in is all ‘small things’ of women. In my eyes, the core of all work is the word’ masses’. Advocating the virtues of the new era and a healthy lifestyle is to pass happiness among our neighbors.” In the long-term front-line service of grass-roots communities, Tian xiangxia summed up a set of “xiangxia community mass work methods” of “three rely on, three use and four in place”, which was listed as one of the 100 excellent community mass work methods promoted by the Ministry of civil affairs.\n\nZhao Li, 54, is a villager of housekeeper Wa village, Qingyun street, Xintai City and the Eighth National Model of courageous action. Next to his home is Qingyun lake. He has learned a good skill of swimming since childhood. The first time he went into the water to save people was in the winter of 1985, when Zhao Li was only 17 years old. Over the past 30 years, he has repeatedly risked his life to participate in water rescue, successfully rescued 16 drowning people, and voluntarily participated in the rescue of drowning people for more than 40 times. “We Shandong people have love and righteousness, and we will do it when it’s time to do it! Although there are times of fear in my heart, as long as I see someone falling into the water, I don’t hesitate to save it, because if I delay a few seconds, a life may be lost.” Zhao Li said. In August 2020, he initiated the establishment of Tongzhou public welfare rescue service center to provide water emergency rescue services. So far, there are more than 170 registered volunteers and more than 400 peripheral rescue forces. Years of rescue experience has made Zhao Li deeply feel that public welfare is not a person’s full effort, but everyone’s ability.\n\nMore than 100 red songs, 800000 words of lecture materials, more than 70000 kilometers of publicity itinerary and 20 years of “red propagandist” outline the image of Xie Liting, 82, the Eighth National Model of honesty and trustworthiness and the leader of the positive energy publicity Party group of Fuqiao street Paifang street community, Rencheng District, Jining City. He always kept in mind the oath and determination to “listen to the party and follow the party all his life”. To promote the party’s innovative theory to fly into the homes of ordinary people, grass-roots propaganda must be grounded and dynamic. Before each lecture, Xie Liting carefully “prepared lessons”, understood the age, culture and professional composition of the audience, and thought about what kind of language and way to speak. When inspiration came in the middle of the night, he immediately got up and wrote it down. Over the years, leaders at all levels have visited his home for many times and invited him to participate in the propaganda of party history and the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee. Xie Liting said: “many people have advised me that it’s time to have a rest at such an old age. However, these have not stopped me from preaching. Shandong people are honest, and as a party member, we should stick to our original promise.”\n\n“Dedication is to do, love and specialize in one line.” Zhang LIANGANG, the Eighth National Model of dedication and dedication and a high-level expert of Shandong Port Group Co., Ltd., said. In 1983, he graduated from university and took root in the front line of the wharf with the dream of serving the country with science and technology. Since 2013, he and members of the “LIANGANG innovation team” have started from a piece of white paper, broken through difficulties and walls, made five breakthroughs and 10 major innovative achievements in all aspects of the automated terminal, and built the first fully automated container terminal in Asia with independent intellectual property rights. “The deployment of the province’s’ top ten innovations’ is very rare for our team to seize new opportunities and build a major science and technology demonstration project of smart port in Shandong Province. Innovation in the field of science and technology is inseparable from talent introduction and education innovation. I have a deep understanding of this. My personal experience and our team combination are the most convincing. We will speed up the R & D and implementation of key innovation projects and make more breakthroughs ‘neck sticking’ technical problems. “ Zhang LIANGANG said.\n\n“As an ordinary rural woman, I am very excited to attend this press conference.” The eighth provincial moral model, said Liu Hua, a villager of Cuizhai village, Dawang Town, Guangrao County. More than 20 years ago, her mother-in-law and adoptive parents fell ill one after another. Without complaint or regret, she took up the important task of taking care of five elderly people at home. In order to create better living conditions for the elderly, in 2015, she and her husband began to operate the edible fungus farm. Due to their willingness to bear hardships and promise, the farm became more and more prosperous. “Our town and village often carry out voluntary service activities to respect and love the elderly through our new era civilization practice station. I mobilize my sisters to participate together and bring the fresh mushrooms and tomatoes on the farm to the elderly.” Liu Hua said.\n\nIn the construction of virtue Shandong in the new era, every ordinary person is advancing in an extraordinary way to interpret the thickness of life and the power of virtue. The moral model’s fighting spirit of self-improvement and forging ahead, the noble character of being promising and good, and the sincere feelings of loving the motherland and dedicating the people will provide rich moral nourishment and strong spiritual power for the construction of a strong socialist modern Province in the new era.

The New Yellow River reporter learned that at present, more than 1500 pharmacies in Jinan have cooperated with third-party platforms to provide distribution services, and nearly 150 provide 24-hour drug purchase and delivery services, serving 600000 people.\n\nIt is understood that in 2021, Jinan actively innovated in the field of drug retail, and jointly built a drug retail traceability system through the implementation of the “electronic receipt” system to meet the people’s demand for “reassuring drugs”; Through the “double remote” system of remote prescription and remote trial, we can share the convenience of prescription drug sales and meet the people’s demand for “reassuring purchase of drugs”. It has realized the tripartite win-win situation of supervision, enterprises and the masses, and has made beneficial exploration in building a safe and assured consumption demonstration city.\n\nThe joint construction of “electronic receipt” has realized the traceability of the whole chain of drug retail transportation, distribution and acceptance, guaranteed the quality of drug circulation, and achieved the electronic traceability of drug retail transportation and distribution. At present, more than 3000 stores of more than 80 pharmaceutical retail chain enterprises in the city have built electronic receipts in their own computer management system, replacing the paper version of the accompanying bill of lading. While establishing a complete and real computer traceability system, it has greatly reduced the operation cost and reduced the operation burden of enterprises.\n\nPrescription reviewers share “double remote”, realize accurate traceability from “drug” to “person”, and ensure the safety of prescription drug management. According to the idea of “supervision department advocacy, industry association organization and market-oriented operation”, gradually realize the management mode of remote sharing of prescriptions and reviewers. At present, the city has basically realized full coverage of remote pharmaceutical care pharmacies in the main urban area, ensuring that retail pharmacies have “drugs” that can be sold and “shared prescription reviewers” that can be reviewed and must be reviewed, avoiding the blind spot of prescription review and supervision.\n\nSupervision, enterprises and the masses win-win, and help build a demonstration city of safe and assured consumption. The regulatory authorities strengthen supervision through “one receipt and two remote”. The company promotes the “Internet plus drug circulation” as a good measure to serve the development of pharmaceutical enterprises, and encourages chain enterprises to promote the transformation of new retail strategy and promote the high quality development of the pharmaceutical retail market. Through the organic combination of “one receipt, two remote” and “online order store pick-up and online order store delivery” 24-hour drug purchase service measures, the masses can enjoy more safe, convenient and accessible pharmaceutical services. In June 2021, Jinan market supervision bureau and the third-party platform took the lead in launching the “little yellow light” livelihood service plan in the country, which can deliver drugs urgently needed by the people to their homes 24 hours at any time, making it no longer difficult for consumers to buy drugs late at night.

Let's move forward resolutely -- upholding the Changsha spirit in epidemic prevention and control", "body": "There is always a power in the “long-term” evaluation. Let’s move forward resolutely\n\n——Changsha spirit of epidemic prevention and control\n\nWen / Cao Hui, ou Yangqian\n\nThere is always a force that makes us move forward resolutely. This power originates from the city spirit. This kind of spirit is cohesive force, gathers sand into a tower, gathers loneliness and weakness into greatness; It is vitality, self-improvement, that makes sleepy land sprout.\n\nOn the Bank of Xiangshui River, the foothills are towering. Lushan looked down at the people at his feet.\n\nIn the wake of the outbreak of pneumonia caused by New Coronavirus, Changsha has changed its past days in recent days. A silent city is not depressed. On the contrary, a spirit is condensing, surging, fermenting and subliming.\n\nLushan testifies! Thousands of miles of assistance, love relay, investigation and prevention, and the participation of the whole city… This unexpected epidemic is not only a test of urban strength, but also a revitalization of urban spirit!\n\nOn January 23, Wuhan announced its closure. At the first time of the day, the Changsha Municipal Party committee and the Changsha municipal government made a decisive decision and quickly established the epidemic prevention headquarters, which operated efficiently.\n\nA game of chess in the whole city is powerful, orderly and effective. Launch the first level response to major public health emergencies; Start the emergency mechanism; Start the safeguard mechanism; Allocate support materials… Each urgent time scale clearly records Changsha’s respect for life and its responsibility to the people.\n\nIn a race against time, at Huanghua Airport, at the south high-speed railway station, at the intercity railway, at the high-speed entrance to the city, at the Hexi bus station… Strength tilted to the key checkpoints for registration, temperature measurement and strict disinfection. In just one day, Changsha used caution and responsibility to weave a “protective cover” of the city.\n\nRace against time. In the vast rural areas, the ordinary “village horn” sounded in time, sentence by sentence and sound by sound, expanding the publicity of prevention and control measures; In the urban area, based on the grid, grid members personally carry out door-to-door visits to collect information and monitor the epidemic situation.\n\nA special battle without gunpowder smoke entered the critical stage; A solid city wall against the epidemic stood towering.\n\nThis is a big mobilization of the whole city. Changsha, a glorious and warm city, is building dams to fight the epidemic in the southeast, northwest, men, women, old and young; From the majority of medical staff to ordinary workers, farmers, cadres, soldiers and students, they help each other and contribute silently.\n\nIn the fight against the epidemic, the majority of medical and scientific researchers stepped forward and fulfilled their mission. “The hospital is the battlefield. As soldiers, who will go up if we don’t rush up?” Jin Diwen, a 57 year old veteran party member of Changsha fourth hospital, wrote a petition and stood up at the forefront of the fight against the epidemic; Zhou Bailong, a rural doctor who was once shortlisted as the candidate of “the most beautiful rural doctor in China”, volunteered to take care of 17 villagers returning from Hubei. It takes seven or eight hours to provide door-to-door service a day… Medical staff rushed to the front line and became the most beautiful “villager”.\n\nFighting against pneumonia caused by New Coronavirus is closely related to family, individual and social solidarity. It is everyone’s responsibility.\n\nResponsibility and responsibility are so noble, but they are so ordinary.\n\nSelfless and fearless soldiers in white clothes fighting on the front line are responsible, as are ordinary citizens who maintain a normal attitude and actively do a good job in protection; It is a responsibility to stick to the post and be dedicated, and it is also a responsibility to take temporary rest and cooperate with prevention and control; It’s a responsibility to offer love and help generously. It’s also a responsibility to close stores and take care of yourself.\n\nThe responsibility of overcoming difficulties brings together the majestic force of Changsha to share life and death in the same boat!\n\nThe spirit of a city can be found from its typical representatives, but it should be publicized in the choice in front of the great righteousness.\n\nHunan and Hubei are separated by a strip of water, connected by heart, embracing each other and interlinked by love. In the face of those from Hubei who were stranded outside and could not go home, Changsha set up 11 designated reception hotels for people from epidemic foci to warm these “neighbors” wandering in Hunan in the cold wind and rain; For Hubei people who are isolated at home, Changsha has arranged for special personnel to be good “errands” to deliver materials and meet their needs. “We should have a warm home for our neighbors in Changsha!” Enthusiastic Changsha people said.\n\nA warm current also poured into Hubei. On January 23, the people’s pharmacy received the help of Wuhan Jinyintan hospital for material shortage, and sent 500 sets of protective clothing to Wuhan the next day; Keming noodle industry donated 1000 boxes of instant noodles and 550 boxes of Wudong noodles, which started smoothly from Xinxiang, Henan Province and went all the way south. After coordination and efforts of various parties, they were sent to 8 front-line hospitals in Wuhan; BYD overseas branch gave full play to the convenience of its residence, coordinated foreign resources, purchased N95 masks worth 1 million yuan and sent them to the front-line hospital, and donated 10 million yuan to Hubei Charity Federation\n\n“We come from Xiangya Hospital of Central South University and ask for Wuhan to support epidemic prevention and control.” This is a brief and comprehensive statement made by the medical workers of Xiangya Hospital in the preface to the battle;\n\n“We come from Sany Heavy Industry and Zoomlion, and ask for war to support the construction of Wuhan huoshenshan hospital.” This is the responsibility of Changsha mechanical engineering enterprise during the construction of huoshenshan Hospital;\n\n“We issued a proposal to the citizens of Changsha. In just a few days, 15 million yuan of love money rushed to Wuhan.” This is the introduction of the person in charge of Changsha Charity Federation;\n\n……\n\nTransmit strength with strength and confirm warmth with warmth. Hunan and Hubei, Changsha and Wuhan form a strong and close community of life.\n\nIn fighting New Coronavirus’s pneumonia outbreak, Changsha’s practice has tempered the character of Changsha’s spirit. The battlefield of fighting the epidemic has become a classroom to condense and carry forward the urban spirit.\n\nCountless people go retrograde, and countless people resolutely move forward.\n\nIn recent days, the measures taken in the early stage have begun to bear fruit, which will help enhance people’s confidence in overcoming the epidemic. However, the situation remains grim and the struggle continues. Changsha should not have the slightest relaxation and paralysis.\n\nLushan testified that Changsha spirit will support it to fight tenaciously until complete victory.\n\nOn February 4, we ushered in the beginning of spring, and the 24 solar terms began a new cycle.\n\nThe 24 solar terms formulated by the ancients, taking the beginning of spring as the first solar term, skillfully put the most severe and bleak season next to the most hopeful and most exciting season.\n\nLushan testify, Changsha towards spring, set out!", "timestamp": 1649015282, "digest": "434rVN5k_QQOSQmcLIii-X4pKyuLBSOAddwGsUm0nUg", "contributor": "0x8729659522c7814aD1daabdF4E405884CA29DE5e"}
{"id": "Golp4Dxz_FoyFV_RZIvZf68Vbkw_aMPhJKj8JxyZN2U", "title": "Folding screen turning year: \"one machine is hard to find\" who won the C position?", "body": "In the popular business district of Nanshan District, Shenzhen, Huawei, glory, Xiaomi, oppo and other stores are lined up. The war of high-end brands has started one after another in 2021, and the folding screen has become the protagonist of the counter.\n\nA mobile phone salesperson told reporters: “shortly after the launch of Huawei’s new P50 pocket, the white model had to add 1000 yuan before it was available, and the gold model had to add 4000 yuan. Earlier, in the new stage of Huawei’s previous generation of folding screen mobile phones, someone was willing to increase the price by more than 20000 yuan, and I sold six at a high price.”\n\nWhen the base number of folding screen mobile phones is still small, “one machine is difficult to find” and “pre-sale is full” have become the general situation of the front-end sales. Although it accounts for less than 1% of global mobile phone sales, it is undeniable that folding screen mobile phones, as a high-end mobile phone species, are rapidly entering the crowd.\n\nChen Jun, deputy general manager and chief analyst of Qunzhi consulting, told the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that according to the latest survey data of sigaintell, the global shipment scale of foldable smartphones in 2021 was about 7.21 million, with a year-on-year increase of about 171.9%. It is expected that the global shipment scale of foldable smartphones in 2022 will reach about 14.4 million, with a year-on-year increase of about 99.6%, It is expected to exceed 70 million in 2025.\n\nThe threshold of tens of millions of shipments is close at hand, and the market is still growing at a high speed. Since the second half of last year, various companies have intensively launched new folding screen products, which is a key moment to push 2022 to scale. Many people in the industry believe that 2022 has the opportunity to usher in the turning point of folding screen mobile phones.\n\nAt present, both the head brand and the core supply chain continue to increase investment on the folding screen.\n\nLi Xianjie, deputy director of TCL Huaxing advanced product development department, said in an interview with 21st Century Business Herald: “In 2022, all mobile phone manufacturers, including Lenovo, oppo, vivo and glory, will continue to actively layout folding products. By the end of 2022, oppo may launch the first slidable roll product. Samsung plans to launch the roll product and three fold product as soon as 2023. In the short term, the left and right fold and up and down order fold are still the mainstream of folding products, and TCL Huaxing is also developing multi-form folding products at the same time. It is predicted that 2023-202 Apple’s folding mobile phone will be available in 4 years, which is expected to set off a wave and lead to the wider popularization of folding screens. “\n\nAlthough there are still flaws in the experience of folding screen mobile phones, whether the sales volume can rise rapidly and whether the product line can be continuously supported need to be considered. However, with the maturity of the overall supply chain and the decline of costs, the ecology of folding screen will also enter version 2.0 and further move towards the public.\n\nScramble for c-position of folding screen\n\nIn the past MWC, folding screen mobile phones are still an important arena for giants. Huawei, Samsung, oppo, glory and other brands have displayed the latest products. This year, the competition for hegemony of folding screen will become more and more intense. Who wins the C position also means the advancement of high-end image.\n\nFrom the current shipment volume, Samsung and Huawei occupy the main share of the folding screen Market in the global market. According to the statistics of Qunzhi consulting, the shipment volume of Samsung folding screen mobile phones in 2021 was 5.8 million, accounting for 81% of the market; Huawei shipped 1 million units, accounting for 13.9%; Millet shipments were 200000, accounting for 2.7%.\n\nWith the entry of domestic manufacturers such as glory and oppo, the pattern will change in 2022. In the next 2-3 years, Apple’s choice will also become a wind vane and an important variable.\n\nChen Jun told reporters: “Apple is indeed evaluating and studying folding products. However, due to Apple’s special demands on the technology and process of folding products, the current industrial chain still needs time to further upgrade and improve. Based on this, Qunzhi consulting believes that Apple will release folding products in 2025, and the first product is still uncertain. Specifically, mobile phones or laptops are under test and pre research.”\n\nIf two years ago, mobile phone brands had different attitudes towards folding screen, now, the investment in folding screen mobile phones has become a common direction. Recently, Zhao Ming, CEO of glory, said in an interview that folding screen will be a new growth field, and glory must invest in the future, “Both ordinary mobile phones and folding screens will become the mainstream of smart phones. When we released glory Magic V, we also announced our strategy to make the folding screen the main machine. Until today, Magic V is out of stock, and we have to wait 15 to 30 days to get it. We see the potential pain point of users, that is, we need to make the folding screen lighter, thinner and more powerful Longer pool life, etc. “\n\nFor brands, folding screen has become a necessary element of high-end, which cannot be profitable in the short term. They must also show their technical and product strength and find new growth points in high-end and large-scale.\n\nOn the one hand, from the trend of the mobile phone industry, high-end has become a new driving force of the mobile phone market. On March 3, GfK’s latest report pointed out that models with good quality, fast response and powerful functions have become the first choice for consumers who want to buy new smartphones. This trend led to the average price of smartphones rising to US $368 last year (US $318 in 2020). Affected by the high-end effect (that is, the sales price rises despite the decline in sales), the sales of the global smartphone market has maintained a growth trend, and this trend continues. Between October and December 2021, the average price of smart phones rose again to $392, 6.5% higher than that in 2021.\n\nOn the other hand, many insiders pointed out to reporters that folding screen technology is a new competitive point for Android and IOS in the high-end market, and also helps domestic manufacturers compete directly with apple. As a new category, folding screen mobile phones not only upgrade the mechanical structure, but also strengthen the productivity and tool attributes of mobile phones. In addition to the innovation at the hardware level, Android smartphone manufacturers also have localization opportunities in the reconstruction of application ecology.\n\nAccording to Chen Jun, in 2022, folding screen mobile phones are still in the rising stage, and the industrial chain of folding machines is still in the stage of rapid growth. The folding screen mobile phones released by various companies are also located in super flagship models. The market pricing is generally on the high side, and the application of products at the same time", "timestamp": 1649015343, "digest": "0La9gGJ7xRmuTOwaf4_O5SB8N4XhGUp9VchB-i2YazU", "contributor": "0x8a5d26f8B46b8B5cF3ad9fb241f91Ba98d6469AB"}

Большинство игр NFT предпочли монетизировать полезную ценность, в то время как их игры могли бы лучше монетизировать ценность социальную .\n\n*\"Я считаю, что инновации модели бизнеса являются более разрушительными, чем технические инновации\" - Фред Уилсон, кофаундер Union Square Ventures.*\n\nИгровая индустрия, как и ее вымышленные персонажи, продолжает развиваться. Этот сектор постоянно находится на грани срыва, где он открывает как технологические инновации, так и инновации моделей бизнеса и адаптирует их к постоянно меняющимся требованиям.\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b3f6f9411c28ca70ed99f40312c3a4d22daa2aed-1018x568.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nПоследней инновационной волной в игровой индустрии стало появление GameFi - более широкой финансиализации игровых активов. Первая модель монетизации GameFi - play-to-earn (P2E) - была предоставлена в игре Axie Infinity. Игроки могут покупать аксей, чтобы заработать SLP-токены, внутриигровой товар, используемый для разведения и улучшения аксей. Экономический успех Axie привел к появлению множества рипофов и NFT-игр, которые усовершенствовали модель \"P2E\" с помощью стейкинг-моделей.\n\n**Pay to Play2Earn: Недостатки спекулятивных игр** \n\nСпекулятивная и рефлексивная система, присущая игровой модели \"P2E\", привела к созданию игровых брендов с многомиллиардной оценочной стоимостью, таких как Axie Infinity, DeFi Kingdoms, Star Atlas и другие. Однако у существующей игровой модели play-to-earn есть несколько серьезных недостатков, которые препятствуют ее долгосрочному успеху.\n\nВо-первых, возможность покупки НФТ или внутриигровой валюты создает определенную механику \"pay-to-win\", чего избегает большинство крупных франшиз и успешных игр. Самые успешные игры часто делают упор на скилл, предпочитая создавать “Ranked matchmaking” избегая принципа \"спамь кредиткой пока не победишь\".\n\nВо-вторых, большинство P2E игр требуют предварительных инвестиций в НФТ только для того, чтобы начать играть. Это, естественно, становится существенной преградой для многих пользователей и еще больше усиливает принцип \"pay-to-win\".\n\nДа в принципе, спросите 100 крипто-геймеров, на счет того, весело ли играть в игры, и почти каждый вам даст ответ: \"Нет... но я на этом зарабатываю\". Игроки, зарабатывающие деньги с помощью MonkeyWork игровых действий, не являются явным показателем успеха франшизы. Конечный результат всегда будет один - игроки будут постепенно переходить от одной игры, в которой им удалось заработать, в другую, постоянно находясь в поисках новых платформ для подобного рода заработка.\n\n**Немного о “Стипендиальной программе“**\n\nЧасто деятельность P2E фармилки поддерживается \"стипендиальными программами\". Например, стипендиальная программа Axie позволяет более бедным геймерам заимствовать активы у богатых НФТ владельцев, делясь с ними частью прибыли. По сути, стипендиаты выполняют повторяющиеся внутриигровые действия и делят часть прибыли с владельцами NFT. Игровые гильдии, такие как Yield Guild Games, расширили программу стипендий, поддерживая более 20 000 стипендиатов. Несмотря на восхищение тем, что YGG позволяет людям получать денежное вознаграждение за свой труд, такая динамика игры не является устойчивой. Стипендиальная программа, которая больше похожа на работу, требует дальнейшего роста возможностей дохода в Axie Infinity.\n\n**Заимствование из традиционных игр: Монетизация в играх NFT** \n\nСегодня большинство игр монетизируют периодический доход по одной из двух схем. Первая схема - социальная ценность - продажа внутриигровых активов, которые демонстрируют статус или визуальную/косметическую ценность, но не влияют на игровой процесс. Fortnite - прекрасный пример, который построил успешный бизнес на продаже скинов или визуальных улучшений для оружия. Roblox монетизируется за счет подписки на Robux, которые можно применить в различных играх, созданных сторонними разработчиками, у некоторых из них во главе - полезность, а у других - социальная ценность. Наконец, такие игры, как GTA, позволяют игрокам приобретать предметы, которые помогают быстрее завершить сюжетную линию; однако в обладании определенными видами имущества есть и элемент социальной ценности (например, Lambo против Prius).\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/d325fe76d3c89d40ffafb9c0a56872685db3020b-1024x728.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nЭта модель может быть широко применена и к криптоиграм, только лишь с тем отличием, что постоянный доход будет поступать через вторичные торговые платежи, а не подписки (например, Fortnite V-Bucks и Roblox Robux).\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/49c8a6c9ba24e2baf3c6d86191bfbf421856bd7f-1442x1138.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nИгровая книга НФТ сфокусирована на продаже НФТ и совмещении стейкинга и доходности для создания стимулов именно \"играть\" в игру. Не существует популярных игр NFT, которые концентрируются на монетизации через социальную ценность, хотя есть проекты NFT, такие как BAYC и другие коллекции, которые монетизируются в основном из-за социальной ценности.\n\nБольшинство NFT игр не могут преодолеть Entertainment Threshold (порог развлечения) - точку, в которой компания или разработчик создали игру, достаточно захватывающую, чтобы крепко стоять на ногах не только из-за финансовых стимулов предлагаемых пользователям.\n\n**Краткая заметка о коммунальных НФТ**\n\nКак было сказано ранее, наличие торгуемых НФТ, обеспечивающих конкурентные преимущества, быстро превращается в систему pay-to-win, поэтому большинство игр с НФТ должны избегать этого в принципе. Однако есть случаи, когда НФТ, суть которых - польза, имеют смысл в игре. Time-saving NFTs - это механизм, с помощью которого разработчики игр могут подойти к интеграции с НФТ. Одним из ярких примеров являются MMORPG, такие как Runescape или World of Warcraft, в которых есть множество общих предметов: ресурсы, например, дерево, золото и кирпичи, необходимые для строительства других более значимых ресурсов, но по своей сути не делающие игрока лучше в соревновательных аспектах игры. Сочетание этих типов обычных НФТ с неторгуемыми соревновательными или социальными НФТ - более лучший способ создания НФТ игр, основанных на схеме полезности.\n\n**Исследуем пробелы: Free-to-Play-to-Earn (F2P2E)** \n\nДаже несмотря на свои недостатки, модель \"P2E\" представляет собой новую динамику для создания игровой экономики. Игровая модель free-to-play-to-earn (F2P2E) может подойти для криптоигр лучше, чем модель pay-to-play-to-earn (P2P2E).\n\nСтоит отметить, что плохо продуманные игры free-to-play (F2P) все равно остаются такими же играми, как и P2E-игры, а значит, F2P-игры должны использовать более эффективные стратегии монетизации. Представьте себе игру, в которой скины (например, одежда для персонажа) дают только косметические преимущества, но люди в игре все равно должны играть, чтобы заработать ресурсы, необходимые для создания того же скина для персонажа. Это все еще воплощает игру с динамично развивающейся вторичной экономикой, но не переходит в среду \"pay-to-win\".\n\n**Заключительные размышления об Play-to-Earn** \n\nP2E-модель, популяризированная играми на подобие Axie Infinity, стала значимым моментом в игровом секторе NFT. В ближайшие годы в эту сферу будут инвестированы миллиарды долларов, но большинство ищет игру в стиле Axie, несмотря на то, что новая модель - это то, что привлечет новые миллионы геймеров. Модель free-to-play-to-earn позволит использовать систему play-to-earn, одновременно поддерживая конкурентную среду и устойчивую экономику. \n\nСложно судить что будет дальше, еще недавно никто не мог подумать, что люди будут покупать виртуальные кроссовки и зарабатывать с того, что просто бегают по пару минут в день.

Большинство игр NFT предпочли монетизировать полезную ценность, в то время как их игры могли бы лучше монетизировать ценность социальную .\n\n*\"Я считаю, что инновации модели бизнеса являются более разрушительными, чем технические инновации\" - Фред Уилсон, кофаундер Union Square Ventures.*\n\nИгровая индустрия, как и ее вымышленные персонажи, продолжает развиваться. Этот сектор постоянно находится на грани срыва, где он открывает как технологические инновации, так и инновации моделей бизнеса и адаптирует их к постоянно меняющимся требованиям.\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b3f6f9411c28ca70ed99f40312c3a4d22daa2aed-1018x568.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nПоследней инновационной волной в игровой индустрии стало появление GameFi - более широкой финансиализации игровых активов. Первая модель монетизации GameFi - play-to-earn (P2E) - была предоставлена в игре Axie Infinity. Игроки могут покупать аксей, чтобы заработать SLP-токены, внутриигровой товар, используемый для разведения и улучшения аксей. Экономический успех Axie привел к появлению множества рипофов и NFT-игр, которые усовершенствовали модель \"P2E\" с помощью стейкинг-моделей.\n\n**Pay to Play2Earn: Недостатки спекулятивных игр** \n\nСпекулятивная и рефлексивная система, присущая игровой модели \"P2E\", привела к созданию игровых брендов с многомиллиардной оценочной стоимостью, таких как Axie Infinity, DeFi Kingdoms, Star Atlas и другие. Однако у существующей игровой модели play-to-earn есть несколько серьезных недостатков, которые препятствуют ее долгосрочному успеху.\n\nВо-первых, возможность покупки НФТ или внутриигровой валюты создает определенную механику \"pay-to-win\", чего избегает большинство крупных франшиз и успешных игр. Самые успешные игры часто делают упор на скилл, предпочитая создавать “Ranked matchmaking” избегая принципа \"спамь кредиткой пока не победишь\".\n\nВо-вторых, большинство P2E игр требуют предварительных инвестиций в НФТ только для того, чтобы начать играть. Это, естественно, становится существенной преградой для многих пользователей и еще больше усиливает принцип \"pay-to-win\".\n\nДа в принципе, спросите 100 крипто-геймеров, на счет того, весело ли играть в игры, и почти каждый вам даст ответ: \"Нет... но я на этом зарабатываю\". Игроки, зарабатывающие деньги с помощью MonkeyWork игровых действий, не являются явным показателем успеха франшизы. Конечный результат всегда будет один - игроки будут постепенно переходить от одной игры, в которой им удалось заработать, в другую, постоянно находясь в поисках новых платформ для подобного рода заработка.\n\n**Немного о “Стипендиальной программе“**\n\nЧасто деятельность P2E фармилки поддерживается \"стипендиальными программами\". Например, стипендиальная программа Axie позволяет более бедным геймерам заимствовать активы у богатых НФТ владельцев, делясь с ними частью прибыли. По сути, стипендиаты выполняют повторяющиеся внутриигровые действия и делят часть прибыли с владельцами NFT. Игровые гильдии, такие как Yield Guild Games, расширили программу стипендий, поддерживая более 20 000 стипендиатов. Несмотря на восхищение тем, что YGG позволяет людям получать денежное вознаграждение за свой труд, такая динамика игры не является устойчивой. Стипендиальная программа, которая больше похожа на работу, требует дальнейшего роста возможностей дохода в Axie Infinity.\n\n**Заимствование из традиционных игр: Монетизация в играх NFT** \n\nСегодня большинство игр монетизируют периодический доход по одной из двух схем. Первая схема - социальная ценность - продажа внутриигровых активов, которые демонстрируют статус или визуальную/косметическую ценность, но не влияют на игровой процесс. Fortnite - прекрасный пример, который построил успешный бизнес на продаже скинов или визуальных улучшений для оружия. Roblox монетизируется за счет подписки на Robux, которые можно применить в различных играх, созданных сторонними разработчиками, у некоторых из них во главе - полезность, а у других - социальная ценность. Наконец, такие игры, как GTA, позволяют игрокам приобретать предметы, которые помогают быстрее завершить сюжетную линию; однако в обладании определенными видами имущества есть и элемент социальной ценности (например, Lambo против Prius).\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/d325fe76d3c89d40ffafb9c0a56872685db3020b-1024x728.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nЭта модель может быть широко применена и к криптоиграм, только лишь с тем отличием, что постоянный доход будет поступать через вторичные торговые платежи, а не подписки (например, Fortnite V-Bucks и Roblox Robux).\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/49c8a6c9ba24e2baf3c6d86191bfbf421856bd7f-1442x1138.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nИгровая книга НФТ сфокусирована на продаже НФТ и совмещении стейкинга и доходности для создания стимулов именно \"играть\" в игру.

Игровая модель free-to-play-to-earn (F2P2E) может подойти для криптоигр лучше, чем модель pay-to-play-to-earn (P2P2E).\n\nСтоит отметить, что плохо продуманные игры free-to-play (F2P) все равно остаются такими же играми, как и P2E-игры, а значит, F2P-игры должны использовать более эффективные стратегии монетизации.

Now Moutai is a premium purchase, at least 1000 yuan per bottle.” A “scalper” who has been engaged in liquor business for a long time said when introducing his receiving price.\n\nThe first financial reporter recently found that there are many such “scalpers”. The Baijiu Baijiu Baijiu (Baijiu) liquor has been recovering since the revival of the liquor industry in 2015. The price of high-end liquor has been rising, and it has also become the main support for the growth of Baijiu enterprises. Liquor companies are also pushing the price of high-end liquor through the control of goods and the price.\n\nIn 2013, the state launched a round of antitrust investigation on the Baijiu industry and punished some of the liquor companies. With the increase of the price of liquor, the market also has voices questioning whether Baijiu enterprises’ control of price and price limit are a monopoly behavior.\n\nHigh-end Baijiu prices continue to rise\n\nThe introduction of the “eight regulations” in 2012 has triggered a collapse of the domestic high-end Baijiu price system, and has also ended the last “golden ten years” of Baijiu industry.\n\nThe Baijiu Baijiu Baijiu Baijiu has been rapidly revival since 2015 and has entered a new cycle of industry. The trend of liquor consumption upgrading is obvious. The market has focused on the famous Baijiu liquor brands, followed by the continuous rise of the price of high-end liquor. Now the core prices of mainstream liquor enterprises have surpassed the price of liquor in the peak period of the last industry in 2012.\n\nAs typical representatives, the prices of Maotai and Wuliangye have completed a U-shaped reversal.\n\nIn 2011, the ex factory price of 53 degree flying Maotai was only 619 yuan, but at that time, the market price of flying Maotai had risen to 2000 yuan / bottle. In September 2012, Maotai raised the ex factory price by 33% to 819 yuan / bottle, and the market price quickly broke through the high point of 2300 yuan / bottle. With the introduction of the “eight provisions”, the ex factory price of Maotai in 2014 was still 819 yuan / bottle, while the retail price fell below the 1000 yuan mark.\n\nAfter 2015, the market price of Maotai began to rise rapidly. Although up to now, the ex factory price and market guide price of Maotai are 969 yuan / bottle and 1499 yuan / bottle, in terms of the actual market transaction price, the price of 53 degree flying Maotai has exceeded 3000 yuan / bottle, and the whole box has exceeded 3500 yuan / bottle.\n\nWuliangye’s situation is similar. In February 2013, Wuliangye raised the ex factory price of puwu to 729 yuan / bottle against the market trend, but gave dealers a subsidy of 70 yuan per bottle and various incentives such as quarterly rebate and annual sales rebate. However, the first batch price of Wuliangye soon fell to about 510 yuan to 550 yuan / bottle. In 2014, Wuliangye had to reduce the ex factory price to 609 yuan / bottle, The market guide price was lowered from 1109 yuan / bottle to 729 yuan / bottle. So far, the first batch price of the eighth generation Wuliangye puwu has stabilized at about 1000 yuan, nearly doubling compared with the same period in 2015.\n\nThe Baijiu Baijiu Baijiu is a rising consumer of high-end liquor. The price of high-end liquor is related to the growth of consumption of high-end liquor in China. Besides, the technological moves taken by Baijiu enterprises have also promoted the continuous rise of the price of high-end liquor.\n\nOn the one hand, Baijiu enterprises continuously increase the factory price of the core products, and make a substantial price by stopping the goods and controlling the goods. On the other hand, liquor enterprises will agree on the minimum price with dealers. While increasing the ex factory price, they will also require dealers to simultaneously increase the minimum price, and formulate a strict punishment plan to punish dealers who do not implement the minimum price policy.\n\n“Some high-end Baijiu are very strong suppliers. We have quota as channel merchants. We must face many rigid conditions when we get goods. But because some high-end Baijiu are very scarce products, we have been able to get the supply of goods, so we have been able to provide the so-called market guidance price for suppliers. We dare not do any price adjustment, nor can we. Random transfer of goods must be sold in strict accordance with the region. There are certain reservation and purchase restriction conditions for consumers’ purchase. After all, the goods of such strong suppliers are scarce and very popular. Besides some high-end Baijiu, there is a similar brand of brand drinks and grain and oil products that you have never expected. The common point of these strong suppliers is that they sell well and dare to be out of stock, that is, because their goods sell well, they become important commodities of channel providers, but also rely on their best-selling, so suppliers take out of stock as a means. If the sales channel providers do not sell according to their prices and regional distribution requirements, they will be out of stock immediately, and once out of stock, it will seriously affect the performance of channel providers. There are many best-selling products, but suppliers who dare to break them are rare. Therefore, some suppliers, including some high-end Baijiu, have become the strong ones who can control the channel business. A retail channel said.\n\nLi Ming, a Shandong liquor merchant, told the first financial reporter that he had acted as a product of several domestic Baijiu enterprises, and there were clear minimum selling prices and contents of the sales area in the agreements signed by both sides. When signing a contract with the winery, the dealer shall pay a deposit to the winery according to the market level, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. The winery will also give the dealer corresponding fee support, but there will be corresponding penalties in case of breach of contract. In the era of big data, there are bottle codes for bottles and box codes for boxes. It is very difficult for dealers not to find violations.\n\nOn the legal documents, a contract case of Baijiu contract, which was pronounced in April 2021, shows some of the contents of the contract.\n\nIn the case, Beijing kangyiquan Internet Technology Co., Ltd.

Большинство игр NFT предпочли монетизировать полезную ценность, в то время как их игры могли бы лучше монетизировать ценность социальную .\n\n*\"Я считаю, что инновации модели бизнеса являются более разрушительными, чем технические инновации\" - Фред Уилсон, кофаундер Union Square Ventures.*\n\nИгровая индустрия, как и ее вымышленные персонажи, продолжает развиваться. Этот сектор постоянно находится на грани срыва, где он открывает как технологические инновации, так и инновации моделей бизнеса и адаптирует их к постоянно меняющимся требованиям.\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b3f6f9411c28ca70ed99f40312c3a4d22daa2aed-1018x568.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nПоследней инновационной волной в игровой индустрии стало появление GameFi - более широкой финансиализации игровых активов. Первая модель монетизации GameFi - play-to-earn (P2E) - была предоставлена в игре Axie Infinity. Игроки могут покупать аксей, чтобы заработать SLP-токены, внутриигровой товар, используемый для разведения и улучшения аксей. Экономический успех Axie привел к появлению множества рипофов и NFT-игр, которые усовершенствовали модель \"P2E\" с помощью стейкинг-моделей.\n\n**Pay to Play2Earn: Недостатки спекулятивных игр** \n\nСпекулятивная и рефлексивная система, присущая игровой модели \"P2E\", привела к созданию игровых брендов с многомиллиардной оценочной стоимостью, таких как Axie Infinity, DeFi Kingdoms, Star Atlas и другие. Однако у существующей игровой модели play-to-earn есть несколько серьезных недостатков, которые препятствуют ее долгосрочному успеху.\n\nВо-первых, возможность покупки НФТ или внутриигровой валюты создает определенную механику \"pay-to-win\", чего избегает большинство крупных франшиз и успешных игр. Самые успешные игры часто делают упор на скилл, предпочитая создавать “Ranked matchmaking” избегая принципа \"спамь кредиткой пока не победишь\".\n\nВо-вторых, большинство P2E игр требуют предварительных инвестиций в НФТ только для того, чтобы начать играть. Это, естественно, становится существенной преградой для многих пользователей и еще больше усиливает принцип \"pay-to-win\".\n\nДа в принципе, спросите 100 крипто-геймеров, на счет того, весело ли играть в игры, и почти каждый вам даст ответ: \"Нет... но я на этом зарабатываю\". Игроки, зарабатывающие деньги с помощью MonkeyWork игровых действий, не являются явным показателем успеха франшизы. Конечный результат всегда будет один - игроки будут постепенно переходить от одной игры, в которой им удалось заработать, в другую, постоянно находясь в поисках новых платформ для подобного рода заработка.\n\n**Немного о “Стипендиальной программе“**\n\nЧасто деятельность P2E фармилки поддерживается \"стипендиальными программами\". Например, стипендиальная программа Axie позволяет более бедным геймерам заимствовать активы у богатых НФТ владельцев, делясь с ними частью прибыли. По сути, стипендиаты выполняют повторяющиеся внутриигровые действия и делят часть прибыли с владельцами NFT. Игровые гильдии, такие как Yield Guild Games, расширили программу стипендий, поддерживая более 20 000 стипендиатов. Несмотря на восхищение тем, что YGG позволяет людям получать денежное вознаграждение за свой труд, такая динамика игры не является устойчивой. Стипендиальная программа, которая больше похожа на работу, требует дальнейшего роста возможностей дохода в Axie Infinity.\n\n**Заимствование из традиционных игр: Монетизация в играх NFT** \n\nСегодня большинство игр монетизируют периодический доход по одной из двух схем. Первая схема - социальная ценность - продажа внутриигровых активов, которые демонстрируют статус или визуальную/косметическую ценность, но не влияют на игровой процесс. Fortnite - прекрасный пример, который построил успешный бизнес на продаже скинов или визуальных улучшений для оружия. Roblox монетизируется за счет подписки на Robux, которые можно применить в различных играх, созданных сторонними разработчиками, у некоторых из них во главе - полезность, а у других - социальная ценность. Наконец, такие игры, как GTA, позволяют игрокам приобретать предметы, которые помогают быстрее завершить сюжетную линию; однако в обладании определенными видами имущества есть и элемент социальной ценности (например, Lambo против Prius).\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/d325fe76d3c89d40ffafb9c0a56872685db3020b-1024x728.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nЭта модель может быть широко применена и к криптоиграм, только лишь с тем отличием, что постоянный доход будет поступать через вторичные торговые платежи, а не подписки (например, Fortnite V-Bucks и Roblox Robux).\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/49c8a6c9ba24e2baf3c6d86191bfbf421856bd7f-1442x1138.png?w=1500&auto=format)\n\nИгровая книга НФТ сфокусирована на продаже НФТ и совмещении стейкинга и доходности для создания стимулов именно \"играть\" в игру. Не существует популярных игр NFT, которые концентрируются на монетизации через социальную ценность, хотя есть проекты NFT, такие как BAYC и другие коллекции, которые монетизируются в основном из-за социальной ценности.\n\nБольшинство NFT игр не могут преодолеть Entertainment Threshold (порог развлечения) - точку, в которой компания или разработчик создали игру, достаточно захватывающую, чтобы крепко стоять на ногах не только из-за финансовых стимулов предлагаемых пользователям.\n\n**Краткая заметка о коммунальных НФТ**\n\nКак было сказано ранее, наличие торгуемых НФТ, обеспечивающих конкурентные преимущества, быстро превращается в систему pay-to-win, поэтому большинство игр с НФТ должны избегать этого в принципе. Однако есть случаи, когда НФТ, суть которых - польза, имеют смысл в игре. Time-saving NFTs - это механизм, с помощью которого разработчики игр могут подойти к интеграции с НФТ. Одним из ярких примеров являются MMORPG, такие как Runescape или World of Warcraft, в которых есть множество общих предметов: ресурсы, например, дерево, золото и кирпичи, необходимые для строительства других более значимых ресурсов, но по своей сути не делающие игрока лучше в соревновательных аспектах игры. Сочетание этих типов обычных НФТ с неторгуемыми соревновательными или социальными НФТ - более лучший способ создания НФТ игр, основанных на схеме полезности.\n\n**Исследуем пробелы: Free-to-Play-to-Earn (F2P2E)** \n\nДаже несмотря на свои недостатки, модель \"P2E\" представляет собой новую динамику для создания игровой экономики. Игровая модель free-to-play-to-earn (F2P2E) может подойти для криптоигр лучше, чем модель pay-to-play-to-earn (P2P2E).\n\nСтоит отметить, что плохо продуманные игры free-to-play (F2P) все равно остаются такими же играми, как и P2E-игры, а значит, F2P-игры должны использовать более эффективные стратегии монетизации. Представьте себе игру, в которой скины (например, одежда для персонажа) дают только косметические преимущества, но люди в игре все равно должны играть, чтобы заработать ресурсы, необходимые для создания того же скина для персонажа. Это все еще воплощает игру с динамично развивающейся вторичной экономикой, но не переходит в среду \"pay-to-win\".\n\n**Заключительные размышления об Play-to-Earn** \n\nP2E-модель, популяризированная играми на подобие Axie Infinity, стала значимым моментом в игровом секторе NFT. В ближайшие годы в эту сферу будут инвестированы миллиарды долларов, но большинство ищет игру в стиле Axie, несмотря на то, что новая модель - это то, что привлечет новые миллионы геймеров. Модель free-to-play-to-earn позволит использовать систему play-to-earn, одновременно поддерживая конкурентную среду и устойчивую экономику. \n\nСложно судить что будет дальше, еще недавно никто не мог подумать, что люди будут покупать виртуальные кроссовки и зарабатывать с того, что просто бегают по пару минут в день. Но с другой стороны - отличный оздоровительный ход, хотя бы небольшая часть криптокомьюнити начала немного активничать, а не тупо сидеть за компуктерами дома, хотя, уже слышал, как кибер-умы придумывают схемы, с установкой Степна друзьям-курьерам, которые и так весь день на ногах.)", "timestamp": 1649015537, "digest": "wC8MZWZRivHnHNDxjVYiyzq28bQaK77h9FA8TPjOfZk", "contributor": "0xAD4bE496A44072E2f4A000ad870674aa597447f3"}

After the door was opened, one of the children got off safely. The fire rescue personnel immediately came to the injured boy and asked him about his injury. The boy said he had a pain in his head.\n\nThe fire rescue workers found that there was blood flowing out of the boy’s ears, so they carefully took him out of the car and comforted him, “children, the doctor will be here soon.” Because it was uncertain whether the boy had other injuries, while waiting for the ambulance, the fire rescue personnel put the boy flat on the ground and put their hands on the boy’s head all the way. Two minutes later, the ambulance arrived in time, and the fire rescue personnel protected the boy’s head, picked up the ambulance and handed it to the medical staff.\n\nThe fire department reminds the public that in case of a trapped bus, they must keep calm and don’t panic.

The shutdown of the above production line will also affect the production of about 13000 vehicles.\n\nThe shutdown can be traced back to February 26, when Kojima stamping industry Co., Ltd. found problems when inspecting the internal system, and then stopped the operation of relevant servers on February 27 and reported to Toyota. The shutdown of the server affected Toyota’s Japanese factory. The parts could not be supplied and the factory stopped production.\n\nAccording to Toyota, the closure of Japanese factories every day will affect 5% of Toyota’s monthly production in Japan.\n\nIn fact, Toyota’s production mode has a direct relationship with supplier supply.\n\nUsually, suppliers deliver the supplied parts directly to the production line, and Toyota itself will not hoard goods. The advantage of this model is to save inventory costs and increase turnover efficiency, but the corresponding anti supply risk ability is very poor.\n\nDue to the shortage of spare parts, Toyota’s domestic production in Japan fell sharply by 32.2% and global production fell by 14.9% in January compared with the same period last year.\n\nAccording to the official data of Toyota, the sales volume of Toyota in the global market has fluctuated slightly in the past 10 years, but it is on the rise as a whole. In 2021, its global sales reached 9615157, an increase of 2518304 compared with 2011.\n\nAccording to the data, in 2021, Toyota’s sales in China increased by 8.2% year-on-year to 1.94 million vehicles, and its global sales increased by 10.1% year-on-year to 10.5 million vehicles.\n\nFrom the perspective of business distribution, only 1476136 vehicles were sold in the Japanese market in 2021, and the overseas market still accounts for a large proportion.\n\nAlthough North America has occupied the largest market position of Toyota for many years, its share has been declining recently under the impact of the Asian market.\n\nAs early as 2011, the North American market accounted for about 50% of Toyota’s internal sales. With the continuous development of the Asian market, Toyota’s sales in Asia increased from 2003141 in 2011 to 3135228 in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, Toyota’s sales volume in the Middle East market is lower than that 10 years ago. Although it reached the highest value of 793391 vehicles in 2014, it decreased to 418612 vehicles in 2021, a decrease of 107058 vehicles compared with 2011.\n\nIt is no stranger to Toyota that production is affected by hacker attacks.\n\nIn 2019, it encountered a cyber attack. Some hackers invaded Toyota’s IT system and accessed the data of several sales subsidiaries. The server accessed by the hackers stored the sales information of up to 3.1 million customers.\n\nIn 2020, 9 Toyota factories were halted due to the virus.\n\nIn December 2021, Toyota’s largest parts supplier, electric equipment company, was hacked and employee information was leaked.\n\nIn fact, Toyota is far more than a car company trapped in network security.\n\nIn February 2020, 19 vulnerabilities were found in a Mercedes Benz E-class car, allowing hackers to remotely control the vehicle, including opening the door and starting the engine.\n\nIn June 2020, Honda’s internal network system broke down due to network attack, and then the company suspended the delivery of complete vehicles from domestic factories in Japan and stopped the production of seven automobile factories in North America.\n\nMassive information and accurate interpretation are all in Sina Finance app", "timestamp": 1649015712, "digest": "OzEordUrKxQrZRN-hFch3oQC11MOiSoYJQdTOKCnlEY", "contributor": "0xE5fA0807cdc05637a27461A059Ce836C0183550e"}

It facilitates increasingly devastating wars, declining global biodiversity, and the existential threat posed by climate change. In short, the misapplication of science and technology has allowed short-sighted economic and political interests to threaten our very existence. This proposal aims to reclaim technology’s role as a facilitator of human progress by developing the Universal Biological Interaction System, or UBIS, a decentralized system for widespread human decision-making.\n\n## Research Goals\n\n* Investigate the factors necessary to support human civilization in an open, distributed system of collaborative decision-making.\n* Investigate the feasibility of distributed self-governance.\n* Establish a new balance of technology that affirms humanity’s sustainable role in the natural world.\n\n## Research Objectives\n\n* Build a self-governance system as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO.\n* Build or purchase assets and capabilities supporting all research goals.\n* Establish the first UBIS city, system 0.\n\n## Research Methodology\n\nDAOs allow people anywhere in the world to enter into a common contract defining their contributions toward a coordinated goal. UBIS seeks to establish shared ownership and governance of real-world assets through the formation of a limited liability company, or LLC, representing its DAO.\n\nThe initial UBIS DAO will be built by the core team and founding citizens. Once UBIS is self-sustaining, citizenship will be extended to interested members of the public. The UBIS DAO’s second phase moves the project even further into the real world, leveraging the ownership and contractual powers granted by its LLC toward the establishment of a city governed entirely by the shared mechanism represented by the DAO.\n\n## Plan of work\n\nThe initial phase of UBIS will be organized into five departments:\n\n* Community\n* Legal\n* Real Estate\n* Development\n* Business\n\nMore departments will be added as needed. When the first UBIS city is established, for instance, departments will be added to ensure the delivery of basic municipal services and to represent the city in its dealings with other governmental organizations.\n\nUBIS citizens will vote to add real-world assets necessary to achieve the project’s goal of balance among human participants and the natural world they occupy and the technology that facilitates that balance. Real-world assets owned by UBIS may be highly dispersed during its initial phase but will be concentrated geographically in the city-building phase.\n\nIn its early stages, any DAO is unproven and its prospects somewhat obscure. Over time, it develops its own character, its own history, and its own collective memory—it begins to behave, in other words, like a self-sustaining organism. The core UBIS team will support the project until it achieves this self-sustaining state. At the same time, UBIS citizens will choose their own form of representation, allowing each citizen to participate in the broader endeavor in the ways best suited to them.\n\nWyoming recently became the first US state to acknowledge DAO as entities capable of forming LLCs. This allows UBIS to create a legal entity with full representation in the real world, with the ability to own assets and enter contracts. We expect that this opportunity will soon extend to many parts of the world.\n\n## Upon joining the UBIS DAO, citizens take the oath:\n\nI pledge to propose and vote wisely, and to use my citizenship to promote the well-being of humanity and the growth of UBIS. I further pledge to work and communicate toward our shared goal and true knowledge, ignoring any differences in culture or nationality among UBIS citizens.\n\n[https://discord.gg/wqCHbMma6A](https://discord.gg/wqCHbMma6A)\n\n![Universal Biological Interaction System](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/giDRfehzN02Mz477CLbdS.png?height=1200&width=1200)\n\n", "timestamp": 1649015876, "digest": "MZyfBKJjDtV4a5az2BmbCwjmV4zGFaTRN9CR59s0TKQ", "contributor": "0x2B80bd583b933C6f02f70E64e984E81fCA80219f"}

The architectural site group outside the west gate of the ancient city of Qi, located in the west of Xiaoxu village, Qidu Town, Linzi District, Zibo City, Shandong Province, is recognized as the site of Jixia school palace. The discovery was selected into the 32 preliminary evaluation list of “top ten new archaeological discoveries” in China in 2021.\n\nAccording to historical records, Jixia school palace was founded in Duke Huan of Tian Qi. As a monument in the history of China’s ideological and cultural development, it is the world’s first institution of higher learning in a special form organized by the government and privately presided over. It is an institution with various natures such as research institutes, universities and governance consulting, which has contributed to the formation of the “hundred schools of thought contend” situation of academia all over the world.\n\nThe Archaeological Dig \n\nIn 2017, Shandong Institute of cultural relics and Archaeology set up an archaeology team in the ancient city of Qi in Linzi and began to look for the “Jixia school Palace”. After nearly five years of archaeological excavation, experts have solved a series of questions by using the “exclusion method”. The stratigraphic relationship is clear and the shape is beginning to take shape. From the aspects of literature, orientation and archaeological discoveries, we can judge the location of Jixia school palace. The building site group is connected with the small town of the ancient city of Qi in the East. It is wide in the South and narrow in the north, forming a right angle trapezoid. The maximum width from east to west is about 210 meters, and the length from north to south is about 190 meters. It has a total area of nearly 40000 square meters. Four rows of building sites have been found. The building site group is located in a closed area, surrounded by walls and trenches, in which the trenches are connected with the small town trenches. A road is found between the building site group and the small town, leading to the west gate of the small town in the north and the South Gate of the small town in the south.\n\nOn September 25, 2021, the expert seminar on archaeological discovery of the building foundation outside the west gate of the ancient city of Qi, hosted by Shandong Provincial Department of culture and tourism (Provincial Bureau of cultural relics) and Zibo Municipal People’s government and hosted by the Provincial Institute of cultural relics and Archaeology and Zibo Linzi District people’s government, was held in Linzi. The meeting invited more than 20 domestic well-known experts and scholars, including Liu Qingzhu, a researcher of the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and a member of the academic department of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, to conduct on-the-spot investigation and special discussion. The participating experts affirmed the direct relationship between the site and Jixia school palace, and put forward constructive suggestions on the protection and utilization of the site in the next step. This makes the “search for Jixia school Palace” go further and adds weight to the confirmation of the site.\n\nAccording to the plan, in 2022, experts will continue to fully expose the south gate, look for the west wall and the north wall, and excavate the base sites of buildings in the site to further explore the specific uses of these buildings.", "timestamp": 1649015917, "digest": "DaLvHFKk5I6CpUfDdb5DYSU2dFDc78uxqfzb3e2aTTU", "contributor": "0xe4c137dc6F77A24864ADF73A0633CF60f51d3d79"}

What is the intention of starting a two-line war with Sony?", "body": "Electric car track is full of “new players”. What about traditional car enterprises\n\n\\[the current situation of “lack of core and electricity” in the past two or two years has made all enterprises in the automotive industry chain more aware that they are friends and enemies. Even though they once stood on the same front in harmony, they may be red faced for interests one day.\\]\n\nThe pace of traditional automobile enterprises is being adjusted as various “new players” continue to invade the automobile field.\n\nRecently, at the juncture when the first electric vehicle of its new pure electric vehicle brand “E: n” is about to be launched, Honda also joined hands with Sony and plans to establish a joint venture to jointly develop high value-added pure electric vehicles. The first pure electric vehicle of the new company will be sold in 2025. What is the intention of the double track war on the pure electric vehicle track?\n\nAs one of the top ten auto companies in the world, Honda is similar to other traditional auto giants. It will be anxious about the uncertainties existing in the process of accelerating the transformation of electric, intelligent and networked auto industry. In the first half of electrification, Japanese car companies generally have a slower pace than Tesla and some Chinese independent brands. At present, they are faced with competitors in many fields constantly breaking the border and invading the field of smart cars, which further increases the pressure. How to defend and attack, the giants of traditional automobile enterprises are urgently looking for countermeasures.\n\nTesla’s global sales volume in 2021 has approached 1 million, and it is threatened to reach 20 million in 2030. BYD, which is in full swing with Tesla, has sold more than 90000 vehicles in recent months. According to the current momentum, its sales volume is expected to exceed 1 million vehicles in 2022. “Wei Xiaoli” and other new forces in car making are also fierce, trying to grab more market share. However, these new energy vehicle enterprises that are now at the forefront may not be able to laugh to the end. Giants in many industries such as science and technology, real estate and household appliances have entered the market to build cars.\n\nIn this once-in-a-century auto industry reform, the original pattern will be overturned. In the era of fuel vehicles, car companies tend to focus on core components such as engines and transmissions. When entering the era of intelligent electric vehicles, the whole industrial chain is changing. Upstream and downstream enterprises are looking for new opportunities in competition and cooperation, and the relationship between them will be more complex. There are many possibilities for the technical route and operation mode of power battery, which is only the core component.\n\nFrom lithium ore suppliers to battery manufacturers to new energy host plants, they are constantly playing games. The current situation of “lack of core and less electricity” in the past two years has made enterprises in the automotive industry chain more aware that they are friends and enemies. Even though they have stood on the same front in harmony, one day they may be red faced for interests.\n\nHowever, how difficult it is to vertically integrate the whole industrial chain. As a highly vertical integrator of the industrial chain, although BYD is making rapid progress in the field of new energy vehicles with core components such as hand-held chips and batteries, it still has shortcomings in the field of automatic driving, which is considered that it may not be able to maintain strong combat effectiveness after entering the second half of intellectualization.\n\nWith the advent of the era of “software defined automobile”, the competition of lidar, high-precision map, network communication, AI computing and other technologies intensifies. On the one hand, enterprises need to continue to invest heavily, on the other hand, it will squeeze the value space of hardware. The traditional automobile industry chain, supply chain and value chain have been gradually broken. In the future, the automobile industry chain will be greatly extended, and new application scenarios and business models will continue to emerge, which will have a great impact on traditional automobile enterprises.\n\nIn the future, new energy vehicles will change from vehicles to intelligent terminals. It is a new opportunity to see this huge change. After apple, Huawei, Alibaba, Baidu, Xiaomi and other technology enterprises have stepped up their layout in the field of new energy vehicles, Sony has also entered the field, and the cross-border car building heat has not decreased. The integration of automobile, information and communication, energy, transportation and other industries is accelerating. In the future, intelligent electric vehicle is the product of cross domain industrial integration, and its key technology, product positioning, industrial ecology and energy structure are constantly changing. In the face of the complex situation in new fields, high investment and high risk, these “barbarians” often do not rush to fight alone, but choose to establish countless relationships with traditional car enterprises.\n\nIn the face of the continuous influx of competitors in the car track, some traditional car companies are also taking the strategy of turning enemies into friends, throwing Hydrangea to “new players” one after another, constantly forming alliances and expanding the circle of friends. For example, SAIC, a domestic car company, cooperates with Ali to build zebra network and Zhiji electric vehicle, and Geely cooperates with Tencent, Baidu, Foxconn and other enterprises. Multinational traditional auto giants are also taking various actions. Recently, it is reported that Volkswagen plans to acquire Huawei’s automatic driving department for billions of euros. It hopes to speed up the intelligent electric vehicle track with the help of Huawei’s software and other technical advantages. Honda, while speeding up the transformation of electrification, intelligence and networking to hold its territory, has found another way to establish a new joint venture with Sony to occupy a place in the high-end pure electric market through the joint efforts of both sides.\n\nTraditional car companies put eggs in different “baskets”, which can provide more opportunities. However, in the process of cross-border cooperation with enterprises in science and technology and other industries, who controls the steering wheel and how to balance various relationships in double line or even multi line development are still a big test for traditional automobile enterprises.\n\nMassive information and accurate interpretation are all in Sina Finance app", "timestamp": 1649015921, "digest": "wYLW4k-Ur-h2wUM06UVv7g9swOQdImigX3HABiJDMAg", "contributor": "0x5ff58fD1d9255AfA65EB1083D59E95A4f422219e"}

On March 6, Haidilao announced the launch of barbecue food delivery business. At present, barbecue food products have been launched in some delivery stores in Beijing and Chengdu, including raw meat kebabs, barbecue tinfoil dishes, barbecue snacks, barbecue tools, etc. In fact, in the food supply track, Haidilao has been exploring, and previously opened an offline food supply supermarket. With the fierce competition in the hot pot market, Haidilao also needs to open a differentiated layout from multiple perspectives of products and scenes to consolidate the market.\n\nTake out barbecue\n\nAnother member is added to the delivery “menu” of Haidilao. On March 6, Haidilao announced the launch of barbecue food delivery business. At present, it has been launched in some Haidilao delivery stores in Beijing and Chengdu, and other cities are opening one after another.\n\nThe reporter of Beijing business daily saw from the takeout point single interface that a variety of barbecue food products have been launched, including mutton kebabs, spicy ribs kebabs, Orleans chicken wings kebabs and other raw meat kebabs. The price range is 20-28 yuan. At the same time, four barbecue tinfoil dishes, including roasted vermicelli with garlic chili sauce and roasted brain flower with garlic chili sauce, are also added, with the selling price between 11-22 yuan. In addition to barbecue ingredients, it also provides barbecue stoves and tools such as gas, electric oven, brush and clip.\n\nIn fact, this is not the first time that Haidilao has supplemented its delivery business. In November last year, Haidilao announced that tea products would be sent out. You can place an order by searching “Haidilao tea” on the third-party delivery platform. At present, the reporter of Beijing Business Daily has also seen the “Hi tea” product in the single interface of Haidilao takeout point.\n\nAs for barbecue ingredients, in fact, such business was tested as early as a few years ago. Beijing Business Daily reporter contacted the bottom fishing, its relevant responsible person said, to supplement the demand of home consumption scenarios, the sea fishing outside Beijing, Chengdu part of the site and the tiktok outside the shop sent to barbecue store increased barbecue ingredients. At the same time, as the weather warms up, Haidilao provides barbecue ingredients, which can also enrich the choice of dining scenes such as outings. It means that the submarine fishing market will be adjusted or supplemented according to the future situation.\n\nExtended business chain\n\nIt is not difficult to see from the increase in the category of barbecue ingredients that Haidilao is extending its delivery business. At the same time, it is also constantly increasing the excavation of the food supply track.\n\nIn fact, Haidilao attaches so much importance to the delivery business, which has a certain relationship with the outstanding performance of the delivery business. Delivery business has always been one of the main sources of income of Haidilao company. Haidilao once said in its financial report that most of its income comes from the operation of restaurants, takeout business and the sales of condiments and ingredients. Especially during the epidemic period, the delivery business of Haidilao was outstanding. According to the financial report of Haidilao, in the first half of 2020, Haidilao group achieved a revenue of 9.76 billion yuan, accounting for 4.2% of the total revenue from 1.6%. With the improvement of the epidemic situation and the improvement of the dining rate of hall food, its takeout business is still relatively stable. By the first half of 2021, the revenue of Haidilao delivery business had reached 346 million yuan.\n\nIn addition, the layout once again reveals the “ambition” of Haidilao for the food supply market. At the same time, it also seems to have the meaning of “showing muscle”. Hu Chuncai, a retail management expert, believes that the barbecue takeout business is an extension of Haidilao’s existing delivery business. For Haidilao, it has accumulated certain supply chain advantages and self distribution ability, and the hot pot and barbecue ingredients are similar in raw material processing, so it has certain advantages. In addition, the weather is getting warmer and the demand for going out for barbecue is increasing. Haidilao’s launch of barbecue takeout business at this time also meets the consumer demand.\n\nTurn attack into defense?\n\nIn fact, there has been a lot of fishing in the sea recently. The first is the huge loss warning. At the end of February, Haidilao announced that compared with the net profit of about 309.5 million yuan for the year ended December 31, 2020, it is expected to record a net loss of about 3.8 billion-4.5 billion yuan for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThen the CEO stepped down. On March 1, Haidilao announced the appointment of management personnel. Yang Lijuan, deputy CEO and chief operating officer, was transferred to the post of CEO. Zhang Yong, chairman of the board of directors and former CEO, will continue to serve as chairman of the board of directors and executive director; Li Yu served as chief operating officer of Chinese mainland, and Wang Jinping served as chief operating officer of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.\n\nAccording to Hu Chuncai, Haidilao has launched various services such as manicure. With the continuous upgrading of consumer demand and the increasingly fierce competition of hot pot brand, to some extent, some advantages of Haidilao have been broken through, so it is necessary to establish new competitive advantages and continue brand competitiveness. However, although Haidilao has certain supply and brand advantages, from the perspective of barbecue scene alone, the space and time for consumers to process barbecue ingredients are partially limited. “From the perspective of brand development, many hot pot brands with different characteristics have gradually emerged in the hot pot track, and ‘freshness’ is the only magic weapon for some brands to attract consumers. For Haidilao, it still needs to further study consumers’ preferences and launch high-quality products, so as to enhance and consolidate the brand influence.” Hu Chuncai said.\n\nLai Yang, executive vice president of Beijing Institute of business economics, said that in recent years, consumers’ demand for pre-finished products and semi-finished products has increased, and the market prospect is good. Haidilao’s new business can supplement the brand in terms of revenue growth and categories. However, although Haidilao has a certain brand foundation in the national market, there are differences in the needs and consumption capacity of consumers in different regions. Therefore, Haidilao needs to carry out multi brand and multi-mode development to provide consumers with more diversified choices, so as to occupy different markets.\n\nBeijing Business Daily reporter Guo binlu Zhang Tianyuan\n\nMassive information and accurate interpretation are all in Sina Finance app", "timestamp": 1649016127, "digest": "FRyY7w6WcOH7dzTdjI72r9u6wqiTbO94QdTolR1UUMQ", "contributor": "0x5F9abEfe3D530F8ecBce19e36D05D97e97C04AEC"}

When the two sessions of the National People’s Congress were held in 2022, many deputies to the National People’s Congress made suggestions on smart cars and new energy vehicles, especially focusing on the ecology of the industrial chain. For example, Lei Jun, chairman of Xiaomi company, put forward four suggestions on building a carbon footprint accounting system for new energy vehicles, Long Yunzhou, founder and director of Nezha automobile, suggested to build the ecosystem of intelligent automobile operating system as a whole… In the view of people in the industry, doing a good job in new energy vehicles is to do a good job in the ecological relationship of “people, cars and piles”. All links such as underlying system, accounting system, chip research and development, charging layout and so on can not be despised.\n\nIndustrial chain vigilance neck problem\n\nFrom the development track of the domestic smart phone industry, we can see that whether it is the operating system or core parts, enterprises must have their own technology research and development and accumulation to avoid being “stuck”, and the same is true for the developing smart car.\n\nFrom the system level, Fang Yunzhou suggested that in order to avoid smart cars repeating the mistakes of smart phones being “stuck”, it is urgent to immediately start the ecological construction with China’s smart car operating system as the core.\n\nHe pointed out that the intelligent vehicle operating system is not a simple breakthrough in a single technical point. It requires the combination of the country’s and industry’s bottom logic and upper structure, an architecture ecology based on the car’s bottom operating system, the establishment of an ecosystem from application ecology, value chain ecology, tool chain and standards, and the concerted efforts of all parties in the industrial chain, Seek breakthroughs in the way of jointly creating ecology.\n\nTo this end, Fang Yunzhou suggested to speed up the formulation of relevant standards for software operating systems in line with the definition of Chinese scenarios, establish industry development guidelines, and formulate operating system standards and specifications in line with the development characteristics and trends of China’s intelligent vehicles on the basis of compatibility with relevant international standards; Strengthen the tackling of key technologies such as operating system kernel, improve the ability of independent research and development, and develop an internationally competitive operating system to provide technical support for technology and product innovation; Bring the operating system into national projects and guide industries and universities to overcome key technical difficulties in industry, University and research; Building an operating system ecosystem and cultivating relevant talents of operating system software are the key issues for relevant enterprises to jointly promote the R & D and application of operating system and jointly promote the cultivation of talents of operating system software.\n\nAt the core component level, due to the impact of the epidemic, the shortage of chips has become a global problem, and the automotive industry bears the brunt. Therefore, it is urgent to improve the overall layout and promote the rapid development of China’s vehicle specification chip industry.\n\nWang Fengying, deputy to the National People’s Congress and President of Great Wall Motors, suggested that the “core shortage” problem should be solved first in the short term, and the relevant national regulatory departments should take the initiative to make a systematic layout, restore order, prevent chaos, improve the industrial layout in the medium term and realize an independent and controllable supply chain, which is a necessary condition to support the high-quality development of China’s automobile industry; It is also suggested that the state co-ordinate resources, deploy the vehicle specification chip industry chain, improve the industrial layout, support advantageous enterprises to jointly tackle key problems in politics, industry, learning, research and application, master key parts in their own hands, build an introduction and training mechanism of industrial talents, and realize long-term sustainable development.\n\nCharging infrastructure bid farewell to “savage growth”\n\nCharging infrastructure is an important guarantee for the high-quality development of the new energy vehicle industry. According to the data of the charging alliance, by the end of 2021, the number of electric vehicles in China was 6.4 million, the number of charging piles was 2.617 million, and the vehicle pile ratio was basically at the overall level of 3:1, There is still a certain gap from the vehicle pile ratio of 1:1 planned in the guidelines for the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure (2015-2020).\n\nTo continuously enhance the international competitiveness of China’s new energy vehicles and promote the development of high-power fast charging will become an important development direction at present and in the future. Lei Jun pointed out in the “suggestions on accelerating the construction of high-power and fast charging infrastructure for new energy vehicles” that at present, the proportion of fast charging in China’s public charging piles is only 40%, and the fast charging power is generally low, resulting in the problems of slow charging speed, long queuing time and low turnover efficiency, which are still prominent, and it is difficult to adapt to the rapid development of the current new energy vehicle industry.\n\nLei Jun put forward three suggestions: strengthen policy guidance and promote the planning and layout of high-power fast charging network; Establish a national innovation cooperation platform and strengthen joint research on core technologies; Strengthen construction service guarantee and promote the popularization of high-power charging infrastructure.\n\nIt is worth noting that the “savage growth” of charging piles in recent years has also brought a series of problems. Wang Guangxing, general manager of xindiantu technology, told the Beijing Business Daily that for operators, non-uniform industry standards, low utilization rate of charging piles, obvious regionality, low user stickiness and difficult revenue are common problems; For car owners, it is still normal to find pile annoyance, charging difficulty, poor experience and repeatedly Download app; From the perspective of the industry as a whole, the lack of effective matching between the supply and demand sides, unreasonable charging station planning and insufficient service innovation are all “scars” in the development process of the industry.\n\nTherefore, the aggregation charging platform represented by “xindiantu” came into being. According to the introduction, “new electric road” integrates the upstream and downstream resources of the main engine factory, B terminal car service company, charging operator and other industries, breaking the technical barriers between different charging piles, connecting with the current super frequent traffic entrance with high usage frequency, and introducing the exclusive Alipay / High German / City Super App scanning mode charging mode in the industry, so that all kinds of “vehicle platforms” and “pile platforms” can be interconnected. Realize the one code charging of “xindiantu”, which solves the problems of repeated downloading of charging app by electric vehicle owners and inconvenient payment and recharge.\n\nMarket prosperity and ecological civilization\n\nWhile vigorously developing intelligent vehicles and new energy vehicles, we cannot ignore the impact of the industry on ecological civilization.\n\nIn the proposal on building a carbon footprint accounting system for new energy vehicles, Lei Jun pointed out that under the global carbon peak, carbon neutralization target and EU carbon tariff and other trade systems, the low-carbon development of new energy vehicles has become a key winner in the global competition of the automotive industry Accurate carbon footprint accounting system is the premise and foundation of low-carbon development of new energy vehicle industry.\n\nUp to now, China has not formed a systematic carbon footprint policy management system in the field of new energy vehicles, although", "timestamp": 1649016365, "digest": "nts6PC96q-2qLYHP_pVnmKbd4ZUTRPR3D8Fn84BN7IM", "contributor": "0x9525be0263EB30FAe1c02cC48e7FB6252e451404"}

It was fun for the wife and mother-in-law to travel alone. Zhang Jin incarnated at home as a “one-day photographer” to experience the fun of taking photos, while Cai Shaofen traveled with her mother-in-law to experience the characteristic culture and encountered the dilemma of repeatedly being refused to ask for directions; In contrast, Wang Liwen gave up the “Castle” experience and decided to accompany her mother-in-law on a trip, which made the journey full of warmth. Yang Shuo showed his considerate attribute, washed his mother’s feet and prepared a love dinner for his wife and mother; Zhang lunshuo’s family had a small disagreement during lunch. Christy Zhong and her mother-in-law had a discussion on “who should listen to” at the dinner table. Zhang lunshuo cleverly solved difficult problems; Yuan Chengjie family, which has been enjoying a more cheerful family atmosphere, can also find joy in Tucao’s “food unpleasant” when encountering food shortage.

After his mother-in-law and daughter-in-law went out alone, Zhang lunshuo was so bored at home that he talked with dolls. A series of anxious actions such as “spending seconds like years” such as “wall dolls” and “writing on glass” were very funny.

Chen Qianqian and his mother-in-law “fancy” Tucao: “make complaints about the storm”, “like eating the roots of trees”, vivid metaphor is funny. In this regard, Yuan Chengjie also called out: “I have given up lunch”, and joked that he would directly evaluate “it’s terrible to explode” in front of the people who buy the ingredients (Zhang Jinjia). In addition, in the face of his wife and mother traveling, Yuan Chengjie, who was so happy that he woke up from the sofa in a second and sang rap to show his handsome. However, Yuan Chengjie’s happy mood was extinguished in the “cold face” when his mother came back from playing. Yuan’s mother couldn’t help crying. There was a suspected difference between his mother and his wife. Can yuan Chengjie mediate?\n\nThis program is not only full of warm care and care between families, but also the panic and pressure of sons facing the contradiction between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.
