{"id": "o2ZoL4u8c1WV2-VuQJNqPHdi99VCgpt8T5TBgXsinPM", "title": "The Shape of Power in Crypto (and How I Won the $WRITE Race)", "body": "> “There is a part in each of us which holds fast to the old truth: either you are the hunter or you are the prey. Learn which you are. Act accordingly. Your life depends upon it.” ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nI've worked at companies over the years that claimed to have flat structures. They would proudly declare, \"we're not into hierarchy here!\" \n\nIt sounded nice in theory, but it was never true. There was always a hierarchy that remained hidden. The opaque nature of power in these environments made them difficult to work in and proved to be fertile soil for bad things to grow. \n\nA similar dynamic can be seen outside of the workplace. In American society, there is a false sense of equality and equal opportunity. We choose to ignore the heavy layers of class and social status blanketing our lives because acknowledging them can be uncomfortable.\n\n“Let’s hide follower counts and how many likes a post receives.”\n\nOver the years, I've started to believe that the world would be better if the power structures in our lives were more overt and less opaque. \n\nIn my experience, there can be more accountability when we know who has power and how they got it. Transparency can also make it harder for people with privilege to escape responsibility and get away with using their power poorly.\n\nFurthermore, people who **aren't** in positions of power can better manage their realities. When you don't have power, navigating a hidden hierarchy is like trying to find your way through a corn maze at night without a flashlight.\n\nIt's dark and disorienting.\n\n## Overt Power\n\n> “The shape of power is always the same: it is infinite, it is complex, it is forever branching. Its directions are unpredictable; it obeys its own laws. No one can observe the acorn and extrapolate each vein in each leaf of the oak crown. The closer you look, the more various it becomes. However complex you think it is, it is more complex than that. Like the rivers to the ocean, like the lightning strike, it is obscene and uncontained.”  ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nThe power dynamics in the **Crypto** and **Web 3** space feels much more overt than anywhere else I've been in the past. That's part of why I resisted jumping into crypto for so long. Over time though I started to see how the overtness of all the power could actually be useful.\n\nA great example of this can be seen through the lens of the $WRITE race. The $WRITE race was a competition I had to win in order to publish on Mirror. The rules were relatively simple: in order to start a Mirror publication, I had to receive enough votes to be in the top 10 during one of the rounds. Each week, the top 10 people would be added to the platform.\n\nThis is fundamentally different than how most tech companies launch their products. Startups typically use invite systems where your chance of joining is dependent upon who you know. Sometimes you aren't even aware a new platform exists because you aren't friends with the insiders!\n\nThis old model works great for incumbents with strong networks, but not so great for people like me who don't live in California or New York and who aren't as well connected. \n\nMirror's $WRITE race still had A LOT of power dynamics, but I could actually see them and figure out how to work my way through them.\n\nOn the voting page, everyone's follower counts were clearly displayed. I could see who was voting for who and how many votes had been given. I could even go onto the blockchain and see Mirror's token/contract for myself. Furthermore, each round happened at the same time each week so I could prepare in advance for it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2acf08b9-64f7-481f-bb62-020e691fd827.png?height=4030&width=9374)\n\nThe openness of Mirror (and blockchain technology) has given me power I normally wouldn't have.\n\nNot only did I finally make the top 10 list this week, but I finished in first place thanks to the support of people I had only just met!

{"id": "pEcNGkPvyYyqKkYPqULLxa3lWo-xd7cjBJbFrfXm1Xc", "title": "The Shape of Power in Crypto (and How I Won the $WRITE Race)", "body": "> “There is a part in each of us which holds fast to the old truth: either you are the hunter or you are the prey. Learn which you are. Act accordingly. Your life depends upon it.” ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nI've worked at companies over the years that claimed to have flat structures. They would proudly declare, \"we're not into hierarchy here!\" \n\nIt sounded nice in theory, but it was never true. There was always a hierarchy that remained hidden. The opaque nature of power in these environments made them difficult to work in and proved to be fertile soil for bad things to grow. \n\nA similar dynamic can be seen outside of the workplace. In American society, there is a false sense of equality and equal opportunity. We choose to ignore the heavy layers of class and social status blanketing our lives because acknowledging them can be uncomfortable.\n\n“Let’s hide follower counts and how many likes a post receives.”\n\nOver the years, I've started to believe that the world would be better if the power structures in our lives were more overt and less opaque. \n\nIn my experience, there can be more accountability when we know who has power and how they got it. Transparency can also make it harder for people with privilege to escape responsibility and get away with using their power poorly.\n\nFurthermore, people who **aren't** in positions of power can better manage their realities. When you don't have power, navigating a hidden hierarchy is like trying to find your way through a corn maze at night without a flashlight.\n\nIt's dark and disorienting.\n\n## Overt Power\n\n> “The shape of power is always the same: it is infinite, it is complex, it is forever branching. Its directions are unpredictable; it obeys its own laws. No one can observe the acorn and extrapolate each vein in each leaf of the oak crown. The closer you look, the more various it becomes. However complex you think it is, it is more complex than that. Like the rivers to the ocean, like the lightning strike, it is obscene and uncontained.”  ― from *The Power* by Naomi Alderman\n\nThe power dynamics in the **Crypto** and **Web 3** space feels much more overt than anywhere else I've been in the past. That's part of why I resisted jumping into crypto for so long. Over time though I started to see how the overtness of all the power could actually be useful.\n\nA great example of this can be seen through the lens of the $WRITE race. The $WRITE race was a competition I had to win in order to publish on Mirror. The rules were relatively simple: in order to start a Mirror publication, I had to receive enough votes to be in the top 10 during one of the rounds. Each week, the top 10 people would be added to the platform.\n\nThis is fundamentally different than how most tech companies launch their products. Startups typically use invite systems where your chance of joining is dependent upon who you know. Sometimes you aren't even aware a new platform exists because you aren't friends with the insiders!\n\nThis old model works great for incumbents with strong networks, but not so great for people like me who don't live in California or New York and who aren't as well connected. \n\nMirror's $WRITE race still had A LOT of power dynamics, but I could actually see them and figure out how to work my way through them.\n\nOn the voting page, everyone's follower counts were clearly displayed. I could see who was voting for who and how many votes had been given. I could even go onto the blockchain and see Mirror's token/contract for myself. Furthermore, each round happened at the same time each week so I could prepare in advance for it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2acf08b9-64f7-481f-bb62-020e691fd827.png?height=4030&width=9374)\n\nThe openness of Mirror (and blockchain technology) has given me power I normally wouldn't have.\n\nNot only did I finally make the top 10 list this week, but I finished in first place thanks to the support of people I had only just met! I even received more votes than people who had huge followings (like Jack Butcher with 100,000 followers).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/450c5e98-9a05-4724-83c9-16b33e0dc56a.png?height=4360&width=9374)\n\nIt wasn't easy and not everyone is going to be able to do it, but I don't know of anywhere else an outsider like me would be able to make it through the webs of power this quickly.

{"id": "ybiLor6ZzqIUojobmagW3kPiQuTyjSh16uPmhtU2Nj0", "title": "How to Learn (Crypto)", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/179a6898-c156-40ef-94c6-f8bf6f5770e8.jpg?height=640&width=1280)\n\nOutlining my approach to quickly learning new subjects, and how you too can become a crypto expert in less than you think.\n\n---\n\nIn the past few months, I went from knowing almost nothing about crypto to minting NFTs, [launching my own token](https://miguelpiedrafita.com/token), and getting a job at a crypto startup (TBA).\n\nWhile part of this was definitely being in the right place at the right time, the rest is most likely thanks to a learning strategy I’ve developed over the years, and that helped me structure my dive into the crypto world. Here’s how I’d recommend anyone to do it.\n\n## C is for Community\n\nBefore you do anything else, join a community of people interested in the subject you’re trying to learn. It doesn’t matter if they’re experts or starting out like you (although having some people ahead of you won’t hurt either).\n\nA community will not only help in terms of sharing resources you find but can be a source of motivation to continue diving into the space as well. You’ll also get to meet and talk with really cool people, and hopefully make good friends. That’s been my case, at least.\n\nFor learning crypto, my recommendation would be the [cabbage patch group on Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/HknkPGJxBMxoVxBa). It’s small enough for people to chat casually and share what they’re working on, but big enough to have lots of really smart (and nice) people who can help you out when you get stuck.\n\n## Charting the Unknown\n\nThe main reason why learning is hard is that most of the time, you’re not exactly sure what you’re supposed to learn. Before diving deep into research, you need to understand the discrete concepts and parts that your subject has. That way, you can search for resources on those topics and understand them before looking into how they connect to form the bigger picture.\n\nFor me, this translates to skimming through a bunch of resources for keywords that are repeated over and over (more on finding resources in a second), then doing the same for those keywords until you find isolated concepts.\n\nSome examples of concepts I found during this step while learning crypto were the differences between encryption and hashing (and what those are), the blockchain, the Ethereum network, smart contracts, Ethereum tokens & NFTs.\n\n## Now comes the reading\n\nAfter you’ve identified those concepts, you need to learn more about them individually and collectively. My approach for this is to first search for high-level articles and Twitter threads. Once you’ve read through those, you will have a general idea that can be expanded by reading documentation and whitepapers.\n\nIf you get stuck, turn to your community! Asking for resources that answer specific questions (like “how do smart contracts work”) or asking for help on a specific part of an article you don’t understand makes it very easy for others to understand where you’re stuck and help you out. You can also try reaching out to the authors themselves with specific questions (by mentioning them on Twitter, for example).\n\nFor crypto, I started by reading the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) to understand the concept of blockchains, then read through the [Ethereum website](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) and [their documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/). I also found [this great overview of crypto trends and concepts for 2020](https://2020inreview.forefront.news/) and [a list of NFT-related resources curated by a16z](https://a16z.com/2021/04/02/nfts-readings-resources/).\n\n## Learn by Building\n\nOver the years, I’ve found that I learn best by getting to work and creating stuff. When diving into new subjects, I try to think of the smallest possible thing I could build (usually over a weekend) that includes one of the new concepts I’m trying to learn but also other concepts I’m already familiar with.\n\nFor example, when I was learning crypto I could have jumped straight to learning Solidity to write smart contracts, but instead started by [building a frontend for Mirror](https://m1guelpf.blog/post/building-apps-with-mirror), a project that included new concepts (fetching decentralized data from [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/)), but also using Next.js and Tailwind CSS to design an interface, something I’ve been doing for years now.\n\nDo this a few times, either adding a new concept to your existing project, or starting a new one, and you’ll be surprised at how well you can work with them.\n\n## Learn in Public\n\n“The best way to learn is to teach someone else”, goes the saying. For me, this means sharing what you’re learning publicly. Writing articles (like this one!), writing Twitter threads, or even just replying to other people’s content.\n\nThis doesn’t only contribute to making others’ journey easier, but can also help you build an audience around your subject and earn credibility in the space. Being public with what you are learning also allows others to correct you when you get something wrong, or when there are multiple opinions on a subject, adding additional context and nuance you wouldn’t get from articles.\n\nI’ve always been very public with what I’m learning, what I’m building, and new things I discover, which has helped me get a following [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/m1guelpf), as well as winning the $WRITE Race (which you need to get access to Mirror) and get a job at a crypto startup!\n\n## Keep Up!\n\nTech moves fast (and crypto moves way faster), so you need some way of keeping up with the times or you’ll miss out on all the new things people make. You could spend hours looking through Reddit and Twitter every week, but in most cases, there are people who’ll provide curated feeds and write-ups so you don’t have to.\n\n[The Defiant](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/) is a great example of this. They have a daily newsletter that includes interviews with influential people, profiles on new trends and projects in the space, and relevant news on the world of crypto and Ethereum.\n\nThere’s probably a newsletter like this waiting for you on whichever space you’re diving into (and if there’s not, start one!).\n\n## Good luck!\n\nWhile there are some assumptions backed on this learning strategy (for example, it assumes you’re learning a technical subject), I still think it’s a great method to use when approaching a new subject. Hopefully, it’ll help you dive into crypto or any other subject you’ve been waiting to learn!\n\nAnd if you are interested in crypto but don’t know where to start, I’m planning to do a livestream where I take one of my non-technical “random teenager” friends and try to explain everything Ethereum to them in a few hours. You can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/m1guelpf) if you want to learn more about that when there are more details available.\n\nGood luck! :D", "timestamp": 1619276089, "digest": "p_PQRfysu4i1RWoIoqGxAiqYXLxnahr3YzV8KPQIzR0", "contributor": "0xE340b00B6B622C136fFA5CFf130eC8edCdDCb39D"}
{"id": "EE-wCqYBrqSuybPxSQf92WmuQsEErwD7TYYXel1hgL4", "title": "Introducing Songcamp and \"The Unlock\" NFT", "body": "***UPDATE:*** **A huge thank you to [Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq) for collecting \"The Unlock\" NFT and officially *unlocking* this first Songcamp for everyone!**\n\n**TL;DR: The music industry is broken. Instead of trying to fix it, let’s just try something a whole lot different. It all starts with [this](https://zora.co/songcamp/2863) NFT.**\n\nThe current music industry models condition us to believe certain untruths: that we must amass millions upon millions of streams a month to earn a decent living, that we must be one thing and build one brand identity and not stray from that, that we must spend an exorbitant amount of time and money finding our audience by paying for data that is siloed off by opaque intermediaries — data that is rightfully ours.  \n\nAll this and more adds up to the hamster wheel performance of the music business. \n\nAnd the worst part is it cuts creativity off. It sets illusory limits upon the limitless imagination of creative folks. \n\nWe need not accrue millions of streams. We need not build one and only one version of ourselves. And we sure as hell do not need to commoditize our music and let it sit frozen on digital shelves that we don’t own. \n\n## Music + The New Internet = 💥\n\nThere are new avenues emerging that entirely circumvent these old models. They are young and nascent and not fully understood. We aren’t entirely sure how they work yet, or how most people are going to use them. \n\nBut we *do* know that they allow us to realize a truer value of digital things, which until now has been decided by a handful of centralized organizations. \n\nSo what we must do now is **experiment**. Songcamp is a place to run these experiments. \n\n## Experiment No. 1 → “The Unlock” \n\nOur first experiment is a songwriting camp that doesn’t end when the music is written, but extends out into the visual creation and release of said music. \n\nThe idea is to **collectively fund, create and distribute art**.\n\n### Here’s how it works:\n\n- 3 newly-formed groups of *music makers* are currently co-creating 3 songs from scratch\n\n- 1 team of *visual artists* is working on cover artwork for those records\n\n- and a team of *project operatives* is creating and executing a web3 distribution plan for said music \n\nThis is where you come in…\n\n## We are auctioning off a 1/1 NFT that *unlocks* this songcamp.\n\nPurchasing this piece ***unlocks*** this first songwriting camp for all involved. The funds received will go towards a) our distribution costs (gas fees etc.) and b) the visual team that created this artwork. \n\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2863)\n\n\n\nThis is a 1/1 cassette tape sleeve (known as a J-card) representing the first batch of music created at Songcamp. Artwork is by [Peace Node](https://twitter.com/peace_node) + [Gian Ferrer](https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles).\n\n### What The Collector Gets\n\n- This incredibly dope NFT, a badge of honor that says you unlocked the first songcamp\n- Your name (+ logo) included on the final songs’ cover artworks\n- Social media love + bragging rights as the named sponsor of this camp\n- On-chain recognition as the *first* supporter of Songcamp, with retroactive benefits (tbd) as the community grows \n\n### Auction Details\n\n- The auction will close on **Tuesday April 20th at 4pm ET**. \n- We’ve decided to bake in a “***no resale***” mechanic by setting the Creator Equity to 99%. This ensures that the collector is someone who wants to hold this NFT for a lifetime. It also allows us to build an on-chain community of supporters over time — **a community we intend to grow with and bring value to**. \n\n## What’s Next?\n\nWe will be sharing more details in the coming days as to how this music will be distributed. \n\nWe're excited to go down this journey into the unknown with all of you! \n\nOh, do connect with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songcampdotband) + [Discord](https://discord.gg/wHsJD2sTpc).", "timestamp": 1619279700, "digest": "kh0Nl55x_PzNRADmIzAjzLi2RCK7SD9sMBJ2O5NqKpY", "contributor": "0xfC4852B5e3aF65058CdfE1D1dce26946c0C1975f"}
{"id": "mVMQNB41-zfseaHjb3QiP8IaVw1ImYy4R6CYqMl1d2Y", "title": "Emily Ratajkowski, Lisa del Giocondo, and our collective conceptions of legitimate ownership", "body": "In September 2020, model and actress Emily Ratajkowski published an [essay](https://www.thecut.com/article/emily-ratajkowski-owning-my-image-essay.html) in The Cut which details her experience with ownership (and more often, her lack of it) over her own image. Her stories detail how her likeness has been used, distributed, and abused, often by men with more power than she does under our legal system. \n\nIn one anecdote, she details her experience being sued by a paparazzo for posting a photograph he took of her to her own Instagram stories. The photograph itself was taken without Ratajkowski’s consent - in the photo, she can be seen hiding her face from the creeping photog. Later on in the piece, she details a number of more upsetting stories, many of which overlap with themes of sexual consent, harassment, and abuse. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/160a3ed8-2c2f-491d-aa8e-4d879545c9a3.jpeg?height=610&width=342)\n\nThis image is the subject of O’Neil v. Ratajkowski et al. Source: Robert O’Neil, republished in [The Cut](https://www.thecut.com/article/emily-ratajkowski-owning-my-image-essay.html).\n\nReading the piece back in September, I remember thinking about the dislocation between our legal definitions and ethical, intuitive understandings of ownership. I remember thinking about the complications which emerge from this misalignment, particularly for women. I remember being moved by Ratajkowski’s vulnerability in sharing these stories. \n\nI also remember thinking about NFTs. \n\nNFTs allow us to make digital images - abundant and easily copyable - unique. The past few months have seen a tidal wave of experimentation by artists and creators over this new vehicle for creation, distribution, and attribution. There has also been speculation as to what this all means for content creation, distribution, and value exchange for digital media. The opportunity is exciting, particularly for those whose livelihoods are tied to creating on the Internet.\n\nAs I read Ratajkowski’s piece back in September, I remember thinking about how the next wave of models and creators following in her footsteps might be able to steer clear of some of the more blatant abuses she endured. What if an image of one’s likeness were partially owned by the subject, and she had rights to define how the image could be used in the future? What if she were promised a piece of future profits? \n\nYet as the past few months have also shown us, NFTs are not a panacea. We are still figuring out how all of this will work -- who is allowed to profit, and under what circumstances. In early March for instance, Meltem Demirors noted that some of her Tweets were being sold by others, unauthorized.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Melt_Dem/status/1369362485359284229\n\n[BitClout](https://bitclout.com/) more recently has came under fire for issuing 15,000 “creator coins” tied to profiles with data pirated from Twitter. The proper “owners” of these profiles can claim them if they would like, and in return be granted access to a portion of their coins. BitClout has been the subject of frequent, charged [debate](https://decrypt.co/62770/inside-bitclout-dystopian-social-network-big-investors-vocal-critics) within the crypto community since its announcement. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/17a46a01-6de6-4540-98af-8d2e42968831.png?height=281&width=605)\n\nMy [profile](https://bitclout.com/u/devinawalsh) on BitClout.\n\nEven though NFTs have now officially entered the mainstream, we’re still determining the difference between what is possible and what is right. \n\nVitalik Buterin explores this idea, and legitimacy on the Internet more generally, in his recent essay [The Most Important Scarce Resource Is Legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html). He asks: \n\n> Why is it that Elon Musk can sell an NFT of Elon Musk's tweet, but Jeff Bezos would have a much harder time doing the same? Elon and Jeff have the same level of ability to screenshot Elon's tweet and stick it into an NFT dapp, so what's the difference? To anyone who has even a basic intuitive understanding of human social psychology (or the [fake art scene](https://www.austinartistsmarket.com/famous-fakes-art-history/)), the answer is obvious: Elon selling Elon's tweet is the real thing, and Jeff doing the same is not. Once again, millions of dollars of value are being controlled and allocated, not by individuals or cryptographic keys, but by social conceptions of legitimacy.\n\n\nIn other words, **we** get to decide what is legitimate and what is not.\n\nOften, like in the Musk/Bezos example, the legitimate owner of a digital work is clear. Other times, it is not. It certainly differs across cultures. I think about a friend of mine who lives in the UAE, who is extremely careful about the photographs she posts on her Instagram. In the UAE, it is illegal to publish photographs of strangers without their consent. I compare this to the paparazzo who sued Ratajkowski for posting a photograph of her that he took, without her consent, to her own Instagram. I assume courts in the UAE would interpret legitimate ownership in this case very differently. \n\nCritically, Buterin notes that the evolution of the NFT industry is “not predetermined.” We might be excited today about a future in which these assets empower artists, but that future depends upon our “active coordination and support.” \n\nFor now, interpretations of legitimacy seem to be bending towards what we would tend to classify as right. [Cent](https://v.cent.co/), the platform upon which Jack Dorsey sold his first ever Tweet, requires sellers to prove ownership of a Twitter account prior to selling the account’s Tweets. \n\nI hope that we not only continue down this path, but that the mainstream usage of NFTs shifts our broader conceptions of legitimate ownership. The new tools at our disposal might be able to evolve our collective understanding and enforcement of who is the rightful owner of a work, and how that owner might be able to benefit from and distribute it. \n\nAnd so as I finished writing this post, I was thrilled to hear that Ratajkowski [announced](https://twitter.com/emrata/status/1385710264050454529) she would be selling an NFT entitled Buying Myself Back: A Model for Redistribution. In the NFT, the model is posing in front of a work by Richard Prince. In The Cut essay, Ratajkowski details her troubling experience finding out about, tracking down, and ultimately paying for this work, a blown up photograph of herself which she had posted to her own Instagram account.\n\nRatajkowski [framed](https://twitter.com/emrata/status/1385710264050454529) her decision to create and sell this NFT as setting a symbolic precedent “that allows for women to have ongoing authority over their image and to receive rightful compensation for its usage and distribution.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/86a22ab9-0c79-4211-a697-22a856f57c7c.jpeg?height=2048&width=1366)\n\n\nSource: Emily Ratajkowski, [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/style/emily-ratajkowski-nft-christies.html).\n\nOver the past few months, as my mind has circled these topics, I’ve found myself thinking a lot about [Lisa del Giocondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_del_Giocondo). Lisa is more popularly known as the Mona Lisa; she is the woman behind the painting. Centuries before thousands of crypto-enthusiasts would use her likeness to explain the value of owning NFTs (plentiful reproduction of an image only enhances the value of owning the original), Lisa lived a relatively normal life.\n\nAt age 15, she married a Florentine merchant named Francesco. Scholars have noted that the two likely married for love, which was not a given at the time. Lisa had five children -- Francesco is reported to have commissioned the painting from da Vinci to celebrate the birth of their second child. Lisa, like many women, suffered a miscarriage. Her husband became a local politician. The family lived a comfortable, middle-class life. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/emrata/status/1385710897939816451\n\nThe Mona Lisa has, of course, gone on to become the most famous, most valuable, work of art in the world. Today the Mona Lisa is owned by the government of France, and draws millions of people per year to the Louvre. The work is in the public domain, free to be used for commercial purposes with no legal repercussions. We see Lisa everywhere, from coffee cups to music videos.\n\n\n![](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mona-lisa-eil-by-robin-harper.jpg?resize=1800,1200&w=1200)\n\n\n\nSource: Robin Harper, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/louvre-beyonce-jay-z-apeshit-video-696636/).\n\nIf Lisa were alive today, I wonder what she would think about all this. I wonder whether she would feel like Ratajkowski, frustrated by a lack of control over how her image is used. I wonder whether her descendants have seen any financial benefit from the commercial use of their matriarch’s likeness. I wonder if she too would mint her own NFT.\n\nThis essay is also published on [Substack](https://devinwalsh.substack.com/p/emily-ratajkowski-lisa-del-giocondo).
